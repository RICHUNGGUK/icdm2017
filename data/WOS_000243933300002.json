We establish a chart of the dynamical modes in the input voltage versus load resistance parameter plane. This chart displays several different torus bifurcations along with their associated resonance tongues where periodic dynamics is observed. We show how a quintruple-turn torus is transformed into a single-turn torus in a homoclinic bifurcation and examine different mechanisms of torus destruction (via horseshoe formation and through period doubling). Particular emphasis is paid to following the changes of the stable and unstable manifolds in detail.
