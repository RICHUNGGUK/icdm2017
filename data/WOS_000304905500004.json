Those methods have been studied under different names, like collaborative and parallel fuzzy clustering. In this study, we offer some augmentation of the two FCM-based clustering algorithms used to cluster distributed data by arriving at some constructive ways of determining essential parameters of the algorithms (including the number of clusters) and forming a set of systematically structured guidelines such as a selection of the specific algorithm depending on the nature of the data environment and the assumptions being made about the number of clusters. A thorough complexity analysis, including space, time, and communication aspects, is reported. A series of detailed numeric experiments is used to illustrate the main ideas discussed in the study.", "paper_title": "Collaborative Fuzzy Clustering Algorithms: Some Refinements and Design Guidelines", "paper_id": "WOS:000304905500004"}
