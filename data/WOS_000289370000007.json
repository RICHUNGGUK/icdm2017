This method is built on a sharp interface concept and developed on an Eulerian Cartesian fixed-grid with a cut-cell scheme and marker points to track the moving interface. The unsteady, axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations in both liquid and gas phases are solved separately. The mass continuity and momentum flux conditions are explicitly matched at the true surface phase boundary to determine the interface shape and movement. A quadratic curve fitting algorithm with marker points is used to yield smooth and accurate information of the interface curvatures. It is uniquely demonstrated for the first time with the current method that conservation of mass is strictly enforced for continuous infusion of flow into the domain of computation. The method has been used to compute the velocity and pressure fields and the deformation of the liquid core. It is also shown that the current method is capable of producing accurate results for a wide range of Reynolds number, Re, Weber number, We, and large property jumps at the interface.
