The numerical framework is based on the CLSVOF (coupled level set and volume-of-fluid) method, the THINC/WLIC (tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing/weighted line interface calculation) scheme, multi-moment methods (CIP-CSL and VSIAM3) and density-scaled CSF (continuum surface force) model within a balanced force formulation. In this paper, we propose a level set based algorithm of the density-scaled balanced CSF model and show that the density-scaled balanced CSF model can reduce spurious currents more than the standard balanced CSF model without using the density-scaling when the exact curvature is not given. We also show that the numerical framework can well capture the physics of droplet splashing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
