In the conventional SPH method, equations of state (EOS) are employed to relate the pressure to the particle density. To enforce the volume conservation, high speeds of sound are usually required, which leads to very small time steps and noisy pressure distribution. The problem remains one of the main reasons of numerical instability in SPH. In the paper, a new extra pressure correction scheme is proposed to transport the local pressure disturbance to the neighboring area and no solution of the Poisson equation is required. As a result, smoother pressure distribution and more efficient simulation are achieved. The proposed method has been used to simulate free surface problems. The results demonstrate the validation of the present SPH method. Surface tension and fluid fragmentation can be Well handled.
