The first algebra simplifies a two-sorted infinitary axiomatisation by Wagner. Its completeness is established relatively to Wagner's completeness result. The second one is based on one-sorted algebras proposed by Park and Cohen. Its completeness is derived from our first result. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
