We formulate the anomaly detection problem as a binary composite hypothesis testing problem and develop a model-free and a model-based method, leveraging techniques from the theory of large deviations. Both methods first extract a family of probability laws (PLs) that represent normal traffic patterns during different time-periods, and then detect anomalies by assessing deviations of traffic from these laws. We establish the asymptotic Newman-Pearson optimality of both methods and develop an optimization-based approach for selecting the family of PLs from past traffic data. We validate our methods on networks with two representative time-varying traffic patterns and one common anomaly related to data exfiltration. Simulation results show that our methods perform better than their vanilla counterparts, which assume that normal traffic is stationary.", "paper_title": "Statistical Traffic Anomaly Detection in Time-Varying Communication Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000365085700001"}
