This type of camera uses a built-in Web server resulting in variable response times when sending control commands. Furthermore, communicating with a Web server involves network delays. Thus, because the camera is inside a control loop, the effective frame rate that can be processed by a computer vision method is irregular and in general low (2-6 fps). Our tracking method has been specifically designed to perform in such conditions. It detects, at every frame, candidate blobs using motion detection, region sampling, and region color appearance. The target is detected among candidate blobs using a fuzzy classifier. Then, a movement command is sent to the camera using the target position and speed. The proposed method can cope with low frame rate, and thus with large motion of the target, even in the case of a fast walk. Results show that our system has a good target detection precision (> 88%) and low track fragmentation, and the target is almost always localized within 1/6th of the image diagonal from the image center.", "paper_title": "People tracking using a network-based PTZ camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000291703700006"}
