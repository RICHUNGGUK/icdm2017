The current study conducts in-depth interviews and explores psychological factors that may be significantly related to the usability of car navigation systems. Data collected from 1,181 drivers via an online survey are statistically analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results indicate that the proposed research model accurately predicts driver acceptance of car navigation systems. The model identifies perceived processing speed and locational accuracy of car navigation systems as key psychological constructs, and reveals that satisfaction plays a moderate role. Theoretical implications and practical implications for improving car navigation systems are discussed.", "paper_title": "Driver acceptance of car navigation systems: integration of locational accuracy, processing speed, and service and display quality with technology acceptance model", "paper_id": "WOS:000331801500003"}
