New multimedia services demand data-rates of up to hundreds of Mbps and thus higher frequency bands are being explored to support these new high data rate services. However, to support mobility, handoff is a must in many of these networks and systems. In the mean time the 60 GHz band has received much attention due to its 5GHz of the available spectrum globally. However, the 60 GHz channels face many challenges such as high attenuation and NLOS propagation. The high reduction in signal strength as a function of distance results in a small coverage area, thereby causing frequent handoffs for mobile terminals. In this paper, we discuss and compare handoff algorithms intended for WLAN, GSM, UMTS, etc. We study these algorithms from the point of view of their usability in 60 GHz networks and make recommendations for handoff algorithms in such networks.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Handoffs - Lessons for 60 GHz Based Wireless Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300515000005"}
