The framework is based on a projection onto convex sets (POCS) algorithm including a novel constraint. In the proposed method, a nonlinear eigenspace of each cluster obtained by classification of known textures within the target image is applied to the constraint. The main advantage of this approach is that the eigenspace can approximate the textures classified into the same cluster in the least-squares sense. Furthermore, by monitoring the errors converged by the POCS algorithm, a selection of the optimal cluster to reconstruct the target texture including missing intensities can be achieved. This POCS-based approach provides a solution to the problem in traditional methods of not being able to perform the selection of the optimal cluster due to the missing intensities within the target texture. Consequently, all of the missing textures are successfully reconstructed by the selected cluster's eigenspaces which correctly approximate the same kinds of textures. Experimental results show subjective and quantitative improvement of the proposed reconstruction technique over previously reported reconstruction techniques.", "paper_title": "POCS-Based texture reconstruction method using clustering scheme by kernel PCA", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934200004"}
