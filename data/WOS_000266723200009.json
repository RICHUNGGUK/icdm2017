In this paper, we present a new model called neuronal cluster which includes spatial as well as temporal weights in its unified adaptation scheme. The \"in-place\" nature of the model is based on two biologically plausible learning rules, Hebbian rule and lateral inhibition. We present the mathematical demonstration that the temporal weights are derived from the delay in lateral inhibition. By training with the natural videos, this model can develop spatio-temporal features such as orientation selective cells, motion sensitive cells, and spatio-temporal complex cells. The unified nature of the adaption scheme allows us to construct a multilayered and task-independent attention selection network which uses the same learning rule for edge, motion, and color detection, and we can use this network to engage in attention selection in both static and dynamic scenes.", "paper_title": "Spatio-Temporal Adaptation in the Unsupervised Development of Networked Visual Neurons", "paper_id": "WOS:000266723200009"}
