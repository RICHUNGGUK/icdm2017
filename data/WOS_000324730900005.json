Quantities of interest include the mean cumulative number of events and the mean cumulative cost of the events. The mean cumulative function (MCF) can be estimated using non-parametric (NP) methods or by fitting parametric models, and many procedures have been suggested to construct the confidence intervals (CIs) for the MCF. This paper summarizes the results of a large simulation study that was designed to compare five CI procedures for both NP and parametric estimation. When performing parametric estimation, we assume the power law non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) model. Our results include the evaluation of these procedures when they are used for window-observation recurrence data where recurrence histories of some systems are available only in observation windows with gaps in between.", "paper_title": "A simulation study on the confidence interval procedures of some mean cumulative function estimators", "paper_id": "WOS:000324730900005"}
