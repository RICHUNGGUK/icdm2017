Muramatsu et al. have previously proposed a lattice structure of 2D nonseparable LPPUFBs which have efficient frequency response. However, the proposed structure requires less number of design parameters and computational costs than the conventional one. Through some design examples and simulation results, we show that both filter banks have comparable frequency response and coding gain.", "paper_title": "A Simplified Lattice Structure of Two Dimensional Generalized Lapped Orthogonal Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600028"}
