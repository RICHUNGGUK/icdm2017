We prove correctness and error bounds for the four different rounding modes, and formalize a subset of the IEEE 754 [1] standard by gluing together a set of fixed-point and floating-point numbers to represent the subnormals and normals. In our floating-point proofs, we treat phases of floating-point numbers as copies of fixed-point numbers of varying precision so that we can reuse fixed-point rounding theorems.", "paper_title": "A Parameterized Floating-Point Formalizaton in HOL Light", "paper_id": "WOS:000365196900010"}
