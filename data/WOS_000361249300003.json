The methodology, involving the adaptive partition of the domain into uniformly discretised regions, is extended to systems of equations without increase in algorithmic complexity. By application first to the simpler case of the Euler equations of gas dynamics, the technique is shown to handle shocks without loss of accuracy and to result in significant CPU runtime reductions of over 90%. Application to more complex two-phase flow problems, including the flashing flow during the decompression of a pipeline, also show dramatic increase in computational performance.
