The segmentation of the images is realized via the FGFCM (Fast Generalized Fuzzy C-Means) clustering algorithm, which is robust to noise and outliers. The optimal number of clusters is determined via the PCAES (Partition Coefficient And Exponential Separation) validity index. We use a similarity measure defined via Lukasiewicz t-norm for comparison between the original image and the reconstructed images. The best results are obtained if this similarity measure overcomes a threshold value, experimentally determined from the analysis of the trend of it with respect to the PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio).
