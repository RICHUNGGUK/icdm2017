Specifically, these different influences of trust on customer loyalty is tested with the mediating construct of intention to use the website using a large number of risk taker samples (n = 149) and risk avoider samples (n = 176). In the risk taker samples, the influence of online trust through website ability on customer loyalty is fully mediated by the intention to use the website. However, in the risk avoider samples, online trust beliefs such as ability and integrity as well as intention to use website have direct influences on customer loyalty. There is no relationship of benevolence in this model in both samples. The model explains 43% and 48% of R squares for each sample group. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.", "paper_title": "Understanding the Different Influences of Online Trust on Loyalty by Risk Takers and Avoiders", "paper_id": "WOS:000343217800004"}
