The Med-reminder application is used to remind people to take their medicines correctly and on time or to call a relative or a medical person in an emergency situation. Since the graphical user interface was adapted for the elderly, Med-reminder is easy to use without previous training. For evaluating the graphical user interface, navigation and the general usability of the application, and hence the identification of key aspects that increase the adoption rate of assisted living applications among the target population, a methodology for a user evaluation study was designed and conducted. User evaluation study results are presented in the paper.", "paper_title": "Assisted living solutions for the elderly through interactive TV", "paper_id": "WOS:000320317200007"}
