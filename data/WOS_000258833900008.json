It provides automatic calculation of a fuzzy corresponding map and color similarity for lower luminance conditions, which detects little chromatic regions in CCD camera images under lower illumination and presents regions with a possibility of occlusion situation. Experimental detection results for two dynamic images from real surveillance cameras in a downtown area in Japan under low luminance conditions show that the proposed algorithm has 15% improved accuracy compared with the independent detection algorithm in the same false alarm rate, which occlusion regions are correctly presented. Moreover, implementability for severe surveillance situation is discussed. The proposed algorithm is being considered for use in a low cost surveillance system at a relatively poor security downtown (shopping mall) area in Japan. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
