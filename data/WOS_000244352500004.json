The so-called heuristic technique uses the convergence behaviour of the iterative scheme to estimate the next time step whereas the adaptive technique regulates the time step on the basis of an approximation of the local time truncation error. The sample problems used to assess these various schemes are characterized by nonuniform (in time) boundary conditions, sharp gradients in the infiltration fronts, and discontinuous derivatives in the soil hydraulic properties. It is found that higher order initial solution estimates improve the convergence of the iterative scheme for both the heuristic and adaptive techniques, with greater overall performance gains for the heuristic scheme, as could be expected. It is also found that the heuristic technique outperforrns the adaptive method under strongly nonlinear conditions. Previously reported observations suggesting that adaptive techniques perform best when accuracy requirements on the numerical solution are very stringent are confirmed. Overall both heuristic and adaptive techniques have their limitations, and a more general or mixed time stepping strategy combining truncation error and convergence criteria is recommended for complex problems.
