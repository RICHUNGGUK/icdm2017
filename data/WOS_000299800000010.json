To effect online recognition, we propose a methodology that employs a Bayesian filter supported by hidden Markov models. We also introduce a novel re-adjustment framework of behavior recognition and classification by incorporating the user's feedback into the learning process through two proposed schemes: a plain non-linear one and a more sophisticated recursive one. The proposed approach aims at dynamically correcting erroneous classification results to enhance the behavior modeling and therefore the overall classification rates. The performance is thoroughly evaluated under real-life complex visual behavior understanding scenarios in an industrial plant. The obtained results are compared and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
