The approximate capacity region is then used to find the degrees of freedom region. For the special case of symmetric interference channels, we also find the amount of receiver cooperation in terms of the backhaul capacity beyond, which the degrees of freedom do not improve. Further, the generalized degrees of freedom is found for MIMO interference channels with equal number of antennas at all nodes. It is shown that the generalized degrees of freedom improves gradually from a W curve to a V curve with increase in cooperation in terms of the backhaul capacity.", "paper_title": "On the Capacity and Degrees of Freedom Regions of Two-User MIMO Interference Channels With Limited Receiver Cooperation", "paper_id": "WOS:000341982200033"}
