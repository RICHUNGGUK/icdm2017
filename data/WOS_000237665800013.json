Accordingly, after contextualizing the project and outlining the current lexical database structure and statistics, it describes the WordNet.Br editing GUI that was designed to aid the linguist in carrying out the tasks of building synsets, selecting sample sentences from corpora, writing synset concept glosses, and encoding both language-independent conceptual-semantic relations and cross-lingual conceptual-semantic relations between WordNet.Br and Princeton WordNet.", "paper_title": "Methods and tools for encoding the WordNet.Br sentences, concept glosses, and conceptual-semantic relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800013"}
