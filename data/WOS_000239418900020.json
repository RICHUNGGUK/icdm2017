Since in real life humans move permanently between communities, we aim in our position paper at building an inter-operable community infrastructure based on the mobile JXME open source peer-to-peer system which focuses on seamless switching between different community types. On top of the JXME based file sharing service we currently implement a situation aware search layer to compensate the limited interaction possibilities of small screens. We show that raw context data can be gathered directly from the smart phone. To avoid cumbersome retrieval times we apply sociological and personal behaviour models to predict information requests.", "paper_title": "Scenarios for mobile community support", "paper_id": "WOS:000239418900020"}
