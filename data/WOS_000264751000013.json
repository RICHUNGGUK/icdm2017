Current statistical methods for this approach are based on parametric models that might not be appropriate for all experiments. To provide a nonparametric method for analyzing data obtained in selective transcriptional profiling studies, an empirical-likelihood-based inference is derived for multi-sample comparisons when information is available on surrogate variables. The results show that when testing for the association between the transcriptional abundance of a given gene and a known QTL, using relatively inexpensive trait data on extra individuals significantly improves the power for the proposed test.
