A fundamental quality metric of a space-filling curve is its \"clustering number\" with respect to a class of queries, which is the average number of contiguous segments on the space-filling curve that a query region can be partitioned into. We present a characterization of the clustering number of a general class of space-filling curves, as well as the first nontrivial lower bounds on the clustering number for any space-filling curve. Our results answer questions that have been open for more than 15 years.", "paper_title": "Optimality of Clustering Properties of Space-Filling Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000336443800001"}
