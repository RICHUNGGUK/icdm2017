The method is based on piecewise linearization of all nonlinearities, and on decomposition of the full scale problem into smaller subproblems. Column generation in a Branch & Price framework is used to solve the decomposed problem. The method differs from most Branch & Price methods by branching only on continuous quantities and by solving the subproblems using commercial MILP software. The method is applied to a realistic model of an oil field, the Troll oil and gas field at the Norwegian Continental Shelf, a petroleum asset with severe production optimization challenges due to rate dependent gas-coning wells. This study shows that the method is capable of solving instances of practical size to proven optimality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
