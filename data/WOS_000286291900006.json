In this paper we focus on \"database as a service\" concept and propose a methodology that securely and efficiently queries encrypted XML documents using parallel processing. The content of the database is not revealed to the service provider and immunity against attacks is also provided. The query execution is performed at the service provider side that uses several computation nodes. Proposed methodology is tested and the performance results are presented.", "paper_title": "PARALLEL PROCESSING OF ENCRYPTED XML DOCUMENTS IN DATABASE AS A SERVICE CONCEPT", "paper_id": "WOS:000286291900006"}
