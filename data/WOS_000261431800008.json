We also characterize the set of least periods of factors of a Sturmian word. In particular, the corresponding set for the Fibonacci word is the set of Fibonacci numbers. As a by-product of our results, we give several new proofs and tightenings of well-known properties of Sturmian words.", "paper_title": "LEAST PERIODS OF FACTORS OF INFINITE WORDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261431800008"}
