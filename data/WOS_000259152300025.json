Once the correspondence between a source and a target 2D shape is established, the linear vertex interpolation is usually used for generating in-between shapes. However, this naive scheme usually generates unnatural interpolated results. In this paper, we present a fast and easy-to-implement 2D shape interpolation scheme to generate visually pleasing morphs between 2D polygons. Each triangle in a compatible triangulation is represented by a stick structure. The intermediate shape of a triangle is interpolated using this stick structure. All of these intermediate triangles are then assembled together according to a predetermined order. Several examples of aesthetically pleasing morphs are demonstrated using the proposed method. All of these morph sequences can be generated in real time.", "paper_title": "Smooth shape interpolation for 2D polygons", "paper_id": "WOS:000259152300025"}
