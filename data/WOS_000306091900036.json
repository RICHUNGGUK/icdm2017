An alternating direction method of multipliers in conjunction with the fast discrete cosine transform is used to solve the TV-regularized optimization problem. The new algorithm is tested on both synthetic and real data, and is demonstrated to be effective and robust in treating images with noise and missing data (incomplete data). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
