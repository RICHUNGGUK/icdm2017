A more practical model of sensor failures than outage is considered. A given upper bound of the filtering performance in the sensor failures case is guaranteed and the performance in the nominal case is optimized. A new formulation in terms of LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) is adopted without introducing additional conservativeness. An example is given to illustrate the proposed design procedures. Furthermore, the nominal robust H-infinity filter and the reliable robust H-infinity filter are compared to show the necessity of reliable design.", "paper_title": "LMI-based reliable H-infinity filtering with sensor failure", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255500004"}
