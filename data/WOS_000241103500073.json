Besides noise or other people's conversation, even the user's utterance can cause difficulties when he is talking to someone else or to himself (\"Off-Talk\"). In this paper the automatic classification of the user's focus of attention is investigated. In the German SmartWeb project, a mobile device is used to get access to the semantic web. In this scenario, two modalities are provided speech and video signal. This makes it possible to classify whether a spoken request is addressed to the system or not: with the camera of the mobile device, the user's gaze direction is detected; in the speech signal, prosodic features are analyzed. Encouraging recognition rates of up to 93% are achieved in the speech-only condition. Further improvement is expected from the fusion of the two information sources.", "paper_title": "Are you looking at me, are you talking with me: Multimodal classification of the focus of attention", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500073"}
