Then, the energy efficiency of multi-cell cellular networks with co-channel interference is investigated. Simulation results verify the proposed model and the energy-spectrum efficiency tradeoffs in cellular networks with multi-antenna and co-channel interference.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficiency Modelling and Analyzing Based on Multi-cell and Multi-antenna Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282525200007"}
