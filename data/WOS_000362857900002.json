For large websites, implementing microdata can take a lot of time. In general, it is necessary to perform two main activities, for which we lack methods and tools. The first consists in designing what we call the website schema.org, which is the fragment of schema.org that is relevant to the website. The second consists in adding the corresponding microdata tags to the web pages. In this paper, we describe an approach to the design of a website schema.org. The approach consists in using a human-computer task-oriented dialogue, whose purpose is to arrive at that design. We describe a dialogue generator that is domain independent but that can be adapted to specific domains. We propose a set of six evaluation criteria that we use to evaluate our approach and that could be used in future approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
