First, we construct a perceptual filterbank from psycho-acoustic model and incorporate it in the subspace-based enhancement approach. This filterbank is created through a five-level wavelet packet decomposition. The masking properties of the human auditory system are then derived based on the perceptual filterbank. Finally, the prior SNR and the masking threshold of each critical band are taken to decide the attenuation factor of the optimal linear estimator. Five different types of in-car noises in TAICAR database were used in our evaluation. The experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed conventional subspace and spectral subtraction methods.", "paper_title": "Critical band subspace-based speech enhancement using SNR and auditory masking aware technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840000006"}
