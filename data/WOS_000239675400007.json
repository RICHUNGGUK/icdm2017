Standards are fundamental, but often they are difficult to use, due to their lack of understandability and the occurrence of inconsistencies. An ontology is useful for clarifying the elements of a standard, along with their interrelationships, as well as for detecting inconsistencies. In this paper we propose an ontology for the object-relational features of the new SQL:2003 standard, formalized with UML 2.0 class diagrams and OCL well-formedness rules. The ontology is instantiated with an example in which most of the new object-relational features of the SQL:2003 standard are presented. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
