Furthermore, the paper deals about advanced Computers Graphics techniques for managing complexity in representing chaotic and hyperchaotic systems. The problems we have faced deal about the nature of these configurations, their shapes and dimensions, the granularity of these objects, since the output could be made of different elements Such as Cubes. cylinders and so oil. Instead. cognitive issues related to perception of forms in 3D spaces and their recognition are still unexplored. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
