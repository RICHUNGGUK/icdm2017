In this paper, we adopted the Cross-Diamond-Hexagonal Search (CDHS) block-matching algorithm (BMA) to reduce the complexity significantly. The CDHS BMA reduced about 2/3 computation time without sacrificing the reconstruction quality comparable to the full search BMA but it has high noises, unqualified motion vectors, resulted from occlusion existing in each frame of a sequence. We farther proposed a simple and robust block-wise motion vector selection (BWMVS) strategy that can remove occlusion effectively. The stability due to BWMVS was verified by the reconstruction results using the interpolation methods (nearest, bilinear, and bicubic). The experimental results showed that by combining the CDHS BMA and BWMVS, high quality images in SR reconstruction can be obtained without complex computation.", "paper_title": "A FAST AND ROBUST MAP-BASED SUPERRESOLUTION RECONSTRUCTION METHOD USING CDHS AND BLOCK-WISE MOTION VECTOR SELECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800021"}
