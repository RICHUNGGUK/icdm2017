Two random processes with Markovian transition characteristics are introduced to model the system component. failure process and the fault detection, and isolation (FM) decision process, respectively. The random behavior of the FDI process is conditioned on the failure process state. Firstly, the exact-fuzzy-model-based case is considered, where the nonlinear AFTC'S can be exactly represented by a T-S fuzzy model. Based on a stochastic Lyapunov function, a stochastic stability condition of the fuzzy system is derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An LMI approach to the design of FDI-driven PDC controllers is also developed. Secondly, the uncertain-fuzzy-model-based case is studied, in which a T-S fuzzy model with norm-bounded uncertainties is used to describe the nonlinear A FTCS. Robust stochastic stability and stabilization conditions for the uncertain fuzzy system are provided in terms of LMIs. Finally, a simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "STOCHASTIC STABILITY ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS FOR NONLINEAR FAULT TOLERANT CONTROL SYSTEMS BASED ON THE T-S FUZZY MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000281745700011"}
