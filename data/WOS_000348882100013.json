Thus eventual consistency is proposed to provide highly available storage systems. However, current practice is mainly experience-based and lacks quantitative analysis for identifying a good tradeoff between the two. In this work, we are concerned with providing a quantitative analysis on availability for widely-used quorum systems in data center networks. First, a probabilistic model is proposed to quantify availability for typical data center networks: 2-tier basic tree, 3-tier basic tree, fat tree and folded clos, and even geo-distributed data center networks. Second, we analyze replica placements on network topologies to obtain maximal availability. Third, we build the availability-consistency table and propose a set of rules to quantitatively make tradeoff between availability and consistency. Finally, with Monte Carlo based simulations, we validate our presented quantitative results and show that our approach to make tradeoff between availability and consistency is effective.
