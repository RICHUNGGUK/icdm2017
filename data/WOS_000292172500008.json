Many of these properties are of independent interest in the theory of distance measures on quantum operations. A non-uniqueness result for the gate fidelity is proven, a consequence of which is the existence of non-depolarizing channels that produce a constant gate fidelity on pure states. Asymptotically, the gate fidelity associated with any quantum channel is shown to converge to that of a depolarizing channel. Methods for estimating the minimum of the gate fidelity are also presented.", "paper_title": "DEPOLARIZING BEHAVIOR OF QUANTUM CHANNELS IN HIGHER DIMENSIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000292172500008"}
