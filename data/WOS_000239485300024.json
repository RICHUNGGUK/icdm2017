This paper proposes a real world statistics based event-trigger bit error rate (BER) model, which can describe and handle the time-varying wireless channel error characteristics better. Moreover, a recurrent neural network is employed to decide the state transfer as a mechanism. Simulation results and comparisons demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in term of visual performance and transmission efficiency over a variety of wireless channel conditions.", "paper_title": "A neural network decision-making mechanism for robust video transmission over 3G wireless network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300024"}
