The signal to interference ratio (SIR) is shown to converge almost surely to a constant and the bit-error rate (BER) is expressed as a function of the traffic load, transmission probability, channel coefficient, and distribution of transmission power. Furthermore, the throughput, the spectrum efficiency, and the stability region are analyzed and simulated. For dominating systems, it is shown that the MMSE detector achieves much higher throughput and spectral efficiency than decorrelator detector. Besides, it is also disclosed that, when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is larger than an optimum value, the spectrum efficiency increases as the ratio of bit energy to noise power spectrum density (Eb/N0) increases; however, when SNR is smaller than the optimum value, the spectrum efficiency decreases as Eb/N0 increases. For ordinary stable systems, it is demonstrated that their stability region gets narrower as the traffic load increases.
