We find that the n-tangle is not the residual entanglement for any even n >= 4 qubits. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the vanishing of the concurrence C(1(2...n)). The condition implies that the concurrence C(1(2...n)) is always positive for any entangled states while the n-tangle vanishes for some entangled states. We argue that for even n qubits, the concurrence C(1(2...n)) is equal to or greater than the n-tangle. Further, we reveal that the residual entanglement is a partial measure for product states of any n qubits while the n-tangle is multiplicative for some product states.", "paper_title": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE N-TANGLE AND THE RESIDUAL ENTANGLEMENT OF EVEN N QUBITS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282921000011"}
