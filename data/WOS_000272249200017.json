In most cases a prophylactic vaccination prevents the tumor growth. In particular the Triplex vaccine prevented mammary carcinoma formation using a Chronic schedule, but it is not known if this schedule is minimal. A computational model named SimTriplex was able to reproduce in silico the in vivo experiments. The combination of SimTriplex and Genetic Algorithms (GA), produced a minimal vaccination schedule capable to guarantee in silico survival. This process required the use of a High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure for several days. In this paper we show another optimization procedure based on simulated annealing approach used to get a faster algorithm response.", "paper_title": "SIMULATED ANNEALING AND OPTIMAL PROTOCOLS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272249200017"}
