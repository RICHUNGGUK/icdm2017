However, it is obvious that the web service quality changes significantly under the unpredictable network environment. Such changes impose very challenging obstacles to web service QoS prediction. Most of the traditional web service QoS prediction approaches are implemented only using a set of static model parameters with the help of designer's a priori knowledge. Unlike the traditional QoS prediction approaches, our algorithm in this paper is realized by incorporating approximate dynamic programming- (ADP-) based online parameter tuning strategy into the QoS prediction approach. Through online learning and optimization, the proposed approach provides the QoS prediction with automatic parameter tuning capability, and prior knowledge or identification of the prediction model is not required. Therefore, the near-optimal performance of QoS prediction can be achieved. Experimental studies are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADP-based prediction approach.", "paper_title": "Online Optimization of Collaborative Web Service QoS Prediction Based on Approximate Dynamic Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000361198000001"}
