In essence, each subpixel is addressed individually, allowing the underlying signal to be sampled more densely. Unfortunately, naive subpixel sampling introduces colour aliasing, as each subpixel only displays a specific colour (usually R, G and B subpixels are used). As previous work has shown, chromatic aliasing can be reduced significantly by taking the sensitivity of the human visual system into account. In this work, we find optimal filters for subpixel rendering for a diverse set of 1D and 2D subpixel layout patterns. We demonstrate that these optimal filters can be approximated well with analytical functions. We incorporate our filters into GPU-based multi-sample anti-aliasing to yield subpixel rendering at a very low cost (1-2 ms filtering time at HD resolution). We also show that texture filtering can be adapted to perform efficient subpixel rendering. Finally, we analyse the findings of a user study we performed, which underpins the increased visual fidelity that can be achieved for diverse display layouts, by using our optimal filters.", "paper_title": "Low-Cost Subpixel Rendering for Diverse Displays", "paper_id": "WOS:000331694100017"}
