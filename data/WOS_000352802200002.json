The cause of such a contradiction is analyzed in detail in this work, which essentially links to the reconstruction of bed and flow information in those newly created cells during grid adaptation. An effective approach is subsequently proposed to resolve the contradiction by locally modifying the bed elevation in certain problematic cells when reconstructing flow information using linear interpolation as part of the grid adaptation procedure.
