For instance searching for a biological sequence of amino acids or DNA nucleotides in a library or database of sequences of interest to identify similarities is not something which can easily be outsourced due to the data protection and privacy laws. However, DNA sequencing is becoming a main stream technology, thus it would be desirable to be able to offer computational services without endangering the patient privacy. While data in transit can easily be protected by transport layer security, the data must be stored in the clear during processing. Most algorithms and schemes are either optimized for speed with no consideration for data protection and thus cannot be used to offer services. On the other hand the theoretical Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes that protect the privacy of patient data are so slow that they are not feasible for the real world use. Since the search spaces represented for instance by the genome or proteome of complex organisms are immense, fast privacy preserving search algorithms are needed. In the previous work we introduced the foundation for such a privacy preserving genome search engine. In this work, we improve and elaborate on this and present an extensive evaluation and comparison showing that this scheme is both secure and practical. Our approach is based on Bloom filters with a configurable security property that performs more than 2000 times faster than PIR equivalents for large datasets, making it suitable for applications in bioinformatics. The results can then be further aggregated using Homomorphic Cryptography to allow an exact-match searching. In performance tests a search of a 50-nucleotides-long sequence against human chromosomes can be securely executed in less than 0.1 s on a 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7. We offer the entire system as an open source service for the community and offer ready-to-use REST as well as SOAP Web services. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
