We examine PON architectures and dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithms. Our classifications provide meaningful and insightful presentations of the prior work on EPONs. The main branches of our classification of DBA are: grant sizing, grant scheduling, and optical network unit queue scheduling. We further examine the topics of QoS support, as well as fair bandwidth allocation. The presentation allows those interested in advancing EPON research to quickly understand what already was investigated and what requires further investigation. We summarize results where possible and explicitly point to future avenues of research.", "paper_title": "ETHERNET PASSIVE OPTICAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES AND DYNAMIC BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION ALGORITHMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971800003"}
