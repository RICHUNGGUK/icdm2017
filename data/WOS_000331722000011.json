Obviously, the computation resource can be used to improve the execution efficiency of not only graphing applications but other time consuming applications like data mining. The Clustering Affinity Search Technique is a famous clustering algorithm, which is widely used in clustering the biological data. In this paper, we will propose an algorithm that can utilize the GPU and the individual memory of graphics card to accelerate the execution. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can deliver excellent performance in terms of execution time and is scalable to very large databases.", "paper_title": "A parallel and scalable CAST-based clustering algorithm on GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000331722000011"}
