This article deals with the construction of algebraic two-level and multilevel preconditioning algorithms for the Lame equations of elasticity, which are discretized by Crouzeix-Raviart non-conforming linear finite elements on triangles. An important point to note is that in the non-conforming case the FE spaces corresponding to two successive levels of mesh refinements are not nested. To handle this, a proper aggregation-based two-level basis is considered, which enables us to fit the general framework of the two-level preconditioners and to generalize the method to the multilevel case. The derived estimate of the constant in the strengthened Cauchy-Bunyakowski-Schwarz (CBS) inequality is uniform with respect to both, mesh anisotropy and Poisson ratio, including the almost incompressible case.", "paper_title": "Aggregation-based multilevel preconditioning of non-conforming FEM elasticity problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200102"}
