Docking studies were employed to position the inhibitors into the BuChE active site to determine the most probable binding mode. The strategy was to explore multiple inhibitor conformations in producing a more reliable 3D-QSAR model. These multiple conformations were derived using the FlexS program. The conformation selection step for CoMFA was done by genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm based CoMFA approach was found to be the best. Both CoMFA and CoMSIA yielded significant cross-validated q(2) values of 0.701 and 0.627 and the r(2) values of 0.979 and 0.982, respectively. These statistically significant models were validated by a test set of five compounds. Comparison of CoMFA and CoMSIA contour maps helped to identify structural requirements for the inhibitors and serves as a basis for the design of the next generation of the inhibitor analogues. The results demonstrate that the combination of ligand-based and receptor-based modeling with use of a genetic algorithm is a powerful approach to build 3D-QSAR models. These data can be used for the lead optimization process with respect to inhibition enhancement which is important for the drug discovery and development for Alzheimer's disease.", "paper_title": "Receptor-based modeling and 3D-QSAR for a quantitative production of the butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors based on genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000256240400014"}
