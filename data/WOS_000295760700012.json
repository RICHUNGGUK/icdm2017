However, changes in iris texture appearance occur with age, disease and medication. This study of high resolution images of 238 irides, captured with a specialised biomicroscope at three and six month intervals, and classified according to texture, measured recognition failure rates resulting from the application of local and non-local feature extraction techniques. In both local and non-local comparisons, minimum failure rates of 20.3% and 13.8% were noted, respectively. The complex fibre pattern formation of the iris results in variability in identification with differing failure rates depending on texture. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
