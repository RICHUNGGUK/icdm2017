The one is concerned with elliptic curve discrete logarithm (ECDL) on curves with an endomorphism of degree 2 or 3. For such curves, we obtain a better lower bound of degrees for polynomial interpolation of ECDL. The other deals with degrees of polynomial interpolations of embeddings of a subgroup of the multiplicative group of a finite field to an elliptic curve.", "paper_title": "On degrees of polynomial interpolations related to elliptic curve cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000239426500013"}
