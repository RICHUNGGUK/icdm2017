However, these outdated products can be remanufactured and resold to market. In this paper, a closed-loop supply chain inventory system with multi-manufacturing cycles and multi-remanufacturing cycles is analyzed using sequential and global optimization. In the case of sequential optimization, the decision is made initially by the down-stream player, then by the up-stream player. In the case of global optimization, the decision is made jointly by all the players. The supply chain includes a manufacturer, a retailer, a collector and a material supplier. This paper considers out of date as a type of deterioration and generalizes the following three cases: (i) single manufacturing cycle and single remanufacturing cycle, (ii) single manufacturing cycle and multi-remanufacturing cycles, and (iii) multi-manufacturing cycles and single remanufacturing cycle. The analytical results of this study show that a significant increase in the joint profit will result when the integrated policy is adopted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
