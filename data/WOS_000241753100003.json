In experiments using SVM-based classifiers, when the imbalance is extreme, novelty detectors are more accurate than balanced and unbalanced binary classifiers. However, with a relatively moderate imbalance, balanced binary classifiers should be employed. In addition, novelty detectors are more effective when the classes have a non-symmetrical class relationship.", "paper_title": "The novelty detection approach for different degrees of class imbalance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100003"}
