Many researchers have studied the non-linear dynamic behavior of CSTR for several reaction schemes from a theoretical stand point. The present experimental studies are carried out to identify the existence of input multiplicity in a non-isothermal CSTR. The sulfuric acid catalyzed hydrolysis of acetic anhydride reaction system has been chosen and the regions of existence of input multiplicity are theoretically identified. The reactor showed the same steady state temperature for two input flow rates of reaction mixtures into the CSTR reactor and thus confirming the existence of input multiplicity for the sulfuric acid catalyzed hydrolysis of acetic anhydride reaction system. It was observed that the time taken by the reactor was too long at a low feed flow rate of reaction mixture than at a higher feed flow rate reaction mixture. The model simulations of steady state temperatures were in close agreement with experimental data for the above feed flow rates of reaction mixture conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
