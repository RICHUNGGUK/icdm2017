To simulate excavation in elastoplastic soils, we employ a Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion using an initial strain method. We parallelize the software based on non-overlapping domain decomposition using MPI. We verify the uniqueness principle for multistage excavation in linear elastic materials. We validate our serial and parallel programs, and illustrate several examples of multistage excavation in elastoplastic materials. Finally, we apply our software to a model of the Pyhasalmi ore mine in Finland. Strong-scaling performance tests involving multistage excavation show that the parallel program performs reasonably well for large-scale problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
