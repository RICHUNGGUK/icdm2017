Our framework was evaluated with clear speech and speech with white, pink, bubble, car and machine gun additive noise. Our framework's results were very promising since an accuracy of 76.1% was achieved for the case of clear speech (for distances less than 25 msec to the actual segmentation point), without presenting over-segmentation on the speech signal. An average reduction of 4% in the total accuracy of our segmentation framework was observed in the case of wideband distortion additive noise environment.", "paper_title": "Detecting broad phonemic class boundaries from Greek speech in noise environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500060"}
