Nevertheless, many of these past applications utilized the benefit of the system but rarely proposed approaches to enhance the overall efficiency. In this paper, we continue what was discussed in the previous research, to develop a self-evolving artificial immune system II by coordinating the T and B cell in the immune system to build a block-based artificial chromosome to shorten the computation time and to improve the performance for problems of different complexities. Through designing Plasma cell and clonal selection, which are relevant to the functioning of the Immune Response, the Immune Response will help the AIS in realizing the global and local searching ability and prevent it from being trapped in local optima. The significant performance shown in the experimental result validates that SEAIS II is effective in solving the permutation flows-hop problems.", "paper_title": "A self-evolving artificial immune system II with T-cell and B-cell for permutation flow-shop problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000344482300005"}
