A fuzzy collaborative sensor network is developed in this study to predict the cycle time of a job in a semiconductor manufacturing factory, which is an important task for the factory. In the fuzzy collaborative sensor network, each sensor detects the status of a particular job as well as various environmental conditions present in the factory and uses a fuzzy neural network to analyze the received information. Each sensor communicates its settings and forecasting results to other sensors with the aid of a central control unit. According to the experimental results, the aggregate forecasting performance was considerably improved through the sensors' collaboration.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Collaborative Sensor Network for Semiconductor Manufacturing Cycle Time Forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000317507700001"}
