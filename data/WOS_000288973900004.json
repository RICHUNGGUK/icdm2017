We argue that second-order Markov logic is ideally suited for this purpose and propose an approach based on it. Our algorithm discovers structural regularities in the source domain in the form of Markov logic formulas with predicate variables and instantiates these formulas with predicates from the target domain. Our approach has success folly transferred learned knowledge among molecular biology, web, and social network domains.", "paper_title": "Deep Transfer: A Markov Logic Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000288973900004"}
