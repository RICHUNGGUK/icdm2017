Extraction of semantics from the image content for geospatial information seeking and knowledge discovery has been thus becoming a critical process. Unfortunately, the available geographic images may be blurred, either too light or too dark. It is therefore often hard to extract geographic features directly from images. In this paper, we describe our developed methods in applying local scale-invariant features and bag-of-keypoints techniques to annotating images, in order to carry out image categorization and geographic knowledge discovery tasks. First, local scale-invariant features are extracted from geographic images as representative geographic features. Subsequently, the bag-of-keypoints methods are used to construct a visual vocabulary and generate feature vectors to support image categorization and annotation. The annotated images are classified by using geographic nouns. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is sensible and can effectively enhance the tasks of geographic knowledge discovery. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
