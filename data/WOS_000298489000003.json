This paper deals with an implementation of the FFT on the accelerator system, a heterogeneous multicore architecture to accelerate computation-intensive parallel computing in scientific and engineering applications. The Engineering and Scientific Computation Accelerator (ESCA) consists of a control unit and a single instruction multiple data (SIMD) processing element (PE) array, in which PEs communicate with each other via a hierarchical two-level network-on-chip (NoC) with high bandwidth and low latency. We exploit the architecture features of ESCA to implement a parallel FFT algorithm efficiently. Experimental results show that both the proposed parallel FFT algorithm and the ESCA architecture are scalable. The 16-bit fixed-point parallel FFT performance of ESCA is compared with a published work to prove the superiority of the mapping algorithm and the hardware architecture. The floating-point parallel FFT performances of ESCA are evaluated and compared with those of the IBM Cell processor and GPU to demonstrate the computing power of the ESCA system for high performance applications.", "paper_title": "Implementation and evaluation of parallel FFT on Engineering and Scientific Computation Accelerator (ESCA) architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000298489000003"}
