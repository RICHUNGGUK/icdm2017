However, most studies of these data have relied on existing genome annotations and thus are limited to the analysis of known transcripts. Results: In this article, we propose a novel method based on a marked point process model to find differentially expressed genomic regions of arbitrary length without using genome annotations. The presented method conducts a statistical test for differential analysis in regions of various lengths at each nucleotide and searches the optimal configuration of the regions by using a Monte Carlo simulation. We applied the proposed method to both synthetic and real genomic data, and their results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Finding differentially expressed regions of arbitrary length in quantitative genomic data based on marked point process model", "paper_id": "WOS:000308532300048"}
