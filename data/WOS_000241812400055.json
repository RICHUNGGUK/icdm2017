This fact is perhaps even more important in the development of learning software: the process of creating learning materials must take into account the range of abilities, needs, and interests of different stakeholders, adapting itself to a variety of contexts and pedagogical paradigms. It is therefore a complex process that must consider diverse perspectives and levels of abstraction. Currently, there are two trends among others in Software Engineering engaged in optimizing the process of information systems development: Aspect-Oriented Software Development and Model-Driven Architecture. The combination of both mechanisms can facilitate the development of complex information systems like computer-supported learning systems. The intention of this paper is to propose an analysis method in learning material development process based on Aspect-Oriented Analysis and Model-Driven Architecture.", "paper_title": "Towards an effective instructional engineering analysis method", "paper_id": "WOS:000241812400055"}
