In this paper, we present EBOARST, an efficient four-step algorithm to construct a rectilinear obstacle-avoiding Steiner tree for a given set of pins and a given set of rectilinear obstacles. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we propose a novel algorithm, which generates sparse obstacle-avoiding spanning graphs efficiently. Second, we present a fast algorithm for the minimum terminal spanning tree construction step, which dominates the running time of several existing approaches. Third, we present an edge-based heuristic, which enables us to perform both local and global refinements, leading to Steiner trees with small lengths. Finally, we discuss a refinement technique called segment translation to further enhance the quality of the trees. The time complexity of our algorithm is O(n log n). Experimental results on various benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves 16.56 times speedup on average, while the average length of the resulting obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner trees is only 0.46% larger than the best existing solution.", "paper_title": "EBOARST: An Efficient Edge-Based Obstacle-Avoiding Rectilinear Steiner Tree Construction Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000261310800007"}
