Nano-Qplus is a sensor network platform developed by ETRI. Programs of nodes such as sensors, routers, sinks and actuators in a sensor network are automatically generated through the technique. Developers can implement USN applications from models of sensor networks. The execution code is generated by setting attribute values of each node according to the model through the script proposed in this paper. Through the technique of this paper, developers can easily implement USN applications even if they do not know the details of low-level information. The development effort of USN applications also will be decreased because execution codes are automatically generated. Furthermore, developers can perform early test through rapid code generation, so the verified code is generated by correcting errors in the early development stage.", "paper_title": "A technique for code generation of USN applications based on Nano-Qplus", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500120"}
