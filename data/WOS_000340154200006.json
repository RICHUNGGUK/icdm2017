The information needed to resolve architectural design problems is often not readily available during the early conceptual stages, requiring proposals to be evaluated only after an initial solution is reached. This \"solution-driven\" design approach focuses on the generation of designs as a means to explore the solution space. Generative design can be achieved computationally through parametric and algorithmic processes. However, utilizing a large repertoire of organiational patterns and design precedent knowledge together with the precise criteria of spatial evaluation can present design challenges even to an experienced architect. In the implementation of a parametric design process lies an opportunity to supplement the designer's knowledge with computational decision support that provides real-time spatial feedback during conceptual design. This paper presents an approach based on a generative multiperformance framework, configured for generating and optimizing architectural designs based on a precedent design. The system is constructed using a parametric modeling environment enabling the capture of precedent designs, extraction of spatial analytics, and demonstration of how populations can be used to drive the generation and optimization of alternate spatial solutions. A pilot study implementing the complete workflow of the system is used to illustrate the benefits of coupling parametric modeling with structured precedent analysis and design generation.", "paper_title": "Generative spatial performance design system", "paper_id": "WOS:000340154200006"}
