Component self-adaptation and self-configuration properties are thus becoming mandatory requirements in order to cope with application complexity. An increasing number of systems, such as video content distribution, make use of distributed feed-back mechanisms to build-up intelligent, robust anti self-managing services. Technology wise, with the wide-spread usage of wireless communication interfaces on today's mobile devices, communication failures are an ever increasing nuisance in the design of distributed self-adaptive services and applications. Communication protocols designed for wired networks are not suited for this new class of networks (including mobile ad-hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, vehicular ad-hoc networks, etc.) due to the several orders of magnitude higher amount of communication failures. Although virtually every single existing communication protocol tries to deal with the various effects introduced by communication failures, almost all existing state of the art relies on previous knowledge about the amount of errors occurring at run time (information usually collected from previous deployments). A survey of current literature easily shows that, in contrast, applications that make use of distributed feedback mechanisms via online estimation of communication errors has received relatively small attention. In this paper we introduce a new distributed feedback mechanism, named LossEstimate, for runtime quantification of the global amount of communication failures present in a large-scale network. The new algorithm helps building self-adaptive services and has the advantage of being fully distributed - each node computes an estimate of the amount of errors using a gossip-alike approach. The algorithm is adaptive in the sense that it can follow changes in the mean value of the amount of communication failures over time. We focus our analysis on the impact of various network topologies, discussing the case of fully connected networks (relevant for the case of peer-to-peer networks), static multihop topologies (mapping on the case of wireless sensor networks) and mobile multihop networks (mapping on the case of mobile ad-hoc networks and vehicular ad-hoc networks). The results show that the algorithm performs well in all three scenarios, without requiring specific adaptations. Besides the lack of an alternative protocol, the gossip-alike characteristics make LossEstimate an attractive choice for building a distributed feedback mechanism via the online quantification of the amount of communication failures in large-scale networks, due to the fact that it exhibits a small communication overhead and has a small convergence time. It stands as an important building-block for engineering self-adaptive distributed applications and services, such as video streaming, by means of distributed feedback mechanisms.
