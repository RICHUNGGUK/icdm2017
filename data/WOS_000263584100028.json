Ontology-based method for knowledge representation offers a means for the reuse and sharing of knowledge unambiguously. In this paper, we present a way of representing product configuration knowledge using semantic web technology, namely OWL and SWRL, and developing actual configuration engines based on derived configuration knowledge. Firstly, a general configuration ontology model defining vocabularies, terminologies and relationships that are common to the product configuration domain is constructed to act as a general semantic foundation for product configuration. With this general model, domain specific configuration models can be derived by inheriting or subclassing the ontologies within this general model. Both general ontology-based model and domain specific configuration model are formalized using OWL, an ontology language for encoding knowledge over the Web. Furthermore, constraint knowledge, such as require constraints and resource constraints, is represented with SWRL, a rule language based on OWL Finally, actual configuration system is implemented using JESS by mapping OWL-based configuration knowledge and SWRL-based constraints into Jess facts and Jess, respectively. The presented ontology-based method for representing configuration knowledge enables the reuse of product configuration knowledge and thus facilitates the processes of modeling product configuration knowledge. In addition, the implementation of actual configuration system with existing rule engine, namely JESS, makes it possible the rapid development of product configuration systems. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
