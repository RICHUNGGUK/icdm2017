In this work we introduce a calibration update procedure, which allows a robotic head to simultaneously fixate, track, and reconstruct a moving object in real-time. The update method is based on a mapping from motor-based to image-based estimates of the camera orientations, estimated in an offline stage. Following this, a fast online procedure is presented to update the calibration of an active binocular camera pair. The proposed approach is ideal for active vision applications because no image-processing is needed at runtime for the scope of calibrating the system or for maintaining the calibration parameters during camera vergence. We show that this homography-based technique allows an active binocular robot to fixate and track an object, whilst performing 3D reconstruction concurrently in real-time.", "paper_title": "Real-time visuomotor update of an active binocular head", "paper_id": "WOS:000314021200003"}
