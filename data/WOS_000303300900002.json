Maintenance policy selection is a multiple criteria decision making problem. Criteria considered here are 'risk of equipment failure' and the 'cost of maintenance'. The maintenance policies considered are Corrective Maintenance (CM), Time Based Maintenance (TBM), Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Shutdown Maintenance (SM). For modeling, fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) has been employed. Chang's extended analysis has been applied to deal with the fuzzy variables and the preferred maintenance policy alternative is found out using FANP analysis. The methodology was applied to a unit of a chemical plant and the suitable maintenance policy was found out for each of the 13 equipment of the unit. The results were compared to the earlier study using Analytic Hierarchal Process and Goal Programming (Arunraj and Maiti, 2010) vis-a-vis the existing practices. The results show that CBM is preferred when the risk possessed by an equipment is very high while CM is preferred in those cases where risk is low and cost is the main consideration. But in cases where both cost and risk are somewhat equally important, TBM is the preferred option. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
