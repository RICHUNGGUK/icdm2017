It is founded on two concepts: situatedness and constructive memory. These have the capacity to explain a range of design behaviors but have proven to be difficult to fully comprehend. This paper presents analogies with developments in physics that aim to assist in the comprehension of these foundational ideas. The ideas are drawn from the developments in the notions of space and observations in physics since, to a degree, they parallel the developments in constructive memory and situatedness.", "paper_title": "Understanding situated design computing and constructive memory: Newton, Mach, Einstein and quantum mechanics", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630500027"}
