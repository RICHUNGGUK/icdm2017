Demosaicing or color filter array (CFA) interpolation is the process of estimating the missing color samples to reconstruct a full color image. In this paper, we propose a demosaicing method that uses multiscale color gradients to adaptively combine color difference estimates from different directions. The proposed solution does not require any thresholds since it does not make any hard decisions, and it is noniterative. Although most suitable for the Bayer CFA pattern, the method can be extended to other mosaic patterns. To demonstrate this, we describe its application to the Lukac CFA pattern. Experimental results show that it outperforms other available demosaicing methods by a clear margin in terms of CPSNR and S-CIELAB measures for both mosaic patterns.", "paper_title": "Multiscale Gradients-Based Color Filter Array Interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000312892000013"}
