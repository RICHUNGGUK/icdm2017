By adding new linear constraints to Schrijver's semidefinite programming bound, which is obtained from block-diagonalizing the Terwilliger algebra of the Hamming cube, we obtain two new upper bounds on A(n,d) , namely A(18,8) <= 71 and A(19,8) <= 131. Twenty three new upper bounds on A(n,d,w) for n <= 28 are also obtained by a similar way.", "paper_title": "Improved Semidefinite Programming Bound on Sizes of Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000325981100025"}
