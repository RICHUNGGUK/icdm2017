Such queries are based on local filter query statistics, and require as less communication cost as possible, which makes it more difficult than the existing distributed k-NN queries. Especially, we hope to reduce candidate peers and degrade communication cost. In this paper, we propose an efficient pruning technique to minimize the number of candidate peers to be processed to answer the k-NN queries. Our approach is especially suitable for continuous k-NN queries when updating peers, including changing ranges of peers, dynamically leaving or joining peers, and updating data in a peer. In addition, simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR)-based query approaches, especially for continuous queries.", "paper_title": "Continually answering constraint k-NN queries in unstructured P2P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257809900004"}
