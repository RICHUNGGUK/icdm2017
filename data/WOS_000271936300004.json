Topological descriptors based oil molecular features have proven to be useful for describing molecular profiles. Renyi entropy is used as a variability measure to contract a feature-pair distribution composing the descriptor vector. The performance of RED descriptors was tested for the analysis of different sets of molecular distances, virtual screening, and pharmacological profiling. A free parameter of the Renyi entropy has been optimized for all the considered applications.", "paper_title": "RED: A Set of Molecular Descriptors Based on Renyi Entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000271936300004"}
