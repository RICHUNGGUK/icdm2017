In order to improve the performance of GSA, this paper firstly uses particle memory character and population social information to update velocity. Secondly, a chaotic mutation operator is embedded into GSA and a selection-operator-based greedy rule is adopted to update population. When dealing with the constraints of the SEEHTS, a modification strategy by dividing the violation water volume into several parts and randomly selecting intervals to adjust the water discharge gradually is proposed to handle the water dynamic balance constraints. Meanwhile, a new symmetrical adjusting strategy is adopted to handle reservoir storage constraints. Furthermore, the priority index strategy based on thermal power output is applied to handle system load balance constraints. To test the performance of the proposed method, simulation results have been compared with those obtained by particle swarm optimization, evolutionary programming and differential evolution reported in literature. The results show that the proposed IGSA provides the optimum solution with less fuel cost and smaller emission. So it demonstrates that IGSA is effective for solving SEEHTS problem.", "paper_title": "An improved gravitational search algorithm for solving short-term economic/environmental hydrothermal scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000361730200006"}
