The work described below constitutes the first effort of any kind to annotate multiple translations of foreign-language texts with interlingual content. Three levels of representation are introduced: deep syntactic dependencies (IL0), intermediate semantic representations (IL1), and a normalized representation that unifies conversives, nonliteral language, and paraphrase (IL2). The resulting annotated, multilingually induced, parallel corpora will be useful as an empirical basis for a wide range of research, including the development and evaluation of interlingual NLP systems and paraphrase-extraction systems as well as a host of other research and development efforts in theoretical and applied linguistics, foreign language pedagogy, translation studies, and other related disciplines.", "paper_title": "Interlingual annotation of parallel text corpora: a new framework for annotation and evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000279980200001"}
