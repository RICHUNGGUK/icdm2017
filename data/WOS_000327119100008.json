One of the challenges is how to customize the architecture for the target applications efficiently and effectively without performing explicit design space exploration. In this article we present a novel methodology for incremental interconnect customization of CGRAs that can suggest a new interconnection architecture which is able to maximize the performance for a given set of application kernels while minimizing the hardware cost. In our methodology, we translate the problem of interconnect customization into that of inexact graph matching, and we devised a heuristic for A* search algorithm to efficiently solve the inexact graph matching problem. Our experimental results demonstrate that our customization method can quickly find application-optimized interconnections that exhibit 80% higher performance on average compared to the base architecture which has mesh interconnections, with little energy and hardware increase in interconnections and muxes.", "paper_title": "Architecture Customization of On-Chip Reconfigurable Accelerators", "paper_id": "WOS:000327119100008"}
