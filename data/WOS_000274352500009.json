A diverse set of 611 compounds, including 442 fathead minnow toxicity (FMT) agents and 169 non-FMT agents, are adopted to develop the classification models. A hybrid feature selection method, which combines Fischer's score and Monte Carlo simulated annealing embedded in the SVM approach, is used to select the relevant descriptors from 1559 molecular descriptors. Five-fold cross-validation method is used to optimize the model parameters and select the relevant descriptors. Using the 60 selected descriptors, SVM model gives an averaged prediction accuracy of 95.5% for FMT, 79.3% for non-FMT and 91.0% for all samples, while the corresponding values of the ANN model are 92.5%, 75.2% and 87,7%, respectively. The study indicates that the hybrid feature selection method is very efficient and the selected descriptors from the SVM approach have also a good performance for the ANN approach. A hold-out method is used to build the final classification models by using the selected descriptors and optimized model parameters from the 5-fold cross-validation. The SVM model gives an excellent prediction accuracy of 96.6% for FMT, 93.0% for non-FMT and 95.1% for all samples, while the corresponding values of the ANN model are 91.4%, 90.7% and 91.1%, respectively.
