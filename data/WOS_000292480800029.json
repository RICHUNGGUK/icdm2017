In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric independence test based on a least-squares density ratio estimator. Our method, called least-squares independence test (LSIT), is distribution-free, and thus it is more flexible than parametric approaches. Furthermore, it is equipped with a model selection procedure based on cross-validation. This is a significant advantage over existing non-parametric approaches which often require manual parameter tuning. The usefulness of the proposed method is shown through numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Least-Squares Independence Test", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480800029"}
