As such, the main limitation of these kinds of techniques is that a generated wrapper is only useful for the web page it was designed for. To overcome this, in this paper it is proposed a system that generates first-order logic rules that can be used to extract data from web pages. These rules are based on visual features such as font size, elements positioning or types of contents. Thus, they do not depend on a document's internal structure, and are able to work on different sites. The system has been validated on a set of different web pages, showing very high precision and good recall, which validates the robustness and the generalization capabilities of the approach.", "paper_title": "FIRST-ORDER LOGIC RULE INDUCTION FOR INFORMATION EXTRACTION IN WEB RESOURCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000313370300007"}
