These disturbances degrade tracking performance significantly and, therefore, should be compensated. To this end, the kinematics with state-dependent disturbances are rigorously derived based on the general form of slippage in the mobile robots, and fuzzy adaptive observers together with parameter adaptation laws are designed to estimate the state-dependent disturbances in both kinematics and dynamics. Because of the modular structure of the proposed method, it can be easily combined with the previous controllers based on the model with the pure nonholonomic constraint, such that the combination of the fuzzy adaptive observers with the previously proposed backstepping-like feedback linearization controller can guarantee the trajectory tracking errors to be globally ultimately bounded, even when the nonholonomic constraint is violated, and their ultimate bounds can be adjusted appropriately for various types of trajectories in the presence of large initial tracking errors and disturbances. Both the stability analysis and simulation results are provided to validate the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Adaptive Tracking Control of Wheeled Mobile Robots With State-Dependent Kinematic and Dynamic Disturbances", "paper_id": "WOS:000304905500015"}
