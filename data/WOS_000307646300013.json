As a consequence, the corresponding untyped decision procedures can be extended for free to the typed settings. Some of these theorems are obtained via a detour through fragments of cyclic linear logic, and give rise to a substantial optimisation of standard proof search algorithms.", "paper_title": "UNTYPING TYPED ALGEBRAS AND COLOURING CYCLIC LINEAR LOGIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000307646300013"}
