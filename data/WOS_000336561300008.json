We characterize equinumerous partition ideals in terms of the minimal elements generating the complementary order filters. Here we apply a general rewriting methodology to the case of filters having overlapping minimal elements. In addition to a 'bijective proof' for Zeckendorf-like theorems - that every positive integer is uniquely representable within the Fibonacci, Tribonacci and k-Bonacci numeration systems, we establish 'bijective proofs' for a new series of partition identities related to Fibonacci, Tribonacci and k-step Fibonacci numbers. The main result is proved with the help of a multiset rewriting system such that the system itself and the system consisting of its reverse rewriting rules, both have the Church-Rosser property, which provides an explicit bijection between partitions of two different types (represented by the two normal forms).
