The channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) has been widely used as a surrogate for human observers in evaluating lesion detectability. In this paper, we propose that the problem of developing a numerical observer can be viewed as a system-identification or supervised-learning problem, in which the goal is to identify the unknown system of the human observer. Following this approach, we explore the possibility of replacing the Hotelling detector within the CHO with an algorithm that learns the relationship between measured channel features and human observer scores. Specifically, we develop a channelized support vector machine (CSVM) which we compare to the CHO in terms of its ability to predict human-observer performance. In the examples studied, we find that the CSVM is better able to generalize to unseen images than the CHO, and therefore may represent a useful improvement on the CHO methodology, while retaining its essential features.", "paper_title": "Learning a Channelized Observer for Image Quality Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000267698100003"}
