By introducing a novel alternate transmission mode, the network can optimize the optical power received by each node. By using ring topology, the central office can provide full protection in the case of both single- and double-fiber failure. It can make the number of affected RNs more predictable. And the system oscillation caused by failure can also be controlled in a stable range. By simulation, the mentioned functions are demonstrated. The simulating results show the network has good performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
