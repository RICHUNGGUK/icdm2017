The complexity of such problems is increased when the solutions exhibit sharp moving fronts. An efficient adaptive multiresolution numerical method is described for solving systems of partial differential equations. This method is based on multiresolution analysis and interpolating wavelets, that dynamically adapts the collocation grid so that higher resolution is automatically attributed to domain regions where sharp features are present. Space derivatives were computed in an irregular grid by cubic splines method. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated with some relevant examples in a chemical engineering context.", "paper_title": "Wavelet-based adaptive collocation method for the resolution of nonlinear PDEs", "paper_id": "WOS:000251514900007"}
