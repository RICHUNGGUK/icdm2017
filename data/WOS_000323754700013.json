More specifically, meronymic relations between simplex and compound nouns provide the necessary input to the deduction patterns that involve different types of compound-internal relations. The scope of these deductions extends to all four meronymic relations modeled in version 6.0 of GermaNet: component, member, substance, and portion. This deduction-based approach provides an effective method for automatically enriching the set of semantic relations included in GermaNet.", "paper_title": "Using part-whole relations for automatic deduction of compound-internal relations in GermaNet", "paper_id": "WOS:000323754700013"}
