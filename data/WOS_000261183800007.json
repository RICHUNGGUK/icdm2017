Reinforcement learning is an effective method for agents to learn how to determine actions for any time steps in a Markov decision process. Temporal-difference (TD) learning is a fundamental method for solving the reinforcement learning problem, and it can tackle the temporal credit assignment problem. This research designs agents that apply TD-based reinforcement learning to deal with online bilateral bargaining with incomplete information. This research further evaluates the agents' bargaining performance in terms of the average payoff and settlement rate. The results show that agents using TD-based reinforcement learning are able to achieve good bargaining performance. This learning approach is sufficiently robust and convenient, hence it is suitable for online automated bargaining in electronic commerce. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
