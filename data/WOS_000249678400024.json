The proposed framework is able to automatically learn the skin color information from each test image in real-time and generate the specific skin model (SSM) for that image. Consequently, the SSM can adapt to a certain image, in which the skin colors may vary from one region to another due to illumination conditions and inherent skin colors. The proposed framework consists of multiple iterations to learn the SSM, and each iteration comprises two major steps: (1) collecting new skin samples by region growing; (2) updating the skin model incrementally with the available skin samples. After the skin model converges (i.e., becomes the SSM), a post-processing can be further performed to fill up the interstices on the skin map. We performed a set of experiments on a large-scale real-life image database and our method observably outperformed the well-known Bayesian histogram. The experimental results confirm that the SSM is more robust than static skin models. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
