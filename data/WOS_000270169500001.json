Consequently, the known optimal Family D and a new optimal Family epsilon are produced in a uniform method. In contrast to the known optimal Family D, the new Family epsilon has the same parameters such as the sequence length 2(2(n) - 1), the family size 2(n), and the maximal nontrivial correlation value 2 n+1/2 + 2, where n is a positive integer, but with a different correlation function.", "paper_title": "A new optimal quaternary sequence family of length 2(2(n)-1) obtained from the orthogonal transformation of Families B and C", "paper_id": "WOS:000270169500001"}
