With the aim of enlarging the scope of feasible simulations, the presented solution combines the techniques developed for our distributed-memory CPU solver with our shared-memory GPGPU solver. The performance of the developed solution is proved using two different GPGPU clusters: the first one consists of two workstations with NVIDIA GTX 480 GPUs linked by a Gigabit Ethernet network, and the second one comprises four nodes with NVIDIA Tesla M2090 GPUs linked by an Infiniband network.", "paper_title": "Parallelization of the FMM on distributed-memory GPGPU systems for acoustic-scattering prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000316408500003"}
