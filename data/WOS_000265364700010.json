In this paper, an effective dynamic equation of a 3-DOF translational parallel manipulator for control purpose has been derived by the Lagrange-D'Alembert formulation. The structural properties of the derived dynamic equation were proved so that the vast control strategies developed for the serial counterparts can be easily extended for controlling the CPM (Cartesian parallel manipulator). The derived model also leads to decoupling dynamic characteristics, by which the complexity of the controller design can be significantly reduced. Based on this approach, a model-based computed torque method for positioning control of the CPM is illustrated. Both simulated and experimental results show that the model-based controller can achieve high positioning performance. Furthermore, it is shown that the coupling forces from other limbs play significant roles in the force components of the total dynamics of the CPM. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
