Most of the existing energy-saving algorithms focus on resource consolidation for energy efficiency. This paper proposes a simulation-driven methodology with the accurate energy model to verify its performance, and introduces a new resource scheduling algorithm Best-Fit-Decreasing-Power (BFDP) to improve the energy efficiency without degrading the QoS of the system. Both the model and the resource algorithm have been extensively simulated and validated, and results showed that they are effective. In fact, the proposed model and algorithm outperforms the existing resource scheduling algorithms especially under light workloads. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
