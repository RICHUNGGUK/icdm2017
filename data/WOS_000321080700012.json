Therefore, this paper proposes an energy-efficient model for flexible flow shop scheduling (FFS). First, a mathematical model for a FFS problem, which is based on an energy-efficient mechanism, is described to solve multi-objective optimization. Since FFS is well known as a NP-hard problem, an improved, genetic-simulated annealing algorithm is adopted to make a significant trade-off between the makespan and the total energy consumption to implement a feasible scheduling. Finally, a case study of a production scheduling problem for a metalworking workshop in a plant is simulated. The experimental results show that the relationship between the makespan and the energy consumption may be apparently conflicting. In addition, an energy-saving decision is performed in a feasible scheduling. Using the decision method, there could be significant potential for minimizing energy consumption. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
