This influence is mediated by perceptions and satisfaction with the ICT. The contingency factors analyzed are the firm's environment and ICT compatibility with the organizational culture. Perceptions are the usefulness, ease of use and security of the ICT. Findings demonstrate that contingency factors directly explain the firm's perceptions and, indirectly, satisfaction and continuance intentions. This study contributes by adapting the predominant behavioral models in the technology arena to the analysis of continuance and explaining why firms perceive inter-organizational ICTs as useful and secure.
