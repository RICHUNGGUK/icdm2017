Both register allocation and instruction scheduling are performed simultaneously at each variable reference where the selection between serialization by scheduling and spilling by register allocation is determined. To make a right selection, the costs of serialization and spilling are estimated with a cost model proposed to reduce the complexity of the estimation. Experiments show that IRIS achieves significant improvements when compared to widely-used existing techniques.", "paper_title": "Integrated instruction scheduling and fine-grain register allocation for embedded processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423500028"}
