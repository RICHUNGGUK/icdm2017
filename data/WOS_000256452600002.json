To achieve this, we introduce the use of Kolmogorov complexity to query complexity. Our technique generalizes the weighted and unweighted methods of Ambainis and the spectral method of Barnum, Saks, and Szegedy. As an immediate consequence of our main theorem, it can be shown that adversary methods can only prove lower bounds for Boolean functions f in O(min(root nC(0)(f), root nC(1)(f))), where C-0, C-1 is the certificate complexity and n is the size of the input.", "paper_title": "Lower bounds for randomized and quantum query complexity using Kolmogorov arguments", "paper_id": "WOS:000256452600002"}
