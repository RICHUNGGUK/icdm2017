The 2D-FDLPP algorithm is derived from the Two-dimensional Locality Preserving Projections (2D-LPP) by exploiting both fuzzy and discriminant properties. 2D-FDLPP algorithm preserves the relationship degree of each sample belonging to given classes with fuzzy k-nearest neighbor classifier. Also, it introduces between-class scatter constrain and label information into 2D-LPP algorithm. 2D-FDLPP algorithm finds the subspace which can best discriminate different pattern classes and weakens the environment factors according to soft assignment method. Therefore, 2D-FDLPP algorithm has more discriminant power than 2D-LPP, and is more suitable for recognition tasks. Experiments are conducted on the MNIST database for handwritten image classification, the JAFFE database and Cohn-Kanade database for facial expression recognition and the ORL database for face recognition. Experimental results reported the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Learning a Two-Dimensional Fuzzy Discriminant Locality Preserving Subspace for Visual Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784600024"}
