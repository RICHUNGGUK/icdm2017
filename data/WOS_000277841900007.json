Implicitly, morphology and syntax are to a certain extent embedded in the language models but the richness of such linguistic knowledge is not exploited. This paper studies the use of morpho-syntactic (MS) information in a post-processing stage of an ASR system, by reordering N-best lists. Each sentence hypothesis is first part-of-speech tagged. A morpho-syntactic score is computed over the tag sequence with a long-span language model and combined to the acoustic and word-level language model scores. This new sentence-level score is finally used to rescore N-best lists by reranking or consensus. Experiments on a French broadcast news task show that morpho-syntactic knowledge improves the word error rate and confidence measures. In particular, it was observed that the errors corrected are not only agreement errors and errors on short grammatical words but also other errors on lexical words where the hypothesized lemma was modified.
