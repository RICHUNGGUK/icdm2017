A cycle in an oriented 3-graph is a positive sum of some of the triples that gives weight zero to each 2-set. Our aim in this paper is to consider the following question: how large can the girth of an oriented 3-graph be? We show that there exist oriented 3-graphs whose shortest cycle has length : this is asymptotically best possible. We also show that there exist 3-tournaments whose shortest cycle has length , in complete contrast to the case of 2-tournaments.", "paper_title": "Cycles in Oriented 3-Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000358372000007"}
