ARP is stateless, as there is no authentication when exchanging a MAC address between hosts. Hacking methods using ARP spoofing are being continuously abused in various ways, and there have been many prior studies of the prevention of such attacks. However, prevention requires the modification of the basic network protocol or expensive additional equipment, so it is hard to apply these methods to the current network. In this paper, we examine the limits of prior research into ARP spoofing prevention. In addition, we suggest a defense mechanism that does not require changes to the network protocol or expensive equipment. Our system automatically renews the reliable MAC address information to the ARP table as a static type to protect users from ARP spoofing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
