The neural network contains time-invariant uncertain parameters whose values are unknown but bounded in given compact sets. Without assuming both the boundedness on the activation functions and the differentiability on the time-varying delays, a new sufficient condition is presented to ensure the existence, uniqueness, and global robust stability of equilibria for interval neural networks with multiple time-varying delays based on the Lyapunov-Razumikhin technique as well as matrix inequality analysis. Several previous results are improved and generalized, and an example is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
