Therefore, it is problematic to run and to find the best treatment plan for chemotherapy, even in case of a small size of tissue. Using an artificial neural network, this paper simulates the multiscale cancer model faster than its numerical algorithm. In order to find the best treatment plan, it suggests applying a simpler avascular model called Gompertz. By using these proposed methods, multiscale cancer modeling may be extendable to chemotherapy for a realistic size of tissue. In order to simulate multiscale model, a hierarchical neural network called Nested Hierarchical Self Organizing Map (NHSOM) is used. The basis of the NHSOM is an enhanced version of SOM, with an adaptive vigilance parameter. Corresponding parameter and the overall bottom-up design guarantee the quality of clustering, and the embedded top-down architecture reduces computational complexity. Although by applying NHSOM, the process of simulation runs faster compared with that of the numerical algorithm, it is not possible to check a simple search space. As a result, a set containing the best treatment plans of a simpler model (Gompertz) is used. Additionally, it is assumed in this paper, that the distribution of drug in vessels has a linear relation with the blood flow rate. The technical advantage of this assumption is that by using a simple linear relation, a given diffusion of a drug dosage may be scaled to the desired one. By extracting a proper feature vector from the multiscale model and using NHSOM, applying the scaled-best treatment plans of Gompertz model is done for a small size of tissue. In addition, simulating the effect of stress reduction on normal tissue after chemotherapy is another advantage of using NHSOM, which is a kind of \"emergent''.
