In many studies, modeling accessibility relies on proxy variables such as estimated travel time to selected destinations. In developing countries, estimating the travel time is hindered by scarce information about the transportation network, making it necessary to take into account off-network travel coupled with considerations of multimodal options available within the existing network. This research proposes such a hybrid approach that computes the travel time to selected destinations by optimizing together a fully modeled multimodal network and off-network travel. The model was applied in a region around Kisangani located in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travel times to Kisangani from the hybrid approach were found to be in close agreement with field-based information (R-2=0.98). The developed approach also proved to better support real-world transportation constraints (such as transfer points between travel modes or barriers) than cost-distance-based travel-time modeling. Demonstration results from the hybrid approach highlight the potential for impact assessment of road construction or rehabilitation, development of secondary towns or markets, and for land use planning in general.", "paper_title": "Multimodal accessibility modeling from coarse transportation networks in Africa", "paper_id": "WOS:000319047600009"}
