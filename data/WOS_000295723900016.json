Our analysis has substantiated the undeniable advantage of applying the bidispersive grain structure since its effectiveness is many times as high as the effectiveness of the monodispersive grain structure. Apparently, the method described in the present paper will be equally efficient when applied to heterogeneous catalysts made use of in other technological processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
