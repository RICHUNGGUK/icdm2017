To understand the underlying data-generating process and to obtain good interpolations, fixed-domain asymptotics, in which the number of observations increases in a fixed region, is often more appropriate than increasing-domain asymptotics. In the fixed-domain setting, we prove that, for a general class of inhomogeneous covariance functions, with suitable choice of wavelet filters, the wavelet transform of a nonstationary process has mostly asymptotically uncorrelated components.", "paper_title": "Decorrelation Property of Discrete Wavelet Transform Under Fixed-Domain Asymptotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000327594500016"}
