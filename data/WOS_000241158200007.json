These changes may be motivated by evolutions of user requirements as well as changes of operational sources. The multiversion-based multidimensional model we provide supports both data and structure changes. The approach consists in storing star versions according to relevant structure changes whereas data changes are recorded through dimension instances and fact instances in a star version, The model is able to integrate mapping functions to populate multi version-based multidimensional databases.", "paper_title": "A multiversion-based multidimensional model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241158200007"}
