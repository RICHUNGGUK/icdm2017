To select an informative feature with a reliable classifier features containing standard bandpower, AAR coefficients, and fractal dimension along with support vector machine (SVM), Adaboost and Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) classifiers have been assessed. In the single feature-classifier combinations, bandpower with FLDA gave the best results for three subjects, and fractal dimension and FLDA and SVM classifiers lead to the best results for two other subjects. A genetic algorithm has been used to find the best combination of the features with the aforementioned classifiers and led to dramatic reduction of the classification error and also best results in the four subjects. Genetic feature combination results have been compared with the simple feature combination to show the performance of the Genetic algorithm.", "paper_title": "A comparison approach toward finding the best feature and classifier in cue-based BCI", "paper_id": "WOS:000245298000009"}
