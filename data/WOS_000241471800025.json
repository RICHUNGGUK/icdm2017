This paper gives an improved global trust value computing method of choosing trusted source peers in P2P system. First, we give a basic description of our trust mechanism; then we bring out the global trust value computing method; third, we define trust computing operator; fourth, we introduce other related trust mechanisms; and finally we do some simulations to compare the performance of our method with other trust mechanism.", "paper_title": "An improved global trust value computing method in P2P system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800025"}
