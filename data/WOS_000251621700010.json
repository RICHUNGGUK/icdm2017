When channel distortion measure D-c is a function of bit error rate, an optimal index assignment to minimize D-c is not as uniformly optimal as BER varies. The paper presents a new distortion measure called expected channel distortion (ECD). It is independent of the bit error rate by two proposed beta-type distributions in a multiple-error pattern. Additionally, any index assignment algorithm with ECD measure is mismatch-free. In other words, index assignment algorithms can be against channel mismatch even though BER varies with time in dynamic channels. The voice digitization in North American Telephone Systems (CCITT) is adopted to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed measure. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
