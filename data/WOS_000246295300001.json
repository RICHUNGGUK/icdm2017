Some currently popular cognitive architectures lack sufficiently complex built-in meta-cognitive mechanisms. However, a sufficiently complex meta-cognitive mechanism is important, in that it is an essential part of cognition and without it, human cognition may not function properly. We contend that such a meta-cognitive mechanism should be an integral part of a cognitive architecture. Thus, such a mechanism has been developed within the CLARION cognitive architecture. The paper demonstrates how human data of two meta-cognitive experiments are simulated using CLARION. The simulations show that the meta-cognitive processes represented by the experimental data ( and beyond) can be adequately captured within the CLARION framework. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
