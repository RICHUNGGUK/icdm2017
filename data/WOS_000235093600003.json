This paper will present the details of our development in the design and fabrication of the interior architecture of scaffolds using a novel design approach. The interior architecture design (IAD) approach seeks to generate layered scaffold freeform fabrication tool path without forming complicated 3D CAD scaffold models. This involves: applying the principle of layered manufacturing to determine the scaffold individual layered process planes and layered contours; defining the 2D characteristic patterns of the scaffold building blocks (unit cells) to form the Interior Scaffold Pattern; and the generating the process tool path for freeform fabrication of these scaffolds with the specified interior architecture. Feasibility studies applying the IAD algorithm to example models with multi-interior architecture and the generation of fabrication planning instructions will also be presented.
