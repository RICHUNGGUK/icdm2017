Architectures for both single ended and differential ended LNA are proposed for small fractional bandwidths such as the ECC frequency band and for large fractional bandwidths such as FCC frequency band. Simple guidelines to achieve large voltage gain and low noise figure are given. The implementation in standard CMOS technologies in the context of integrated receivers is discussed and simple layout rules allowing reliable designs are proposed. Several LNA prototypes for different fractional bandwidths have been fabricated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS technology. Measurement results agree well with the simulations.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of UWB CMOS LC filters LNA for carrier less impulse radio receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000284640800005"}
