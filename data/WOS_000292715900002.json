Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents the special software for transient finite element (FE) analysis of coupled electromagnetic-thermal problems in a squirrel cage induction motor. The software has been prepared and is successfully applied in the design of special squirrel cage motors, e.g. the motors working in cryogenic conditions. A time-stepping FE method and transients analysis of an induction motor has been applied. The nonlinearity of the magnetic circuit, the movement of the rotor and the skewed slots have been taken into account. The results of computations have been compared with measurements. Findings - The method presented and the elaborated specialised software for FE analysis of electromagnetic and thermal transients are used to determine the dynamic performance of the squirrel-cage induction motor. The results of simulations compared with measurements confirm the adequacy of this approach to the analysis of coupled electromagnetic-thermal problems. Research limitations/implications - 3D effects have only been taken into account by quasi-3D techniques (e.g. the multi-slice for the skewed rotor slots). Practical implications - The software developed can be useful in the analysis and design of squirrel cage motor, especially motors working in cryogenic conditions. Originality/value - The paper offers appropriate software for transient analysis of coupled electromagnetic and thermal problems in squirrel cage motors with skewed slots.", "paper_title": "Finite element analysis of transient electromagnetic-thermal phenomena in a squirrel cage motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000292715900002"}
