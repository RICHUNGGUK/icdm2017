This paper presents a study of searchable signatures on the Instagram application, demonstrating that these types of tags are valuable not only because they allow for both individuals and groups to engage in what social theorist Axel Honneth calls the \"struggle for recognition,\" but also because they provide contextual use data and sociohistorical information so important to the understanding of digital objects. Methods for the gathering and display of searchable signatures in digital library environments are also explored.", "paper_title": "Searchable Signatures: Context and the Struggle for Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000344038600003"}
