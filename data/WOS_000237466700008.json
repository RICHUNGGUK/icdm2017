With the recent interest in assessing the safety, security, integrity and robustness of critical infrastructure networks, both technical and human performance measures have become important. This paper proposes a model for evaluating critical network infrastructures using both human and technical performance measures, and illustrates use of the model in a case study. Results of the evaluation and expected impacts of the research model are discussed in the final section.", "paper_title": "Critical infrastructure network evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237466700008"}
