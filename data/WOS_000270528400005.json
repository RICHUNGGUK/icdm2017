This article carries out a survey on the issue and points out the problems for the current semantic-based service discovery approaches. After that, an information model for registered services is proposed. Based on the model, it brings forward a two-phase semantic-based service discovery method which supports both the operation matchmaking and operation-composition matchmaking. Th authors import the bipartite graph matching to improve the efficiency of matchmaking. An implementation of the proposed method is presented. A series of experiments show that the method gains better performance on both discovery recall rate and precision than a traditional matchmaker and it also scales well with the number of services being accessed.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Service Discovery Method and its Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000270528400005"}
