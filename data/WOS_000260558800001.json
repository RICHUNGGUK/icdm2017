In contrast to most previous provers, our tool does not rely on the Dolev-Yao model but on the computational model. It produces proofs presented as sequences of games. These games are formalized in a probabilistic polynomial-time process calculus. Our tool provides a generic method for specifying security properties of the cryptographic primitives, which can handle shared-key and public-key encryption, signatures, message authentication codes, and hash functions. Our tool produces proofs valid for a number of sessions polynomial in the security parameter in the presence of an active adversary. We have implemented our tool and tested it on a number of examples of protocols from the literature.", "paper_title": "A Computationally Sound Mechanized Prover for Security Protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000260558800001"}
