However, there is still much to do to bridge the results of human posture estimation and the understanding of human movements. Human movement assessment is an important technique for exercise learning in the field of healthcare. In this paper, we propose an action tutor system which enables the user to interactively retrieve a learning exemplar of the target action movement and to immediately acquire motion instructions while learning it in front of the Kinect. The proposed system is composed of two stages. In the retrieval stage, nonlinear time warping algorithms are designed to retrieve video segments similar to the query movement roughly performed by the user. In the learning stage, the user learns according to the selected video exemplar, and the motion assessment including both static and dynamic differences is presented to the user in a more effective and organized way, helping him/her to perform the action movement correctly. The experiments are conducted on the videos of ten action types, and the results show that the proposed human action descriptor is representative for action video retrieval and the tutor system can effectively help the user while learning action movements.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Human Movement Retrieval and Assessment With Kinect Sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000351467400012"}
