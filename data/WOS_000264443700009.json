Its main goal is to improve the recommendation recall maintaining high recommendation precision. The formal model has been built to describe the method and to analyze how the measures used in traditional Information Retrieval may be adapted to evaluate the effectiveness of recommendation process. The original contributions consist among others of proving several properties which show that the method is able to adapt to changing user's needs and achieving the maximum effectiveness if the component methods work properly.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy-based method for improving recall values in recommender systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264443700009"}
