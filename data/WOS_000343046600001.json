The objective is to assess the performance and the potential of the temporal scheme and to investigate its advantages with respect to the second-order BDF. Furthermore, a strategy to adapt the time step and the order of the temporal scheme based on the local truncation error is considered. The proposed DG-MEBDF method has been evaluated for three unsteady test cases: (i) the convection of an inviscid isentropic vortex; (ii) the laminar flow around a cylinder; and (iii) the subsonic turbulent flow through a turbine cascade.
