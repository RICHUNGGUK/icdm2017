The detection and classification of feature points in the arteriovenous eye tree will increase the information about the structure allowing its use for medical diagnosis. In this work a method for detection and classification of retinal vessel tree feature points is presented. The method applies and combines imaging techniques such as filters or morphologic operations to obtain an adequate structure for the detection. Classification is performed by analysing the feature points environment. Detection and classification of feature points is validated using the VARIA database. Experimental results are compared to previous approaches showing a much higher specificity in the characterisation of feature points while slightly increasing the sensitivity. These results provide a more reliable methodology for retinal structure analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
