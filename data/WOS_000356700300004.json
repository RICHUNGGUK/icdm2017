Facilitating global deployment by electric vehicles is considered as a promising pathway to greenhouse gas reduction and energy security. In order to supply the vehicles, charging stations (CS) are necessitated as inevitable requirements. Inappropriate place and size of CS cause some new technical challenges, such as voltage deviation and an increase in power loss. This paper presents optimal planning of CS in presence of capacitors (CAP) to maintain voltage and improve power loss in electrical distribution networks. Simulation is carried out on a 34-bus radial distribution network. A genetic algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem. Results demonstrate the effect of optimal planning of CS and CAP on power loss and voltage profile in electric distribution networks.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous Allocation of Charging Stations and Capacitors in Distribution Networks Improving Voltage and Power Loss", "paper_id": "WOS:000356700300004"}
