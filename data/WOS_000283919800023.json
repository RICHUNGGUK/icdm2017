It provides a binary mobility definition that is analogous to the commonly used definition of intrinsic disorder in X-ray crystallographic structures. At least three different use cases can be envisaged: ( i) visualization of NMR mobility for structural analysis; ( ii) definition of regions for reliable comparative modelling in protein structure prediction and (iii) definition of mobility in analogy to intrinsic disorder. MOBI uses structural superposition and local conformational differences to derive a robust binary mobility definition that is in excellent agreement with the manually curated definition used in the CASP8 experiment for intrinsic disorder in NMR structure. The output includes mobility-coloured PDB files, mobility plots and a FASTA formatted sequence file summarizing the mobility results.", "paper_title": "MOBI: a web server to define and visualize structural mobility in NMR protein ensembles", "paper_id": "WOS:000283919800023"}
