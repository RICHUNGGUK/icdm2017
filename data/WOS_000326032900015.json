Here we offer a mathematical foundation, based on algebraic-geometry arguments, of an extension of this approach to the automated recognition of rational cubic, quartic, and elliptic curves. The accuracy of this approach is tested against synthetic data and in the case of experimental observations provided by the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory mission.", "paper_title": "Hough Transform of Special Classes of Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000326032900015"}
