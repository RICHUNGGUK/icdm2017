Firstly, we analyze characteristics of fuzzy logic that are adapted to the study of machine intelligence. Secondly, we present our opinions on machine intelligence, i.e., (1) machine intelligence requires uncertain reasoning with linguistic expressions, (2) study uncertain reasoning based on logic is one of scientific methodologies, (3) machine intelligence demands uncertain reasoning with linguistic information under the guidance of logic, (4) machine intelligence also requires automated reasoning with linguistic information based on logic. Finally, we introduce our work on uncertain and automated reasoning in the framework of lattice-valued logic based on lattice implication algebra, and discuss some further goals.
