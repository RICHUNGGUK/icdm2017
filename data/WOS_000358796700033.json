The conventional spectral method can solve the Boltzmann collision operator for binary gas mixtures but with a computational cost of the order m(r)(3)N(6), where m(r) is the mass ratio of the heavier to the lighter species, and N is the number of frequency nodes in each frequency direction. In this paper, we propose a fast spectral method for binary mixtures of monatomic gases that has a computational cost O(root m(r)M(2)N(4)logN), where M-2 is the number of discrete solid angles. The algorithm is validated by comparing numerical results with analytical Bobylev-Krook-Wu solutions for the spatially-homogeneous relaxation problem, for m(r) up to 36. In spatially-inhomogeneous problems, such as normal shock waves and planar Fourier/Couette flows, our results compare well with those of both the numerical kernel and the direct simulation Monte Carlo methods. As an application, a two-dimensional temperature-driven flow is investigated, for which other numerical methods find it difficult to resolve the flow field at large Knudsen numbers. The fast spectral method is accurate and effective in simulating highly rarefied gas flows, i.e. it captures the discontinuities and fine structures in the velocity distribution functions.
