To minimize WMSE, the weights of the squared bias and variance should be determined in advance. Determining the weights in accordance with the decision maker (DM)'s preference structure regarding the tradeoffs between the two responses is critical and difficult. In this study, we develop an interactive weighting method where the DM provides his/her preference information in the form of pairwise comparisons. Our method estimates the weights based on the pairwise comparisons in an interactive manner. The method obtains a satisfactory solution through several pairwise comparisons in the case examples that we tested. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
