This paper presents a bibliometric study of scientific output on learning to rank (L2R) between 2000 and 2013. For this procedure to be successful, every relevant bibliographic L2R record retrieved from the Scopus database was considered. The records were processed according to a series of one-dimensional and multi-dimensional metric indicators which were selected for the study. The results of this research provide the scientific community with reliable, up-to-date information about the state of L2R research and trends, and will enable researchers to develop valuable studies to reinforce research, development and innovation.", "paper_title": "Bibliometric study of the scientific research on \"Learning to Rank\" between 2000 and 2013", "paper_id": "WOS:000348324000031"}
