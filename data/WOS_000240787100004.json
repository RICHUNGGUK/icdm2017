The early detection of adenomas could prevent their evolution to cancer. A novel system for the support of the detection of adenomas in gastrointestinal video endoscopy is presented. Unlike other systems, it accepts standard low-resolution video input thus requiring less computational resources and facilitating both portability and the potential to be used in telemedicine applications. It combines intelligent processing techniques of SVMs and color-texture analysis methodologies into a sound pattern recognition framework. Concerning the system's accuracy this was measured using ROC analysis and found to exceed 94%. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
