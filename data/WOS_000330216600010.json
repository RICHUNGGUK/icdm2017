The basic PSO formulation has been augmented by: 1) running multiple PSOs and 2) deterministically generating a part of the initial population for PSO. The mapping results, in terms of the overall communication metric, have been compared with well-known techniques reported in the literature and also with exact methods built around integer linear programming (ILP). Our PSO-based results are superior to those from reported techniques. For smaller benchmarks, the results obtained are same as those corresponding to the ILP formulation, establishing the quality of the solution strategy.", "paper_title": "Application Mapping Onto Mesh-Based Network-on-Chip Using Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000330216600010"}
