The algorithm includes the capture of salient shapes in the image using a smooth direction field and the abstraction of both colors and shapes along the direction field. In addition to the directional stylization, the proposed algorithm has many good properties. First, the temporal coherence is preserved without any extra processing. Second, the level of abstraction can be controlled within constant time complexity. Last but not least, the parallel GPU implementation allows the real-time stylization of online videos. A variety of experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in producing high-quality abstract illustrations.", "paper_title": "Real-time directional stylization of images and videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000316483000003"}
