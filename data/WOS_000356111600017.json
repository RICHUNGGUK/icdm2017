PES is high-value service solution (e.g., repair, maintenance, and energy management) based on product to help manufacturers to achieve sustainable growth and profitability. Modularization can help to realize customization, increase in flexibility, reusability of service modules, and simplification of complex PES systems, etc. However, compared with tangible product, the modularization of product-extension service has rarely been dealt with, despite its potential benefits. More specifically, the question of how to identify service components and partition modules in the practical context is still an unexplored subject. Thus, this paper proposes a PES modularization approach based on modified service blueprint and fuzzy graph. The PES blueprint is firstly used to represent the whole PES scenario and identify all relevant service components. Then, fuzzy graph theory is utilized to module partition based on correlation analysis results of the service components. Finally, an exemplified modular design of compressor rotor service demonstrates the potential of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
