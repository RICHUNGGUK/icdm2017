Multicast is also considered as a key service for audio and video applications as well as data dissemination protocols over the last-mile backhaul Internet connectivity provided by multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks (MCMR WMNs). The multicast problem is essentially related to a channel assignment strategy which determines the most suitable channel-radio associations. However, channel assignment brings about its own complications and hence, solving the multicast problem in MCMR WMNs will be more complicated than that of traditional networks. This problem has been proved to be NP-hard. In the major prior art multicast protocols developed for these networks, channel assignment and multicast routing are considered as two separate sub-problems to be solved sequentially. The work in this article is targeted at promoting the adoption of learning automata for joint channel assignment and multicast routing problem in MCMR WMNs. In the proposed scheme named LAMR, contrary to the existing methods, these two sub-problems will be solved conjointly. Experimental results demonstrate that LAMR outperforms the LCA and MCM proposed by Zeng et al. (IEEE Trans. Parallel. Distrib. Syst. 21(1):86-99, 2010) as well as the genetic algorithm-, tabu search-, and simulated annealing-based methods by Cheng and Yang (Int. J. Appl. Soft Comput. 11(2):1953-1964, 2011) in terms of achieved throughput, end-to-end delay, average packet delivery ratio, and multicast tree total cost.", "paper_title": "LAMR: learning automata based multicast routing protocol for multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000312871600005"}
