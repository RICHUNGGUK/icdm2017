The MOGA explores conformation on-the-fly while simultaneously aligning a set of molecules such that their pharmacophoric features are maximally overlaid. By using a clique detection method to generate overlays Of precomputed conformations to initialize the population (rather than starting from random), the speed of the algorithm has been increased by 2 orders of magnitude. This increase in speed has enabled the program to be applied to greater numbers of molecules than was previously possible. Furthermore, it was found that biasing the conformations explored during search time to those found in the Cambridge Structural Database could also improve the quality of the results.", "paper_title": "Multiobjective Optimization of Pharmacophore Hypotheses: Bias Toward Low-Energy Conformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000272937800014"}
