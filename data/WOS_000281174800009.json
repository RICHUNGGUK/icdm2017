That is, we have a collection of sets such that for any two sets, either one of them is a subset of the other, or they are disjoint. In other words, a nested set system forms a hierarchy in the form of a tree structure. The task assignment problem on such hierarchical organizations is a real life problem. In this paper, we introduce the tree-like weighted set packing problem, which is a weighted set packing problem restricted to sets forming tree-like hierarchical structure. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm with cubic time complexity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
