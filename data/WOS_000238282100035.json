Convergence theorems for sequences of Choquet integrals are shown. A transformation theorem is given, which reveals the relation between this kind of Choquet integral on fuzzy sets and the Choquet integral on classical crisp sets. Finally, a new set function defined by this kind of Choquet integral is discussed. This new set function preserves many structural characteristics of the original set function.", "paper_title": "Choquet integrals with respect to fuzzy measure on fuzzy sigma-algebra", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100035"}
