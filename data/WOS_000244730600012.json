Algorithms dedicated to vessel segmentation generally detect the cerebral vascular tree by only seeking this high intensity blood signal in MRA data. The method presented in this paper proposes a different strategy which consists in using both MRA and classical MRI in order to integrate a priori anatomical knowledge for guidance of the vessel segmentation process. It then uses mathematical morphology tools to carry out a simultaneous segmentation of both blood signal in MRA and blood and wall signal in MRI, enabling to take advantage of a larger amount of information than previously proposed methods. This method is dedicated to the superior sagittal sinus segmentation; however, similar strategies could be considered for segmentation of other vascular structures. It has been performed on a database composed of 9 couples of MRA and MRI, providing results which have been validated and compared to other ones obtained with a region-growing algorithm. Their validation tends to prove that the proposed method is reliable even when the vascular signal is inhomogeneous or contains artifacts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
