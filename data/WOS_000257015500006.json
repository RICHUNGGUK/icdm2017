The various positioning schemes developed by researchers are intended to reduce this geometric error in order to mill with target-sized milling cutters while respecting the tolerance interval. There are two trends in positioning: either positioning is simple and right from the start it is easy to determine design of the maximum allowed milling cutter radius, or positioning is complex and determination of the maximum Milling cutter dimensions can only be conducted after digital calculations of the error. It will then be necessary to choose another milling cutter radius and recommence the positioning procedure and error calculation in order to validate the tool. In the present study, a method to estimate error in the scope of complex positioning is presented. The aim is to be capable of choosing a maximum cutting tool radius that respects the tolerance interval. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
