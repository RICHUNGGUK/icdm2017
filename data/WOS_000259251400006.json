This paper considers flip-accessibility for rhombus tilings of the whole plane, asking whether any two of them are linked by a possibly infinite sequence of flips. The answer turning out to depend on tilings, a characterization of flip-accessibility is provided. This yields, for example, that any tiling by Penrose tiles is flip-accessible from a Penrose tiling.
