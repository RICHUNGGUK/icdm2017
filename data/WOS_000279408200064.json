Motivated by the challenge of how to maximize revenue, revenue management, is the process of accurately accounting for the utility of both service providers and customers while at the same time optimizing the total revenue. Using classical mathematical methods, revenue management can be a very difficult and complex task. Our goal is to bridge the gap between real-time preserve service system analysis and optimization for robust and reliable system design. Our method that is both simple and novel takes advantage of soft real-time preserve service system's unique features to maximize the revenue. The method uses Monte Carlo simulations, logic and graphics to achieve useful probabilistic design results in a very efficient and visual manner. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
