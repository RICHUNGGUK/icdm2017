For a particular detection output it is a challenge to automatically select the best association algorithm. We approach this challenge by developing novel measures for ranking the association algorithms according to their performance without the need for a ground truth. We formulate tracking as a binary classification task and develop our principal measure (ED-score) based on the definitions of precision and recall. On a range of real cell videos tested, ED-score has a strong correlation (-0.87) with F-score. However, ED-score does not require a ground truth for computation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
