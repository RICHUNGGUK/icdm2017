The new method involves a mixed discretization of the dependent variables, discretizing the flow variables with non-conforming Rannacher-Turek finite elements while using a simple first order conforming discretization of the level set field. A three step segregated solution approach is employed, first a discrete projection method is used to decouple and compute the velocity and pressure separately, after which the level set field can be computed independently. The developed method is tested and validated on a static bubble test case and on a numerical rising bubble test case for which a very accurate benchmark solution has been established. The new approach is also compared against two commercial simulation codes, Ansys Fluent and Comsol Multiphysics, which shows that the developed method is a magnitude or more accurate and at the same time significantly faster than state of the art commercial codes.
