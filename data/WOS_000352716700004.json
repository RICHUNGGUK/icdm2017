Design/methodology/approach - Conceptual aspects of REST are reviewed and a generic architecture to support REST is presented. The relevance of the architecture is demonstrated with the help of a case study based on the collection registration database of the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. Findings - The authors argue that the \"resources and representations\" model of REST is a sustainable way for the management of web resources in a context of constant technological evolutions. Practical implications - When making information resources available on the web, a resource-oriented publishing model can avoid the costs associated with the creation of multiple interfaces. Originality/value - This paper re-examines the conceptual merits of REST and translates the architecture into actionable recommendations for institutions that publish resources.", "paper_title": "The fallacy of the multi-API culture Conceptual and practical benefits of Representational State Transfer (REST)", "paper_id": "WOS:000352716700004"}
