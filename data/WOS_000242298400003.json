The pros and cons of different network sizes are discussed, in particular how they are suited to the purposes of direct data browsing and also the cluster analysis with U-matrices. The tree-structured SOM (TS-SOM) [4, 5] is proposed as a method of acquiring multi-resolution/multi-purpose mappings of a given input space, The TS-SOM is discussed in detail and a novel modification to the algorithm that improves its reliability as a multi-resolution visualization method is presented.", "paper_title": "Multi-resolution visualization of data with self-organizing maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000242298400003"}
