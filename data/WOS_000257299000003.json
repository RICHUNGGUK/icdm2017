By employing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a sufficient condition for the global exponential stability of the delayed Markovian jumping neural networks is established. The proposed condition is also extended to the uncertain cases, which are shown to be the improvement and extension of the existing ones. Finally, the validity of the results are illustrated by an example.", "paper_title": "Robust exponential stability of Markovian jumping neural networks with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000257299000003"}
