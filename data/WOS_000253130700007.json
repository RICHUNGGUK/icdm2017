IMS utilizes protocols such as IP version 6 (IPv6), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to deliver the multimedia content. This paper proposes an analysis tool referred to as SIPv6 Analyzer to investigate the IMS-related protocols during IMS service deployment. The SIPv6 Analyzer not only dissects the protocol headers but also provides user-friendly functions such as message flow generation and audio/video replay for IPv6, SIP, and RTP. We describe the design of the SIPv6 Analyzer and use examples to illustrate how it works.
