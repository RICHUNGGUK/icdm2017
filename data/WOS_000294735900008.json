The objectives of these studies are discussed here in the context of the availability of suitable computational data that might be compared with the results of the experimental research. It is concluded that the currently available data are insufficient and should be augmented to provide better guidance for experimental work.", "paper_title": "Third-order nonlinear optical materials: practical issues and theoretical challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000294735900008"}
