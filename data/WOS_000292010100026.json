However, the identification of interaction sites mimicked by these peptides on the antigen surface is a difficult task. LocaPep is a computer program developed to localize epitopes using a new clusters algorithm that focuses on protein surface properties. The program is constructed with the aim of providing a flexible computational tool for predicting the location of epitopes on protein structures. As a first set of testing results, the localization of epitope regions in eight different antigenic proteins for which experimental data on their antibody interactions exist is correctly identified by LocaPep. These results represent a disparate sample of biologically different systems.
