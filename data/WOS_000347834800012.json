One such system available is called home infotainment platform (HIP) that uses an over-the-top box to provide a low-cost and affordable solution. However, user study from HIP suggests that the user experience of browsing internet on TV in a traditional way is not satisfactory. In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of context-aware television implemented on HIP, where we extract TV program contexts like identity and content using image processing techniques of logo detection and character recognition. There can be innovative internet-TV mash-up applications using such contexts. The techniques are especially useful for deriving the contexts from analog broadcast TV content that is prevalent in countries like India. The algorithms are designed in a lightweight manner so that they can be run efficiently on a low-cost resource-constrained platform like HIP. Experimental results with live Indian TV channel data show acceptable accuracy for the proposed systems with low-computational complexity.", "paper_title": "Context-aware television-internet mash-ups using logo detection and character recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000347834800012"}
