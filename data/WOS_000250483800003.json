The offset contribution at the output voltage is extracted and used to modify the DC component of the input voltage or the value of the active load, through low frequency feedback loops, which are realized using two transistors operating in weak inversion and a small capacitor. Because these circuits do not affect the bandwidth and allow using small transistors, the power consumption is greatly reduced with respect to an uncompensated amplifier of the same speed and offset behavior. The proposed strategies present reduced costs in area, power consumption and complexity, and a decrease in the low frequency noise contributions. MonteCarlo, HSPICE simulations results of common source, class AB and fully differential amplifiers, and experimental results of a class AB amplifier, all implemented in a 0.5-mu m CMOS technology are shown. Statistical analyses of these strategies are also presented. Improvements up to 99.74% and 398.6% in the offset and the power consumption are respectively observed.", "paper_title": "New strategies to improve offset and the speed-accuracy-power tradeoff in CMOS amplifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000250483800003"}
