An additional block interleaving mechanism improves the performance of RS coding when there are long bursts of errors. We propose a performance model of RS coding for varying conditions of Rayleigh fading on the broadcast channel with the maximum amount of block interleaving, and verify this analytic model by comparing its results with a simulation. Evaluating the quality of the resulting MPEG-4 FGS (fine granular scalability) video demonstrates the effectiveness of RS coding in achieving high perceived video quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
