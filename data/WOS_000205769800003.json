In accordance with common classification of localisation strategies, the paper proposes a geometric centralised optionally anchor Free algorithm that is based on clusterisation, multilateration and geodetic network adjustment. The method avoids fold-ambiguities by statistical tests on the robustness of the minimally stable structure in 3D. Such a rigid cluster is expanded by a novel robust approach for multilateration. The algorithm developed is capable of obtaining the least-squares solution reliably even in the presence of measurement noise levels Of Lip to 7% of the ranges. Simulations with randomly deployed networks show that it is possible to reach the best achievable mean position deviation (i.e. the Cramer Rao bound).", "paper_title": "3D Wireless Network Localization from Inconsistent Distance Observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000205769800003"}
