TMACC descriptors are generated using atomic properties determined by molecular topology. Previous validation (J Chem Inf Model 2007, 47: 626-634) of the TMACC descriptor suggests it is competitive with the current state of the art. Results: Here, we illustrate the interpretability of the TMACC descriptors, through the analysis of the QSARs of inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In the case of the ACE inhibitors, the TMACC interpretation shows features specific to C-domain inhibition, which have not been explicitly identified in previous QSAR studies. Conclusions: The TMACC interpretation can provide new insight into the structure-activity relationships studied.
