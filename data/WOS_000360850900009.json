We studied and quantified the interaction of the metallomacrocycle with the TiO2 cluster and the electronic spectrum of the complex. TDDFT calculations using the B3LYP functional were found to be the most suitable for describing the observed absorption energy bands of YD2 and YD2-TiO2. Our calculations show that the diarylamino groups act as electron donors in the photon-induced injection that occurs in DSSCs. The free-energy changes that take place during electron injection support the good performance of YD2 on TiO2 clusters.", "paper_title": "Interaction of YD2 and TiO2 in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs): a density functional theory study", "paper_id": "WOS:000360850900009"}
