By considering the cross-terms with additional design parameters, a complete form of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed. Then some free weighting matrices are introduced, and a sufficient stability condition is obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The obtained criterion is dependent on the sizes of neutral delay and discrete delay and are less conservative than those produced by previous approaches. Numerical examples are given to illustrate both the improvement the proposed method provides over some existing ones and the relationship between the neutral- and discrete-delay.
