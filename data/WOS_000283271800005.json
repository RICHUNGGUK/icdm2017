Considering the limitation of evaluation on emitter's anti-clogging performance at present. a new method using passage rate of particles as the evaluation index was proposed based on stochastic trajectory model in a Lagrangian reference frame. Using orthogonal design, the passage rates of particles of 16 trapezoidal labyrinth channels with various geometries were calculated. where 4 dimensionless parameters were taken as the factors. The results obtained from analysis of range and variance showed that the influence degree on passage rate of particles ranks as follows: alpha > D/W > S/H > H/D. A mathematic model was established between the particle passage rate and 4 key parameters according to the multivariable regression method, which can be used to predict and compare the anti-clogging performance of trapezoidal labyrinth channels with different geometries.
