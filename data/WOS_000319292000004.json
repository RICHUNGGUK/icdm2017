This paper aims to develop a model based on three-circled sets of criteria for the pre-measurement phase of an asset recognition process. This model should be applicable to all types of assets, but we mainly focus on information as an intangible-based asset. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews and a questionnaire survey were used to provide triangulating perspectives to follow the grounded theory approach and generate artefact-based asset recognition criteria. The generated theory is applied to information as a candidate asset to explain how this invisible resource can be recognized in financial statements.", "paper_title": "Accounting recognition of information as an asset", "paper_id": "WOS:000319292000004"}
