We propose to enrich this calculus by labelling elements of sequences. Since two elements with the same label are considered to be linked, this allows us to represent protein interaction at the domain level. Well-formedness of terms are ensured by both a syntactic constraint and a type system: we discuss the differences between these approaches through the description of a biological system, namely the EGF pathway.", "paper_title": "A Formalism for the Description of Protein Interaction Dedicated to Jerzy Tiuryn on the Occasion of His Sixty Birthday", "paper_id": "WOS:000285459000002"}
