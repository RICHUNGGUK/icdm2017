Although both methods are derived from the Boltzmann equation thus share a common kinetic origin, numerically they are rather different. The LBE is a finite difference method, while the GKS is a finite-volume one. In addition, the LBE is valid for near incompressible flows with low-Mach number restriction Ma < 0.3, while the GKS is valid for fully compressible flows. In this study, we use the generalized lattice Boltzmann equation (GLBE) with multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision model, which overcomes all the apparent defects in the popular lattice BGK equation. We use both the LBE and GKS methods to simulate the flow past a square block symmetrically placed in a 2D channel with the Reynolds number Re between 10 and 300. The LBE and GKS results are validated against the well-resolved results obtained using finite-volume method. Our results show that both the LBE and GKS yield quantitatively similar results for laminar flow simulations, and agree well with existing ones, provided that sufficient grid resolution is given. For 2D problems, the LBE is about 10 and 3 times faster than the GKS for steady and unsteady flow calculations, respectively, while the GKS uses less memory. We also observe that the GKS method is much more robust and stable for under-resolved cases due to its upwinding nature and interpolations used in calculating fluxes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
