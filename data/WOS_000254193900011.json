Previously, these methods targeted the nonlinear systems near their chaotic regime but it is shown here that they are equally applicable near the branch of unstable solutions. The system is first analyzed from the view point of bifurcation, and the existence of Hopf bifurcation is established through normal form analysis. Hopf bifurcation can be either sub-critical or super-critical, and in the former case, unstable periodic orbits are formed. Our aim is to control them through a delay feedback approach so that the system stabilizes to its nearest stable periodic orbit. At the vicinity of the sub-critical Hopf point, adaptive synchronization is studied and the effect of the coupling parameter and the speed factor is analyzed in detail. Adaptive synchronization is also studied when the system is in the chaotic regime.", "paper_title": "On the study of delay feedback control and adaptive synchronization near sub-critical Hopf bifurcation", "paper_id": "WOS:000254193900011"}
