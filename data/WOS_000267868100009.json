[Physica A 387, 6845 (2008)] to study the effects of bus stop on traffic flow. Our numerical tests show that bus stop will have great effects on the stability of traffic flow and that the effects are related to the initial density and the number of bus stops. The numerical results are accordant with the real traffic, which shows that the model proposed by Tang et al. can describe some complex traffic phenomena resulted by bus stop.", "paper_title": "THE EFFECTS OF BUS STOP ON TRAFFIC FLOW", "paper_id": "WOS:000267868100009"}
