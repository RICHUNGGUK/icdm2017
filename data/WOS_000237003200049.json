Our implementation builds on the Formal Linear Algebra Methods Environment (FLAME), the Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK), and the Parallel Out-of-Core Linear Algebra Package (POOCLAPACK) infrastructures. Experimental results on an Intel Itanium2 (R) platform demonstrate the high performance of this approach.", "paper_title": "Rapid development of high-performance out-of-core solvers", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200049"}
