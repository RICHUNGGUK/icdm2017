Further, it allows users to view, exchange, organize, and combine the information available and it facilitates group decision-making. Three-member teams, randomly assigned in either the (a) view others' whiteboards or (b) cannot view others' whiteboards conditions, completed an intelligence analysis and mission planning task. Each team member was given access to a virtual whiteboard populated with decision cards (DCards) containing intelligence information constrained to a specific area of expertise. DCards can be assessed (rated) for decision impact and importance and team members have access to all DCards regardless of experimental condition. Team members who can view their teammates' whiteboards during collaborative activities achieve significantly higher performance. When compared to teams unable to view others' whiteboards, they move their own DCards less frequently, add fewer additional DCards to their own whiteboards, and rate others' DCards less frequently. Additionally, rating one's own DCards is the only process positively related team performance.", "paper_title": "Where's Farah?: Knowledge silos and information fusion by distributed collaborating teams", "paper_id": "WOS:000288220000008"}
