In this paper we introduce a novel approach to the semantics of such calculi: we consider a sort of labeled transition systems called counterpart models as semantic domain, where states are algebras and transitions are defined by counterpart relations (a family of partial homomorphisms) between states. Then, formulae are interpreted over sets of state assignments (families of partial substitutions, associating formula variables to state components). Our proposal allows us to model and reason about the creation and deletion of components, as well as the merging of components. Moreover, it avoids the limitations of existing approaches, usually enforcing restrictions of the transition relation: the resulting semantics is a streamlined and intuitively appealing one, yet it is general enough to cover most of the alternative proposals we are aware of. The paper is rounded up with some considerations about expressiveness and decidability aspects.", "paper_title": "Counterpart Semantics for a Second-Order mu-Calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000305269900007"}
