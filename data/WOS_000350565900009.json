In contrast to existing storage architectures, we consider a PCM-based storage architecture to enhance the reliability of storage systems. In PCM-based storage systems, the major challenge falls on how to prevent the frequently updated (meta) data from wearing out their residing PCM cells without excessively searching and moving metadata around the PCM space and without extensively updating the index structures of file systems. In this work, we propose an adaptive wearleveling mechanism to prevent any PCM cell from being worn out prematurely by selecting appropriate data for swapping with constant search/sort cost. Meanwhile, the concept of indirect pointers is designed in the proposed mechanism to swap data without any modification to the file system's indexes. Experiments were conducted based on well-known benchmarks and realistic workloads to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design, for which the results are encouraging.", "paper_title": "Marching-Based Wear-Leveling for PCM-Based Storage Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000350565900009"}
