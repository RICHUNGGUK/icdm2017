In this perspective, customer complaints through call centers are adequate to support the analysis for service improvement in financial service industry. In this study, we propose a web-based decision support system for business process management employing customer complaints, namely Voice of the Customer (VOC), and its handling data for service improvement. It involves VOC conversion for data enrichment and includes analysis of summarization, exception and comparison. The proposed system is evaluated on a major credit card company in South Korea.
