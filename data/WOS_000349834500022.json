Based on the subtraction, the notions of dual and minor for M-fuzzifying matroids are given when M is the unit interval [0, 1] or a finite Boolean algebra. Following the analogy with crisp matroids a number of relations among these notions are derived.", "paper_title": "Minors of M-fuzzifying matroids", "paper_id": "WOS:000349834500022"}
