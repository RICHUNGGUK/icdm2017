Based on a result of Bertrand and Schmidt, we prove that a number belongs to Q(alpha) if and only if it has an eventually periodic alpha-adic expansion. Then we consider alpha-adic expansions of elements of the ring Z[alpha(-1)] when satisfies the so-called Finiteness property (F). We give two algorithms for computing these expansions-one for positive and one for negative numbers. In the particular case that is a quadratic Pisot unit satisfying (F), we inspect the unicity and/or multiplicity of alpha-adic expansions of elements of Z[alpha(-1)]. We also provide algorithms to generate alpha-adic expansions of rational numbers in that case. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
