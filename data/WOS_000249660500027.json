Our approach is based on a new method for interface advection that we term the Marker Level Set (MLS). The MLS method uses surface markers and a level set for tracking the surface of the liquid, yielding more efficient and accurate results than popular methods like the Particle Level Set method (PLS). Another novelty is that the surface markers allow the MLS to handle non-diffusively surface texture advection, a rare capability in the realm of Eulerian simulation of liquids. We present several simulations of the dynamical evolution of liquids and their surface textures.", "paper_title": "Textured liquids based on the marker level set", "paper_id": "WOS:000249660500027"}
