The method simply relates the kinetic energy to the system temperature via the particles' momenta based on the ideal gas law. However, when used in a tightly bound system such as solids, the method may suffer from deriving a lower system temperature and potentially inducing early breaking of atomic bonds at relatively high temperature due to the neglect of the effect of the potential energy of atoms based on solid state physics. In this paper, a modified NH thermostat method is proposed for solid system. The method takes into account the contribution of phonons by virtue of the vibrational energy of lattice and the zero-point energy, derived based on the Debye theory. Proof of the equivalence of the method and the canonical ensemble is first made. The modified NH thermostat is tested on different gold nanocrystals to characterize their melting point and constant volume specific heat, and also their size and temperature dependence. Results show that the modified NH method can give much more comparable results to both the literature experimental and theoretical data than the standard NH. Most importantly, the present model is the only one, among the six thermostat algorithms under comparison, that can accurately reproduce the experimental data and also the T-3-law at temperature below the Debye temperature, where the specific heat of a solid at constant volume is proportional to the cube of temperature.
