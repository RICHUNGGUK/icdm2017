Many decision support systems need to support online interactive frequent itemset mining, which is a challenging task because frequent itemset mining is a computation intensive repetitive process. One solution is to precompute frequent itemsets. In this paper, we propose a compact disk-based data structure - CFP-tree to store precomputed frequent itemsets on a disk to support online mining requests. The CFP-tree structure effectively utilizes the redundancy in frequent itemsets to save space. The compressing ratio of a CFP-tree can be as high as several thousands or even higher. Efficient algorithms for retrieving frequent itemsets from a CFP-tree, as well as efficient algorithms to construct and maintain a CFP-tree, are developed. Our performance study demonstrates that with a CFP-tree, frequent itemset mining requests can be responded to promptly. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
