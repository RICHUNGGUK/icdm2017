Although numerous guidelines are available for object modeling as part of requirements modeling, developing quality object models has always been considered a challenging task, especially for novice systems analysts in business environments. This paper presents an approach that can be used to support the development of quality object models. The approach is implemented as a knowledge-based system extension to an open source CASE tool to offer recommendations for improving the quality of object models. The knowledge component of this system incorporates an ontology of quality problems that is based on a conceptual model quality framework commonly found in object models, the findings of related empirical studies, and a set of analysis patterns. The results obtained from an empirical evaluation of the prototype demonstrate the utility of this system, especially with respect to recommendations related to the model completeness aspect of semantic quality.
