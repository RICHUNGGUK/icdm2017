It has a dielectric arc lens for better directivity and a simple microstrip transition as feed. The horn, the lens and the transition share the same substrate. The resulting formula from optical principles shows that the suitable dielectric lens can improve the directivity of the antenna significantly. A prototype was fabricated; the antenna size is 39.175 x 14 x 2 mm(3). The frequency band is from 25.5 to 28.5 GHz. The measured gain of this antenna is about 9 dB; the bandwidth, at 10 dB return loss, is over 12%.
