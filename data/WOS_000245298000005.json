Typically, the electroencephalogram and motion of ciliary muscle's measurement are common methods of evaluating the sleep status and eyeball motion respectively. The proposed survey is to make a wireless eye-mask for monitoring the closed eye motion non-invasively. The mask with CCD unit, wireless module, and an antenna can send the image of closed eye motion into the image-processing module in PC host. The spatial and frequency features from the eye-mask are analyzed to quantitatively describe relative position, velocity, and moving direction of eyelids and eyeballs. Besides, the motion history can feed into the support vector machine neural network and statistics units to evaluate the appropriate time to trigger the alarm if emergency occurs. The survey not only constructs a system with wireless monitoring the closed eye motion non-invasively but develops an algorithm judging whether the closed eye moving or not.", "paper_title": "Analysis of closed eyes motion using a wireless eye-mask", "paper_id": "WOS:000245298000005"}
