A methodology of multi-scale variance-based global sensitivity analysis is developed, and illustrated on the NOE model on the Orb River, France. The variability of the amount of expected annual flood avoided damages, and the associated sensitivity indices, are estimated over different spatial supports, ranging from small cells to the entire floodplain. Both uncertainty maps and sensitivity maps are produced to identify the key input variables in the NOE model at different spatial scales. Our results show that on small spatial supports, variance of the output indicator is mainly due to the water depth maps and the assets map (spatially distributed model inputs), while on large spatial supports, it is mainly due to the flood frequencies and depth damage curves (non spatial inputs).
