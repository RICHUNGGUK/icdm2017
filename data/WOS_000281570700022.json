The natural combination of VMS with adaptive strategy retains the best features of both methods and overcomes many of their deficits. A reliable a posteriori projection error estimator is derived, which can be computed by two local Gauss integrations at the element level. Finally, some numerical tests are presented to illustrate the method's efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
