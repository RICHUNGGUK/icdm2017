Its algorithm originally assumes homogeneous registers which are all gathered in the same register file. Although this register architecture is still common in most general-purpose processors, embedded processors often contain heterogeneous registers which are scattered in physically different register files dedicated for each dissimilar purpose and use. In this work, we developed a modified algorithm for optimal coalescing that helps a register allocator for an embedded processor to better handle such heterogeneity of the register architecture. In the experiment, an existing register allocator was able to achieve up to 10% reduction in code size through our coalescing, and avoid many spills that would have been generated without our scheme.", "paper_title": "Optimistic coalescing for heterogeneous register architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000253409500011"}
