The objective is to design a suitable constrained piecewise affine static output feedback controller, guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop fuzzy control system with a prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation level. Based on a smooth piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function combined with S-procedure and some matrix inequality convexification techniques, some new results are developed for static output feedback controller synthesis of the underlying continuous-time T-S fuzzy affine systems. It is shown that the controller gains can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, three examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Static-Output-Feedback H-infinity Control of Continuous-Time T-S Fuzzy Affine Systems Via Piecewise Lyapunov Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000317001400005"}
