This test statistic involves the non-parametric estimate of the samples' probability density functions (PDF's) based on the kernel density estimator and the calculation of the mean square error (MSE) distance of the estimated PDF's. In order to extract single-pixel-wide edges, a generic detection scheme cooperated with the non-maximum suppression is also proposed. This new method is applied to a variety of noisy images, and the performance is quantitatively evaluated with edge strength images. The experiments show that the proposed method provides a more effective and robust way of detecting edges in CT image compared with other existing methods.", "paper_title": "Statistical Edge Detection in CT Image by Kernel Density Estimation and Mean Square Error Distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085800018"}
