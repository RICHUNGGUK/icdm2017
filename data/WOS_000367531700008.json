Then we give a series of necessary and sufficient conditions that these implications satisfy: left neutrality property, identity principle, ordering principle, law of contraposition, modus ponens and modus tollens, respectively. We also discuss the relations between (f, g, boolean AND)-implication ((f, g, boolean OR)-implications, respectively) and other known classes of fuzzy implications.", "paper_title": "Generating Implications from One-Variable Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000367531700008"}
