The average computing time was 18 s per protein for 218 test proteins with higher prediction accuracy (1.1% increase for chi(1) and 0.8% increase for chi(1+2)) than the best performing program developed by other groups. We show that the energy functions, which were calibrated to tolerate the discrete errors of rigid rotamers, are appropriate for protein loop selection, especially for decoys without extensive structural refinement.", "paper_title": "Fast and accurate prediction of protein side-chain conformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000295680600022"}
