The proposed AAM fitting algorithm consists of two alternating procedures: active contour fitting to find the contour sample that best fits the face image and then the active appearance model fitting over the best selected contour. We also suggest an effective fitness function for fitting the contour samples to the face boundary in the active contour technique; this function defines the quality of fitness in terms of the strength and/or the length of edge features. Experimental results show that the proposed active contour-based AAM provides better accuracy and convergence characteristics in terms of RMS error and convergence rate than the existing robust AAM. The combination of the existing robust AAM and the proposed active contour-based AAM (AC-R-AAM) had the best accuracy and convergence performances. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
