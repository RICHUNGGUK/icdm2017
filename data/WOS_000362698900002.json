This paper presents an exhaustive literature survey of smart cities. First, it introduces the origin and main issues facing the smart city concept, and then presents the fundamentals of a smart city by analyzing its definition and application domains. Second, a data-centric view of smart city architectures and key enabling technologies is provided. Finally, a survey of recent smart city research is presented. This paper provides a reference to researchers who intend to contribute to smart city research and implementation.", "paper_title": "A literature survey on smart cities", "paper_id": "WOS:000362698900002"}
