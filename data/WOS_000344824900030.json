The full one-loop corrections to the Higgs boson masses are evaluated in a mixed renormalisation scheme of on-shell and (DR) over bar conditions. The Higgs decay widths include the dominant higher order QCD corrections, and the decays into bottom quarks, strange quarks and tau leptons are supplemented by higher order SUSY corrections through effective couplings. All relevant off-shell decays into two massive gauge bosons, gauge and Higgs boson and Higgs pair final states as well as into heavy quark pairs are computed. The input and output files feature the SUSY Les Houches Accord so that the program can easily be linked with existing computer tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
