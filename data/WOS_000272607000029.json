This associative model substitutes the additions and multiplications used by other models by computing maximums and minimums. This type of associative model has been applied to different pattern recognition problems including face localization and gray scale image restoration. Despite of his power, MAMs have not been applied in problems that involve true-color patterns. In this paper it is described how a MAM can be applied in problems involving true-color patterns. Furthermore, a complete study of the behavior of this associative model in the restoration of true-color images is performed using a benchmark of 14400 images altered by different type of noises.
