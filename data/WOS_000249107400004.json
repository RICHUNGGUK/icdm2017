The main purpose of MOSL is to address key functional aspects of global computing such as distribution awareness, mobility, and security and their integration with performance and dependability guarantees. In this paper, we present MoSL+, an extension of MOSL, which incorporates some basic features of the Modal Logic for Mobility (MOMO), a logic specifically designed for dealing with resource management and mobility aspects of concurrent behaviours. We also show how MOSL+ formulae can be model-checked against STOKLAIM specifications. For this purpose, we show how existing state-based stochastic model-checkers, like e.g. the Markov Reward Model Checker (MRMC), can be exploited by using a front-end for STOKLAIM that performs appropriate pre-processing of MOSL+ formulae. The proposed approach is illustrated by modelling and verifying a sample system.
