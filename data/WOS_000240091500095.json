We use fuzzy matrix space to represent the corresponding TSP solution, and bring forward the transformation method of fuzzy matrix space. Heuristic information is employed to improve the convergence speed. The experiment results show that IFD-PSO has a better performance and achieves satisfactory effect.", "paper_title": "Heuristic information based improved fuzzy discrete PSO method for solving TSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500095"}
