The method is demonstrated on an operational transconductance amplifier and capacitor (OTA-C)-based CMOS filter structure. First, we simulate the degradation of the symmetrical CMOS OTA by determining the degraded transistors in the structure. The simulation results are compared with the experimental results of our previous study. First-and second-order low-pass filter degradations are also simulated to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method. Finally, the degradation in the electroencephalogram band-pass filter and its effect on the diagnosis is discussed.", "paper_title": "On the degradation of OTA-C-based CMOS low-power filter circuits for biomedical instrumentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000322741500011"}
