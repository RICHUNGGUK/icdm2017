However, it has been observed that on highly noisy data AdaBoost easily leads to overfitting, which seriously constrains its applicability. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a new regularized boosting algorithm LPnorm2-AdaBoost (LPNA). This algorithm arises from a close connection between AdaBoost and linear programming. In the algorithm, skewness of the data distribution is controlled during the training to prevent outliers from spoiling decision boundaries. To this end, a smooth convex penalty function (l(2) norm) is introduced in the objective function of a minimax problem. A stabilized column generation technique is used to transform the optimization problem into a simple linear programming problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through experiments on many diverse datasets.", "paper_title": "Increasing the robustness of boosting algorithms within the linear-programming framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000247972100002"}
