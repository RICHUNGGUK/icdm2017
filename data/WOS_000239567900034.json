Currently, parts are verified by using alignment techniques on the inspected part and a CAD model. Applying the alignment on points or meshes is demanding and time-consuming. This work proposes a new alignment method to be applied on segments rather than on mesh elements. First, a discrete curvature analysis is applied on the meshes, and segments are extracted. Then, the inspected and CAD models are represented by segment graphs. Finally, a bipartite graph matching process is applied on the segment graphs, which are combined to be the two sides of a bipartite graph. As a result, a Combinatorial Matching Tree (CMT) is defined, and potential alignments are determined. The feasibility of the proposed segments alignment is demonstrated on real scanned engineering parts.", "paper_title": "Verification of engineering models based on bipartite graph matching for inspection applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900034"}
