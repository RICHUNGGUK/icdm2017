We present a constructing method of blending surfaces by parametric discrete interpolation PDE splines. These functions are obtained from some boundary conditions and a given interpolation data point set, by minimizing a functional associated with a partial differential equation (PDE) in a parametric finite element space. We formulate the corresponding problem and we establish a variational characterization of the solution and some convergence results. Finally, we show a graphical example. (c) 2007 IMACS.
