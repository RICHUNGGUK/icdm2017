The robustness in servo systems is related to parameter uncertainties and noise accumulation. In this paper, both parameter uncertainties and noise are considered in derivation of the error dynamic equation of the ILC algorithm. Based on the error dynamics, the H-infinity framework is utilized to design the robust learning controller. An optimization design process in selecting the proper learning gain and determining the learning function is proposed to ensure that both tracking performance and convergence condition are achieved. Simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the robust learning algorithm which can be applied efficiently to machine tools with the payload varying from 0 to 20 kg. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the tracking and contouring performances significantly when performing a complex NURBS curve on a three-axis milling machine.
