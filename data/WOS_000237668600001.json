Currently the tools poorly support urban scenarios, since they do not take a spatial environment into account. In this paper, we describe a platform for the modeling of city scenarios. We extend ns-2 with corresponding mobility and wireless transmission models. By using its emulation facility, we integrate unmodified applications and real implementations of network protocols. We demonstrate the usefulness of the platform for performance evaluations by modeling a mobile application in a simulated environment of Stuttgart downtown. We show that it helps identifying application problems before deployment.", "paper_title": "Simulating mobile ad-hoc networks in city scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000237668600001"}
