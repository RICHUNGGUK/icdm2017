They may pose wafer residency time constraints, i.e., a wafer can stay in a module for a limited time after it is processed. Although techniques exist for scheduling cluster tools with either wafer residency time constraints or wafer revisiting, it is much more challenging to schedule tools with both of them. Considering that atomic layer deposition is a typical wafer revisiting process, this paper intends to schedule a dual-arm cluster tool dealing with it. Based on the analysis of such a tool's properties, a novel scheduling strategy called modified 1-wafer cyclic scheduling is derived. With this strategy, necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions are presented. If schedulable, highly efficient scheduling algorithms are developed to obtain a feasible and optimal schedule together with a way to implement the obtained one. Illustrative examples are given to show the application of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Schedulability and Scheduling Analysis of Dual-Arm Cluster Tools with Wafer Revisiting and Residency Time Constraints Based on a Novel Schedule", "paper_id": "WOS:000350145900009"}
