In this paper, we study the network throughput using network coding and explore how the maximum throughput can be achieved in a two-way relay wireless network. Unlike previous studies, we consider a more general network with arbitrary structure of overhearing status between receivers and transmitters. To efficiently utilize the coding opportunities, we invent the concept of network coding cliques (NCCs), upon which a formal analysis on the network throughput using network coding is elaborated. In particular, we derive the closed-form expression of the network throughput under certain traffic load in a slotted ALOHA network with basic medium access control. Furthermore, the maximum throughput as well as optimal medium access probability at each node is studied under various network settings. Our theoretical findings have been validated by simulation as well.", "paper_title": "On the Throughput of Two-Way Relay Networks Using Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000327662100020"}
