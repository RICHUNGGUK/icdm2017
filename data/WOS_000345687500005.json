We encode the DEMD residue image of all non-I frames (P and B frames in H.264/MPEG) instead of the original frame. All non-I frames are synthesized using correlation search and patch-based multi-level IMF synthesis from the DEMD representation of key frames (I frames, in the H.264/MPEG framework) and the DEMD residual image of the frame being synthesized. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides better compression results as compared to MPEG/H.264 with acceptable reconstruction quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
