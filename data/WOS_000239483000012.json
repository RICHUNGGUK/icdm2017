This paper proposes an algorithm called BoostingTree, which is based on the conventional Adaboost and uses tree-structure to convert seven facial expressions to six binary problems, and also presents a novel method to compute projection matrix based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In this novel method, a block-merger combination is designed to solve the \"data disaster\" problem due to the combination of eigenvectors. In the experiment, we construct the weak classifiers set based on this novel method. The weak classifiers selected from the above set by Adaboost are combined into strong classifier to be as node classifier of one level of the tree structure. N-level tree structure built by BoostingTree can effectively solve multiclass problem such as facial expression recognition.", "paper_title": "Facial expression recognition based on BoostingTree", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000012"}
