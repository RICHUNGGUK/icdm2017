The proposed system robustly tracks people in an indoor environment and displays their predicted future footsteps in front of them in real-time. The system is composed of a video camera, a computer and a projector. There are three main modules: tracking, analysis and visualization. The tracking module extracts people as moving blobs by using an adaptive background subtraction algorithm. Then, the location and orientation of their next footsteps are predicted. The future footsteps are visualized by a high-paced continuous display of foot images in the predicted location to simulate the natural stepping of a person. To evaluate the performance, the proposed system was exhibited during a public art exhibition in an airport. People showed surprise, excitement, curiosity. They tried to control the display of the footsteps by making various movements.", "paper_title": "Real-time tracking of humans and visualization of their future footsteps in public indoor environments An intelligent interactive system for public entertainment", "paper_id": "WOS:000303869800005"}
