Specifically we achieve this goal through a combination of a fuzzy cognitive map and probabilistic planning with RDDL. Both were implemented inside a deliberative agent architecture that intends to appropriately represent the uncertain nature of data (with a Markov decision process) and the involved deliberative reasoning (with a fuzzy cognitive map). We are interested in the viability of using this view so it was tested by the simulations inspired in the ART testbed domain, but our final intention is proposing an alternative and richer representation of concepts involved in reputation problems instead of increasing the accuracy of trust predictions at any cost.", "paper_title": "Transforming agent-actions into reputational images with probabilistic planning and a fuzzy cognitive map", "paper_id": "WOS:000361767900010"}
