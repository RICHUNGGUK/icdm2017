This boundary surface Gamma is part of the envelope when B is moved by translations defined by vectors a epsilon A, or vice versa. We present an efficient algorithm working for dense point clouds or for triangular meshes. Besides this the global self-intersections of the boundary Gamma are detected and resolved. Additionally we point to some relations between Minkowski sums and kinematics, and compute local quadratic approximations of the envelope. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
