The new release allows periodic boundary conditions, many-body simulations of non-interacting particles, arbitrary stationary potential functions, and imaginary time evolution to approximate the ground state energy. The new release is more resilient to the computational environment: a wider range of compiler chains and more platforms are supported. To ease development, we provide a more extensive command-line interface, an application programming interface, and wrappers from high-level languages.", "paper_title": "Extended computational kernels in a massively parallel implementation of the Trotter-Suzuki approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000362919500034"}
