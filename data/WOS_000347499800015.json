Fuzzy clustering used to form information granulation is employed to overcome a possible curse of dimensionality, while the polynomial neural network is utilized to build local models. Furthermore, genetic algorithm (GA) is exploited here to optimize the essential design parameters of the model (including fuzzification coefficient, the number of input polynomial fuzzy neurons (PFNs), and a collection of the specific subset of input PFNs) of the network. To reduce dimensionality of the input space., principal component analysis (PCA) is considered as a sound preprocessing vehicle. The performance of the HRBFNNs is quantified through a series of experiments, in which we use several modeling benchmarks of different levels of complexity (different number of input variables and the number of available data). A comparative analysis reveals that the proposed HRBENNs exhibit higher accuracy in comparison to the accuracy produced by some models reported previously in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
