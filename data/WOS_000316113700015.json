Also, we provide the convergence of VIM when it is applied to system of linear Volterra integro-differential equations. Finally, using the proposed method, we give some illustrative examples and compare the solutions obtained by VIM with those obtained by homotopy perturbation method (HPM). The results reveal that the VIM is more powerful than the HPM.", "paper_title": "Numerical solution of linear fuzzy Volterra integro-differential equations by variational iteration method", "paper_id": "WOS:000316113700015"}
