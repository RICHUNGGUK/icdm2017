This article is about user requirements development, mainly the activities of documenting and analyzing user requirements for software-intensive systems. These are modeling activities that are useful for further Requirements Engineering activities. Current techniques for requirements modeling present a number of problems and limitations. Based on these shortcomings, a list of requirements for requirements modeling languages is proposed. The proposal of this article is to show how some extensions to SysML diagrams and tables can fulfill most of these requirements. The approach is illustrated by a list of user requirements for a Road Traffic Management System. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
