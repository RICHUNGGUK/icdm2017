The scheme takes advantage of the multi-root nature of LCMRMG and successfully integrates public key, certification and threshold technologies. The scheme is hierarchical and fully distributed. The key management operations are flexible in secure share distribution and scalable well to large MANET. Extensive simulations have shown that the scheme is secure, robust, efficient, and scalable.
