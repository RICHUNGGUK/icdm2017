Search for novel type ZBGs and development of non-hydroxamate HDACi has become a focus in current research. To complement this, it is desirable to explore a virtual screening (VS) tool capable of identifying different types of potential inhibitors from large compound libraries with high yields and low false-hit rates similar to FITS. This work explored the use of support vector machines (SVM) combined with our newly developed putative non-inhibitor generation method as such a tool. SVM trained by 702 pre-2008 hydroxamate HDACi and 64334 putative non-HDACi showed good yields and low false-hit rates in cross-validation test and independent test using 220 diverse types of HDACi reported since 2008. The SVM hit rates in scanning 13.56 M PubChem and 168K MDDR compounds are comparable to HTS rates. Further structural analysis of SVM virtual hits suggests its potential for identification of non-hydroxamate HDACi. From this analysis, a series of novel ZBG and cap groups were proposed for HDACi design.", "paper_title": "Identifying Novel Type ZBGs and Nonhydroxamate HDAC Inhibitors Through a SVM Based Virtual Screening Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000278587200004"}
