A within-subjects laboratory experiment showed SDPT increased end-user programmers' success rate and decreased the time they required. Another study, based on using SDPT to analyze a corpus of example end-user programs, demonstrated that applying all available SDPT transformations achieved an execution time improvement of 42% and a memory usage improvement of 20%, comparable to improvements that expert programmers historically had manually achieved on the same programs. These results indicate that SDPT is an effective method for helping end-user programmers to fix performance problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
