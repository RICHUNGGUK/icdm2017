In fact the theory advocates that nonadaptive, \"random\" functionals are in some sense optimal for this task. However, in practice, compressed sensing is very difficult to implement for large data sets, particularly because the recovery algorithms require significant computational resources. In this work, we present a new alternative method for simultaneous image acquisition and compression called adaptive compressed sampling. We exploit wavelet tree structures found in natural images to replace the \"universal\" acquisition of incoherent measurements with a direct and fast method for adaptive wavelet tree acquisition. The main advantages of this direct approach are that no complex recovery algorithm is in fact needed and that it allows more control over the compressed image quality, in particular, the sharpness of edges. Our experimental results show, by way of software simulations, that our adaptive algorithms perform better than existing nonadaptive methods in terms of image quality and speed.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Compressed Image Sensing Using Dictionaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000302220800003"}
