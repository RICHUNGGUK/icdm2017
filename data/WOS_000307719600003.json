Quality in use case models is of particular importance when they are utilized within a use case driven development process, whereby every aspect of development is driven by the models and influenced by their quality. Many practitioners and researchers have provided guidelines, suggestions and techniques to construct high quality use case models. This invaluable body of knowledge is disseminated across numerous literature resources. Without unifying this knowledge into one resource, it cannot be expected that a use case modeler would be fully aware of the entire body of knowledge and benefitting from it. This paper presents a systematic review that was conducted in order to identify and amalgamate this knowledge. The amalgamated knowledge is presented in a unified form, specifically as a set of 26 anti-patterns, which modelers can use to improve the quality of their models.", "paper_title": "Constructing high quality use case models: a systematic review of current practices", "paper_id": "WOS:000307719600003"}
