It is found that the dispersive interactions are dominant in determining the magnitude of the interaction and that electron transfer between the adsorbate and the surface is small. Good agreement is found between the calculated interaction energies and the experimental affinities measured in an aqueous environment.", "paper_title": "Binding of Pollutant Aromatics on Carbon Nanotubes and Graphite", "paper_id": "WOS:000276915200013"}
