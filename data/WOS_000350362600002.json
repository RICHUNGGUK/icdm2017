The LIL limits quantify the magnitude of asymptotic stochastic fluctuations of the stochastic processes compensated by their deterministic fluid limits. The LIL is established in three cases: underloaded, critically loaded, and overloaded, for five performance measures: queue length, workload, busy time, idle time, and number of departures. The proof of the LIL is based on a strong approximation approach, which approximates discrete performance processes with reflected Brownian motions. We conduct numerical examples to provide insights on these LIL results.", "paper_title": "A law of iterated logarithm for multiclass queues with preemptive priority service discipline", "paper_id": "WOS:000350362600002"}
