Recently, an improved scheme for flexible biometrics remote user authentication was proposed by Khan and Zhang. In this paper, we demonstrate that Khan-Zhang's scheme is still vulnerable to the following two attacks: (1) It is insecure to parallel session attack in which an adversary without knowing a legal user's password and biometrics information can masquerade as the legal user by somehow crafting a valid login message from eavesdropped communications between the user and the remote system; (2) It is insecure to privileged insider's attack since a legal user's password can be easily revealed to the insider attacker of the remote system. Moreover, we figure out how to eliminate the security vulnerabilities of Khan-Zhang's scheme. Compared with Khan-Zhang's scheme, the proposed scheme is more efficient and holds stronger security.", "paper_title": "A ROBUST AND FLEXIBLE BIOMETRICS REMOTE USER AUTHENTICATION SCHEME", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161000017"}
