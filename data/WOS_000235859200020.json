The features extracted by \"FingerCode\" are used to capture the ridge strength. This feature vector is then classified as genuine or impostor according to a novel approach to handle the fingerprint verification as a two-class problem. Moreover, we show that extracting the features from sub-images around the core permits to better represent the local information. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
