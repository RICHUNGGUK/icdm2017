This model associates with each created token a time interval specifying when the token will become available and forces enabled transitions to occur as soon as possible. This model can simulate other timed Petri nets and allows to describe large and complex real-time systems. We propose a much more efficient contraction for its generally infinite state space than those developed in the literature. Our contraction approach captures all linear properties of the model and produces finite graphs for all bounded models.", "paper_title": "Interval timed coloured Petri net: efficient construction of its state class space preserving linear properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000253625200004"}
