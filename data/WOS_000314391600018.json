This is referred to as the resource placement problem. In a perfect t-placement each nonresource node is at a distance of t or less from exactly one resource node. Here, we first find all perfect t-placements in the infinite square and triangular grids. That information is then used to show that translates of earlier sets are the only perfect t-placements in Gaussian and EJ interconnection networks.", "paper_title": "On Resource Placement in Gaussian and EJ Interconnection Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000314391600018"}
