The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) promotes efforts to cultivate effective research and collaborations among nano scientists and engineers to accelerate the advancement of nanotechnology and its commercialization. As of August 2008, there have been over 800 products considered to benefit from nanotechnology directly or indirectly. However, today's accomplishments in nanotechnology cannot be transformed into commercial products without productive collaborations among experts from disparate research areas such as chemistry, physics, math, biology, engineering, manufacturing, environmental sciences, and social sciences. To study the patterns of collaboration, we build and analyze the collaboration network of scientists and engineers who conduct research in nanotechnology. We study the structure of information flow through citation network of papers authored by nano area scientists. We believe that the study of nano area co-author and paper citation networks improve our understanding of patterns and trends of the current research efforts in this field. We construct these networks based on the publication data collected for years ranging 1993 through 2008 from the scientific literature database \"Web of Science\". We explore those networks to find out whether they follow power-law degree distributions and/or if they have a signature of hierarchy. We investigate the small-world characteristics and the existence of possible community structures in those networks. We estimate the statistical properties of the networks and interpret their significance with respect to the nano field.", "paper_title": "The structure and analysis of nanotechnology co-author and citation networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000294839200006"}
