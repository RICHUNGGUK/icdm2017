This paper proposes a new protocol to reach energy efficiency. The protocol has a different priority in energy efficiency as reducing energy consumption in nodes, prolonging lifetime of the whole network, increasing system reliability, increasing the load balance of the network, and reducing packet delays in the network. In the new protocol is proposed an intelligent routing protocol algorithm. It is based on reinforcement learning techniques. In the first step of the protocol, a new clustering method is applied to the network and the network is established using a connected graph. Then data is transmitted using the Q-value parameter of reinforcement learning technique. The simulation results show that our protocol has improvement in different parameters such as network lifetime, packet delivery, packet delay, and network balance.", "paper_title": "Efficient Intelligent Energy Routing Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352375500001"}
