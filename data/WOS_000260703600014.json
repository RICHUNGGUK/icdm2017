The products are sold under a general rebate warranty policy. it is also assumed that the slap, parameter of the lifetime distribution is known, and the scale parameter is it random variable varying from lot to lot. A cost model is established which contains the cost per unit oil test, the cost per unit time for life test, and the costs of rejecting and accepting a unit. Ail algorithm for determining the optimal reliability sampling plans which minimize the expected average cost per lot is provided. Some numerical results to illustrate the use of the proposed method are studied, (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
