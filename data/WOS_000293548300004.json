End-to-end real-time requirements are fulfilled with speed or delay constraint at each hop through integrating the contention and neighbor table mechanisms. More precisely, EBRR maintains a neighbor table via the contention mechanism being dependent on wireless broadcast instead of beacons. EBRR can provide a way of handling a void problem. Furthermore, EBRR can incorporate a dual-channel paradigm to alleviate packet collisions so as to lessen energy consumption and shorten end-to-end delay in high-load networks. Comprehensive simulations are carried out and show that EBRR can not only achieve better real-time performance in static networks, but also effectively improve energy efficiency and reduce communication cost in dynamic and high-load networks.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient beaconless real-time routing protocol for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000293548300004"}
