Collins reported on extensive calculations supporting his conjecture that the exponent 1-n in the well-known Mahler-Mignotte bound for the root separation of squarefree integral polynomials of degree n might be replaceable with -n/2. This paper exhibits infinite sequences of cubic polynomials with 'true' exponent -2, thus disproving that conjecture for degree n = 3, and extends this to analogous bounds for close root triplets of quartic polynomials.
