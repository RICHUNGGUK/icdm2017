However, most of the algorithms were developed based on the constraints of feedrate, acceleration/deceleration (acc/dec), jerk, and chord errors. The errors caused by servo dynamics were rarely included in the design process. This paper proposes an integrated look-ahead dynamics-based (TLD) algorithm which considers geometric and servo errors simultaneously. The ILD consists of three different modules: a sharp corner detection module, a jerk-limited module, and a dynamics module. The sharp corner detection module identifies sharp corners of a curve and then divides the curve into small segments. The jerk-limited module plans the feedrate profile of each segment according to the constraints of feedrate, acc/dec, jerk, and chord errors. To ensure that the contour errors are bounded within the specified value, the dynamics module further modifies the feedrate profile based on the derived contour error equation. Simulations and experiments are performed to validate the ILD algorithm. It is shown that the ILD approach improves tracking and contour accuracies significantly compared to adaptive-feedrate and curvature-feedrate algorithms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
