The life time distributions of the system components are assumed to be geometric with different parameters. Two-sided Bayesian probability intervals of the parameters are also derived. Numerical simulation study is given in order to: (i) explain how one can apply the theoretical results obtained, (ii) study the influence of the sample size and masking level on the accuracy of point estimates.
