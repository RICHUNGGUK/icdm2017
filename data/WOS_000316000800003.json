These frameworks must provide efficient support for systems of this kind, by means of an efficient messaging service, agent group management, security issues, etc. To cope with these requirements, in this paper, we present a novel Multiagent Platform that has been developed at the Operating System level. This feature provides high efficiency rates and scalability compared to other high-performance middleware-based Multiagent Platforms.", "paper_title": "A Scalable Multiagent Platform for Large Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000316000800003"}
