A major problem with many active learning algorithms is that an unreliable current hypothesis can mislead the querying component to query \"uninformative\" points. In this work we propose a remedy to this problem. Our solution can be viewed as a \"patch\" for fixing this deficiency and also as a proposed modular approach for active-transductive learning that produces powerful new algorithms. Extensive experiments on \"real\" data demonstrate the advantage of our method. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
