In this paper we consider difference type penalties in a context of nonparametric generalized linear models, and investigate the impact of the order of the differencing operator. Minimizing Akaike's information criterion we search for a possible best data-driven value of the differencing order. Theoretical derivations are established for the normal model and provide insights into a possible 'optimal' choice of the differencing order and its interrelation with other parameters. Applications of the selection procedure to non-normal models, such as Poisson models, are given. Simulation studies investigate the performance of the selection procedure and we illustrate its use on real data examples.", "paper_title": "P-splines regression smoothing and difference type of penalty", "paper_id": "WOS:000281983200009"}
