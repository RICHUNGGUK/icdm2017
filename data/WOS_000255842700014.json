It has been applied to many practical biometric systems and achieved excellent performance. However, there is little literature involving theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of classifier combination. In this paper, we investigate classifiers combined with the max and min rules. In particular, we compute the recognition performance of each combined classifier, and illustrate the condition in which the combined classifier outperforms the original unimodal classifier. We focus our study on personal veri. cation, where the input pattern is classified into one of two categories, the genuine or the impostor. For simplicity, we further assume that the matching score produced by the original classifier follows a normal distribution and the outputs of different classifiers are independent and identically distributed. Randomly-generated data are employed to test our conclusion. The influence of finite samples is explored at the same time. Moreover, an iris recognition system, which adopts multiple snapshots to identify a subject, is introduced as a practical application of the above discussions.", "paper_title": "Classifier combination and its application in iris recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000255842700014"}
