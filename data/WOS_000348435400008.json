The proposed circuit can be configured to compute the geometric mean between two signals and the square root of the inverse of a signal. Tanner tool is used to confirm the functionality of the circuit in 0.18 A mu m CMOS TSMC process technology. Simulation results show a 3 dB bandwidth of 2 MHz and a relative error of about 2.4 %. The maximum power consumption is 1.73 A mu W. The proposed circuit is attractive for low power and low current applications.", "paper_title": "A new CMOS current-mode controllable-gain square rooting circuit using MOSFET in subthreshold", "paper_id": "WOS:000348435400008"}
