We focus on weighted unit-price-contract (UPC) auctions, in which bidders bid unit prices and pay accordingly if they win, and their bids are weighted by factors based on their own past performance. We characterize the efficient and the revenue-maximizing weighting factors and apply our framework to study Yahoo!'s and Google's auction designs, each of which can be viewed as a special case of weighted UPC auctions.
