The SNNM is the interconnection of a linear dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator. By combining Lyapunov functional with S-Procedure, some useful criteria of global asymptotic stability for the discrete-time SNNMs are derived, whose conditions are formulated as linear matrix inequalities. Most delayed (or non-delayed) RNNs can be transformed into the SNNMs to be stability analyzed in a unified way. Some application examples of the SNNMs to the stability analysis of the discrete-time RNNs shows that the SNNMs make the stability conditions of the RNNs easily verified.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of discrete-time recurrent neural networks based on standard neural network models", "paper_id": "WOS:000270649100001"}
