This paper starts with the construction of CCs and then proceeds to describe the design of CC-based CDMA and MIMO wireless communication systems. Complementary-coded chip-level space-time coding offers a unique paradigm to implement multiuser MIMO systems, opening up a new dimension to combine multiple-access and multiple-antenna techniques in a unified platform for a possible system design optimization of a wireless communication system in the future. In this paper, we will also discuss various potential research topics and technical challenges that need to be tackled before a complementary-coded MIMO CDMA system can be implemented in practical wireless applications.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Complementary-Coded MIMO CDMA Wireless Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000352024400004"}
