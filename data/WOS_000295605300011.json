Such systems share the reconfigurable device and processing unit as computing resources which leads to highly dynamic allocation situations. To manage such systems at runtime, a reconfigurable operating system is needed. The main part of this operating system is resource management unit which performs HW/SW partitioning, co-scheduling and placement of hardware tasks at run-time. In this paper, we present a technique for on-line integrated HW/SW partitioning and co-scheduling. We focus on on-line, real-time and non-preemptive systems. The main characteristics of our method are future-awareness scheduling and strong nexus between partitioning, scheduling and placement. A large variety of experiments have been conducted on the proposed algorithm using synthetic and real tasks. Obtained results show considerable benefits of this algorithm.", "paper_title": "Future-based On-line Integrated HW/SW Partitioning and Co-scheduling for Reconfigurable Computing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000295605300011"}
