A mixed-model assembly line is one capable of producing different types of products to respond to different market demands, while minimizing on capital costs of designing multiple assembly lines. In this research, according to the stochastic environment of production systems, a mixed-model assembly line has been put forth in a make-to-order (MTO) environment. Furthermore, a MOGA approach is presented to solve the corresponding balancing problem and the decision maker is provided with the subsequent answers to pick one based on the specific situation. Finally, a comparison is carried out between six multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) so as to determine the best method to solve this specific problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
