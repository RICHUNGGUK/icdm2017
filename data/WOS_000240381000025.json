The algorithm can be used in various applications in CAD and computer graphics. This paper focuses on paper crafting and demonstrates that the algorithm generates approximations that are developable, easy to cut, and can be glued together. It is also shown that the error between the given model and the paper model is small.", "paper_title": "Paper craft models from meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240381000025"}
