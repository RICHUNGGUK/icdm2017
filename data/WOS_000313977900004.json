The zero-forcing vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time architecture (ZF V-BLAST) algorithm and maximum ratio combining scheme are applied at the receiver. The average bit error rate (BER) expression is derived provided that the number of receive antennas is not less than that of transmit antennas. The BER expression is verified by simulations. Numerical results show that the numbers of transmit and receive antennas have significant effects on the BER performance of the considered system. Spatial and path diversity show different capabilities to improve the BER performance. The MIMO MT-CDMA system based on the ZF V-BLAST algorithm is capable of achieving a better BER performance and a higher capacity than the conventional MT-CDMA system.
