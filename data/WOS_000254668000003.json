The intent is to provide a comprehensive conceptual framework within which to systematically and consistently address problems and solutions related to dynamically reconfigurable systems. The analysis identifies and categorizes the various types of change that may be required, the relationship between those types, and the system integrity characteristics that need to be considered when such changes take place. A system model is employed to describe each change type using examples of global and local properties in the context of a financial analysis system. A rigorous formal methodology, based on the Alloy language and tools, is employed to specify precisely and formally the detailed relationships between various parts of the model. Based upon these descriptions, the types of change of dynamic system reconfiguration are presented as a series of UML class models.", "paper_title": "Domain analysis of dynamic system reconfiguration", "paper_id": "WOS:000254668000003"}
