One important function of this framework is that it can predict different conflict resolutions based on DMs' different fuzzy satisficing thresholds. The fuzzy preference conflict analysis framework extends the option prioritization technique that can efficiently elicit DMs' crisp preferences, also using it to calculate DMs' fuzzy preferences. Through analyzing a water pollution conflict that occurred between the upstream and the downstream areas of a reservoir in China, the capability of the fuzzy preference conflict analysis framework to investigate real-world conflicts is verified, as is the efficiency of the fuzzy option prioritization methodology in representing DMs' fuzzy preferences.", "paper_title": "A conflict analysis framework considering fuzzy preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200049"}
