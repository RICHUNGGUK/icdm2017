While the large body of experiments so far accumulated has validated MDM2 as a therapeutically important target for the development of anticancer drugs. it is only recently that MDMX has also become ail attractive target for the treatment of tumor cells expressing wild type p53. The availability of structural information of the N-terminal domain of MDM2 ill complex with p53-derived peptides and inhibitors, and the very recent disclosure of the crystal Structure of the N-terminal domain of MDMX bound to a p53 peptide, offer all unprecedented opportunity to provide insight into the molecular basis of p53 recognition and the identification of discriminating features affecting the binding of the tumor suppressor protein at MDM2 and MDMX. By using coarse graining simulations. in this Study we report the exploration of the conformational transitions featured in the pathway leading from the apo-MDM2 and apo-MDMX states to the p53-bound MDM2 and p53-bound MDMX states., respectively. The results have enabled LIS to identify a pool of diverse conformational states of the oncogenic proteins that affect the binding of p53 and the presence of conserved anti non-conserved interactions along the conformational transition pathway that may be exploited in the design of selective and dual modulators of MDM2 and MDMX activity.", "paper_title": "Targeting the Conformational Transitions of MDM2 and MDMX: Insights into Dissimilarities and Similarities of p53 Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000260428800009"}
