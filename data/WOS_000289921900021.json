Recently, two-dimensional LDA (2DLDA) for matrices such as images has been reformulated into symmetric 2DLDA (S2DLDA), which is solved by an iterative algorithm. In this paper, we propose a non-iterative S2DLDA and experimentally show that the proposed method achieves comparable classification accuracy with the conventional S2DLDA, while the proposed method is computationally more efficient than the conventional S2DLDA.", "paper_title": "Non-iterative Symmetric Two-Dimensional Linear Discriminant Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000289921900021"}
