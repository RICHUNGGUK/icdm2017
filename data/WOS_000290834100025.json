Given standard estimates of the departure points of flow trajectories, solving the associated MA problem provides a corrected solution satisfying a discrete Lagrangian form of the mass continuity equation to round-off error. The impact of the MA enhancement is discussed in two diverse limits of fluid dynamics applications: passive tracer advection in a steady cellular flow and in fully developed turbulence. Improvements of the overall accuracy of simulations depend on the problem and can be substantial. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
