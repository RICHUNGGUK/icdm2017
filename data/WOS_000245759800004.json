Although EDCA introduces new mechanisms for differentiated medium access, it falls short in ensuring (i) intra-class QoS guarantees since flows belonging to the same service class (AC) are assigned the same MAC parameters regardless of their respective bit rate, which leads to throughput fairness rather than perceived QoS fairness, and (ii) sustained QoS guarantees by developing some sort of admission control mechanism to protect QoS of flows being served. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol featuring a dynamic channel reservation by using dynamic TXOPlimit parameter assignment along with a fully distributed admission control algorithm. By monitoring the dynamics MAC's AC queues, each AC figures out during runtime the TXOPlimit's value that best accommodates the application's data rate. TXOPlimit values are determined based on instantaneous network availability modelling taking into account key factors (e.g., contention level, network load, etc.) that influence flows' QoS performances. We generalize this model so that each AC active in the network may a priori assess the achievable QoS. This later model is used to design a fully-distributed admission control algorithm that regulates the network load to protect the already admitted flows from new entering flows. Simulation results show that compared to both EDCA and AEDCF (Adaptive EDCF), our protocol excels, in terms of network utilization and ability to guarantee the same QoS metrics' performances to flows of the same AC (intra-class). The admission control mechanism ensures high protection to the admitted flows while maintaining high network utilisation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
