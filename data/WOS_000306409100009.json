Compared to commonly used contour fragment features, these primitives support more efficient representation since their storage requirements are independent of object size. Additionally, these primitives are readily described by their geometrical properties and hence afford very efficient feature comparison. We pair these primitives as shape-tokens and learn discriminative combinations of shape-tokens. Here, we allow each combination to have a variable number of shape-tokens. This, coupled with the generic nature of primitives, enables a variety of class-specific shape structures to be learned. Building on the contour-based method, we propose a new hybrid recognition method that combines shape and appearance features. Each discriminative combination can vary in the number and the types of features, where these two degrees of variability empower the hybrid method with even more flexibility and discriminative potential. We evaluate our methods across a large number of challenging classes, and obtain very competitive results against other methods. These results show the proposed shape primitives are indeed sufficiently powerful to recognize object classes in complex real-world scenes.", "paper_title": "Object Recognition by Discriminative Combinations of Line Segments, Ellipses, and Appearance Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000306409100009"}
