Recently, a number of anti-counterfeiting approaches have been proposed for such purpose. This paper presents a track-and-trace system for RFID-based anti-counterfeiting, and addresses possible implementation issues, such as tag selection, product tagging, tag programming and locking. A packaging line for bottled products is developed and integrated with the proposed system for investigation of these issues. Experiments are conducted to determine the critical tag moving speed beyond which the tag programming rate or reliability of tagged products being transferred on a convey drops significantly. The critical tag moving speed is vital not only for determining the maximum production throughput possible, but also for setting up RFID equipment needed to ensure tagged products with erroneous tagging can be sorted out from the packaging line accordingly.
