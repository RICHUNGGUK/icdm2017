This article presents an approach of adapting these solvers to solve anisotropic diffusion equations. The formulation works by decomposing the diffusive flux into a component associated with isotropic diffusion and another component associated with departure from isotropic diffusion. This results in an isotropic diffusion equation with additional terms to account for the anisotropic effect. These additional terms are treated using a deferred correction approach and coupled via an iterative procedure. The presented approach is validated against various diffusion problems in anisotropic media with known analytical or numerical solutions. Although demonstrated for two-dimensional problems, extension of the present approach to three-dimensional problems is straight forward. Other than the finite volume method, this approach can be applied to any discretization method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
