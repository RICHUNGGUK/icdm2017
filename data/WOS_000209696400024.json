The proposed scheme is based on sending pairs of probing packets to a wireless end host to determine the smallest and average intra-packet gaps of the probing packets that are used for the estimation of the constant dispersion gap that wireless access creates. We present experimental evaluations of the proposed scheme, and the obtained results show that the proposed scheme achieves high measurement accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the proposed scheme is able to work under the presence of cross traffic along the path.", "paper_title": "Active Scheme to Measure Throughput of Wireless Access Link in Hybrid Wired-Wireless Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696400024"}
