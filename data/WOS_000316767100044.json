The technique was developed through hybridization of a radial basis function network (RBFN) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The machining was done on 5 vol% titanium carbide (TiC) reinforced austenitic manganese steel metal matrix composite (MMC). The proposed Neuro-Genetic technique was found to be potential in finding several optimal input machining conditions which can satisfy wide requirements of a process engineer and help in efficient utilization of WEDM in industry.
