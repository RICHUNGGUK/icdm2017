The problem of wood recognition is compounded with the nonlinearities of the features among the similar wood species. Besides that, large wood databases presented a problem of large processing time especially for online wood recognition system. In view of these problems, we propose the use of fuzzy logic-based pre-classifier as a means of treating uncertainty to improve the classification accuracy of tropical wood recognition system. The pre-classifier serve as a clustering mechanism for the large database simplifying the classification process making it more efficient. The use of the fuzzy logic-based pre-classifier has managed to increase the accuracy of the wood recognition system by 4 % and reduce the processing time for training and testing by more than 75 % and 26 % respectively.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy logic-based pre-classifier for tropical wood species recognition system", "paper_id": "WOS:000325699700003"}
