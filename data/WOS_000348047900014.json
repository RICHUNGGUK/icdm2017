However, the influence level of each object is unknown, information that is critical for some applications (e.g. target marketing). In this paper, we propose a new query type, Ordered Reverse k Nearest Neighbor (ORkNN), and make efforts to adapt it in an on-demand scenario. An Order-k Voronoi diagram based approach is used to answer ORkNN queries. In particular, for different values of k, we pre-construct only one Voronoi diagram. Algorithms on both the server and the clients are presented. We also present experimental results that suggest our proposed algorithms may have practical applications.", "paper_title": "Ordered Reverse k Nearest Neighbor Search via On-demand Broadcast", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047900014"}
