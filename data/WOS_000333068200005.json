New control schemes are introduced in situations where the desired stabilization task cannot be attained solely based on quasi-local dissipative means, as considered in previous analysis. The new schemes either allow for Hamiltonian control or, if the latter is not an option, suitably restrict the set of admissible initial states. In both cases, we provide explicit algorithms for constructing a Markovian master equation that achieves the intended objective and show how this genuinely extends the manifold of stabilizable states. In particular, we present dissipative quasi-local control protocols for deterministically engineering multipartite GHZ \"cat\" states and W states on n qubits. For GHZ states, we show that no scalable procedure exists for achieving stabilization from arbitrary initial states, whereas this is possible for a target W state by a suitable combination of a two-body Hamiltonian and dissipators. Interestingly, for both entanglement classes, we show that quasi-local stabilization may be scalably achieved conditional to initialization of the system in a large, appropriately chosen subspace.", "paper_title": "STEADY-STATE ENTANGLEMENT BY ENGINEERED QUASI-LOCAL MARKOVIAN DISSIPATION: HAMILTONIAN-ASSISTED AND CONDITIONAL STABILIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000333068200005"}
