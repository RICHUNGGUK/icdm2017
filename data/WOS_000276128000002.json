However, by investigating cognitive radio network (CRN) architecture, the links in CRNs are unlikely to support complete security check due to link dynamics, opportunistic availability, and uni-directional in available time window. We therefore introduce trusted cognitive radio networking (TCRN) concept to facilitate network functions such as association in dynamic spectrum access and routing. First of all, we explore the mathematical framework for trust in CRNs. We then show successful association of node to CRN based on the mathematical structure of trust from statistical decision theory. Furthermore, we modify the machine-learning algorithm to update the trust measure for each node, and develop rules of thumbs to facilitate TCRN with learning capability, based on numerical simulations. Trusted CRN can greatly alleviate heterogeneous challenge for CRN operation.
