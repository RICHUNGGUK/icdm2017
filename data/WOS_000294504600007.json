In CDMA2000 Evolution Data Optimized (EVDO) network, initial applications have been mainly focused on Best Effort (BE) traffic. Network operators observed that even though BE traffic users were the lowest priority users paying small subscription fees, they were heavily consuming the network resources. Therefore, operators demanded to charge BE users depending on their different levels of data usage. In this paper, we have designed a novel forward link (FL) scheduler to differentiate BE traffic users, and created new BE user classes with different throughput characteristics. Our new approach is called Inter-User Best Effort (IUBE) traffic classification and is implemented in CDMA2000 1xEVDO networks. The performance and characterization of designed scheduler is investigated through real network experiments conducted in live CDMA2000 1xEVDO network. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) throughput measurements, received mobile terminal power, and signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR) were evaluated in the experiments. In conclusion, experimental data reveals that the average throughput value of a particular IUBE class user matches with its targeted IUBE class throughput value, and IUBE feature of CDMA2000 1xEVDO provides accurate traffic classification among BE traffic users in the cellular network.", "paper_title": "Traffic differentiation for BE users in CDMA 1xEVDO networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000294504600007"}
