In practice, a service may have multiple functional specifications for satisfying different users with different expectation descriptions around a similar functional property. For example, a song retrieval service may be enacted by the name of a song or enacted by the lyric of the song if a user does not know the name of the song. In view of this challenge, a service evaluation method promoted by multi-functional specification is proposed for cross-cloud service choreography, in this paper. Concretely speaking, a mixed integer programming model is employed to decompose global constraints into local constraints; then, the evaluation is promoted by multi-functional specification and enacted by brokers for cross-cloud service choreography. At last, experiments are presented to verify our method.
