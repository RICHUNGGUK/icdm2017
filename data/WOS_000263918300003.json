In this paper, a novel approach to automatically segment scenes and semantically represent scenes is proposed. Firstly, video shots are detected using a rough-to-fine algorithm. Secondly, key-frames within each shot are selected adaptively with hybrid features, and redundant key-frames are removed by template matching. Thirdly, spatio-temporal coherent shots are clustered into the same scene based on the temporal constraint of video content and visual similarity between shot activities. Finally, under the full analysis of typical characters on continuously recorded videos, scene content is semantically represented to satisfy human demand on video retrieval. The proposed algorithm has been performed on various genres of films and TV program. Promising experimental results show that the proposed method makes sense to efficient retrieval of interesting video content.", "paper_title": "Video scene segmentation and semantic representation using a novel scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000263918300003"}
