The intersection between the ray and the patch is reduced to the root-finding problem of the univariate Bernstein polynomial. The polynomial is obtained via Chebyshev sampling points interpolation. An iterative and unconditionally convergent algorithm called Bezier point insertion is proposed to find the roots of the univariate polynomials. The Bezier point insertion is robust and suitable for the SIMD architecture of CPU. Experimental results show that the proposed root-finding algorithm performs better than other root-finding algorithms, such as Bezier clipping and B-spline knot insertion. Our rendering algorithm can display thousands of piecewise algebraic patches of degrees 6-9 in real time and can achieve the semi-transparent rendering interactively.", "paper_title": "Real-time rendering of algebraic B-spline surfaces via Bezier point insertion", "paper_id": "WOS:000332596000006"}
