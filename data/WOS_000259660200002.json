In order to share distributed geospatial resources and facilitate the interoperability, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), in industry-government-academia consortium, has developed a set of widely accepted Web-based interoperability standards and protocols. Grid is the technology enabling resource sharing and coordinated problem solving in dynamic, raulti-institutional virtual organizations. Geospatiall (;rid is an extension and applicalion of Grid technology in the geospatial discipline. This paper discusses problems associated with directly using Globus-based Grid technology in the geospatial disciplines, the needs for geospatial Grids, and the Natures of geospatial Grids. Then, the paper presents a research project that develops and deploys a geospatial Grid through integrating Web-based geospatial interoperability standards and technology developed by OGC with Globus-based Grid technology. The geospatial Grid technology developed by this project makes the interoperable, personalized, on-demand data access and services a reality at large geospatial data archives. Such a technology can significantly reduce problems associated with archiving, manipulating, analyzing and utilizing large volumes of geospatial data at distributed locations.
