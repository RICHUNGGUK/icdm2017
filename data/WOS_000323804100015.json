This study focuses on the drawback of BDA attributed to the objective function based on the arithmetic mean in one-class classification problems, and proposes an objective function based on a generalized mean. A novel method is also presented to effectively maximize the objective function. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides better discriminative features than the BDA and its variants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
