Nevertheless, many basic graph problems like Connectivity, Reachability, Single-Source Shortest-Paths, and Flow Maximization are known to be PSPACE-hard if their input graphs are represented by OBDDs. This holds even for input OBDDs of constant width. We extend these results by concrete exponential lower bounds on the space complexity of OBDD-based algorithms for the Reachability Problem, the Single-Source Shortest-Paths Problem, and the Maximum Flow Problem. This involves the first exponential lower bound on the OBDD size for the highest bit of Integer Multiplication w. r. t. the natural interleaved variable order.", "paper_title": "Exponential lower bounds on the space complexity of OBDD-based graph algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100071"}
