The finite element applications for the fluid-structure interactions can be divided into iterative algorithms and sequential algorithms. In this paper, a new computational methodology for the analysis of tissue-fluid interaction problems is presented. The whole computational domain is treated as a single biphasic continuum, and the same space and time discretisation is carried out for the sub-domains using a penalty-based finite element model. This procedure does not require the explicit modelling of additional boundary conditions or interface elements. The developed biphasic interface finite element model is used in analysing blood flow through normal and stenotic arteries. The increase in fluid flow velocity when passing through a stenosed artery and the drop in pressure at the region are captured using this method.", "paper_title": "Tissue-fluid interface analysis using biphasic finite element method", "paper_id": "WOS:000263717100005"}
