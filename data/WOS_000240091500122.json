This is because they do not use the structural information efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel plagiarism detection system which uses parse tree kernels. By incorporating parse tree kernels into the system, it efficiently handles the structural information within source programs. A comparison with existing systems such as SID and JPlag shows that the proposed system can detect plagiarism more accurately due to its ability of handling structural information.", "paper_title": "Program plagiarism detection using parse tree kernels", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500122"}
