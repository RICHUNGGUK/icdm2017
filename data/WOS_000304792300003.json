This is reflected in prescriptive methods and is the dominant assumption in most studies. However, data modeling can also be considered a type of design with negotiable requirements, a creative process, and many workable solutions. Our paper discusses empirical results from almost 500 practitioners on three continents comparing data modeling to design. We found that data modeling, as practiced, was better characterized as design. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
