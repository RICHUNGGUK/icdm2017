Design steps for optimum loop filter design for quantization noise suppression and thermal noise reduction is outlined. Design specifications for sampling clock phase noise, reference buffer and input buffer settling is analyzed. Presented design has a 2nd-order loop filter and uses only metal-metal capacitors and thin oxide digital transistors with no additional components occupying less than 0.1 mm(2) silicon area in 0.13 mu m CMOS digital process. Measurement results show that the ADC achieves 80 dB peak SNR at a 100 kHz integration bandwidth with 1 pJ/sample conversion efficiency. With decimation filter power consumption of 0.22 mW at 104 MHz sampling rate, the ADC consumes only about 1 mA at 1.5 V for each channel.", "paper_title": "Design and analysis of a CMOS passive I a pound dagger ADC for low power RF transceivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000263975800002"}
