The mechanical behavior of these materials is widely studied with repeated load triaxial tests (RUT) in which the elastic response is defined as the resilient behavior. Usually observed under total stress conditions, the effect of pore pressure changes during loading are not usually included in design. Further, the unbound layers frequently exist under partially saturated conditions. The influence of the unsaturated state, i.e., the suction, on the mechanical behavior, of unbound granular materials for roads has not been sufficiently studied and is generally not taken into account in models used for these materials. This article presents an experimental study of the repeated load response of a compacted clayey natural sand, and describes a model for the response which includes the effects of soil suction. The response of the proposed model formulated in terms of effective stress is compared with a similar model formulated in terms of total stress. The results from both the effective stress model and the total stress model are compared with the measured volumetric and deviatoric response. It is suggested that since the model parameters for the effective stress formulation are relatively constant for all values of suction (water content), the resilient response can be best captured by an effective stress model.
