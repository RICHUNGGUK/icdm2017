The algorithm employs a fixed computational domain with the boundaries of the flow domain being located inside the computational domain. The physical boundary conditions are enforced using the immersed boundary conditions concept. The algorithm relies on the Fourier expansions in the flow direction and the Chebyshev expansions in the transverse direction. Various tests confirm spectral accuracy of the algorithm.
