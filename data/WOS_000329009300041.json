This protocol implements mutual user authentication and Platform-Authentication between the supplicant and Mesh Authenticator (MA), and between the supplicant and Authentication Server (AS) of a WLAN mesh network, establishes the key management system for the WLAN mesh network, and effectively prevents the platform configuration information of the supplicant, MA and AS from leaking out. Moreover, this protocol is proved secure based on the extended Strand Space Model (SSM) for trusted network access protocols.", "paper_title": "A Trusted Network Access Protocol for WLAN Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329009300041"}
