It is demonstrated that although the Jacobian matrix in these methods has a bigger size than the Jacobian matrix in classical low-order methods, it enjoys a special structure that can be used to develop efficient factorization techniques. In addition, the paper proposes a method to reduce the number of Newton-Raphson iterations needed to converge in the large Jacobian domain.", "paper_title": "Structural Characterization and Efficient Implementation Techniques for A-Stable High-Order Integration Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000298327500010"}
