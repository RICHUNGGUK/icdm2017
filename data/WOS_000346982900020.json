However, existing CSC algorithms are inefficient in handling moderate and large datasets. In this paper, we aim to develop a scalable and efficient CSC algorithm by integrating sparse coding based graph construction into a framework called constrained normalized cuts. To this end, we formulate a scalable constrained normalized-cuts problem and solve it based on a closed-form mathematical analysis. We demonstrate that this problem can be reduced to a generalized eigenvalue problem that can be solved very efficiently. We also describe a principled k-way CSC algorithm for handling moderate and large datasets. Experimental results over benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is greatly cost-effective, in the sense that (1) with less side information, it can obtain significant improvements in accuracy compared to the unsupervised baseline; (2) with less computational time, it can achieve high clustering accuracies close to those of the state-of-the-art.", "paper_title": "Scalable Constrained Spectral Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000346982900020"}
