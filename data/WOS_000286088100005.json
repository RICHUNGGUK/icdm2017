The methodology combines a finite difference-based simulation model and an evolutionary multiobjective optimization model. A combined simulation-optimization methodology is developed for two different formulations: (a) the minimization of maximum settlement and the minimization of differential settlement subject to stress constraints: (b) the minimization of maximum settlement, the minimization of differential settlement and the maximization of the degree of consolidation subject to stress constraints. The developed methodology is applied to an illustrative system. Different scenarios are evaluated to examine critical field conditions. The solution results show that the modular ratio and the ultimate stress carrying capacity of the stone column are the most important parameters for optimal design. The obtained results also show the potential applicability of the developed methodology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
