However, existing malicious feedback ratings complicate the accurate measurement of nodes' reputation scores. In this paper, we introduce an accurate reputation measurement approach, which uses both virgin and non-virgin reputation scores to shield services against malicious feedback ratings. We implement our approach based on the NetLogo simulation environment, and the simulation results show that our approach is capable of measuring node's reputation more effectively when suffering from malicious feedback ratings compared with other approaches.", "paper_title": "Using reputation measurement to defend mobile social networks against malicious feedback ratings", "paper_id": "WOS:000355231600015"}
