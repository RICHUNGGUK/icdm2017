However, recently the isogeometric analysis has been introduced as a viable alternative to the standard, polynomial-based finite element analysis. Moreover, it has been shown that it may outperform the classical finite element method in many aspects. This paper presents how the isogeometric analysis can be integrated within an object oriented finite element environment. The class hierarchy and corresponding methods are designed in such a way, that most of the existing functionality of the finite element code is reused. The missing data and algorithms are developed and implemented in such a way that the object oriented features, such as modularity, extensibility, maintainability, and robustness, are fully retained. The performance of the implemented isogeometric analysis methodology is presented on two- and three-dimensional examples. (C) 2011 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
