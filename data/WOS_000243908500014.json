We demonstrate that for a broad class of continuous distributions the limiting value of the expected optimal cost of the MAP is determined by the location of the left endpoint of the support set of the distribution, and construct asymptotical bounds for the expected optimal cost.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic behavior of the expected optimal value of the multidimensional assignment problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000243908500014"}
