Due to the built-in potential induced by this junction, superior current spreading performance is achieved. In addition, the suppression of current crowding phenomenon yields the reduced parasitic effect. Therefore, under an injection current of 20 mA, improved behaviors including lower turn-on voltage, lower parasitic series resistance, and significantly enhanced electrostatic discharge (ESD) performance are presented.
