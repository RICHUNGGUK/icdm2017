However, the global optima may not always be the most desirable solution in many real-world engineering design problems. In practice, if the global optimal solution is very sensitive to uncertainties, for example, small changes in design variables or operating conditions, then it may not be appropriate to use this highly sensitive solution. In this paper, we focus on combining evolutionary algorithms with function approximation techniques for robust design. In particular, we investigate the application of robust genetic algorithms to problems with high dimensions. Subsequently, we present a novel evolutionary algorithm based on the combination of a max-min optimization strategy with a Baldwinian trust-region framework employing local surrogate models for reducing the computational cost associated with robust design problems. Empirical results are presented for synthetic test functions and aerodynamic shape design problems to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges to robust optimum designs on a limited computational budget.", "paper_title": "Max-min surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm for robust design", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475600003"}
