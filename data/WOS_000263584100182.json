In the VQ coding procedure, it is often needs several epochs of clustering and always fails to obtain a better codebook: for instance, the well-known generalized Lloyd algorithm (GLA) easily traps into suboptimal codebook and does not have the ability to locate an optimal codebook during any clustering iteration with a random initial codebook. Hence, we propose a G(2)LA design to solve heavy times of clustering procedure and at least to gain the best suboptimal codebook. In order to avoid edge degradation, firstly, the new selection of initial codevectors is adopted as the fast grey vector quantization (FGVQ) procedure which chooses nonhomogeneous vectors from a large volume image data. Then extending the GLA to G(2)LA method by utilizing the measurement of grey relational analysis (GRA) which depends on the effect of relative objective and initial codevectors of FGVQ to obtain a better representative codebook. Experiment results show that at the same bit rate the G(2)LA has not only the quickly convergence time but also high quality reconstructed image than traditional GLA technique with Euclidean distance measure, especially in high dimension and a large volume data system.
