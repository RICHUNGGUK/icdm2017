Among a plethora of low power devices that are being explored, single-electron transistors (SETs) at room temperature are particularly attractive. Although prior work has proposed a binary decision diagram-based reconfigurable logic architecture using SETs, it lacks an automatic synthesis algorithm for the architecture. Consequently, in this work, we develop a product-term-based approach that synthesizes a logic circuit by mapping all its product terms into the SET architecture. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach on a set of MCNC benchmarks.", "paper_title": "A Synthesis Algorithm for Reconfigurable Single-Electron Transistor Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000315457200005"}
