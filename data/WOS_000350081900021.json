More recently, prototype approaches, known for compact and efficient models, were defined in a probabilistic setting, but are limited to metric vectorial spaces. Here we propose a generalization of the discriminative probabilistic prototype learning algorithm for arbitrary proximity data, widely applicable to a multitude of data analysis tasks. We extend the algorithm to incorporate adaptive distance measures, kernels and non-metric proximities in a full probabilistic framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
