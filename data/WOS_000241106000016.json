Conception of doubly coprime factorization and Youla parameterization of LTI systems are extended to T-S fuzzy system with respect to quadratic stability. The parameterization of the close-loop systems, which are affine with arbitrary stable Q-parameter, is then described. This description enables the application of the Q-parameter approach to various T-S fuzzy control-systems. Above all, a design scheme of Q to obtain L2-gain performance is clarified.", "paper_title": "Youla parameterization and design of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000016"}
