Cryptographic applications are inherently complex and involve large computations. Most cryptographic operations can be translated into logical operations, shift operations, and table look-ups. In this paper we design a novel processor (called mu-core) with a reconfigurable Arithmetic Logic Unit, and design custom two-dimensional multi-core architectures on top of it to accelerate cryptographic kernels. We propose an efficient mapping of instructions from the multi-core grid to the individual processor cores and illustrate the performance of AES-128E algorithm over custom-sized grids. The model was developed using Simulink and the performance analysis suggests a positive trend towards development of large multi-core (or multi-mu-core) architectures to achieve high throughputs in cryptographic operations.
