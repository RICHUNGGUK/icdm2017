This is normally accomplished by identifying those feature points with most similar local features represented by feature descriptors and measuring the feature-vector distance based on the nearest neighbor matching criterion. However, a large number of mismatches would be incurred especially when the two images under comparison have a large viewpoint variation with respect to each other or involve very different backgrounds. In this paper, a new mismatch removal method is proposed by utilizing the bipartite graph to first establish one-to-one coherent region pairs (CRPs), which are then used to verify whether each point-to-point matching pair is a correct match or not. The generation of CRPs is achieved by applying the Hungarian method to the bipartite graph, together with the use of the proposed region-to-region similarity measurement metric. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed mismatch removal method is able to effectively remove a significant number of mismatched point-to-point correspondences.
