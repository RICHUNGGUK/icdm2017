Our method defines a new mixture model that is able to extract independent and non-Gaussian features without loss of accuracy. The proposed model is learned using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm by minimizing the message length of the data set. Experimental results show the merits of the proposed methodology in the categorization of object images.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Feature Extraction Selection Approach for High-Dimensional Non-Gaussian Data Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000267050600007"}
