Firstly, the ideal solution is defined as the solution of the network without disturbing signals. In order to ensure uniqueness, L-2-gain stability, global stability or global exponential stability of the ideal solution, corresponding sufficient conditions are presented, respectively, using homotopic method, inequality techniques, M-matrix properties or one time-delay inequality. All the obtained results are illustrated by several simulations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
