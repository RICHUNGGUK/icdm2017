Inspired by the vaccination process of the natural immune system, the algorithm implements an individual-orientated adaptation of the width in training stages to optimize the potential solutions, therefore reinforces the evolutionary capability and efficiency. A two-layer genotype-coding scheme, which enables a simultaneous evolution of network structure and parameters, is presented to achieve a compact and consistent-in-form solution. The proposed learning strategy is tested on several benchmark problems and results demonstrate promise.", "paper_title": "AN EVOLUTIONARY RBF NETWORK CONFIGURATION USING ADAPTIVE WIDTH ADJUSTMENT BASED ON VACCINATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000260159400005"}
