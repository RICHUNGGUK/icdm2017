In this paper, the supplier selection problem is studied under a novel fuzzy approach in multiple sourcing conditions to select appropriate supplier in group decision-making environment regarding multiple sources. The use of the model is suitable in evaluating situations that involve subjectivity, vagueness and imprecise information. The group data have been used in multiple criteria decision making with multiple objective supplier selection. Trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are applied to evaluate the weights of supplier selection criteria under uncertainty conditions. The use of the model is suitable in evaluating situations that involve subjectivity, vagueness and imprecise information. The proposed method can use imperfect or insufficient knowledge of data to deal with decision-making problems. Additionally, fuzzy linear programming concept developed to enhance the optimum amount of the purchase under surrounding circumstance. This model allows the decision maker to meet the challenges with different weight and criteria for each criterion with respect to the required strategy. The considered fuzzy method leads to more consistence results compared to the existing methods and shows its preference in a numerical example.", "paper_title": "A new mixed fuzzy-LP method for selecting the best supplier using fuzzy group decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000330030100029"}
