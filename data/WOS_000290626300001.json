This paper explores the effectiveness of applying design models to the area of organization (re)design. To that purpose a component-based model for (re)design of organizations is presented as a specialization of an existing generic design model. Using recently developed formalizations within Organization Theory organization models are described as design object descriptions, and organization goals as design requirements. A formal design process description is presented that models the redesign process for an organization that adapts to changes in the environment. The formally specified and implemented approach to organization redesign thus obtained has been tested for a well-known historical case study from the Organization Theory literature.", "paper_title": "A generic architecture for redesign of organizations triggered by changing environmental circumstances", "paper_id": "WOS:000290626300001"}
