The robustness and efficiency of process optimization are critical factors to obtain ideal results, especially for those complicated metal-forming processes. Gradient-based optimization algorithms are subject to mathematical restrictions of discontinuous searching space, while nongradient optimization algorithms often lead to excessive computation time. This paper presents a novel intelligent optimization approach that integrates machine learning and optimization techniques. An intelligent gradient-based optimization scheme and an intelligent response surface methodology are proposed, respectively. By machine learning based on the rough set algorithm, initial total design space can be reduced to self-continuous hypercubes as effective searching spaces. Then optimization algorithms can be implemented more effectively to find optimal design results. An extrusion forging process and a U channel roll forming process are studied as application samples and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified.", "paper_title": "Optimization of metal-forming process via a hybrid intelligent optimization technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000248587300004"}
