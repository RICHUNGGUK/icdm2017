In doing this, we consider the possibility of analyzing networks where the diagonal of the adjacency matrix is structured, that is, has a fixed number of nonzero entries. We test these ideas on a network model with fixed degree, using both numerical and analytical calculations. Our results are the following. First, the leaf-removal behavior for large system size enables to distinguish between different regimes of feedback. We show their relations and the connection with the onset of complexity in the graph. Second, the influence of the diagonal structure on this behavior can be relevant.", "paper_title": "Randomization and feedback properties of directed graphs inspired by gene networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241645900016"}
