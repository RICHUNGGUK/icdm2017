The FE meshes of the structures of interest are obtained from arthrographic magnetic resonance images. All soft tissues are considered linear elastic and isotropic, and the bones were assumed rigid. A compression of the femur on the acetabular cavity as well as flexural movements and internal rotations are applied. Stresses and contact pressures are evaluated in this patient-specific model in order to better interpret the mechanism of aggression of the femoral and acetabular cartilages. The corresponding results are presented and discussed. The values obtained for the contact pressures are similar to those reported by other models based on idealised geometries. An FE analysis of a non-cam hip is also performed for comparison with the pathological case.", "paper_title": "Finite element simulations of a hip joint with femoroacetabular impingement", "paper_id": "WOS:000334018600011"}
