A graph G of order n is said to be borderenergetic if its energy equals the energy of the complete graph K-n, i.e., if epsilon(G) = 2(n - 1). We first show by examples that there exist connected borderenergetic graphs, different from the complete graph K-n. The smallest such graph is of order 7. We then show that for each integer n, n >= 7, there exists borderenergetic graphs of order n, different from K-n, and describe the construction of some of these graphs.", "paper_title": "Borderenergetic Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000361847100008"}
