As CFA interpolation generally exists in the generation of natural images and it imposes influence on the local correlation of PRNU, the differences between the PRNU correlations of natural images and those of computer generated graphics are investigated. Nine dimensions of histogram features are extracted from the local variance histograms of PRNU to represent the identification features. The discrimination is accomplished by using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experimental results and analysis show that it can achieve an average identification accuracy of 99.43%, and it is robust against scaling, JPEG compression, rotation and additive noise. Thus, it has great potential to be used in image source pipelines forensics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
