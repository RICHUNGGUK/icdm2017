We develop a simple Markov process model to analyze data block behavior and its impact on application performance, while the snapshot operation is underway at the block-level storage. We have implemented the two snapshots techniques on both Windows and Linux operating systems. Based on our analytical model and our implementation, we carry out quantitative performance evaluations and comparisons of the two snapshot techniques using IoMeter, PostMark, TPC-C, and TPC-W benchmarks. Our measurements reveal many interesting observations regarding the performance characteristics of the two snapshot techniques. Depending on the applications and different I/O workloads, the two snapshot techniques perform quite differently. In general, copy-on-write performs well on read-intensive applications, while redirect-on-write performs well on write-intensive applications.", "paper_title": "Design and Analysis of Block-Level Snapshots for Data Protection and Recovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000270957000003"}
