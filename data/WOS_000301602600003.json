Due to the high dimension and high noise level of fMRI data, order selection and dimension reduction are important procedures for multivariate analysis methods such as independent component analysis (ICA). In this work, we develop a complex-valued order selection method to estimate the dimension of signal subspace using information-theoretic criteria. To correct the effect of sample dependence to information-theoretic criteria, we develop a general entropy rate measure for complex Gaussian random process to calibrate the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling scheme in the complex domain. We show the effectiveness of the approach for order selection on both simulated and actual fMRI data. A comparison between the results of order selection and ICA on real-valued and complex-valued fMRI data demonstrates that a fully complex analysis extracts more meaningful components about brain activation.", "paper_title": "Order Selection of the Linear Mixing Model for Complex-Valued FMRI Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000301602600003"}
