In the proposed system, the transmitter of the secondary system relays the primary signal and overlays its own data on the retransmitted primary signal. The results of the theoretical analysis show that the proposed scheme with regenerative relay allows the secondary system to communicate at the same speed as the primary system that disregards the presence of the secondary system.", "paper_title": "Spectrum Sharing Overlay System with a Repeater for the Primary Signal", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738700016"}
