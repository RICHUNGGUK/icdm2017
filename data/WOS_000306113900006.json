This article presents another situation to reveal that the AGM inequality to locate the optimal solution may be invalid for Teng, Chen, and Goyal [Teng, J.T., Chen, J., and Goyal S. K.

So, the main purpose of this article is to adopt the calculus approach not only to overcome shortcomings of the arithmetic-geometric mean method of Teng et al.
