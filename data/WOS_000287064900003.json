In this paper we present end to end BER performance of dual hop wireless communication systems equipped with multiple Decode and Forward relays over Rayleigh fading channel with the best relay selection. We compare the BER performance of the best relay with the BER performance of single relay. We select the best relay based on the end to end channel conditions. We further calculate the outage probability of the best relay. It is shown that the outage probability of the best relay is equivalent to the outage probability when all relays take part in the transmission. We apply orthogonal space time block coding at the source terminal. Numerical and simulation results are presented to verify our analysis.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Two-Hop Cooperative MIMO Transmission with Best Relay Selection in Rayleigh Fading Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000287064900003"}
