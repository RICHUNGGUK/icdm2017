When WSNs are deployed in hostile environments, two issues about sensors' locations need to be considered. First, attackers may attack the localization process to make estimated locations incorrect. Second, since sensor nodes may be compromised, the base station (BS) may not trust the locations reported by sensor nodes. Researchers have proposed two techniques, secure localization and location verification, to solve these two issues, respectively. In this paper, we present a survey of current work on both secure localization and location verification. We first describe the attacks against localization and location verification, and then we classify and describe existing solutions. We also implement typical secure localization algorithms of one popular category and study their performance by simulations.", "paper_title": "Secure localization and location verification in wireless sensor networks: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000319075500003"}
