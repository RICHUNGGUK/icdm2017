We proposes a new routing algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for two order pickers (A-TOP) with congestion consideration. Using two extended dedicated heuristics with congestion consideration as reference group, a comprehensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of A-TOP. The simulation proves that A-TOP achieves the shortest total picking time in most instances and performs well in dealing with the congestion. The impacts of warehouse layout, order size, and pick:walk-time ratio on A-TOP and system performance are analyzed as well. A-TOP can adapt to different warehouse configurations, meanwhile, it can be easily extended to the situation with more than two order pickers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
