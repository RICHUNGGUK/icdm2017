This paper presents a novel Radius Basis Function (RBF) neural network with some distinctive training strategies, which can integrate multiple information sources efficiently and exploit the potential advantages of each feature. Multi-scale features extracted from remote sensing images are evaluated adaptively and used for segmentation. Experimental results obtained on artificial and real data are both presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.", "paper_title": "Remote sensing image fusion based on adaptive RBF neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100035"}
