Random Gaussian and random binary antipodal spreading are considered. We obtain the optimum asymptotic multiuser efficiency of a K-user system with spreading gain N when K and N -> infinity and the loading factor, (K/N), grows logarithmically with K under some conditions. It is shown that the optimum detector in a Gaussian randomly spread CDMA system has a performance close to the single user system at high signal-to-noise ratio when K and N. 8 and the loading factor, (K/N), is kept less than (log(3) K/2). Random binary antipodal matrices are also studied and a lower bound for the optimum asymptotic multiuser efficiency is obtained. Furthermore, we investigate the connection between detecting matrices in the coin weighing problem and optimum asymptotic multiuser efficiency. We obtain a condition such that for any binary input, an N x K random matrix, whose entries are chosen randomly from a finite set, is a detecting matrix as K and N -> infinity.", "paper_title": "On Optimum Asymptotic Multiuser Efficiency of Randomly Spread CDMA", "paper_id": "WOS:000368420200016"}
