More specifically the article addresses key design criteria of transportability, deployability, global stability, and site responsiveness through the development of analytical expressions and control framework, and reduced-scale physical model testing. The case study, a three-tiered tetrahedral mast is composed of three connected sets of planar pantograph systems and deployed by single actuator located between two of the three mast supports. The article discusses the optimum configurations for the individual design criteria and trade-offs to be made between compactness, overturning, and operational power. The design, construction, and experimentation with a 73-cm tall fully deployed physical model reinforce the feasibility of the presented smart mast concept.", "paper_title": "Structural Analysis and Validation of a Smart Pantograph Mast Concept", "paper_id": "WOS:000323825100002"}
