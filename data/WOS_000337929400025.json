Each code corresponds to a particular choice of spatial symmetry: the DIRHBS, DIRHBZ and DIRHBT codes are used to calculate nuclei with spherical symmetry, axially symmetric quadrupole deformation, and triaxial quadrupole shapes, respectively. Reflection symmetry is assumed in all three cases. The latest relativistic nuclear energy density fimctionals are implemented in the codes, thus enabling efficient and accurate calculations over the entire nuclide chart.

Ireland Licensing provisions: none No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 44516 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 317161 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 77. Computer: All computers. Operating system: All operating systems. The Makefiles are specific for a Unix OS and have to be modified for Windows. RAM: Depends on the imposed symmetry and number of oscillator shells. For the triaxial test case it takes 300 MB. Classification: 17.22. Nature of problem: Ground-state properties of even-even open-shell nuclei can be calculated using the framework of selfconsistent mean-field models based on relativistic energy density functionals. The structure of arbitrary heavy nuclei with spherical symmetry, axially symmetric quadrupole deformation, and triaxial quadrupole shapes, is modeled using the latest zero- and finite-range relativistic effective interactions. The particle-particle channel of the effective inter-nucleon interaction is described by a separable finiterange pairing force. Solution method: The current implementation of the model computes the mean-field solution of the nuclear many-body problem for even-even open-shell spherical and quadrupole deformed nuclei. The codes are used to solve the stationary relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov equations in a self-consistent iteration scheme. At each iteration the matrix elements of the equations are updated using the modified Broyden method or the linear mixing method. The single-nucleon wave functions are expanded in a basis of spherical, axially symmetric or triaxial harmonic oscillator, depending on the assumed symmetry of the nuclear shape. For calculations that constrain the shape to specific values of the deformation parameters, the augmented Lagrangian method is used. Restrictions: Time-reversal and reflection symmetries are assumed. Open-shell even-even spherical and quadrupole deformed nuclei are considered. Running time: Depends on the imposed symmetry and number of oscillator shells. For the test cases it runs from few seconds (spherical) up to few hours (triaxial). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
