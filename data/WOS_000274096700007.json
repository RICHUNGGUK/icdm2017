A local uniqueness result is given for this inverse problem suggesting that the reconstruction can be achieved by a single incident wave. A numerical procedure based on the concept of the topological derivative of an associated cost functional is used to produce images of the obstacles. No a priori assumption about the number of obstacles present is needed. Numerical results are included showing that accurate reconstructions can be obtained and that the proposed method is capable of finding both the shapes and the number of obstacles with one or a few incident waves.", "paper_title": "Determining Planar Multiple Sound-Soft Obstacles from Scattered Acoustic Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000274096700007"}
