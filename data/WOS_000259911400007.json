This paper describes the classification, implementation, and evaluation of execution coordination techniques in the mobile agent-based distributed job workflow execution system. First, a classification of the existing execution coordination techniques is developed for mobile agent systems. Second, to put the discussion into perspective, our framework for mobile agent-based distributed job workflow execution over the Grid (that is, MCCF: Mobile Code Collaboration Framework) is described. How the existing coordination techniques can be applied in the MCCF is also discussed. Finally. a performance study has been conducted to evaluate three coordination techniques using real and simulated job workflows. The results are presented and discussed in the paper.
