In this paper, we consider a restricted variant of spiking neural P systems, called homogeneous spiking neural P systems, where each neuron has the same set of rules. The universality of homogeneous spiking neural P systems is investigated. One of universality results is that it is sufficient for homogeneous spiking neural P system to have only one neuron that behaves non-deterministically in order to achieve Turing completeness.", "paper_title": "Homogeneous Spiking Neural P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273197900011"}
