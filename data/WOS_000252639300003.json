In these analyses, the stress changes caused by the pile installation are neglected, irrespective of the installation method. For displacement piles, which are either pushed or hammered into the ground, such an approach is a very crude simplification. To model the entire installation process of displacement piles a number of additional nonlinear effects need to be considered. As the soil adjacent to the pile is displaced significantly, small deformation theory is no longer applicable and a large deformation finite element formulation is required. In addition, the continuously changing interface between the pile and the soil has to be considered. Recently, large deformation frictional contact has been used to model the pile installation and cone penetration processes. However, one significant limitation of the analysis was the use of linear elements, which have proven to be less accurate than higher order elements for nonlinear materials such as soils. This paper presents a large deformation frictional contact formulation which can be coupled consistently with quadratic solid elements. The formulation uses the so-called mortar-type discretisation of the contact surfaces. The performance of this contact discretisation technique is demonstrated by accurately predicting the stress transfer between the pile and the soil surfaces. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
