A library of 10 different components is available: compressor, expansion device, condenser, evaporator, heat exchanger, Hash tank, direct intercooler flash tank, indirect intercooler flash tank, mixer, and splitter. With these components and a library of different refrigerants many different refrigeration systems may be solved. By a user-friendly interface, the user can draw the system scheme by adding different components, connecting them and entering different input data. Results are presented in the form of tables and the cycle diagram of the system is drawn on the logP-h and T-s thermodynamic charts.
