In this letter, a new improved algorithm for cICA is presented through the investigation of the inequality constraints, in which different closeness measurements are compared. The utility of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated by the experiments with synthetic data and electroencephalogram (EEG) data.", "paper_title": "A new constrained independent component analysis method", "paper_id": "WOS:000249279400024"}
