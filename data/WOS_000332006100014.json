The objective of the problem is to find maximum possible number of batches completely filled up to their capacity. The compatibility relationship among product specifications is represented by a graph called the compatibility graph. If the compatibility graph is an arbitrary graph, the problem is proven to be NP-hard and belongs to Max SNP-hard class. We develop an optimum algorithm for an important subclass of the problem where the graph is a quasi-threshold graph which in fact is the case for producing hierarchical product lines that are often found in raw materials industry.", "paper_title": "Order consolidation for hierarchical product lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000332006100014"}
