In addition, a three-stage semiparametric estimation method based on Kendall's tau in order to estimate the Student's t copula has also been designed. Its major advantage is to allow for greater computational tractability when dealing with high dimensional issues, where two-stage procedures are no more a viable choice. The asymptotic properties of this methodology are developed and its finite-sample behavior are examined via simulations. The advantages and disadvantages of this methodology are analyzed in terms of numerical convergence and positive definiteness of the estimated T-copula correlation matrix. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
