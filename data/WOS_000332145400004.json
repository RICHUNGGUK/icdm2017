The implementation of modern manufacturing services (MMS) helps to improve an enterprise's profits and enhance its competitiveness and has become one of the best ways to transform and upgrade enterprises. The implementation of MMS needs a methodology to guide evaluation of an enterprise's current service development phase and level. In this article, first a universal Enterprise Manufacturing Service Maturity Model (EMSMM) was proposed, which contains four service phases and two service levels. Second, a building methodology for the EMSMM for a specific industry was put forward. Third, an evaluation methodology for enterprise MMS phases and levels was provided. Finally, the adoption of these methods by a Chinese manufacturing enterprise was described. The results show that the EMSMM can provide effective scientific decision-making for an enterprise's current service development phase and level.", "paper_title": "A universal enterprise manufacturing services maturity model: a case study in a Chinese company", "paper_id": "WOS:000332145400004"}
