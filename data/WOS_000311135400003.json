The tractability or intractability of computing a solution to such a minimal network was a long standing open question. Dechter conjectured this computation problem to be NP-hard. We prove this conjecture. We also prove a conjecture by Dechter and Pearl stating that for k >= 2 it is NP-hard to decide whether a single constraint can be decomposed into an equivalent k-ary constraint network. We show that this holds even in case of bi-valued constraints where k >= 3, which proves another conjecture of Dechter and Pearl. Finally, we establish the tractability frontier for this problem with respect to the domain cardinality and the parameter k. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
