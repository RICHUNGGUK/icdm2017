In a previous work, these codes were classified in five shapes. In this paper, we analyze the allowable range of values for the rank and dimension of the kernel, which depends on the particular shape of the code. We show that all these codes can be represented in a standard form, from a set of generators, which can help in understanding the characteristics of each shape. The main results we present are the characterization of Hadamard Z(2)Z(4) Q(8)-codes as a quotient of a semidirect product of Z(2)Z(4)-linear codes and the construction of Hadamard Z(2)Z(4) Q(8)-codes with each allowable pair of values for the rank and dimension of the kernel.", "paper_title": "Construction of Hadamard Z(2)Z(4)Q(8)-Codes for Each Allowable Value of the Rank and Dimension of the Kernel", "paper_id": "WOS:000351470800028"}
