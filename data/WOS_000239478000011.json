Transformations must take into account changes in both behavioural and structural diagrams. In this paper, we present a set of transformation laws that aims to systematise the evolution of semantically well-defined UML-RT models, with preservation of both static and dynamic aspects. The proposed laws support the transformation of initial abstract analysis models into concrete design models. Furthermore, we show the seamless application of the laws through design activities of the Rational Unified Process in the development of a case study. Soundness and completeness of the laws are briefly addressed.", "paper_title": "Transformation Laws for UML-RT", "paper_id": "WOS:000239478000011"}
