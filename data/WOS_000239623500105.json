In order for the software tool can be used by biologists easily and intuitively, we use Petri net and Stochastic Petri net to model biopathway, combining corresponding algorithms then can do deterministic and stochastic simulation, add the function that Petri net handle string, thus users can model biopathway such as transcription and translation more effectively. We introduce how to model and simulate biopathway with it in detail, it will be accepted by biologist quickly and used widely.", "paper_title": "The design of biopathway's modelling and simulation system based on Petri net", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500105"}
