We believe that constraint reasoning can have a major impact in this field, by providing general and flexible frameworks to model agents' preferences over the alternative decisions, efficient algorithms to compute the best individual and collective decisions, and innovative approaches to deal with missing information. However, in order to do this, we claim that constraint reasoning should increase its efforts to open up to other research areas, such as voting and game theory, multi-agent systems, machine learning, and reasoning under uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Collective decision making: a great opportunity for constraint reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000334052400007"}
