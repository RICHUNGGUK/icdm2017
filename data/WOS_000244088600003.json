However, knowledge transfer can only be successful if a common interpretative focus and its context are set up. We argue that a combination of group storytelling techniques and a groupware toot can support the elicitation of context shared by a group. Moreover, our goal is to discuss how groupware can structure and formalize the contextual information behind the scenes of a story, making it easier to understand, interpret and reuse the knowledge intrinsic to it.", "paper_title": "The role of shared context in group storytelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000244088600003"}
