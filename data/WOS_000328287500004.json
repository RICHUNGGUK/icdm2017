The result showed that the electrolyte or carbon plate can be used as matrix to draw equifield line graph similar to that by using mortar as matrix. Using electrolyte electrode module for simulation has advantages of simple production, easy measurement, rapidness, and economy. The electrolyte module can be used to simulate the equifield line distribution diagram in practical two-dimensional electrode configuration firstly. Then, several equifield line zones were marked, and several subzones under one-dimensional ALMT were separated from various equifield line zones. The theoretical free content distribution of alkali in concrete under two-dimensional electric field effect could be obtained from duration analysis.", "paper_title": "Equifield line simulation and ion migration prediction for concrete under 2-D electric field", "paper_id": "WOS:000328287500004"}
