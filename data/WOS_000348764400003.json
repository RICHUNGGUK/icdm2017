In particular, it is possible to decide whether such a system of polynomials has a zero in quasilinear time in the logarithm of the degree. The underlying algorithm relies on a result of Bombieri and Zannier on multiplicatively dependent points in subvarieties of an algebraic torus. We also present the following conditional partial extension to the higher-dimensional setting. Assume that the effective Zilber conjecture holds. Then, for a system of multivariate polynomials given in sparse encoding we can compute a finite collection of complete intersections outside hypersurfaces that defines the same zero set in quasilinear time in the logarithm of the degree.", "paper_title": "Overdetermined Systems of Sparse Polynomial Equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000348764400003"}
