This may improve users' experience and bring a positive utility to them. However, their privacy concern may be aroused and perceived risk be increased because LBS need to utilize their location information. From a dual perspective of enablers and inhibitors, this research examined the factors affecting user adoption of LBS. Enablers include perceived usefulness and trust, whereas the inhibitor is privacy risk. The results indicate that contextual offering is the main factor affecting trust, whereas ubiquitous connection is the main factor affecting perceived usefulness. Privacy concern affects privacy risk. Trust has significant effects on perceived usefulness and privacy risk. And these three factors predict user adoption and usage behavior.", "paper_title": "Understanding user adoption of location-based services from a dual perspective of enablers and inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000351520100011"}
