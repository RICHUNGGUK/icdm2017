Indeed we propose a classification based on the dominant color(s) of the images. The process consists in two steps: first, assigning a colorimetric profile to the image in HLS space (Hue, Lightness, Saturation) and then, handling the query for the retrieval. To achieve the first step, the definition of hue is done using a fuzzy representation that takes into account the non-uniformity of color distribution. Then, lightness and saturation are represented through linguistic qualifiers also defined in a fuzzy way. Finally, the profile is built through fuzzy functions representing the membership degree of the image to different classes. Thus, the query for image retrieval is a pair (hue, qualifier). The second step looks for a match between the query and the profiles. In order to improve the software and to make it more flexible, the user can re-define the fuzzy representation of Hue, Lightness and Saturation, according to his own perception.", "paper_title": "Image retrieval using fuzzy representation of colors", "paper_id": "WOS:000241456100010"}
