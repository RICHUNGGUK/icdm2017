Many researchers have proposed key management schemes for SCADA systems. However, previous studies lack the proper considerations for availability. In this paper, we build up cryptographic security requirements for robust SCADA systems. In addition, we propose a hybrid key management architecture for robust SCADA systems which supports replace protocol for availability and reduces the number of keys to be stored in a master terminal unit.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Key Management Architecture for Robust SCADA Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000316242600006"}
