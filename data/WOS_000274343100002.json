In this paper, we propose a process control model in Web-based e-Learning, and illustrate how to implement process control through learning path with workflow technology. This model improves the learning efficiency by providing instructors tools to design courses with learning paths and select the popular learning objects. It also enables students to achieve an orderly learning experience through defined learning path.", "paper_title": "Implementation of Learning Path in Process Control Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000274343100002"}
