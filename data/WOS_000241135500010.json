Autonomous software agents are used to implement the functional components and to encapsulate the end user and participating resource in the system. The domain knowledge is constructed to support the agent conversation and abstract workflow modeling; Knowledge based rule mechanisms is applied to support process scheduling and enactment in the multi-agent environment. The design and prototype implementation of the system is discussed and demonstrated with a case study.", "paper_title": "Towards an agent and knowledge enacted dynamic workflow management system for intelligent manufacturing grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500010"}
