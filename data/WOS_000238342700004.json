Developing small molecules that modulate protein-protein interactions is challenging, owing to the large size of protein-complex interface, the lack of well-defined binding pockets, etc. We describe a general approach based on the \"privileged-structure hypothesis\" [Che, Ph.D. Thesis, Washington University, 2003] - that any organic templates capable of mimicking surfaces of protein-recognition motifs are potential privileged scaffolds as protein-complex antagonists - to address the challenges inherent in the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions.", "paper_title": "Development of small molecules designed to modulate protein-protein interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238342700004"}
