The RBFN is adapted on-line for both model structure and parameters with measurement data. When the RBFN is used to model a non-linear dynamic system, the structure is adapted to model abrupt change of system operating region, while the weights are adapted to model the incipient time varying parameters. Two new algorithms are proposed for adding new centres while the redundant centres are pruned, which is particularly useful for model-based control. The developed algorithm is evaluated by modelling a numerical example and a chemical reactor rig. The performance is compared with a non-adaptive model.", "paper_title": "A new structure adaptation algorithm for RBF networks and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000242672600010"}
