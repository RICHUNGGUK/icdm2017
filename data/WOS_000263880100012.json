A new chaotic system, obtained by making the change on coordinate to the Hu chaotic system, can generate very complex attractors with four-wing topological structure and three positive Lyapunov exponents over a wide range of parameters. The influence of parameters varying to system dynamics is analyzed, computer simulations and bifurcation analysis is also verified in this paper.", "paper_title": "A HYPERCHAOTIC SYSTEM WITH A FOUR-WING ATTRACTOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000263880100012"}
