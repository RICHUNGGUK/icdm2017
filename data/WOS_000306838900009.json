Integrated with a simple multi-frequency oscillator, the IC obtains adjustable preheat-time by controlling frequency changing rate with an external capacitor, and adjusts the minimum frequency by controlling minimum charging current with an external resistor. And a steady dead-time can also be achieved. Based on 0.5 mu m BCD process, the HSPICE simulation was done with 14V voltage supply. While a 1 mu F capacitor and a 100 k Omega resistor are utilized in the external circuit, this IC gives out a preheating frequency up to 175 kHz and the minimum working frequency is 75 kHz. A high frequency preheating time of 1s and a steady dead-time of 2 mu S can also be achieved.", "paper_title": "ELECTRONIC BALLAST IC WITH ADJUSTABLE PREHEAT TIME AND MINIMUM FREQUENCY FOR HOT FLUORESCENT LAMP", "paper_id": "WOS:000306838900009"}
