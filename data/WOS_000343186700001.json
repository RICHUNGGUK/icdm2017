We describe a solution to these problems, designed for the application of spike sorting for next-generation, high-channel-count neural probes. In this problem, only a small subset of features provides information about the cluster membership of any one data vector, but this informative feature subset is not the same for all data points, rendering classical feature selection ineffective. We introduce a \"masked EM\" algorithm that allows accurate and time-efficient clustering of up to millions of points in thousands of dimensions. We demonstrate its applicability to synthetic data and to real-world high-channel-count spike sorting data.", "paper_title": "High-Dimensional Cluster Analysis with the Masked EM Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000343186700001"}
