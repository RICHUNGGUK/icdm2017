Mobile IP (MIP) is expected to play a key role to handle the movements of mobile nodes (MNs) in 4G networks. However, MIP suffers from long handoff latency since it is designed to support the macromobility of a MN. Therefore, it is necessary to devise a scheme that provides currently deployed networks with backward compatibility and that offers seamless connectivity during MIP handoffs across the heterogeneous wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a client-based vertical handoff system for multi-networks to provide end-users with seamless connectivity across heterogeneous wireless networks. Our proposed system is designed as a common network interface at a client side and provides transparent service to IP/MIP layers regardless of used wireless technologies. With this system, we also present vertical handoff performance over a loosely coupled cdma2000/WLAN experimental test-bed. The experimental results show that our system enables a MN to handoff seamlessly across different types of wireless networks without any modifications to the existing IP/MIP stack and core network.
