We develop the hierarchical motion refinement scheme using DC syndrome bits to generate high quality side information (SI) for Wyner-Ziv (WZ) frames. Moreover, we estimate local distortion characteristics of an SI frame and encode the SI frame in three coding modes: skip mode for the reliable channel, WZ mode for the medium channel, and intra mode for the unreliable channel. No bit is transmitted in the skip mode. Syndrome bits in the WZ mode are adaptively allocated based on the local distortion characteristics. The H.264 intra coding is performed in the intra mode to recover severely erroneous blocks. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides significantly better rate-distortion performance than the state-of-the-art DISCOVER codec. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
