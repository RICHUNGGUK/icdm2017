The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) could serve as a key enabler for network virtualization and greatly facilitate network discovery and selection in the mobile Internet. In this paper, we study the problem of network discovery and selection in virtualization-based future mobile Internet. We,first advocate a new perspective of network discovery and selection that fits the network virtualization, and then explore application of the SOA principle for realizing this new perspective. We develop a service-oriented system for network discovery and selection in the mobile Internet and propose a scalable information update mechanism for achieving real-time network discovery and selection. Numerical analysis results are also provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed system and mechanism.", "paper_title": "SERVICE-ORIENTED NETWORK DISCOVERY AND SELECTION IN VIRTUALIZATION-BASED MOBILE INTERNET", "paper_id": "WOS:000332130800004"}
