The well-known CSS construction of q-ary AQCs is extended by removing the F-q-linearity requirement as well as the limitation on the type of inner product used. The proposed constructions are called CSS-like constructions and utilize pairs of nested subfield linear codes under one of the Euclidean, trace Euclidean, Hermitian, and trace Hermitian inner products. After establishing some theoretical foundations, best-performing CSS-like AQCs are constructed. Combining some constructions of nested pairs of classical codes and linear programming, many optimal and good pure q-ary CSS-like codes for q is an element of {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} up to reasonable lengths are found. In many instances, removing the F-q-linearity and using alternative inner products give us pure AQCs with improved parameters than relying solely on the standard CSS construction.", "paper_title": "CSS-Like Constructions of Asymmetric Quantum Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000324573500038"}
