The limited availability of radio spectrum enforces Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to have efficient resource management strategies. The goal is to offer services that satisfy the QoS requirements of individual users while achieving all efficient utilization of network resources. This paper considers a resource allocation strategy for cellular networks to be applied during call initiation, handoff and allocation of mobile base stations. Long-term Customer retention becomes a major challenge for MNOs due to severe competition ill the telecommunications industry. Therefore the MNOs need to understand the customer demographics as well as the customer spending behavior ill telecommunications market. Our proposed model combines the information about the customer demographics and usage behavior once the call is initiated. Our hypothesis is that using customer information together with call information yields an efficient customer-oriented resource management strategy. We have performed simulations with different I-C,real-life scenarios. Our results show that our proposed model performs better ill terms of revenue increase when compared to the First-Come First-Serve based approach", "paper_title": "Resource allocation in cellular networks based on marketing preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000274214700003"}
