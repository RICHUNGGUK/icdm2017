The purposes of this study were to investigate the dynamic response characteristics of pedestrian bridges and to develop a human walking force model to assist in the development and design of pedestrian bridges. Human walking force parameters were identified by a genetic algorithm (GA) from experimental forced vibration data. The results of the dynamic response obtained by the GA were in agreement with the experimental results. Therefore, the GA system was useful in the identification of pedestrian walking forces, and from the experimental and calculated results, it is considered that the walking force model identified by the GA is substantially accurate.
