The total {k}-dominating function (T{k}DF) of a graph G is a function f from V(G) to the set {0,1,2,aEuro broken vertical bar,k}, such that for each vertex vaV(G), the sum of the values of all its neighbors assigned by f is at least k. A set {f (1),f (2),aEuro broken vertical bar,f (d) } of pairwise different T{k}DFs of G with the property that for each vaV(G), is called a total {k}-dominating family (T{k}D family) of G. The total {k}-domatic number of a graph G, denoted by , is the maximum number of functions in a T{k}D family. In this paper, we determine the exact values of the total {k}-domatic numbers of wheels and complete graphs, which answers an open problem of Sheikholeslami and Volkmann (J. Comb. Optim., 2010) and completes a result in the same paper.", "paper_title": "The total {k}-domatic number of wheels and complete graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000308969100002"}
