One major issue with spline spaces over T-subdivisions is in providing proper bases (shape functions) for finite element analysis. In this paper, we propose a method for the construction of hierarchical bases of a spline space with highest order smoothness over a consistent hierarchical T-subdivision. Our method is induced by the surjection condition, and this set of basis functions is hierarchically adaptive. We also present a concrete set of non-negative hierarchical bases over a T-subdivision and apply them in adaptive finite element analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
