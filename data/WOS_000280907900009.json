It is based on two major phases: reverse engineering of the supply chain and then forward engineering. It takes advantages of previous enterprise modelling methodologies, especially CIMOSA. The application of the defined methodology on the logistics flow of an industrial company has allowed the integration of the reverse logistics flows in the traditional supply chain, thanks to the modelling of business processes and the flows related to it.
