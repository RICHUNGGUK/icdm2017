It now needs to be looked into from the perspective of involvement of complex digital technologies comprising Computer Systems, Software Programs, Scanners and Printers. The impact and threat of Digitized Document Frauds like counterfeiting of currency, stamps, judicial papers, educational certificates, degrees, cheques, will, property papers, licenses, security passes, badges, immigration and visa documents including the fraudulent generation of, or alteration in, commonly used documents on the economy and society are inevitable and growing; hence our Forensic Readiness is crucial. This work identifies the peculiar characteristics for the development of a non-destructive automated system for efficiently detecting and fixing the origin of the questioned documents by linking them to the scanner and printer used. This in turn may help establish the authorship of the questioned documents. This work is the first general experimental study for investigating Digitized Document Frauds in a forensically sound manner in the light of Locard's principle of information exchange, individuality principle, cause-effect principle and the principle of comparison.
