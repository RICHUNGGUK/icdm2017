We prove that there exists such a labeling for checking a first-order formula with free set variables in the graphs of every class that is nicely locally clique-width-decomposable. This notion generalizes that of a nicely locally tree-decomposable class. The graphs of such classes can be covered by graphs of bounded clique-width with limited overlaps. We also consider such labelings for bounded first-order formulas on graph classes of bounded expansion. Some of these results are extended to counting queries.", "paper_title": "Compact labelings for efficient first-order model-checking", "paper_id": "WOS:000286680500003"}
