The implicit surface is reconstructed based on radial basis functions network from range scattered data. For the property of locality of radial basis function, the method is fast and robust with respect to large data. Furthermore, an adapted K-Means algorithm is used to reduce RBF centers for reconstruction. Experiment results show that the presented approach is helpful in speed improvement and is a good solution for large data reconstruction.", "paper_title": "Surface reconstruction based on radial basis functions network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300181"}
