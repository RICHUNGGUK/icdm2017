We depict the shape of a firework by a 3D mesh. In order to approximate the mesh using evenly distributed points, we propose a fast point sampling method by extending the dual depth peeling algorithm. The samples are then taken as input to shape-constrained fireworks whose physically plausible animations are based on inverse dynamics. We present a highly parallel iterative clustering algorithm to support multi-level fireworks explosion. In order to simulate natural fuzzy fireworks, We impose extra random particles with a parallel random number generator. Several novel intuitive user interfaces are introduced to improve the usability of the system. Experimental results demonstrate the prettiness and efficiency of the proposed approach.
