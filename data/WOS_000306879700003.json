The latter is becoming increasingly harmful to network performance and service availability, while often consuming precious network and processing resources. Coordinated attacks, such as distributed denial-of-services (DDoS), large-scale scans, and worm outbreaks, occur in multiple networks simultaneously and become extremely difficult to detect using an individual detection engine. This paper presents the specification of a new orchestration-based approach to detect, and, as far as possible, to limit the actions of these coordinated attacks. Core to the proposal is a framework that coordinates the receiving of a multitude of alerts and events from detectors, evaluates this input to detect or prove the existence of anomalies, and consequently chooses the best action course. This framework is named Orchestration-oriented Anomaly Detection System (OADS). We also describe an OADS prototype implementation of the proposed infrastructure and analyze initial results obtained through experimentation with this prototype. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
