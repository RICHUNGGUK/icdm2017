To address the problems of interoperability and reproducing previous results, we present an infrastructure that supports interoperability among reverse engineering tools and applications. We present the design of our infrastructure, including the hierarchy of schemas that captures the interactions among graph structures. We also develop and utilize our implementation, which is designed using a GXL-based pipe-filter architecture, to perform a case study that demonstrates the feasibility of our infrastructure.
