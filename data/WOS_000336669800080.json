This trend is more obvious in the telecommunications industry, where companies become increasingly digitalized. Customer churn prediction is a main feature of in modern telecomcommunication CRM systems. This research conducts a real-world study on customer churn prediction and proposes the use of boosting to enhance a customer churn prediction model. Unlike most research that uses boosting as a method to boost the accuracy of a given basis learner, this paper tries to separate customers into two clusters based on the weight assigned by the boosting algorithm. As a result, a higher risk customer cluster has been identified. Logistic regression is used in this research as a basis learner, and a churn prediction model is built on each cluster, respectively. The result is compared with a single logistic regression model. Experimental evaluation reveals that boosting also provides a good separation of churn data; thus, boosting is suggested for churn prediction analysis.", "paper_title": "A Customer Churn Prediction Model in Telecom Industry Using Boosting", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800080"}
