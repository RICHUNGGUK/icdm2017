In a recent paper, the authors claim that they obtain a criterion of existence, uniqueness, and global exponential stability of periodic solution (i.e. stationary oscillation) for a recurrent cellular neural network with time delays and impulses. We point out that the main result of their paper is incorrect, and present a sufficient condition of stationary oscillation fora time-varying recurrent cellular neural networks with time delays and impulses. An numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained result. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
