We model the network as a multi-queue single-server system and derive the service time distribution of head-of-line packets from a Markov Chain of beacon-enable mode in an unsaturated traffic environment. Two transmission schemes of uplink traffic, the non-acknowledged transmission and acknowledged transmission, are studied with probabilistic exponential backoff scheduling algorithm. We obtain the characteristic equation of network throughput and power consumptions of each node in closed form, from which the stable throughput region and bounded mean delay region are specified with respect to the retransmission factor. Furthermore, we also show that the energy consumption of each node can be kept small within the stable throughput region. All analytical results presented in this paper are verified by simulations.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of markov modulated IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enable mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000323924800015"}
