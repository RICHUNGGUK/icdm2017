As consequences of this result we will refine some recent results and we will present the following double inequality of Gamma(q) (x) in terms of the q-digamma function psi(q)(x) for x> 0 and 0 < q < 1: (q;q)(infinity)(1-q)(1-x)(1/logq[psi q(x+log(3/4)/log q)+log(1-q)])(e) < Gamma(q)(x) < (q;q)(infinity)(1-q)(1-xe1/logq[psi q(x)+log(1-q)]).", "paper_title": "Refinement of some inequalities of q-gamma function", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558700006"}
