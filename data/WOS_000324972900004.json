As a consequence of this, the QBD can be used as a direct approximation of the original SFM, in those situations where a discrete state space is an advantage. We treat the unbounded as well as the bounded cases and illustrate the theory with a numerical example. The key fluid generator, Q, and matrix Psi for the SFMs emerge from the QBD calculations in the natural limit. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
