Based on existing experiences to evaluate the applicability of robust watermarking, it is generally agreed that three parameters or requirements, including the quality of watermarked contents, the survivability of extracted watermark after deliberate or unintentional attacks, and the number of bits embedded, need to be considered. However, performances relating to these three parameters conflict with each other, and the trade off must be searched for. In this paper, we take all the three requirements into consideration, and add the flexibility to meet the specific design in implementation. With the aid of genetic algorithm, we design an applicable system that would obtain the good quality, acceptable survivability, and reasonable capacity after watermarking. Simulation results present the effectiveness in practical implementation and possible application of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "The optimized copyright protection system with genetic watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000260518600003"}
