In particular, the two end-points of the DMT of ss-ss full-duplex networks are determined, by showing that the maximum achievable diversity gain is equal to the min-cut and that the maximum multiplexing gain is equal to the min-cut rank, the latter by using an operational connection to a deterministic network. Also included in the paper, are several results that aid in the computation of the DMT of networks operating under amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols. In particular, it is shown that the colored noise encountered in amplify-and-forward protocols can be treated as white for the purpose of DMT computation, lower bounds on the DMT of lower-triangular channel matrices are derived and the DMT of parallel MIMO channels is computed. All protocols appearing in the paper are explicit and rely only upon AF relaying. Half-duplex networks and explicit coding schemes are studied in a companion paper.", "paper_title": "DMT of Multihop Networks: End Points and Computational Tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000300246900021"}
