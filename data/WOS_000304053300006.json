When a candidate sequence is projected into the modeled subspace, a threshold in the Q-residuals confidence allows us to predict whether this sequence is a binding site. Using the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases, we compared our Q-residuals detector with existing PSSM methods. In most of the studied TF binding sites, the Q-residuals detector performs significantly better and faster than MATCH and MAST. As compared with Motifscan, a method which takes into account interdependences, the performance of the Q-residuals detector is better when the number of available sequences is small.", "paper_title": "A subspace method for the detection of transcription factor binding sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000304053300006"}
