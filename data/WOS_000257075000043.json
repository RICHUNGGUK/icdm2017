However, the effectiveness of this technique on large data is reduced by edge clutter In this paper, we present a novel framework to reduce edge clutter, consequently improving the effectiveness of visual clustering. We exploit curved edges and optimize the arrangement of these curved edges by minimizing their curvature and maximizing the parallelism of adjacent edges. The overall visual clustering is improved by adjusting the shape of the edges while keeping their relative order The experiments on several representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Visual clustering in parallel coordinates", "paper_id": "WOS:000257075000043"}
