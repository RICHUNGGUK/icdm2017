The IEC 61499 standard entails a systematic solution to distributed system development. The basic function block (BFB) is the essential construct of the IEC 61499 architecture. However, the execution semantics of the BFB is not well defined by the standard, which leads to a part of the semantic ambiguity. In this paper, we contribute to improve BFB type declaration by proposing a compact interface model and a strict execution control chart (ECC) model. The improved BFB exhibits less semantic ambiguity, is easier to be created, and is more convenient to be applied in a function block network than the standard BFB. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
