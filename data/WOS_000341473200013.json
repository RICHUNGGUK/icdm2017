We propose a new approach to obtain better and more robust circulations of the rolling stock train units, solving the rolling stock assignment while accounting for the train routing problem. Here robustness means that difficult shunting operations are selectively penalized and propagated delays together with the need for human resources are minimized. This new integrated approach provides a huge model. Then, we solve the integrated model using Benders decomposition, where the main decision is the rolling stock assignment and the train routing is in the second level. For computational reasons we propose a heuristic based on Benders decomposition. Computational experiments show how the current solution operated by RENFE (the main Spanish train operator) can be improved: more robust and efficient solutions are obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
