We present Cloud Mirror, a solution that provides bandwidth guarantees to cloud applications based on a new network abstraction and workload placement algorithm. An effective network abstraction would enable applications to easily and accurately specify their requirements, while simultaneously enabling the infrastructure to provision resources efficiently for deployed applications. Prior research has approached the bandwidth guarantee specification by using abstractions that resemble physical network topologies. We present a contrasting approach of deriving a network abstraction based on application communication structure, called Tenant Application Graph or TAG. Cloud Mirror also incorporates a new workload placement algorithm that efficiently meets bandwidth requirements specified by TAGs while factoring in high availability considerations. Extensive simulations using real application traces and datacenter topologies show that Cloud Mirror can handle 40% more bandwidth demand than the state of the art (e.g., the Oktopus system), while improving high availability from 20% to 70%.", "paper_title": "Application-Driven Bandwidth Guarantees in Datacenters", "paper_id": "WOS:000350564600079"}
