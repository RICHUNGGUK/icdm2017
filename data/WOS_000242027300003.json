Applications should hence be able to accommodate their requirements to run on these devices. In this paper, we provide a performance characterization of a video codec based on techniques such as hierarchical vector quantization which trade off complexity and reproduction quality. Comparison with standard codecs shows a remarkable reduction of coding times, such that real-time coding/decoding of video becomes possible even on low-power devices. This complexity reduction is counterbalanced by reproduction quality impairment. Nevertheless, for application such as video-conference, subjective quality seems to be fairly acceptable. Our analysis also quantifies some limitations of low-power devices with current technology. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
