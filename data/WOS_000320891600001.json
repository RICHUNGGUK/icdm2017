We directly compute the throughput of multicast sessions to unify the unicast and broadcast throughputs. We design two multicast schemes based on the so-called ordinary arterial road system and parallel arterial road system, respectively. Correspondingly, we derive the achievable multicast throughput by taking account of all possible cases of n (s) = omega(1) and 1 a parts per thousand currency sign n (d) a parts per thousand currency sign n - 1, rather than only the cases of as in most related works, where n (s) and n (d) denote the number of sessions and the number of destinations of each session, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the network with a general node density , while the models in most related works are either random dense network (RDN) or random extended network (REN) where the density is lambda = n and lambda = 1, respectively, which further enhances the generality of this work. Particularly, for the special case of our results by letting lambda = 1 and , we show that for some regimes of n (d) , the multicast throughputs achieved by our schemes are better than those derived by the well-known percolation-based schemes.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic throughput for large-scale wireless networks with general node density", "paper_id": "WOS:000320891600001"}
