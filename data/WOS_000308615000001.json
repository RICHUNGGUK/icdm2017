In this paper, we investigated how the plasmodium generates new motility and morphology, and found that there are allometric relationships between the cell volume and morphology, and between cell size and cell motility. We further discuss how these relationships are realised, and these relationships are deeply connected to the organism's benefit of being a large-scale unicellular organism.", "paper_title": "Multi-scaled adaptability in motility and pattern formation of the Physarum plasmodium", "paper_id": "WOS:000308615000001"}
