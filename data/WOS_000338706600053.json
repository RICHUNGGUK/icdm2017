While conventional hard computing is run based on crisp values and binary numbers, SC uses soft values and fuzzy sets. In fact, SC technology is capable of address imprecision and uncertainty. The application of SC techniques in the mining industry is fairly extensive and covers a considerable number of applications. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the published work on SC applications in different mining areas. A brief introduction to mining and the general field of SC applications are presented in the first section of the paper. The second section comprises four review chapters. Mining method selection, equipment selection problems and their applications in SC technologies are presented in chapters one and two. Chapter three discusses rock mechanics-related subjects and some of representative SC applications in this field. The last chapter presents rock blasting related SC applications that include blast design and hazards. The final section of the paper comments on the use of SC applications in several mining problems and possible future applications of advanced SC technologies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
