Several fuzzy clustering methods which are able to handle the presence of noise have been proposed. In this work, we propose a robust clustering approach called F-TCLUST based on trimming a fixed proportion of observations that are (\"impartially\") determined by the data set itself. The proposed approach also considers an eigenvalue ratio constraint that makes it a mathematically well-defined problem and serves to control the allowed differences among cluster scatters. A computationally feasible algorithm is proposed for its practical implementation. Some guidelines about how to choose the parameters controlling the performance of the fuzzy clustering procedure are also given. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
