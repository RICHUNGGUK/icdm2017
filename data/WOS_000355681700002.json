We develop a specification framework for real-time systems using Timed I/O Automata as the specification formalism, with the semantics expressed in terms of Timed I/O Transition Systems. We provide constructs for refinement, consistency checking, logical and structural composition, and quotient of specifications-all indispensable ingredients of a compositional design methodology. The theory is implemented in the new tool ECDAR. We present symbolic versions of the algorithms used in ECDAR, and demonstrate the use of the tool using a small case study in compositional verification.", "paper_title": "Real-time specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000355681700002"}
