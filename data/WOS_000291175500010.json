We first present an achievable rate region with OTIC network coding by introducing virtual flow rates in a node. Then we formulate the network utility maximization problem subject to constraints on this achievable rate region, and analyze the complexities of both node- and path-based formulation with no network coding, OTIC network coding, and overhearing network coding. After that, we solve it using dual decomposition and subgradient method. Based on the solution, we present a new queue model, which is able to facilitate the coding operation between two-way commodities, and then propose a backpressure-based cross-layer optimization algorithm with low coding complexity and overhead. Afterwards, we analyze the stability and asymptotical optimality of the proposed cross-layer algorithm by Lyapunov drift technique, and evaluate its performance through extensive simulation. By comparing with the pure routing scheme under both primary and two-hop interference models in an illustrative topology, it is shown that with the proposed joint optimization algorithms, the OTIC network coding can interact adaptively and optimally with other components in different layers and achieve high throughput gain. Simulation of the proposed algorithm in a mesh network with base station and a random ad hoc network justifies that OTIC network coding can obtain considerable throughput gain with low complexity in various kinds of networks.
