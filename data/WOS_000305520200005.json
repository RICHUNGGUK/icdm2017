To timely disseminate end users with fresh content that is relevant to users' interests is a very useful but challenging task. In this paper we design a distributed top-k document dissemination scheme: by inputting query terms and a number k as subscription conditions, end users subscribe to the top-k most relevant documents. When the documents and subscription conditions are distributed, the difficulties are how to forward the personalized top-k documents to the needed users with low forwarding cost. To this end, we propose document forwarding and filtering algorithms on a set of dedicate servers. Experiments based on real query logs and document datasets show the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Distributed top-k full-text content dissemination", "paper_id": "WOS:000305520200005"}
