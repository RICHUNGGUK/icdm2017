In this paper we describe the basis of MBSD and show how it can be used for educational purposes. By extending the classical diagnosis technique to a hierarchical approach, we built a programming learning system to allow a student to debug his program in different abstraction levels.", "paper_title": "Learning to program using hierarchical model-based debugging", "paper_id": "WOS:000361391200006"}
