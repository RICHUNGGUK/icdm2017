Design/methodology/approach - The analysis involves mainly relative observation, Minkowskian observation, Euclidean observation, and fractional calculus. Findings - It is shown that observation with informational invariance, which is a modeling of subjectivity, creates fractal, and self-similarity. Research limitations/implications - This result could have an application to the quantitative analysis of volatility in finance, for instance. Practical implications - The paper supports the use of fractional dynamics to describe human systems. Originality/value - The paper provides practical arguments that may explain why fractals are so pervasive in natural science, and mainly in systems involving human factors.", "paper_title": "Subjective observation via informational invariance results in creation of fractals and self-similar processes of fractional order", "paper_id": "WOS:000281927800007"}
