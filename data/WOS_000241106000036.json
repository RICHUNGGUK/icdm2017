The new framework does not any extra condition but the observations. An information granule matrix can be turned into a fuzzy relation matrix for fuzzy inference. The concept of information granule matrix is firstly formulated. Then information granule matrix is shown by a simple example and discussed from the meaning of mechanism. To display the advantage of the new framework, it is compared with some existed methods. We also use our suggested framework to illustrate the relationship between earthquake magnitude M and isoseismal area S. The result shows that the new model is better than both Linear Regression and BP Network.", "paper_title": "Theory and practice on information granule matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000036"}
