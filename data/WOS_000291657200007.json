The measurement results show that the proposed temperature sensor achieves a maximum temperature error < 0.6A(0)C within the range from 20A(0)C to 50A(0)C. And a phase-frequency tunable clock generator (PFTCG) is designed with frequency and phase tuning capability on the fly. This chip is manufactured on a standard 90 nm CMOS process. The supply voltage to the chip core is globally applied at 0.5 V with 12 power-domain partitions for sleep-active and voltage-scaling management. The transceiver chipset provides maximum 7 Mbps data rate, resulting in 97.7% efficiency improvement in baseband circuit processing.", "paper_title": "A 90 nm All-digital Smart Temperature Sensor with Wireless Body Area Network Baseband Transceiver for Biotelemetry Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000291657200007"}
