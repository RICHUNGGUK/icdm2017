The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology for solving multiattribute decision making (MADM) with both ratings of alternatives on attributes and weights being expressed with IVIF sets. In this methodology, a weighted Euclidean distance between IF sets is defined using weights of IF sets. A pair of nonlinear programming models is constructed based on the concept of the relative closeness coefficients and the distance defined. Two simpler auxiliary nonlinear programming models are further derived to calculate the relative closeness coefficient intervals of alternatives to the IVIF positive ideal solution, which can be used to generate ranking order of alternatives based on the concept of likelihood of interval numbers. The method proposed in this paper is illustrated with a real example.", "paper_title": "Mathematical programming methodology for multiattribute decision making using interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000316940400009"}
