The goal is to cover all the edges in E with a sub-collection of graphs G(1), G(2), ... , G(p), of minimum size, where each G(i) is a subgraph of a cycle over four nodes - a 4-cycle. Since a subgraph of a 4-cycle can cover up to 4 edges, this covering problem is a special case of the unweighted 4-set cover problem. This specialization allows us to obtain an improved approximation guarantee. Whereas the Currently best known approximation algorithm for the general unweighted 4-set cover problem has an approximation ratio of H-4 - 98/195 approximate to 1.58077 (where H-p approximate to In p denotes the p-th harmonic number), we show that, for every epsilon > 0, there is a polynomial time (13/10 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for our problem. Our analysis of the greedy algorithm shows that, when applied to covering a bipartite graph using copies of K-q,K-q bicliques, it returns a feasible solution whose cost is at most (H-q2 - H-q + 1)OPT + 1 where OPT denotes the optimal cost, thus improving the approximation bound for unweighted q(2)-set cover by a factor of almost 2.
