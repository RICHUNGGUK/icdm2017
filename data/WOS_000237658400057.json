The number of rotatable bonds, the hydrogen-bond properties, and a variable belonging to a topological family of descriptors (chi) showed significant roles in the binding process toward alpha(1)-AR. The new model was also compared to a previous pharmacophore for alpha(1)-AR antagonists and a QSAR model for alpha(2)-AR antagonists with the aim of finding common or different key determinants influencing both affinity and selectivity toward alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-AR.", "paper_title": "A genetic-function-approximation-based QSAR model for the affinity of arylpiperazines toward alpha(1) adrenoceptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000237658400057"}
