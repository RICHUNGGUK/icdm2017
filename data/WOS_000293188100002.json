Recognizing large numbers of strings with U-, V-, and U-V-uncertain-strings, including the interleaving of two or more uncertain strings, is important to thoroughly gathering useful information and detecting harmful information. This paper proposes a complete automaton and its high-speed construction algorithm for large-scale U-, V-, and U-V-uncertain multiple strings, including two or more uncertain strings interlaced with one another. The maximum number of parallel complete automation of the V-uncertain string is also given. This paper reveals that there are two kinds of pretermissions, i.e., similarly-connected and interlaced-string pretermissions, and that mistake may appear in the matching of the regular expressions, or states in the automaton may increase in number, if the intersection of the U-uncertain strings sets and the homologous subsequent special point in the U-uncertain strings sets are not eliminated from the whole system.", "paper_title": "Giant complete automaton for uncertain multiple string matching and its high speed construction algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000293188100002"}
