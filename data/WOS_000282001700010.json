The maximum size of an (n, d, w) constant weight code is denoted by A(n, d, w), and codes of this size are said to be optimal. In a computer-aided approach, optimal (n, d, w) constant weight codes are here classified up to equivalence for d = 4, n <= 12; d = 6, n <= 14; d = 8, n <= 17; d = 10, n <= 20 (with one exception); d = 12, n <= 23; d = 14, n <= 26; d = 16, n <= 28; and d = 18, n <= 28. Moreover, several new upper bounds on A(n, d, w) are obtained, leading among other things to the exact values A(12, 4, 5) = 80, A(15, 6, 7) = 69, A(18, 8, 7) = 33, A(19, 8, 7) = 52, A(19, 8, 8) = 78, and A(20, 8, 8) = 130.0 Since A(15, 6, 6) = 70, this gives the first known example of parameters for which A(n, d, w - 1) > A(n, d, w) with w <= n/2. A scheme based on double counting is developed for validating the classification results.", "paper_title": "Classification of Binary Constant Weight Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000282001700010"}
