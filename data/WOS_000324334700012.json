Due to buyer's market and short product lifecycles, many industries are beginning to shift from mass production to mass customization to satisfy their customer requirements. The purpose of this research is to provide a model for enhancing the software component design in order to improve quality and reusability, as well as to reduce costs based on the concept of mass customization and personalization (MC&P). First, quality function deployment (QFD) was used to find out what the customers think, and to determine the core functions and components of the software. The mass customization technology was then used to aggregate the software modules. Thirdly, the software costs for business strategies, purchasing and renting under the customization model were evaluated. Finally, a real case of Eco design software in PSS was illustrated based on the model.", "paper_title": "Mass customization and personalization software development: a case study eco-design product service system", "paper_id": "WOS:000324334700012"}
