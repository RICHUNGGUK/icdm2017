However, until now all analysis of JSQ has been limited to First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) server farms, whereas it is known that web server farms are better modeled as Processor Sharing (PS) server farms. We provide the first approximate analysis of JSQ in the PS server farm model for general job-size distributions, obtaining the distribution of queue length at each queue. To do this, we approximate the queue length of each queue in the server farm by a one-dimensional Markov chain, in a novel fashion. We also discover some interesting insensitivity properties of PS server farms with JSQ routing, and discuss the near-optimality of JSQ. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
