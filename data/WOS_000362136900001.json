Specifically, we discuss the possible requirements for the fuzzy probabilities in order to model the mixed types of uncertainty, and propose algorithms to construct fuzzy probabilities for both independent and dependent datasets. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated using one-dimensional and high-dimensional examples. After that, we apply the proposed uncertainty representation technique to isocontour extraction, and demonstrate its applicability using examples with both structured and unstructured meshes.
