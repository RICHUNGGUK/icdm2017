DC/DC conversion has therefore been an integral part of such systems to resolve this contradiction. On the other hand, asynchronous computational loads, in addition to their potential power-saving capabilities, can be made tolerant to a much wider range of Vdd variance. This may open up opportunities for much more energy efficient methods of power delivery. This article presents in-depth investigations into the behavior and performance of different on-chip power delivery methods driving both asynchronous and synchronous loads directly from a harvester source. A novel power delivery method, which employs a capacitor bank for adaptively storing the energy from power harvesters depending on load and source conditions, is developed. Its advantages, especially when driving asynchronous loads, are demonstrated through comprehensive comparative analysis.", "paper_title": "A Novel Power Delivery Method for Asynchronous Loads in Energy Harvesting Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298958600003"}
