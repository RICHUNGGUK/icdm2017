Our schemes are based on PKBE schemes (called BGW schemes) introduced by Boneh et al. The first two schemes have a similar structure to the BGW schemes. However, our schemes provide more flexible trade-offs between public key size and ciphertext size because the public keys for each subgroup in the BGW schemes are replaced with group identifiers. In addition, we extend our scheme to the hierarchical structure which can efficiently treat the large number of receivers. Our schemes are provably secure under the BDHE assumption in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "Efficient public key broadcast encryption using identifier of receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000237227700015"}
