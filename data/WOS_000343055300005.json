A mathematical model of a data center is developed; this model provides an opportunity for describing a wide class of data center architectures. In terms of this model, a mathematical formulation of the resource allocation problem is given that admits migration of virtual machines and replication of data storage elements. Resource allocation algorithms for data centers with a unified scheduler for all types of resources, algorithms for data centers with specific schedulers for each type of resources, and similar algorithms from the OpenStack platform are compared; the comparison results are presented.", "paper_title": "Comparing various approaches to resource allocation in data centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000343055300005"}
