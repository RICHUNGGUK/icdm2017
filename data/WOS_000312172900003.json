One of the main reasons is that it is difficult for conventional industrial robots to adapt to any sort of change. This paper proposes a robust control strategy to perform an assembly task of inserting a printed circuit board (PCB) into an edge connector socket using a SCARA robot. The task is very challenging because it involves compliant manipulation in which a substantial force is needed to accomplish the insertion operation and there are some dynamic constraints from the environment. Therefore, a robust control algorithm is developed and used to perform the assembly process. The dynamic model of the robotic system is developed and the dynamic parameters are identified. Experiments were performed to validate the proposed method. Experimental results show that the robust control algorithm can deal with parameter uncertainties in the dynamic model, thus achieve better performance than the model based control method. An abnormal case is also investigated to demonstrate that the robust compliant control method can deal with the abnormal situation without damaging the system and assembly parts, while pure position control method may cause damages. This strategy can also be used in other similar assembly processes with compliant applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
