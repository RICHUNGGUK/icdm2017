However, some solutions are often missed by these packages. In this paper, a new algorithm and its implementation called TWS for solving single nonlinear PDEs are presented. TWS is implemented in MAPLE 10. It turns out that, for PDEs whose balancing numbers are not positive integers, TWS works much better than existing packages. Furthermore, TWS obtains more solutions than existing packages for most cases. Program summary Program title: TWS Catalogue identifier: AEAM_v1_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEAM_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 1250 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 78 101 Distribution formal: tar.gz Programming language: Maple 10 Computer: A laptop with 1.6 GHz Pentium CPU Operating system: Windows XP Professional RAM: 760 Mbytes Classification: 5 Nature of problem: Finding the travelling wave solutions to single nonlinear PDEs. Solution method: Based on tanh-function method. Restrictions: The current version of this package can only deal with single autonomous PDEs or ODEs, not systems of PDEs or ODEs. However, the PDEs can have any finite number of independent space variables in addition to time t. Unusual features: For PDEs whose balancing numbers are not positive integers, TWS works much better than existing packages. Furthermore, TWS obtains more solutions than existing packages for most cases. Additional comments: It is easy to use. Running time: Less than 20 seconds for most cases, between 20 to 100 seconds for some cases, over 100 seconds for few cases. References: [1] E.S. Cheb-Teffab, K. von Bulow, Comput. Phys.
