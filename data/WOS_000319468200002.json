Based on their characteristics, 2D images are classified into one of three categories before being processed by the proposed low-complexity algorithm to generate corresponding depth maps. We also extend the 3D depth algorithm to construct a parallel 3D video system. A thread-level superscalar-pipelining approach is developed to parallelize the 3D video system. Experimental results for HD1080 resolution images demonstrate that the algorithm can generate high-quality depth maps with an average reduction in the computational complexity of 98.2 % compared with a conventional algorithm. The parallel 3D video system can achieve a processing speed of 63.66 fps for HD720 resolution video.", "paper_title": "Real-Time 3D Depth Generation for Stereoscopic Video Applications with Thread-Level Superscalar-Pipeline Parallelization", "paper_id": "WOS:000319468200002"}
