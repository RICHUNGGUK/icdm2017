With the help of clustering of ART neural network, the vaccines that image features of data set are extracted effectively, and then an AIN named aiNet is adopted to realize data compression. Finally the memory antibodies optimized by aiNet can be used to recognize each feature of original dataset and to realize fault diagnosis. The experimental results show that the approach is useful and efficient for the fault diagnosis of the multilevel reciprocating compressor.", "paper_title": "ART - Artificial Immune Network and application in fault diagnosis of the reciprocating compressor", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100062"}
