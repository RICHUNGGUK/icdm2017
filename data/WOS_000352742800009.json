This article intends to improve the existing literature and contribute by involving consumers directly in the design of a smart haptic jacket by adding heat, vibration actuators, and by enhancing portability. The proposed system is designed for six basic emotions: love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness, and fear. Also, it can support several interacts such as a hug, poke, tickle or touch. An online survey was designed, based on literature, and conducted on 92 respondents, who gave their opinion about the physiological impact of emotions and interactions on the human body. The results of this survey assisted in the general design and implementation of the system. 86 % of the volunteers who participated in the final experiment expressed their interest in the system and said that the quality of their multimedia experience was improved through use of the jacket. Detailed design architecture is provided, along with the details of the hardware and software used for the implementation.", "paper_title": "Design and development of a user centric affective haptic jacket", "paper_id": "WOS:000352742800009"}
