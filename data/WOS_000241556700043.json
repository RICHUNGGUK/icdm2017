For that purpose a synchronization signal is needed, typically a concurrent ECG recording. Commonly, the reconstruction phase is adapted by the user to the patient-specific heart motion to improve the image quality and thus the diagnostic value. The purpose of our work is to automatically identify the optimal reconstruction phase for cardiac CT imaging with respect to motion artifacts. We provide a solution for a patient- and heart rate-independent detection of the optimal phase in the cardiac cycle which shows a minimum of cardiac movement. We validated our method by the correlation with the reconstruction phase selected visually on the basis of ECG-triggering and used for the medical diagnosis. The mean difference between both reconstruction phases was 12.5% with respect to a whole cardiac motion cycle indicating a high correlation. Additionally, reconstructed cardiac images are shown which confirm the results expressed by the correlation measurement and in some cases even indicating an improvement using the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Rawdata-based detection of the optimal reconstruction phase in ECG-gated cardiac image reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700043"}
