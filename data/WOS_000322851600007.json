However, current private cloud IaaS monitoring solutions are not sufficiently evolved to fulfill this task. Such a monitoring system needs to contemplate all stakeholders and dimensions of a cloud environment, while at the same time hiding irrelevant information. We propose an information model that offers a multi-level view of a private IaaS cloud, separates the concerns between consumers and providers, and enables the correlation of the collected data to have a complete picture of the environment. Using it we have designed a monitoring architecture, and built it using agents based on open-source monitoring platforms. We show the feasibility of our approach through two sample scenarios deployed into a private IaaS cloud. This monitoring provides the capabilities needed to be used in an autonomous management system.", "paper_title": "A Multi-Level Monitoring Approach for the Dynamic Management of Private IaaS Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000322851600007"}
