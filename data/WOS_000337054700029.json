Directly applying 2D texture to such material results in evident artifact because of the issue of synthesizing solid material or patterns usually very difficult. We propose the simple and effective solid synthesis that efficiently utilizes the procedural texture and exemplar-based synthesis seamlessly in one system. Our method generates warping particles and stores them with a few points based on cellular texture. Stereological technique and spring system are used to automatically guide the synthesis procedure. Using adaptive k-means clustering, we can recover color exemplar with high fidelity. We develop vector-represented results to avoid blurring, and GPU-based rendering for real-time synthesis on a common graphics card. Our experiments showed that the proposed approach can generate realistic texturing of solid material with low memory footprint and efficient aggregate-material synthesis in seconds.", "paper_title": "Efficient texture synthesis of aggregate solid material", "paper_id": "WOS:000337054700029"}
