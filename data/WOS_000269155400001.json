Effective defect tolerance techniques are essential to improve the yield of such complex integrated circuits. We propose to achieve fault tolerance by employing redundancy at the core-level instead of at the microarchitecture level. When faulty cores exist on-chip in this architecture, however, the physical topologies of various manufactured chips can be significantly different. How to reconfigure the system with the most effective NoC topology is a relevant research problem. In this paper, we first show that this problem is an instance of a well known NP-complete problem. We then present novel solutions for the above problem, which not only maximize the performance of the on-chip communication scheme, but also provide a unified topology to Operating System and application software running on the processor. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "On Topology Reconfiguration for Defect-Tolerant NoC-Based Homogeneous Manycore Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000269155400001"}
