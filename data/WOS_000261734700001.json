This is the generalization of the common knowledge that removing up/downsampling will not alter perfect reconstruction. The result provides a simple way to implement redundant perfect reconstruction filter banks, which constitute tight frames of l(2)(Z(n)) when iterated. As an example, a quincunx-sampled frame is presented, which is nearly shift-invariant as well as limited-redundancy.", "paper_title": "THE REPLACEABILITY OF SAMPLING MATRIX FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL PERFECT RECONSTRUCTION FILTER BANKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261734700001"}
