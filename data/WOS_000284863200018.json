In fact, people have found that using such an additive model is not always feasible because of the dependence and feedback among the criteria to somewhat different degrees. To solve the issue the analytic network process (ANP) method is proposed by Saaty. The general method is easy and useful for solving the above-mentioned problem. However in ANP procedures, using average method (equal cluster-weighted) to obtain the weighted supermatrix seems to be irrational because there are different degrees of influence among the criteria. Therefore, we intended to propose an integrated multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques which combined with the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and a novel cluster-weighted with ANP method in this paper, in which the DEMATEL method is used to visualize the structure of complicated causal relationships between criteria of a system and obtain the influence level of these criteria. And, then adopt these influence level values as the base of normalization supermatrix for calculating ANP weights to obtain the relative importance. Additionally, an empirical study is illustrated to demonstrate that the proposed method is more suitable and reasonable. By the concept of ideal point, some important conclusions drawn from a practical application can be referred by practitioners. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
