Using a sample that identified sports as their most frequently played video games, a mental models approach was used to test the impact that perceived controller naturalness (traditional controller vs. natural mapping motion capturing controller) had on perceptions of spatial presence, realism, and enjoyment. The results showed that perceived video game realism is a predictor of spatial presence and enjoyment. Furthermore, the results supported predictions that controller naturalness would influence perceived video game realism of graphics and sound. Future research should investigate whether or not these controllers lead to greater presence and enjoyment in different genres of games (e.g., first-person shooters). In addition, future research should consider whether or not these controllers have the ability to prime violent mental models.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Controller Naturalness on Spatial Presence, Gamer Enjoyment, and Perceived Realism in a Tennis Simulation Video Game", "paper_id": "WOS:000296789400002"}
