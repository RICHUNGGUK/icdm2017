Its purpose is to provide a film to private persons free of charge and encourage them to share the film in a public way, so that sharing information becomes a social activity. This research investigated the extent of openness of these events. It examined whether or not people who host Private-Public Screenings actually make them public. Results of a survey among 135 hosts of a recent run of Private-Public Screenings show that people have indeed opened their homes to strangers for the purpose of creating an event and sharing a film.", "paper_title": "When information sharing becomes an event: An example of Private-Public Film Screenings", "paper_id": "WOS:000357282100007"}
