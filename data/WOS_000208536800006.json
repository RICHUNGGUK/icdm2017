The main improvement of this study is the integration of new algorithms for expressive voice analysis, especially the separation of the glottal source and the vocal tract. Realtime synthesis modules have also been refined. These elements have been integrated in an existing digital instrument: the HANDSKETCH 1.X, a bimanual controller. Moreover this digital instrument is compared to existing systems.", "paper_title": "RAMCESS 2.X framework-expressive voice analysis for realtime and accurate synthesis of singing", "paper_id": "WOS:000208536800006"}
