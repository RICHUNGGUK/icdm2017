We focused on fluid-solid boundary conditions for flow acoustic problems especially the simulations of sound waves from moving boundaries. BB methods include link bounce-back, interpolation bounce-back and unified interpolation bounce-back methods. Five IB methods are explicit and implicit direct-forcing (Explicit-IB and Implicit-IB), two kinds of partially saturated computational methods and ghost fluid method. In order to reduce the spurious pressure generated by the fresh grid node changing from solid domain to fluid domain for BB methods and sharp IB methods, we proposed two new kinds of treatments and compared them with two existing ones. Simulations of the benchmark problems prove that the local evolutionary iteration (LI) is the best one in treatments of the fresh nodes. In addition, for standing boundary problems, although BB methods have a little higher accuracy, all the methods have similar accuracy. However, for moving boundary problems, IB methods are more appropriate than BB methods, because IB methods' smooth interpolation of pressure eld produces less disturbing spurious pressure waves. With improved treatments of fresh nodes, BB methods are also acceptable for moving boundary acoustic problems. In comparative tests in respective type, unified interpolation bounce-back with LI, Implicit-IB, and ghost fluid with LI are the best choices.
