Transformations may operate upon many different modelling languages. This diversity of languages and properties indicates the need for a suitably generic framework for model transformation verification, independent of particular model transformation languages, and able to provide support for systematic procedures for verification across a range of languages, and for a range of properties. In this paper we describe the elements of such a framework, and apply this framework to some example transformation verification problems. The paper is novel in covering a wide range of different verification techniques for a wide range of MT languages, within an integrated framework.", "paper_title": "A framework for model transformation verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000347157300008"}
