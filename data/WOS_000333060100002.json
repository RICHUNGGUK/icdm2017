This theory has rich expressive power that allows free use of quantifiers. By reducing to weak second-order logic with one successor (WS1S), we show that the proposed array theory is decidable. Then two natural extensions to the new theory are shown to be undecidable. A translation-based decision procedure for this theory is implemented, and is shown applicable to program verification.", "paper_title": "Array Theory of Bounded Elements and its Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000333060100002"}
