In this paper, we extend the usual Fourier transform to the case of multisequences and derive an upper bound for the joint 2-adic complexity. Furthermore, for the multisequences with p(n)-period, we discuss the relation between sequences and their Fourier coefficients. Based on the relation, we determine a lower bound for the number of multisequences with given joint 2-adic complexity.", "paper_title": "ON THE JOINT 2-ADIC COMPLEXITY OF BINARY MULTISEQUENCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000307453500004"}
