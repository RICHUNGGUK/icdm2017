The number of neurons in the neural network is equal to that of decision variables in the linear programming problem. It is proven that the neural network with a sufficiently high gain is globally convergent to the optimal solution. Its application to linear assignment is discussed to demonstrate the utility of the neural network. Several simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness and characteristics of the neural network.", "paper_title": "A one-layer recurrent neural network with a discontinuous activation function for linear programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000255002900010"}
