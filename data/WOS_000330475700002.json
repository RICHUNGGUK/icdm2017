The backup routing mechanism is used in the peer-to-peer networking to avoid the discontinue downloading file. Each node uses the single nose and the single connection as the downloading source in the peer-to-peer networking in current model. Any source disconnected would be replaced by others when there are multiple sources for requirement. One loses the connection and fails the downloading files one need. The new backup routing would improve the above condition.", "paper_title": "Backup routing firewall mechanism in P2P environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000330475700002"}
