It is one of the basic stringology keystones used as a part of many algorithms in pattern matching, molecular biology, computer-assisted music analysis and others. The paper discusses automata-theoretical background of Iliopoulos's ALL-BORDERS algorithm that finds all borders of a string with don't care symbols. We show that ALL-BORDERS algorithm is a simulator of a finite automaton together with explaining the function of the automaton. We show that the simulated automaton accepts intersection of sets of prefixes and suffixes (and thus a set of borders) of the input string. Last but not least we define approximate borders. Based on the knowledge of the automata background of ALL-BORDERS algorithm we offer an automata-based algorithm that finds approximate borders with Hamming distance. We discuss conditions under which the same principle can be used for other distance measures for which an approximate searching automaton can be constructed.", "paper_title": "Borders and finite automate", "paper_id": "WOS:000240312700007"}
