In addition, in cases where new ontology schemata are developed, considerable experimentation with real data for testing the consistency of classes, properties and entailment rules is required. During the last decade, there has been intense research and development in creating methodologies and tools able to map Relational Databases with the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Although some systems have gained wider acceptance in the Semantic Web community, they either require users to learn a declarative language for encoding mappings or, in case they support friendly user interfaces, they provide limited expressivity. Thereupon, we present RDOTE, a framework for easily transporting data residing in Relational Databases into the Semantic Web. RDOTE is available under GNU/GPL license and it provides friendly graphical user interfaces, as well as enough expressivity for creating automatic and custom RDF dumps of relational data. RDOTE is also compatible with D2RQ and R2RML mapping definitions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
