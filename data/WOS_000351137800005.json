It is based on the facts that the atom in a cavity can induce the generation of modified coherent states (MCSs), which can be shown to be macroscopically distinguishable, and the anti-commutation relation between the Hamiltonian and the z-component Pauli matrix. We show that this scheme is applicable for a class of cavity field states. The application on two-cavity system provides an alternative scheme for preparation of non-local superpositions of quasi-classical light states. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed schemes are efficient.", "paper_title": "Quantum-state transfer between atom and macroscopically distinguishable cavity field in Jaynes-Cummings model", "paper_id": "WOS:000351137800005"}
