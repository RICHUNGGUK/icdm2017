In video from a static camera, or stabilized (or geo-referenced) aerial video data, motion patterns within a scene enable function attribution of scene regions. A \"road\", for example, may be defined as a path of consistent motion-a definition which is valid in a large and diverse set of environments. The spatio-temporal structure tensor field is an ideal representation of the image derivative distribution at each pixel because it can be updated in real time as video is acquired. An eigen-decomposition of the structure tensor encodes both the local scene motion and the variability in the motion. Additionally, the structure tensor field can be factored into motion components, allowing explicit determination of traffic patterns in intersections. Example results of a real time system are shown for an urban scene with both well-traveled and infrequently traveled roads, indicating that both can be discovered simultaneously. The method is ideal in urban traffic scenes, which are the most difficult to analyze using static imagery.", "paper_title": "Detecting roads in stabilized video with the spatio-temporal structure tensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000235219400003"}
