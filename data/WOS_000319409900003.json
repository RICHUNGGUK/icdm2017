Processing these queries is often needed before the desired content can be identified. Processing the request on the mobile devices can quickly sap the limited battery resources. Conversely, processing user queries at remote servers can have slow response times due communication latency incurred during transmission of the potentially large query. We evaluate a network-assisted mobile computing scenario where midnetwork nodes with \"leasing\" capabilities are deployed by a service provider. Leasing computation power can reduce battery usage on the mobile devices and improve response times. However, borrowing processing power from mid-network nodes comes at a leasing cost which must be accounted for when making the decision of where processing should occur. We study the tradeoff between battery usage, processing and transmission latency, and mid-network leasing. We use the dynamic programming framework to solve for the optimal processing policies that suggest the amount of processing to be done at each mid-network node in order to minimize the processing and communication latency and processing costs. Through numerical studies, we examine the properties of the optimal processing policy and the core tradeoffs in such systems.", "paper_title": "Network-Assisted Mobile Computing with Optimal Uplink Query Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000319409900003"}
