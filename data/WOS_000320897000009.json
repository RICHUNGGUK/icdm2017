The wall boundary conditions we proposed for the moment system have the same number of constraints as required based on the characteristic structures of the hyperbolic moment systems. A numerical scheme is then developed to solve the moment system with both initial and boundary values. The scheme is a finite volume method with customized discretization for the convection term based on the DLM theory [14], and an analytical integration formula is given for the collision term. The numerical experiments are carried out on some benchmark problems in the microflows to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the moment method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
