In order to solve this problem, a method based on feature salience is proposed for automatic detection of targets in complex background. Firstly, in this paper, the method utilizes the average absolute difference maximum (AADM) as the dissimilarity measurement between targets and background region to enhance targets. Secondly, minimum probability of error was used to build the model of feature salience. Finally, by computing the realistic degree of features, this method solves the problem of multi-feather fusion. Experimental results show that the algorithm proposed shows better performance with respect to the probability of detection. It is an effective and valuable small target detection algorithm under a complex background.", "paper_title": "INFRARED SMALL TARGET DETECTION ALGORITHM BASED ON FEATURE SALIENCE AND MULTI-FEATURES FUSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000289156600008"}
