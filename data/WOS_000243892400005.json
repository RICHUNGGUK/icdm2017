To solve the image restoration problem, we use the surrogate constraint methods that can work efficiently for large problems. Among variants of the surrogate constraint method, we consider a basic method performing a single block projection in each step and a coarse-grain parallel version making simultaneous block projections. Using several state-of-the-art partitioning strategies and adopting different communication models, we develop competing parallel implementations of the two methods. The implementations are evaluated based on the per iteration performance and on the overall performance. The experimental results on a PC cluster reveal that the proposed parallelization schemes are quite beneficial. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
