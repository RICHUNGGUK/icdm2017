ITS is fast becoming a reality, favored in their development by the use of the interne. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the feasibility of road-traffic management systems, using the internet as the communication link. Design/methodology/approach - A literature review is presented to give a background in the progressive role that ITS and road safety and control applications play in society. The combination of internet and the ITS architecture is covered, and an electronic prototype providing web services for road-traffic management is designed as an example. The scope of road traffic security research is extensive, and the use of artificial vision systems in road-traffic analysis (technology which is on the basis of the developed prototype) is also discussed. The hardware and software characteristics of the prototype are defined. Findings - The paper provides new insights into the use of the internet for road-traffic management applications. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to one particular road-traffic management system. Results could be extended if more real equipments were analyzed. Also, end-users' perception and their acceptance of the new technology could be examined using an information system theory like the technology acceptance model. Originality/value - The paper shows the utility of the interne in the development of novel ITS.", "paper_title": "Internet in the development of future road-traffic control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277850000004"}
