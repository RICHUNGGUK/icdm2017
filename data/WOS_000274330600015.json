The used principle is similar to the principle of source degeneration, but the additional device is horizontally added, in parallel with the input transistors, which overcame the constraints on common mode range and supply voltage and allow low voltage operation. SPICE simulations using 0.35 mu m CMOS process and a bias current of 10 mu A, show that for less than 1% of transconductance variation, the linear range is up to 0.35 V(pp) in comparison to 0.1 V(pp) for source-degenerated pair, and 0.01 V(pp) for conventional differential pair, under the same biasing current and geometrical dimensions.", "paper_title": "An alternative to source degeneration of CMOS differential pair", "paper_id": "WOS:000274330600015"}
