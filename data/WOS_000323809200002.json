Although, in the nineties, a dozen of papers were written on the ARNN model, some introducing computation via neural nets with real weights and some introducing non-deterministic and stochastic neural nets, it seems that no one noticed such a relativisation, which makes the ARNN an interesting but restricted model of computation.
