In this paper, we provide an overview of many curve-skeleton applications and compile a set of desired properties of such representations. We also give a taxonomy of methods and analyze the advantages and drawbacks of each class of algorithms.", "paper_title": "Curve-skeleton properties, applications, and algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000244895300011"}
