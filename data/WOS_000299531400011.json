In order to succeed in the exploitation of biometric applications over the world, it is needed to make research on power-efficient and cost-effective computational platforms able to deal with those demanding image and signal operations carried out in the biometric processing. The present work deals with the evaluation of alternative system architectures to those existing PC (personal computers), HPC (high-performance computing) or GPU-based (graphics processing unit) platforms in one specific scenario: the physical implementation of an AFAS (automatic fingerprint-based authentication system) application. The development of automated fingerprint-based personal recognition systems in the way of compute-intensive and real-time embedded systems under SoPC (system-on-programmable-chip) devices featuring one general-purpose MPU (microprocessor unit) and one run-time reconfigurable FPGA (field programmable gate array) proves to be an efficient and cost-effective solution. The provided flexibility, not only in terms of software but also in terms of hardware thanks to the programmability and run-time reconfigurability performance exhibited by the suggested FPGA device, permits to build any application by means of hardware-software co-design techniques. The parallelism and acceleration performances inherent to the hardware design and the ability of reusing hardware resources along the application execution time are key factors to improve the performance of existing systems.", "paper_title": "FPGA-based Personal Authentication Using Fingerprints", "paper_id": "WOS:000299531400011"}
