Secondly, evaluations of students' experiences of this process were undertaken to determine if this self-assessment method was a positive experience for them in gaining insights into the quality of their group's presentation. Participants were students undertaking a first year course in a bachelor of business degree within an Australian university. Students were surveyed twice, once prior to group formation to determine their previous oral group presentation experiences and then after viewing their presentations. Data from survey items assessing students' perspectives on the utility of viewing their video presentations, within their group Wikis, revealed that watching the video of their group presentation was an effective method of feedback and could improve both group and individual performance in the future. Further, content analysis of open ended survey questions and focus groups identified that students were highly engaged in the activity and after reviewing and reflecting on their video recording had deeper insights and raised awarenesses of making group presentations. Students identified that this experience would benefit any future group oral presentations they made. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
