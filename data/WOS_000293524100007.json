In that context we introduce a full-reference 3D mesh quality metric; this metric can compare two meshes with arbitrary connectivity or sampling density and produces a score that predicts the distortion visibility between them; a visual distortion map is also created. Our metric outperforms its counterparts from the state of the art, in term of correlation with mean opinion scores coming from subjective experiments on three existing databases. Additionally, we present an application of this new metric to the improvement of rate-distortion evaluation of recent progressive compression algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Multiscale Metric for 3D Mesh Visual Quality Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000293524100007"}
