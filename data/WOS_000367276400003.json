Zoom structures formalize a static depository of knowledge of a discipline of knowledge/science and in particular they allow one to deal with the hierarchical nature of biology. Exploration systems combine reaction systems with zoom structures allowing one to explore a discipline of science such as biology taking into account both its static and dynamic aspects. In order to facilitate applications of exploration systems, in this paper we consider (i) a subclass of zoom structures called standard zoom structures as well as (ii) augmenting both zoom structures and reaction systems by total ordering of their domains (background sets).
