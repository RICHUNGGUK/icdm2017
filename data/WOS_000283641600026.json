The difficulties include non-standard software and hardware peripherals from vendors, interoperability problems between different operating systems as well as lack of expertise in terms of low-level programming for RFID (i.e. steep learning curve). In order to address these difficulties, a reusable RFIDTM API (RFID Tracking & Monitoring Application Programmable Interface) for heterogeneous RFID system has been designed and implemented. The API has been successfully employed in a number of application prototypes including tracking of inventories as well as human/object tracking and tagging. Here, the module has been tested on a number of different types and configuration of active and passive readers including that LF and UHF Readers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
