The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of different implant lengths on the stress distribution around osseointegrated implants under a static loading condition in the anterior maxilla using a three-dimensional finite element analysis. The diameter of 4.0mm external type implants of different lengths (8.5mm, 10.0mm, 11.5mm, 13.0mm, 15.0mm) was used in this study. The anterior maxilla was assumed to be D3 bone quality. All the material was assumed to be homogenous, isotropic and linearly elastic. The implant-bone interface was constructed using a rigid element for simulating the osseointegrated condition. Then, 176N of static force was applied on the middle of the palatoincisal line angle of the abutment at a 120 degrees angle to the long axis of abutment. The von Mises stress value was measured with an interval of 0.25mm along the bone-implant interface. Incremental increase in implant length causes a gradual reduction of maximum and average von Mises stress at the labial portion within the implant. In the bone, higher stress was concentrated within cortical bone area and more distributed at the labial cortex, while cancellous bone showed relatively low stress concentration and even distribution. An increase in implant length reduced stress gradients at the cortical peri-implant region. Implant length affects the mechanisms of load transmission to the osseointegrated implant. On the basis of this study the biomechanical stress-based performance of implants placed in the anterior maxilla improves when using longer implants.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional numerical simulation of stress induced by different lengths of osseointegrated implants in the anterior maxilla", "paper_id": "WOS:000326070800003"}
