When the wheel slip is not between the optimal limits during braking, the desired tire-road friction force cannot be achieved, which influences braking distance, the loss in steerability and maneuverability of the vehicle. In this paper, the new approach, based on dynamic neural networks, has been employed for improving of the longitudinal wheel slip control. This approach is based on dynamic adaptation of the brake actuation pressure, during a braking cycle, according to the identified maximum adhesion coefficient between the wheel and road. The brake actuated pressure was adjusted on the level which provides the optimal longitudinal wheel slip versus the brake actuated pressure selected by a driver, the current vehicle speed, load conditions, the brake interface temperature and the current value of the wheel slip. The dynamic neural network has been used for modeling of a nonlinear functional relationship between the brake actuation pressure and the longitudinal wheel slip during a braking cycle. It provided preconditions for control of the brake actuation pressure based on the wheel slip change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
