In this paper we address the problem of coalition formation among self-interested agents in superadditive task-oriented domains. We assume that each agent has some \"structure,\" i.e., that it can be described by the values taken by a set of m nonnegative attributes that represent the resources w each agent is endowed with. By defining the coalitional value as a function V of w, we prove a sufficient condition for the existence of a stable payment configuration-in the sense of the core-in terms of certain properties of V. We apply these ideas to a simple case that can be described by a linear program and show that it is possible to compute for it-in polynomial time-an optimal task allocation and a stable payment configuration.", "paper_title": "Coalitions among intelligent agents: A tractable case", "paper_id": "WOS:000235370400003"}
