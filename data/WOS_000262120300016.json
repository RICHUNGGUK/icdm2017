Most of the studies in the R&S have focused on a single measure of system performance. In many practical situations, however, we need to select systems based on multiple criteria. A solution is called Pareto optimal if there exists no other solution which is better in all criteria. This paper discusses extending a R&S procedure to select a Pareto set containing non-dominated systems. Computational results show that the proposed procedures are effective in obtaining non-dominated systems.", "paper_title": "A multi-objective selection procedure of determining a Pareto set", "paper_id": "WOS:000262120300016"}
