Further, we present a generalized FP-tree in an applied context. This assists in better understanding existing association-rule-mining strategies. In addition, we discuss and analyze experimentally the generalized k-FP-tree, and demonstrate that the generalized FP-tree reduces the computation costs significantly. This study will be useful to many association analysis tasks where one must provide really interesting rules and develop efficient algorithms for identifying association rules.", "paper_title": "On data structures for association rule discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000244527600001"}
