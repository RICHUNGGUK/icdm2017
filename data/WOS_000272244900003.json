The interoperability goal was met in two phases: firstly, agreeing on a common authorization query interface and protocol with an associated profile that ensures standardized use of attributes and obligations; and secondly implementing, testing, and deploying on OSG and EGEE, middleware that supports the interoperability protocol and profile. The activity has involved people from OSG, EGEE, the Globus Toolkit project, and the Condor project. This paper presents a summary of the agreed-upon protocol, profile and the software components involved.", "paper_title": "Definition and Implementation of a SAML-XACML Profile for Authorization Interoperability Across Grid Middleware in OSG and EGEE", "paper_id": "WOS:000272244900003"}
