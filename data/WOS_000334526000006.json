We have found that most existing segmentation methods are not successful on histopathology images, which prompted us to investigate segmentation of a broader class of images, namely those without clear edges between the regions to be segmented. We model these images as occlusions of random images, which we call textures, and show that local histograms are a useful tool for segmenting them. Based on our theoretical results, we describe a flexible segmentation framework that draws on existing work on nonnegative matrix factorization and image deconvolution. Results on synthetic texture mosaics and real histology images show the promise of the method.", "paper_title": "Images as Occlusions of Textures: A Framework for Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000334526000006"}
