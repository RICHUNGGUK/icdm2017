For this, outflow pressure waveforms were computed from patient-specific spirometries by means of a method that allows to compute the peripheral impedance of the truncated bronchial generation, modelling the lungs as fractal networks. Intratracheal flow pattern was analysed under different scenarios. First, results obtained using different outflow conditions were compared for the healthy trachea in order to assess the importance of using impedance-based conditions. The resulted intratracheal pressures were affected by the different boundary conditions, while the resulted velocity field was unaffected. Impedance conditions were finally applied to the diseased and the stented trachea. The proposed impedance method represents an attractive tool to compute physiological pressure conditions that are not possible to extract in vivo. This method can be applied to healthy, pre- and post-operatory tracheas showing the possibility of predicting, through numerical simulation, the flow and the pressure field before and after surgery.", "paper_title": "CFD analysis of the human airways under impedance-based boundary conditions: application to healthy, diseased and stented trachea", "paper_id": "WOS:000314564900008"}
