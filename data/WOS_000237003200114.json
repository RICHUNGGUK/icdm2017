Due to the complexity of the algorithms, the size of the data sets, and the limitations of the medium printed paper it is usually not possible to report all the minutiae of the data processing and statistical computations. Like the critical assessment of a mathematical proof it should be possible to check the software behind a complex data analysis. To achieve reproducible calculations and to offer an extensible Computational framework the tool of a compendium is discussed.", "paper_title": "Reproducible statistical analysis in microarray profiling studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200114"}
