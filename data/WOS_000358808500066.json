However, as for printed QR barcode, there is no actual research achievement published. This paper studies anti-counterfeiting techniques for printed QR barcode. The primary performance parameter, decoding rate of QR barcode as well as detection rate of digital watermark, is defined and discussed. A multi-channel robust watermarking scheme based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is proposed. In the watermarking scheme, the DWT domain is divided into non-overlapping rectangular areas as called watermarking channels. Channel watermark as well as anti-counterfeiting watermark is embedded into each watermarking channel. At the stage of anti-counterfeiting watermark extracting, the distortion rates of the watermarking channels are estimated by channel watermark. Based on the distortion rates, anti-counterfeiting watermark is computed by a well-designed linear estimation algorithm, whose validity is theoretically proved by analyzing anti-counterfeiting watermark bit error. The experimental results show that the detection rate of anti-counterfeiting watermark is greatly improved with the proposed scheme, and that we can correctly extract anti-counterfeiting watermark from printed QR image by choosing reasonable parameters.
