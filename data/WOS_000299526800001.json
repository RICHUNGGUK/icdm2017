The anticipation of a large penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) into the market brings up many technical problems that are highly related to industrial information technologies within the next ten years. There is a need for an in-depth understanding of the electrification of transportation in the industrial environment. It is important to consolidate the practical and the conceptual knowledge of industrial informatics in order to support the emerging electric vehicle (EV) technologies. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the electrification of transportation in an industrial environment. In addition, it provides a comprehensive survey of the EVs in the field of industrial informatics systems, namely: 1) charging infrastructure and PHEV/PEV batteries; 2) intelligent energy management; 3) vehicle-to-grid; and 4) communication requirements. Moreover, this paper presents a future perspective of industrial information technologies to accelerate the market introduction and penetration of advanced electric drive vehicles.", "paper_title": "A Survey on the Electrification of Transportation in a Smart Grid Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000299526800001"}
