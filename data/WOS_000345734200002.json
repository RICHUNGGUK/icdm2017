Since structure determines physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles, the development of a reliable method for searching the stable structures of Pt-Pd alloy nanoparticles has become of increasing importance to exploring the origination of their properties. In this article, we have employed the particle swarm optimization algorithm to investigate the stable structures of alloy nanoparticles with fixed shape and atomic proportion. An improved discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm has been proposed and the corresponding scheme has been presented. Subsequently, the swap operator and swap sequence have been applied to reduce the probability of premature convergence to the local optima. Furthermore, the parameters of the exchange probability and the 'particle' size have also been considered in this article. Finally, tetrahexahedral Pt-Pd alloy nanoparticles has been used to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. The calculated results verify that the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm has superior convergence and stability compared with the traditional one. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
