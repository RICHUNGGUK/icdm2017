[Nonlinear regression models based on SMSN distributions. J. Korean Statist. Soc. 2011;40:115-124]. This novel class of models provides a useful generalization of the symmetrical NLM [Vanegas LH, Cysneiros FJA. Assessment of diagnostic procedures in symmetrical nonlinear regression models. Comput. Statist. Data Anal. 2010;54:1002-1016] since the random terms distributions cover both symmetric as well as asymmetric and heavy-tailed distributions such as the skew-t, skew-slash, skew-contaminated normal distributions, among others. Motivated by the results given in Garay et al. [Nonlinear regression models based on SMSN distributions. J. Korean Statist. Soc. 2011;40:115-124], we presented a score test for testing the homogeneity of the scale parameter and its properties are investigated through Monte Carlo simulations studies. Furthermore, local influence measures and the one-step approximations of the estimates in the case-deletion model are obtained. The newly developed procedures are illustrated considering a real data set.", "paper_title": "Statistical diagnostics for nonlinear regression models based on scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000335214900009"}
