Random access memory (RAM) is one good candidate for the application of 3-D integration technology. However, yield will be a key challenge for the volume production of 3-D RAMs. In this paper, we present yield-enhancement techniques for 3-D RAMs. An interdie redundancy scheme is proposed to improve the yield of 3-D RAMs. Three stacking flows with respect to different bonding technologies for 3-D RAMs with interdie redundancy are proposed as well. Finally, a built-in self-repair (BISR) scheme is proposed to perform the repair of 3-D RAMs with interdie redundancies. The BISR circuits in two stacked dies can work together to allocate interdie redundancies. Simulation results show that the proposed yield-enhancement techniques can effectively improve the yield of 3-D RAMs.", "paper_title": "A Built-In Self-Repair Scheme for 3-D RAMs With Interdie Redundancy", "paper_id": "WOS:000317001200009"}
