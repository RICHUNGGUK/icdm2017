In this paper, a new methodology for MVM including different types of matrices, i.e. Regular, Toeplitz and Bisymmetric Toeplitz, is presented in detail. This methodology achieves higher execution speed than the software state of the art library, ATLAS (speedup from 1.2 up to 4.4), and other conventional software implementations, for both general (SIMD unit is used) and embedded processors. This is achieved by fully and simultaneously exploiting the combination of software and hardware parameters as one problem and not separately.", "paper_title": "A Methodology for Speeding up MVM for Regular, Toeplitz and Bisymmetric Toeplitz Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000343161400002"}
