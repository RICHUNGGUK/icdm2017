This work substantially generalizes earlier work on fractal tops. The approach involves fractal geometry, chaotic dynamics, and an interplay between discrete and continuous representations. The underlying mathematics is established and some applications to digital imaging are described and exemplified.", "paper_title": "How to Transform and Filter Images Using Iterated Function Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298370600002"}
