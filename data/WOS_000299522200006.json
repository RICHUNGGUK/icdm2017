Players are now expecting a more personalised gaming experience as personalisation has begun to filter into most games and not just MMOGs. In this paper, we explain how players of MMOGs can enjoy a ubiquitous and personalised gaming experience anywhere, on any device, and on any network with Artemis. MPEG-7 is not traditionally used for modelling games; however, Artemis adopts MPEG-7 for modelling the player, their device and the game, in conjunction with genetic algorithms for personalising the game, where possible.", "paper_title": "Personalise your massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) with Artemis", "paper_id": "WOS:000299522200006"}
