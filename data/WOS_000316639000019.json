These envelopes are obtained by identifying polyhedral subdivisions of the hyper-rectangle over which the envelopes can be constructed easily. In particular, we use these techniques to derive, in closed-form, the concave envelopes of concave-extendable supermodular functions and the convex envelopes of disjunctive convex functions.", "paper_title": "Explicit convex and concave envelopes through polyhedral subdivisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000316639000019"}
