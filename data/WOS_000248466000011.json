However, it influences from other side on the aggregate availability of resources. Each mobile station in soft handoff uses multiple resources in both directions (uplink and downlink) to transmit/receive same data to/from each cell the mobile station connects with. Furthermore, these connections themselves will increase the interference in those cells. This paper suggests a mechanism to reduce the handoff failure and call blocking by reducing the interference arising from multiple connections of a user in soft handoff. Simulation results show that the handoff failure and call blocking can be reduced if we integrated this mechanism in the scheme of resource allocation. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
