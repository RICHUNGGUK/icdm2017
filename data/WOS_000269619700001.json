The authors propose a monitoring method based on the cellular model to monitor human activities in the indoor environment. The measured area of an indoor room is divided into several unit areas in which each unit area is considered as a simple cell in the cellular model. A rectangular box is then used to group those neighbouring active cells into a unit to represent a moving object. Since people usually walk without a fixed style and the colour of objects may be similar to that of the background, the distribution of active cells is often uncertain and incomplete. The authors therefore apply the gray relational analysis to detect and track multiple moving objects. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The experimental results show that the proposed system is highly effective in verifying and tracking multiple objects in real time.", "paper_title": "Vision-based monitoring method using gray relational analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000269619700001"}
