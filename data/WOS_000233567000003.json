Digital self-calibration is employed to compensate gain mismatch and offset between time-interleaved channels as well as mismatches arise from a single ADC channel. A timing skew-insensitive parallel S/H circuit is utilized in order to avoid timing skew between parallel ADC channels. The ADC, fabricated in a 0.35-mu m BiCMOS (Site) takes an area of 10.2 mm(2), reaches an ENOB of 11.4 bits with a 79.9-dB SFDR at 192.5-MHz input and draws 1.4 W from a 3.0-V supply.", "paper_title": "A 14b 100-MS/s time-interleaved A/D converter", "paper_id": "WOS:000233567000003"}
