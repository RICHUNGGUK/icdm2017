Successive interference cancellation, which allows one to recover additional information from otherwise lost collision signals, has recently been combined with tree algorithms with blocked access [Y. Yu, G.B. Giannakis, SICTA: A 0.693 contention tree algorithm using successive interference cancellation, in: INFOCOM 2005. 24th Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies, Miami, USA, 2005, pp. 1908-1916], providing a substantially higher maximum stable throughput (MST): 0.693 for Poisson arrivals, given an infinite number of memory locations for storing signals. We propose a novel tree algorithm for a similar problem, but with two relaxed model assumptions: free access is supported and a single signal memory location suffices. A study of the maximal stable throughput of this algorithm is provided using matrix analytical methods; as a result, an MST of 0.5698 for Poisson arrivals is achieved. Our methodology also allows us to investigate the MST when the multiple access channel is subject to Markovian arrival processes.
