In order to provide an efficient method to research modeling and simulation of UUV formation in the marine environment, the novel approach based on Multi-Agent Interaction Chain was proposed for the UUV formation system. Firstly, Multi-Agent Interaction Chain was analyzed, which mainly considered task and role of UUV in the formation, and the overall modeling process of UUV formation system based on Multi-Agent Interaction Chain was established. Then, the static structure of Multi-Agent Interaction Chain was researched focusing on Hybrid UUV-Agent model structure from the UUV-Agent State-Set and UUV-Agent Rule-Base which were the two aspects to strengthen reliability of interaction chain; the dynamic mechanism of Multi-Agent Interaction Chain was designed, which was focused on collaboration model and communication model through the Adaptive Dynamic Contract Net Protocol and KQML/XML/RTI. Finally, three experiments were established to verify the validity and effectiveness of proposed modeling approach for UUV formation system. Simulation results show the proposed model has good performance, which has important theoretical innovation and application prospects.", "paper_title": "UUV formation system modeling and simulation research based on Multi-Agent Interaction Chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000365772300008"}
