Circuit model and its formula are derived. With the proposed RWG-DCI-PEEC method, signal integrity (SI) simulations of high speed differential traces on PCB are carried out in time domain, including response of time domain reflectometry (TDR) and eye diagram of worst case analysis, and are compared with experimental measurements and other commercial softwares. The correctness and effectiveness of our proposed method are verified. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
