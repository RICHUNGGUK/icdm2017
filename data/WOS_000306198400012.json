However, determining the access structure of the secret sharing scheme based on a linear code is a very difficult problem. In this work, we provide a method to construct a class of two-weight linear codes over finite rings. Based on the two-weight codes, we present an access structure of a secret sharing scheme.", "paper_title": "Secret Sharing Schemes from Linear Codes over Finite Rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000306198400012"}
