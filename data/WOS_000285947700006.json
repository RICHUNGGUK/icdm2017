A new logical variant called epsilon S is proposed that captures much of the expressive power of the original, but where certain technical results are much more easily proved. This is illustrated using two existing non-trivial results: the determinacy of knowledge theorem of Reiter and the regression theorem, which reduces reasoning about the future to reasoning about the initial situation. Furthermore, we show the correctness of our approach by embedding ES in Reiter's situation calculus. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
