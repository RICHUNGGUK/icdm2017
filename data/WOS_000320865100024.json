In some previous papers, the relationship between cloning templates is closer and stronger. Therefore, some methods are used to make the relationship loose. First, some theories on stability of cellular neural networks are given. Then, associative memories based on cellular neural networks are given on the basis of these theories. In addition, a design procedure of associative memories is introduced. Finally, some examples are given to verify the theoretical results and design procedures.", "paper_title": "Analysis of associative memories based on stability of cellular neural networks with time delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000320865100024"}
