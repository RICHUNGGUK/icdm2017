Previous work in this area has mainly focused on how to set up a small virtual backbone for high efficiency, which is modelled as the minimum Connected Dominating Set (CDS) problem. In this paper we consider how to establish a small virtual backbone to balance efficiency and fault tolerance. This problem can be formalized as the minimum m-connected k-tuple dominating set problem, which is a general version of minimum CDS problem with m = 1 and k = 1. We propose three centralized algorithms with small approximation ratios for small m and improve the current best results for small k. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
