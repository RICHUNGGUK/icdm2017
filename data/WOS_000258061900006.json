One of the main approaches to this issue is dealing with it as a classification problem. Among the range of instruments available, we focus our attention on the Evolutionary Nearest Neighbor Classifier (ENPC). In this work we assess the performance of the ENPC comparing it to six alternatives. The results suggest that this algorithm might be considered a good choice.", "paper_title": "Early bankruptcy prediction using ENPC", "paper_id": "WOS:000258061900006"}
