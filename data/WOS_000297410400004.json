The number of such pairings is denoted by mu(B, A). We investigate the quantity mu(B, A) for A and B, two finite subsets of an arbitrary group satisfying 1 is not an element of B, vertical bar A vertical bar = vertical bar B vertical bar, and the fact that the order of every element of B is >= vertical bar B vertical bar + 1. Extending earlier results, we show that in this case, mu(B, A) is never equal to 0. Furthermore we prove an explicit lower bound on mu(B, A) in terms of vertical bar B vertical bar and the cardinality of the group generated by B, which is valid unless A and B have a special form explicitly described. In the case A = B, our bound holds unless B is a translate of a progression.", "paper_title": "Counting Certain Pairings in Arbitrary Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000297410400004"}
