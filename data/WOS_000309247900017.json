In contrast to conventional methods, our approach determines the saliency by filtering out redundant contents instead of measuring their significance. To analyze the redundancy of self-repeating spatial structures, we propose a non-local self-similarity based procedure. The result redundancy coefficient is used to compensate the Shannon entropy, which is based on statistics of pixel intensities, to generate the bottom-up saliency map of the visual input. Experimental results on three publicly available databases demonstrate that the proposed model is highly consistent with the subjective visual attention. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
