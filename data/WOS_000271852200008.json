Warehousing and mining this data is an essential problem with great potential benefits for inventory management, object tracking, and product procurement processes. Since RFID tags can be used to identify each individual item, enormous amounts of location-tracking data are generated. With such data, object movements can be modeled by movement graphs, where nodes correspond to locations and edges record the history of item transitions between locations. In this study, we develop a movement graph model as a compact representation of RFID data sets. Since spatiotemporal as well as item information can be associated with the objects in such a model, the movement graph can be huge, complex, and multidimensional in nature. We show that such a graph can be better organized around gateway nodes, which serve as bridges connecting different regions of the movement graph. A graph-based object movement cube can be constructed by merging and collapsing nodes and edges according to an application-oriented topological structure. Moreover, we propose an efficient cubing algorithm that performs simultaneous aggregation of both spatiotemporal and item dimensions on a partitioned movement graph, guided by such a topological structure.", "paper_title": "Modeling Massive RFID Data Sets: A Gateway-Based Movement Graph Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000271852200008"}
