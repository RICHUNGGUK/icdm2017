Since RFID has advantages of a long life, safe and free from environmental constraints, RFID EPC can achieve benefits such as saving manpower costs, expressing logistics management, reducing man-made orders and decreasing excess inventory. The paper is to explore the security issues of the RFID EPC Class 1 Generation 2. RFID transmits information wirelessly, therefore, information can be captured. In order to protect data privacy, many scholars have proposed their own ways to improve. This paper has extended the scheme of Duc et al., and made a more efficient version.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL FOR RFID SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711600007"}
