Conventional load forecasting techniques, including time series methods and stochastic methods, are widely used by electric power companies for forecasting load profiles. However, their accuracy is limited under some conditions. In this paper, neural networks have been successfully applied to load forecasting. Forecasting model with Neural Networks is set up based on the analysis of the characteristics of electric power load, and it works well even with rapidly changing weather conditions. This paper also proposes a novel method to improve the generalization ability of the Neural Networks, and this leads to further increasing accuracy of load forecasting.", "paper_title": "Study of neural networks for Electric Power Load Forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000185"}
