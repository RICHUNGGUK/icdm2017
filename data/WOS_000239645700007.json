However, the analysis performed so far has always been restricted to memoryless channels. Here, we consider the case of a bosonic Gaussian channel with memory, and show that the classical capacity can be significantly enhanced by employing entangled input symbols instead of product symbols.", "paper_title": "Information transmission via entangled quantum states in Gaussian channels with memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000239645700007"}
