However, there is still a need for application systems to be implemented for support of daily business operations. However, these systems may be developed or acquired at different times from different vendors, and thus may be incompatible with each other. Because of this, a number of standards and technologies have been addressed to draw an integral vision in the field of enterprise application integration (EAI). Emerging Web Services has now promised enterprises that they can deploy new digital services faster than ever before by integrating the exisiting application systems. By integrating in this fashion, operational processes of heterogeneous systems are seamlessly controlled and integrated through a meta-processes. This integration could preserve the autonomy of original systems, as well as enhance the flexibility and agility of the business. The researchers who constructed this study have attempted to explore in detail the design of these meta-processes. Also the researchers have proposed a conflict detecting mechanism (CDM) in order to aid process designers. A prototype with a case study has been developed to evaluate the feasibility of the CDM, and the results show that it is useful in guiding process designers to correct and improve their designed meta-processes.
