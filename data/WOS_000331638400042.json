As a result, the corresponding control performance is improved, but such case may lead to high production costs. In this paper, a new tuning methodology for multiple PID controllers from an economic point of view by incorporating multiple performance measures and production costs based on nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is presented. A model of nonlinear thermodynamic laws between numerous system variables affecting the greenhouse climate is formulated. The proposed tuning scheme is tested through step responses for greenhouse climate control by minimizing the indices of overall performance and production cost in a simulation experiment. The results show that the controllers by tuning the gain parameters can achieve good control performance at a relatively low cost. Maybe it is a quite effective and promising tuning method by using this method in the complex greenhouse production.", "paper_title": "NSGA-II-based nonlinear PID controller tuning of greenhouse climate for reducing costs and improving performances", "paper_id": "WOS:000331638400042"}
