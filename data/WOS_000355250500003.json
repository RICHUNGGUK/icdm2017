This is challenging for low-cost resource-constrained embedded devices, with an attacker having physical access to the integrated circuit (IC). Physically, unclonable functions are an emerging technology in this market. They extract bits from unavoidable IC manufacturing variations, remarkably analogous to unique human fingerprints. However, post-processing by helper data algorithms (HDAs) is indispensable to meet the stringent key requirements: reproducibility, high-entropy, and control. The novelty of this paper is threefold. We are the first to provide an in-depth and comprehensive literature overview on HDAs. Second, our analysis does expose new threats regarding helper data leakage and manipulation. Third, we identify several hiatuses/open problems in existing literature.", "paper_title": "Helper Data Algorithms for PUF-Based Key Generation: Overview and Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000355250500003"}
