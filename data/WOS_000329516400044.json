Trajectories are modeled as a discrete-time series of axis-parallel constraints (\"boxes\") in the 2-D space. The anomaly can be estimated by considering two trajectories, where one trajectory is the current movement pattern and the other is a weighted trajectory collected from N norms. The proposed system was implemented and evaluated with eight individuals with cognitive impairments. The experimental results showed that recall was 95.0% and precision was 90.9% on average without false alarm suppression. False alarms and false negatives dropped when axis rotation was applied. The precision with axis rotation was 97.6% and the recall was 98.8%. The average time used for sending locations, running anomaly detection, and issuing warnings was in the range of 15.1-22.7 s. Our findings suggest that the ability to adapt anomaly detection devices for appropriate timing of self-alerts will be particularly important.", "paper_title": "Statistical Anomaly Detection for Individuals With Cognitive Impairments", "paper_id": "WOS:000329516400044"}
