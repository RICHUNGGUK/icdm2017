In order to produce recommendations it applies the results achieved in the personality from the text recognition research field to Personality-based Recommender System user profile modelling. In this way it creates a bridge between the efforts of automatic personality score estimation from plain text and the field of Intelligent Recommender Systems. The paper describes the TWIN system architecture, and results of the experimentation with the system in the online travelling domain in order to investigate the possibility of providing valuable recommendations of hotels of the TripAdvisor website for \"like-minded people\". The results compare favourably with related experiments, although they demonstrate the complexity of this challenging task.", "paper_title": "TWIN: Personality-based Intelligent Recommender System", "paper_id": "WOS:000357312800010"}
