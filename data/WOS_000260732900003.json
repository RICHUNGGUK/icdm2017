By the use of the auto-BT and the epsilon-expansion method, we can obtain a soliton-like solution including N-solitary wave of the GvcKP equation. Especially, we get a soliton-like solution including two-solitary wave as an illustrative example in detail. Since the cylindrical KP (cKP) equation, the generalized cKP (GcKP) equation and the spherical KP (SKP) equation are all special cases of the GvcKP equation, we can also obtain the corresponding results of these equations respectively.
