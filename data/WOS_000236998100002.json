One of the most important aspects while learning this subject is the design of installations to satisfy a set of requirements. In order to design and to test these installations it is necessary to carry out practical works with expensive and dangerous materials. In this situation the use of a computer-supported collaborative learning environment can be a good complement to facilitate this engineering task and to provide a social dimension of learning by creating group work habits. In this paper, we present a proposal of a teaching model for this discipline and a telematic environment developed to give support to the realization of practical works of domotical design in group.
