Acoustic sensors provide the ability to collect data passively, objectively and continuously across large areas for extended periods. While these factors make acoustic sensors attractive as autonomous data collectors, there are significant issues associated with large-scale data manipulation and analysis. We present our current research into techniques for analysing large volumes of acoustic data efficiently. We provide an overview of a novel online acoustic environmental workbench and discuss a number of approaches to scaling analysis of acoustic data; online collaboration, manual, automatic and human-in-the loop analysis.
