For a set L of labels and a dense set T of triplets distinctly leaf-labeled by 3-subsets of L, we seek a tree distinctly leaf-labeled by L and containing all but at most k triplets from T as homeomorphic subtree. Our results are the first polynomial kernel for this problem, with O(k(2)) labels, and a subexponential fixed-parameter algorithm running in time O(vertical bar L vertical bar(4)) + 2(O(k1/3 log k)).
