This paper shows that (1) under the ELM learning framework SVM s maximal margin property and the minimal norm of weights theory of feedforward neural networks are actually consistent (2) from the standard optimization method point of view ELM for classification and SVM are equivalent but ELM has less optimization constraints due to its special separability feature (3) as analyzed in theory and further verified by the simulation results ELM for classification tends to achieve better generalization performance than traditional SVM ELM for classification is less sensitive to user specified parameters and can be implemented easily (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Optimization method based extreme learning machine for classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000285805800014"}
