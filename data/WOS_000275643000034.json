Several simple sufficient conditions are given ensuring global exponential stability and the existence of periodic solution of HHNNs. The obtained results improve some previous works and do not require the symmetry of weight matrix. Finally, two illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
