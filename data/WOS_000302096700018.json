Evolution-based algorithms try to deal with this issue. The algorithm proposed in this paper is called GAAPI and is a hybridization between two optimization techniques: a special class of ant colony optimization for continuous domains entitled API and a genetic algorithm (GA). The algorithm adopts the downhill behavior of API (a key characteristic of optimization algorithms) and the good spreading in the solution space of the GA. A probabilistic approach and an empirical comparison study are presented to prove the convergence of the proposed method in solving different classes of complex global continuous optimization problems. Numerical results are reported and compared to the existing results in the literature to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed algorithm is shown to be effective and efficient for most of the test functions.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Ant Colony-Genetic Algorithm (GAAPI) for Global Continuous Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000302096700018"}
