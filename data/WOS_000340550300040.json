In this paper, the CS based algorithms are investigated for Query by Example Video Retrieval (QEVR) and a novel similarity measure approach is proposed. Combining CS theory with the traditional discrete cosine transform (DCT), better compression efficiency for spatially sparse is achieved. The similarity measure from three levels (frame level, shot level and video level, respectively) is also discussed. For several different kinds of natural videos, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of system by the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A compressed sensing approach for query by example video retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000340550300040"}
