In GS-MPSO, the particles are organized as a ring lattice. The Gaussian mutation operator is applied to the stagnant particles to prevent GS-MPSO trapping into local optima. The SA-based local search strategy is developed to combine with the cognition-only PSO model and perform a fine-grained local search around the promising regions. The experimental results show that GS-MPSO is superior to some other variants of PSO with better performance on optimizing the benchmark functions when the computing resource is limited. Data clustering is studied as a real case study to further demonstrate its optimization ability and usability, too.", "paper_title": "A novel memetic algorithm and its application to data clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000343289100006"}
