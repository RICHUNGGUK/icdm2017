Using the algorithm, the evolution of the weights and centers of RBF networks is achieved sequentially in time by use of the extended Kalman particle filter algorithm, and the process noise covariance matrices are also obtained simultaneously by maximizing the evidence density function with respect to the process noise covariance matrices. Performance of the presented approach is evaluated by two function approximation problems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach obtains better prediction accuracy than other well-known training algorithms.", "paper_title": "A sequential learning algorithm based on adaptive particle filtering for RBF networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700027"}
