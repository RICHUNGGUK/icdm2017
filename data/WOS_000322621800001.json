In this paper, we present a novel approach for multi-object categorization within the BoF framework. The approach addresses two issues in BoF related methods simultaneously: how to avoid scene modeling and how to predict labels of an image when multiple categories of objects are co-existing. We employ a biased sampling strategy which combines the bottom-up, biologically inspired saliency information and loose, top-down class prior information for object class modeling. Then this biased sampling component is further integrated with a multi-instance multi-label leaning and classification algorithm. With the proposed biased sampling strategy, we can perform multi-object categorization within an image without semantic segmentation. The experimental results on PASCAL VOC2007 and SUN09 show that the proposed method significantly improves the discriminative ability of BoF methods and achieves good performance in multi-object categorization tasks.", "paper_title": "Categorization of Multiple Objects in a Scene Using a Biased Sampling Strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000322621800001"}
