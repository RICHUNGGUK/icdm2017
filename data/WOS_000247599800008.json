Two main alternative algorithms, among several possible choices, are fully described in an add one and add many basis, while the other possibilities are only sketched out. It is shown that one can also apply the described Quantum QSPR prediction algorithms to parent problems in the framework of empirical QSPR, based on the molecular space framework.", "paper_title": "About the prediction of molecular properties using the fundamental Quantum QSPR (QQSPR) equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000247599800008"}
