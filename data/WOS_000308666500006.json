Parameters such as the thermal conductivity and the heat transfer coefficient are attempted for estimation in order to satisfy a desired temperature field in the medium. The study is done for single-parameter and simultaneous two-parameter retrievals. The temperature field is calculated from a forward problem using the finite difference method using some known values of the properties. These properties are ultimately retrieved by an inverse approach using the GA. The study is done for different controlling parameters such as the number of generations, measurement errors and number of measurement locations. For two parameter simultaneous estimation, many combination of unknown parameters are observed to satisfy a given temperature field, and their ratio is only found to be successfully estimated. The present work is proposed to be useful for selecting the thermal properties which are required to satisfy a given temperature field. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
