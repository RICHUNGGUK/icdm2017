A natural way to deal with feasibility is to cast it as an additional objective in a multi-objective optimisation setting. In this paper, we consider two possible ways to do this, using a multi-level scheme for ranking solutions. One strategy considers feasibility first, before considering objective values, while the other reverses this ordering. The first strategy has been explored before, while the second has not. Experiments show that the second strategy can be much more successful on some difficult problems.", "paper_title": "Multi-level ranking for constrained multi-objective evolutionary optimisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400057"}
