In this study, we emphasize the selection of suitable component suppliers to enhance productivity taking into consideration product assembly sequences in configuration change. This study takes various criteria into account when evaluating suppliers in different configuration change scenarios. It then utilizes the Analytic Network Process (ANP) to evaluate the weight of each criterion, and constructs an optimal multi-period supplier evaluation model on the basis of assembly sequences by using a Guided genetic algorithm to effectively simulate the assembly procedural relationship and determine the optimal solution sequences. It also employs the Pareto Genetic Algorithm to search for global optimums, and integrates the above two algorithms into a Guided-Pareto genetic algorithm (Cu-PGA). Through building a decision-making system with a hybrid genetic algorithm for solving a series of problems after configuration changes, the optimal production decision could be obtained.", "paper_title": "USING HYBRID GENETIC ALGORITHMS FOR MULTI-PERIOD PRODUCT CONFIGURATION CHANGE PLANNING", "paper_id": "WOS:000278688700031"}
