The design technique is based on a self-adaptive Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. Numerical examples are compared with the existing in the literature and with those found by the other evolutionary algorithms. The results show that the new DE algorithm version outer performs other global optimizers like Particle swarm optimization (PSO) variants and the classical DE algorithm. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals.
