The purpose of this paper is to employ the modified (MDTM) differential transform method (DTM) to obtain approximate periodic solutions of two cases of nonlinear jerk equation. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based on MDTM that is developed by combining DTM, Laplace transform and Pade approximant. Findings - Comparison of results obtained by MDTM with those obtained by numerical solutions indicates the excellent accuracy of solution. Originality/value - The MDTM is extended to determining approximate periodic solution of third-order nonlinear differential equations.", "paper_title": "Approximate periodic solution for nonlinear jerk equation as a third-order nonlinear equation via modified differential transform method", "paper_id": "WOS:000341730800001"}
