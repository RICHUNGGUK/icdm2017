The dynamic behaviors of chaotic signal neural units were analyzed and the time evolution figures of the maximal Lyapunov exponents and chaotic dynamic behavior were given. The improved transiently chaotic neural network has the ability to stay in chaotic states longer because the wavelet function is non-monotonous and is a.,kind of basic function. The simulation results prove that the improved transiently chaotic neural network is superior to the original in solving 10-city traveling salesman problem (TSP).", "paper_title": "Improved transiently chaotic neural network and its application to optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100113"}
