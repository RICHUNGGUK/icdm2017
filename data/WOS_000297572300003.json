Even though manufacture test can guarantee product quality, due to various types of wearout and failure modes, permanent faults appearing in the filed is becoming an increasingly important and real problem. Such types of wear-out creates permanent faults in devices after release to the user during their lifetime. In this paper, we perform a formal investigation of the impact of permanent faults on security, examine empirical evidence, and demonstrate a real attack. Our results show that permanent stuck-at faults may leave security holes in microprocessors. We show that an adversary with knowledge of a fault can launch attacks which can obtain critical secrets such as a private key in 30 seconds.", "paper_title": "Exploring the Interaction Between Device Lifetime Reliability and Security Vulnerabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000297572300003"}
