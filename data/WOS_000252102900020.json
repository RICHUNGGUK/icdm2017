For this discretization, balancing domain decomposition with constraints (BDDC) algorithms are designed and analyzed as an additive Schwarz method (ASM). The coarse and local problems are defined using special partitions of unity and edge constraints. Under certain assumptions on the coefficients and the mesh sizes across partial derivative Omega(i), where the Omega(i) are disjoint subregions of the original region Omega, a condition number estimate C(1 + max(i) log(H-i/h(i)))(2) is established with C independent of of h(i), H-i and the jumps of the coefficients. The algorithms are well suited for parallel computations and can be straightforwardly extended to the 3-D problems. Results of numerical tests are included which confirm the theoretical results and the necessity of the imposed assumptions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
