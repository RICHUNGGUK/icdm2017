Randomly occurring nonlinearities (RONs) and randomly occurring saturations (ROSs) are also considered, respectively, in the state-space model and the measurement output equation to reflect the nonlinear disturbance appearing in a random way and the limited communication capabilities of the sensors. The aim of this paper is focused on the design of a full-order [GRAPHICS] filter such that the [GRAPHICS] performance is guaranteed in the simultaneous presence of the mixed tim delays, RONs and ROSs. By utilizing the Kronecker product and the inequality technique, an energy-like function is developed to establish some sufficient criteria under which the filtering error system satisfies the prescribed [GRAPHICS] disturbance attenuation performance. Furthermore, explicit expression of the filter parameters is also characterized. Numerical example provided in the end of the paper further demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme.", "paper_title": "H-infinity filtering for two-dimensional systems with mixed time delays, randomly occurring saturations and nonlinearities", "paper_id": "WOS:000348520100009"}
