A natural algebraic representation of this problem gives rise to a determinantal ideal: the ideal generated by all minors of size r + I of the matrix. We give new complexity bounds for solving this problem using Grobner bases algorithms under genericity assumptions on the input matrix. In particular, these complexity bounds allow us to identify families of generalized MinRank problems for which the arithmetic complexity of the solving process is polynomial in the number of solutions. We also provide an algorithm to compute a rational parametrization of the variety of a 0-dimensional and radical system of bi-degree (D, 1). We show that its complexity can be bounded by using the complexity bounds for the generalized MinRank problem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
