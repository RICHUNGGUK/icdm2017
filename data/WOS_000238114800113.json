A NSIS QoS Model is utilized to add the admission control framework to the DiffServ architecture and reservation-based admission control algorithms are designed for ingress and interior nodes respectively for enabling quantitative delay guarantees in a DiffServ domain. Due to the NSIS protocol suite can support aggregate reservations effectively and the admission control algorithms are distributed at the ingress and interior nodes, our approach can enable the quantitative end-to-end delay guarantees in a DiffServ domain while still maintaining its simplicity and scalability.", "paper_title": "Scalable quantitative delay guarantee support in DiffServ networks through NSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800113"}
