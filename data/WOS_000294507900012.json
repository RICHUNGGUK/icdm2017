The computer code is written in C and uses a singular value decomposition (SVD) routine from the LAPACK library and the fast Fourier transform for spatial filtering from the FFTW library. Various offset estimation and topographic correction algorithms are implemented, including simultaneous inversion for deformation rates and residual topographic error. This approach is particularly useful when applied to ALOS PALSAR interferograms that are coherent even at large perpendicular baselines and acquired with orbital parameters correlated with the time of acquisition. This methodology is applied to produce time series of ground deformation at Tauhara and Wairakei geothermal fields (Taupo Volcanic Zone, North Island, New Zealand) from 12 ALOS PALSAR images acquired between July 2007 and December 2009. We also present here a high-resolution deformation map of the ground subsidence caused by the extraction of geothermal groundwater for power generation, with maximum rates of subsidence of about 7 cm/y.
