We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for two Bessel sequences having Wilson structure to be dual frames for l(2)(Z). When the window function satisfies some symmetry property, we obtain a characterization of a Wilson system to be a tight frame for l(2)(Z), show that a Wilson frame for l(2)(Z) can be derived from the underlying Gabor frame, and that the dual frame having Wilson structure can also be derived from the canonical Gabor dual of the underlying Gabor frame.", "paper_title": "DISCRETE-TIME WILSON FRAMES WITH GENERAL LATTICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000310462400004"}
