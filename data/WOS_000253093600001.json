Applying the triple Fourier transfomation, the general Solutions for the displacements, the stresses and the pore pressure are derived from the governing equations of Biot's theory. Utilizing the continuity conditions between each layer and the boundary conditions at the half space surface, the transformed domain Solutions for the displacements, the pore pressures and the stresses are established by the transmission and reflection matrices (TRM) method. Numerical results in the time-space domain are obtained by performing the inverse Fourier transform with respect to frequency and the horizontal wavenumbers. Moreover, some numerical examples and corresponding analysis are presented in the paper. Numerical results Show that the occurrence of a softer middle layer in the layered half space will enhance the vertical displacement and the pore pressure of the layered half space. Besides, the presence of a softer middle layer tends to make the response of the layered half space exhibit more oscillatory nature. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
