We rely on a patch-based approach, which requires careful choices for both the distance between patches and for the statistical estimator of the original patch. Experiments are run in the case of pure impulse noise and in the case of a mixture. The method proves to be particularly powerful, especially for the restoration of textured regions, and compares favorably to recent restoration methods.", "paper_title": "A Patch-Based Approach for Removing Impulse or Mixed Gaussian-Impulse Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000326033500015"}
