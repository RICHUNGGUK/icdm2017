The conditions on the global Mittag-Leffler stability and synchronization are established by using Lyapunov method for these networks. The analysis in the paper employs results from the theory of fractional-order differential equations with discontinuous right-hand sides. The obtained results extend and improve some previous works on conventional memristor-based recurrent neural networks. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
