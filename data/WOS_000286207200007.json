But MMC ignores the local structures of samples. In this paper, we develop a novel criterion to address this issue, namely Laplacian Maximum Margin Criterion (Laplacian MMC). We define the total Laplacian matrix, within-class Laplacian matrix and between-class Laplacian matrix by using the similar weight of samples to capture the scatter information. Laplacian MMC based feature extraction gets the discriminant vectors by maximizing the difference between between-class laplacian matrix and within-class laplacian matrix. Experiments on FERET and AR face databases show that Laplacian MMC works well.", "paper_title": "Feature Extraction Using Laplacian Maximum Margin Criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000286207200007"}
