In the optimization procedure, the paper incorporates key infrastructure management concepts of treatment-specific triggers, performance jump models, and performance trend models. Using a case study. the paper determines that optimization can be a viable tool to support scheduling decisions for highway preventive maintenance. Also. using sensitivity analysis, it is determined that changes in the resurfacing interval length and discount rate can influence the choice of optimal PM schedule. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
