In doing so, this proof-of-concept contributes to future development of a robust system which can be deployed and utilized in different situations and industry.", "paper_title": "Using Mobile Robots to Establish Mobile Wireless Mesh Networks and Increase Network Throughput", "paper_id": "WOS:000308484100001"}
