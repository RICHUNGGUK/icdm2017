A combination of MIMO and OFDMA could increase the spectral efficiency in a high speed network. We investigate methods with scalable channel feedback and we analyze the trade off between the amount of Channel State Information (CSI) to the transmitter and the system performance. The proposed schemes with limited feedback are combined with other cell interference reduction strategies based on cooperation for improving the performance of a coordinated multi-cell system under very dynamic conditions like high velocity and fast fading. Simulation results demonstrate that substantial gain is obtained by the proposed schemes which take advantage of the statistical information of the highly dynamic channel. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
