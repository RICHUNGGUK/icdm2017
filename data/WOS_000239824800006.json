Methods: A specific questionnaire was developed by authors to collect sociodemographic data as well as data on general and health-related Internet use. This questionnaire was distributed to patients visiting medical practices in the above mentioned Bavarian region. Results: Whereas many Internet users look for health-related information and products on the Internet, more advanced web-based techniques such as chat rooms and electronic patient records are hardly used. Conclusions: Although modern information technologies have the potential to enable citizens to handle their own health-related information in a self-determined and informed manner, at present the general population in Germany is hardly taking this opportunity.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of health-related Internet use in Germany", "paper_id": "WOS:000239824800006"}
