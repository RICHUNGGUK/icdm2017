To improve the performance of CKCDIM, this paper puts forward a dynamic and self-study language model which based on a general language model and user language model, and proposes two indexes which are the average number of pressed-keys (ANPK) and the hit rate of first characters (HRFC) to measure the performance of the input method. Meanwhile, this paper brings forward a modified Church-Gale smoothing method to reduce the size of general language model to meet the need of mobile phone. At last, the experiments prove that the dynamic and self-study language model is a steady model and can improve the performance of CKCDIM.", "paper_title": "A Chinese mobile phone input method based on the dynamic and self-study language model", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000084"}
