In terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach and delay-partitioning projection technique, delay-dependent stability criteria are derived for the considered neural networks for cases with or without the information of the delay rates via new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. We also establish that the conservatism of the conditions is a non-increasing function of the number of delay partitions. An example with simulation results is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
