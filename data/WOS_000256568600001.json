Such robots are more useful in rough terrains, pipeline inspections and in the removal of obstacles. The design of such multi-shaped robots requires dynamic shape changes in its hardware as well as reconfigurable software architecture. Modular robots are preferred under such conditions, in that they can change their behavior dynamically. This paper proposes new modular software and hardware architecture for multi-shaped robots using real-time dynamic behavior identification and selection. It is a layered architecture with reusable and reconfigurable modules, which can be embedded in an expert system as both hardware and software modules and demonstrated with snake robot or physically reconfigured four-legged robots. The intelligent dynamic selection and synchronization of selected behaviors enable mobile robots to perform many tasks under complex situations. The architecture proposed can be applied to shape-reconfigurable robots, for the dynamic selection of behavior during reconfiguration, where hardware and software modules can be reused during reconfiguration.
