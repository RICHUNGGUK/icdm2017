By introducing two auxiliary autonomous systems, differential inequality technique and active control technique are used to deal with the synchronization of two non-identical forced oscillators with parameter mismatch in external harmonic excitations. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "SYNCHRONIZATION WITH ERROR BOUND OF NON-IDENTICAL FORCED OSCILLATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260388800009"}
