Hence, a common hardware platform that can support multiple protocols implemented or controlled by software, generally referred to as software defined radio (SDR), is essential. This paper presents a family of dynamically reconfigurable application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs) for channel coding in wireless communication systems. As a weakly programmable intellectual property (IP) core, it can implement trellis-based channel decoding in a SDR environment. It features binary convolutional decoding, and turbo decoding for binary as well as duobinary turbo codes for all current and upcoming standards. The ASIP consists of a specialized pipeline with 15 stages and a dedicated communication and memory infrastructure. Logic synthesis revealed a maximum clock frequency of 400 MHz and an area of 0.11 mm(2) for the processor's logic using a low power 65-nm technology. Memories require another 0.31 mm(2). Simulation results for Viterbi and turbo decoding demonstrate maximum throughput of 196 and 34 Mb/s, respectively. The ASIP hence outperforms state-of-the-art decoder architectures targeting software defined radio by at least a factor of three while consuming only 60% or less of the logic area.", "paper_title": "A reconfigurable ASIP for convolutional and turbo decoding in an SDR environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000259572800006"}
