The usual approach to solve the BTE, the Monte Carlo method, is found to be prohibitively CPU intensive for technically relevant frequencies below 100GHz. A numerical alternative based on a spherical harmonics expansion of the BTE is presented, of which the CPU time does not depend on the frequency. In addition, this approach allows to solve the Langevin-type BTE, which gives more physical insight into noise. This is demonstrated for some relevant device applications.", "paper_title": "Noise calculation in the semiclassical framework: A critical analysis of the Monte Carlo method and a numerical alternative", "paper_id": "WOS:000236456400017"}
