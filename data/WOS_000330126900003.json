However, most existing MB-level rate control methods are not designed for hardware implementation, and are too complex for practical use in real-time video coding. In this paper, a simple and effective MB-level rate control scheme is proposed that uses historical rate information to directly assign a QP value to a class of MBs. This paper will also introduce a method to realize the idea and make the pipeline data dependency applicable in circuit design. Experiments show that the proposed classification-based MB-level rate control algorithm can achieve a coding gain up to 0.6 dB and an averaging gain of 0.18 dB.", "paper_title": "A Novel R-D Optimized MB-level Rate Control Scheme for Real-Time Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000330126900003"}
