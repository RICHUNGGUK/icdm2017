Basic safety message (BSM) is transmitted only through the control channel at regular intervals. In this paper, we propose an analytic model based on interacting semi-Markov process (SMP) to evaluate both Medium Access Control (MAC) and application level performance and reliability of safety message broadcasting incorporating the impact of multi-channel operations. Message service time distribution is derived using Laplace-Stieltjes transform based on the proposed model. Due to the cyclic interactions between the SMP models for vehicles contending the same channel, fixed-point iteration is used to obtain converged solutions. Subsequently, MAC and application-level performance and reliability metrics are derived based on the converged solutions. Channel fading with path loss is taken into consideration in this derivation. The analytic models are validated through extensive simulations in NS2 to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed fixed-point iteration based model decomposition. The effects of channel switching mechanism and channel fading are also evaluated by comparing with other analytic models.", "paper_title": "Performance and Reliability Evaluation of BSM Broadcasting in DSRC with Multi-Channel Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000344990300017"}
