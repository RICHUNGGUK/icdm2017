These technological advances also make fault diagnosis and maintenance interventions much more challenging, since these operations require a deep understanding of the entire system. This paper proposes a holonic cooperative fault diagnosis approach, along with a generic architecture, to increase the embedded diagnosis capabilities of complex transportation systems. This concept is applied to the fault diagnosis of door systems of a railway transportation system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
