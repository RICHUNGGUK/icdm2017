This improves current bounds on the number of combinatorial types of polytopes. The previous best lower bounds for the number of neighborly polytopes were found by Shemer in 1982 using a technique called the Sewing Construction. We provide a new simple proof that sewing works, and generalize it to oriented matroids in two ways: to Extended Sewing and to Gale Sewing. Our lower bound is obtained by estimating the number of polytopes that can be constructed via Gale Sewing. Combining both new techniques, we are also able to construct many non-realizable neighborly oriented matroids.", "paper_title": "Many Neighborly Polytopes and Oriented Matroids", "paper_id": "WOS:000327891900003"}
