The traffic cost function for each link is defined based on known routing information. We theoretically analyze the probability distribution which is very useful for mobile agents to select a neighboring node to move to. The optimal probability distribution makes inference on the known information and approximates to a unbiased distribution. Simulation experiments are conducted to compare the performance of our algorithm with existing algorithms. The results show that our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms on the performance metrics considered.", "paper_title": "A traffic-based routing algorithm by using mobile agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000252749200001"}
