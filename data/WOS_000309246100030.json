Sequential aggregate signature (SAS) schemes allow multiple signers to sequentially produce a short signature of different messages and also allow signers to attest to these messages as well as the order in which they signed. At CCS 2007, Boldyreva et al. proposed the first identity-based sequential aggregate signature (IBSAS) scheme from pairings on elliptic curves, which have the merits of both SAS and IBS schemes. In 2009, Hwang et al. pointed out that the Boldyreva et al.'s scheme is not secure. How to construct a secure IBSAS scheme is still an important open problem. In this paper, we present an IBSAS scheme, which is not based on pairings but based on RSA. We define a new security model for IBSAS schemes, and we prove our scheme secure in this model. We also give the potential applications of our scheme in secure network routing, but we believe that this scheme has many other applications as well.", "paper_title": "IDENTITY-BASED SEQUENTIAL AGGREGATE SIGNATURE SCHEME BASED ON RSA", "paper_id": "WOS:000309246100030"}
