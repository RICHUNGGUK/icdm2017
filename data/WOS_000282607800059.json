This research attempts to build a decision support system that optimizes the time limit for maximum sales response or profit in Internet shopping promotions. We decompose the effect of time limits into two opposing forces, which are the awareness and urgency of a promotional offer that are depicted as hyperbolic S-shaped functions. Using the decision calculus approach, we can determine the optimal promotional time limit with different input parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed system with real world examples and conduct some sensitivity analyses. We compare our numerical results from hyperbolic functions with those from simple exponential functions; we find that hyperbolic functions yield more appropriate promotional time limits on Internet. This research contributes to the field of decision support by providing a new approach to determining the optimal time limit for online sales promotions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
