For the good electric conductivity of metal, the turn-on electric field of the Fe/Ni and CNT composite film (Fe/CNT film) decreases to 1.42 V/mu m comparing with the usual CNT film of 2.45 V/mu m, and the emission current increases from 60 mu A to 440 mu A at an applied electric field of 2.3 V/mu m. Furthermore, the field enhancement factor beta increases from 1721 to 3242. By characterizing the prepared samples via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), it is found that carbide Fe(3)C phase is formed in Fe/CNT film, and the metal particles are filled in the interspaces of CNTs. It is evaluated that benefiting from good electrical conductivity and chemical inertness of metal carbide, Fe/CNT film achieves high emission characteristics and emission uniformity.
