To consider fluctuating demands commonly occurred in refuse collection systems, we consider a restricted dynamic version of the problem in which the locations are fixed, but the allocations are changed over a given planning horizon. The problem is formulated as an integer programming model for the objective of minimizing the sum of fixed costs to open collection points and variable costs to transport refuses between demand and collection points, and then, due to the complexity of the problem, two heuristic algorithms are suggested. The heuristics, called the multi-stage branch and bound and the modified drop heuristics in this paper, are based on the decomposition of the entire problem into the static location and the dynamic allocation sub-problems. Computational experiments were done on various test instances, and the results are reported. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
