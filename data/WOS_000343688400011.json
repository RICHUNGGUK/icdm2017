Thus it calls for specific focus on IT governance in order to reach fusion between business and IT goals. Good IT performance management should enable the business and IT executives to understand how IT is contributing to the achievement of business goals. The paper addresses the issue of representing IT governance best practice frameworks as ontological metamodels. Special attention is dedicated to VAL IT framework, which represents a comprehensive framework to maximize business value from IT investments. The paper points out the necessity of analyzing, comparing and integrating IT governance frameworks in order to complement different knowledge and generate ontological metamodel of IT performance management. Scope of our work is in the static aspect of the framework and as the metalanguage Extended Entity/Relationship model is used.", "paper_title": "Representing IT Performance Management as Metamodel", "paper_id": "WOS:000343688400011"}
