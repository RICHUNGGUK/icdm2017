Our approach, which uses multivalued maps, provides a better framework to define topological notions, like retractions, in a far more realistic way than by using just single-valued digitally continuous functions. In particular, we have characterized the deletion of simple points and some well known parallel thinning algorithm as a particular type of retractions, called (N, k)-retractions. In this paper we give a full characterization of the thinning algorithms that can be modeled as (N, k)-retractions. This class agrees, with minor modifications, with the class of thinning algorithms satisfying Ronse sufficient conditions for preservation of topology. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
