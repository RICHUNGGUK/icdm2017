In this paper, another algorithm to solve the discrete logarithm problem in F-p* for p prime is presented. The global running time is again L-p[1/3, 1.9018...], but in contrast with Matyukhins method, this algorithm enables us to calculate individual logarithms in a separate stage in time L-p[1/3, 3(1/3)], once a L-p[1/3, 1.9018...] time costing pre-computation stage has been executed. We describe the algorithm as derived from [6] and estimate its running time to be L-p [1/3, (64/9)(1/3)], after which individual logarithms can be calculated in time L-p[1/3, 3(1/3)].", "paper_title": "An algorithm to solve the discrete logarithm problem with the number field sieve", "paper_id": "WOS:000238186800012"}
