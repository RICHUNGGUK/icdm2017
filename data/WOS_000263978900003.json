CAC is the key component of QoS routing protocols. The goal of CAC is to protect existing flows from QoS violations and fully utilize available radio resource on channels. We propose a CAC mechanism, called Contention-Aware Multi-channel Call Admission Control (CMC), for MR(2)-MC WMNs based on IEEE 802.11 DCF. CMC is fully distributed, relies on local information to estimate the residual bandwidth of a path, and can be integrated into existing routing protocols for MR(2)-MC WMNs to provide QoS. We evaluate the performance of CMC via ns-2 simulations. The results show that CMC can precisely predict the end-to-end residual bandwidths of paths, successfully protects existing flows from QoS violations, and fully utilizes the bandwidths on channels.", "paper_title": "Distributed Contention-Aware Call Admission Control for IEEE 802.11 Multi-Radio Multi-Rate Multi-Channel Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263978900003"}
