These methods, however, have limitations. Digital watermarks embedded in digital content could be removed by malicious users via post-processing, whereas DRM-based access-control solutions could be hacked. In this paper, we introduce a content tracking mechanism that we have built for multimedia-content near-replica detection as the second line of defense. The integrated framework aims to detect unlawful copyright infringements on the Internet, and combines the strengths of static rights enforcement and dynamic illegal content tracking. The issues of accuracy and huge computation cost in copy detection have been addressed by the introduced content-based techniques. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of proposed copy detector.", "paper_title": "Effective content tracking for digital rights management in digital libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500035"}
