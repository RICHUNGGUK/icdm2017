This paper exploits a semi-rigid beam element (SRBE) that consists of a beam element with two semi-rigid connections at the ends to simulate the flexibility of joint. Guyan reduction method condenses the SRBE as a super element. A special finite element software for structural modeling and analysis of BIW (SMAB) is developed in .NET framework. The Unified Modeling Language is employed to depict the classes and their relationship. The design patterns are identified and applied in the framework design to facilitate communication and system expansion. Microsoft DirectX and GDI+ implement graphics display of spatial BIW frame and planar thin-walled cross section. Based on multi-threaded technology in .NET, subspace iteration method is paralleled to speed up the mode analysis. As a result, the efficiency of the SRBE is demonstrated by a benchmarking automotive body. Multi-threaded parallel is effective and useful, especially for frequency optimization.
