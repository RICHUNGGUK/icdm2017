The identification of digital evidence relating to cloud storage services can, however, be a challenge in a digital forensic investigation. Using SkyDrive as a case study, we identified the types of terrestrial artefacts that are likely to remain on a client's machine (in the context of our experiments; computer hard drive and iPhone), and where the access point(s) for digital forensics examiners are, that will allow them to undertake steps to secure evidence in a timely fashion.
