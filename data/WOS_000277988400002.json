Specifically, we give a deterministic solution for each of two well known PSPACE-complete problems: QSAT and Q3SAT. In the case of QSAT, the answer to any instance of the problem is computed in a time which is linear with respect to both the number n of Boolean variables and the number in of clauses that compose the instance. As for Q3SAT, the answer is computed in a time which is at most cubic in the number n of Boolean variables. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
