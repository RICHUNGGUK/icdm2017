However, actual applications may involve the tasks in which multiple coordinated mobile manipulators system interacts with rigid or non-rigid working surfaces. In this paper, we consider multiple mobile manipulators grasping a rigid object in contact with a deformable working surface, whose geometric and real physical parameters are unknown but boundedness of physical parameters is known. The contact forces are nonlinear and difficult to model. A neuro-adaptive control for coordinated mobile manipulators is proposed for robust force/motion tracking. The control law is based on the philosophy of the parallel approach, in which the control problem is divided into three subspaces and the adaptive techniques are employed to deal with the uncertain environmental constraints, disturbances, and unknown robotic and object dynamics. The proposed adaptive force-motion controller guarantees the tracking errors of motion and force trajectories converge to zero. Simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
