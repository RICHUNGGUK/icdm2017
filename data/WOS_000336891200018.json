Various post-processing techniques have been proposed to reduce blocking artifacts, but they usually introduce excessive blurring or ringing effects. This paper proposes a self-learning-based post-processing framework for image/video deblocking by properly formulating deblocking as an MCA (morphological component analysis)-based image decomposition problem via sparse representation. Without the need of any prior knowledge (e.g., the positions where blocking artifacts occur, the algorithm used for compression, or the characteristics of image to be processed) about the blocking artifacts to be removed, the proposed framework can automatically learn two dictionaries for decomposing an input decoded image into its \"blocking component\" and \"non-blocking component.\" More specifically, the proposed method first decomposes a frame into the low-frequency and high-frequency parts by applying BM3D (block-matching and 3D filtering) algorithm. The high-frequency part is then decomposed into a blocking component and a non-blocking component by performing dictionary learning and sparse coding based on MCA. As a result, the blocking component can be removed from the image/video frame successfully while preserving most original visual details. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
