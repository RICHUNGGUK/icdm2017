In this paper, we study the embedding of a mesh of trees in the crossed cube. Let n be a multiple of 4 and N = 2((n-2)/2). We prove that an N x N mesh of trees (containing 3N(2) - 2N nodes) can be embedded in an n-dimensional crossed cube (containing 4N(2) nodes) with dilation 1 and expansion about 4/3. This result shows that crossed cubes are promising interconnection networks since mesh of trees enables fast parallel computation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
