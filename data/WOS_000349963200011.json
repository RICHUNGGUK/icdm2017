The success of this e-government system is examined using an integrated IS success model. The model developed includes the constructs such as system quality, information quality, service quality, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived satisfaction, perceived risk, and behavioral intention. The proposed integrated research model of IS was validated using the response taken from 419 citizens from different cities of India. The empirical outcomes provided the positive significant connections between all 12 hypothesised relationships between eight constructs. The empirical evidence and discussion presented in the study can help the government to improve upon and fully utilise the potential of the OPGRS as a useful tool toward a transparent and corruption free country.", "paper_title": "Investigating success of an e-government initiative: Validation of an integrated IS success model", "paper_id": "WOS:000349963200011"}
