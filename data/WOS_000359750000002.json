The author's attack on Rijndael-160/160 covers eight rounds. The attack complexities are 2(126.5) chosen plaintexts, 2(129.28) 8-round Rijndael-160/160 encryptions and 2(132.82) bytes. Their attack on Rijndael-192/192 covers ten rounds. It requires 2(179) chosen plaintexts, 2(181.09) 10-round Rijndael-192/192 encryptions and 2(185.59) bytes memory. These are the currently best cryptanalytic results on Rijndael-160/160 and Rijndael-192/192 in terms of the number of attacked rounds. Furthermore, their results show that the slow diffusion in the key schedule of Rijndael makes it a target for this type of analysis.", "paper_title": "Related-key rectangle cryptanalysis of Rijndael-160 and Rijndael-192", "paper_id": "WOS:000359750000002"}
