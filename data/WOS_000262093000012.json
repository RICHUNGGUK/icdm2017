Testing was performed for the first configuration through a systematic comparison between direct numerical simulation results and large eddy simulation results of many characteristics, including resolved kinetic energy, SGS energy production, molecular dissipation, and kinetic energy spectrum. The new models, which are based on dynamic structure model and satisfy the consistency of material frame in difference with the SGS stress, showed more accurate results than traditional models. In the forced testing, the new models were better able to capture essential features of rotating turbulence, including cyclonic/anti-cyclonic asymmetry, quasi-2D at large scales, and reverse kinetic energy transfer from small to large scales.", "paper_title": "A POSTERIORI TESTS OF ONE-EQUATION LES MODELING OF ROTATING TURBULENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000262093000012"}
