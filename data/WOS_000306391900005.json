This can be achieved by allocating spectrum resource in a cognitive radio way. The proposed resource allocation is performed in two steps; spectrum sensing and resource scheduling. The femto base station detects idle frequency assignments (FAs) free from the occupation by macro-users and then allocates sub-channels in an idle FA to femto-users, effectively managing the interference problem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Cognitive Radio Based Resource Allocation in Femto-Cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000306391900005"}
