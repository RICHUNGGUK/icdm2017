Current solutions fail to meet important requirements of those networks since they have limited support for dynamicity of networks, nodes and information, or flexible information retrieval mechanisms for satisfying user's needs. In this paper, we propose a Global Directory Service based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) and Hilbert Space Filling Curves (HSFC) that provides distribution and flexibility for information retrieval. Performance analyses reveal that the proposed mechanisms are scalable with the number of networks, nodes, and amount of information.", "paper_title": "A flexible DHT-based directory service for information management", "paper_id": "WOS:000356581300013"}
