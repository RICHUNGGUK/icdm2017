It is shown that the harmonic actions are approximately conserved for the semi-discretised system as well. This permits to prove that the energy of the wave equation along the interpolated semi-discrete solution remains well conserved over long times and close to the Hamiltonian of the semi-discrete equation. Although the momentum is no longer an exact invariant of the semi-discretisation, it is shown to be approximately conserved. All these results are obtained with the technique of modulated Fourier expansions.", "paper_title": "Spectral semi-discretisations of weakly non-linear wave equations over long times", "paper_id": "WOS:000256963400005"}
