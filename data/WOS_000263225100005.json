Subsethood is itself a fuzzy set that is a crisp interval when G and H are interval type-2 sets. We show how to compute this interval and then use the result to compute subsethood for general type-2 fuzzy sets. A definition of subsethood for arbitrary fuzzy sets of type-n > 2 is then developed. This subsethood is a type-(n - 1) fuzzy set, and we provide a procedure to compute subsethood of interval type-3 fuzzy sets.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Subsethood for Fuzzy Sets of Type-2 and Generalized Type-n", "paper_id": "WOS:000263225100005"}
