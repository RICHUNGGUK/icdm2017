This paper presents a family of algorithms called iteratively reweighted least integrated squares for minimum disparity computation. This family of algorithms, indexed by a real parameter alpha, approximates the disparity measure by quadratic functions, in a form of integrated weighted squared errors, and minimizes the quadratic functions conveniently by using weighted least squares linear regression algorithms. Among all potential values of alpha, we advocate the use of alpha = 1 from the consideration of robust estimation, which results in an algorithm similar in spirit to the Fisher scoring method for maximum likelihood computation. Numerical studies show that the new algorithms, especially the one that uses alpha = 1. give competitive or better performance over the other algorithms available in the literature.
