Three settings are investigated: when (i) faithfulness is guaranteed (ii) faithfulness is not guaranteed and (iii) the parameter distributions are concentrated around unfaithfulness (near-unfaithfulness). In a simulation study, the effects of the different settings are compared using the parents and children (PC) and max-min parents and children (MMPC) algorithms. The results show that the performance in the faithful case is almost unchanged compared with the unrestricted case, whereas there is a general decrease in performance under the near-unfaithful case as compared with the unrestricted case. The response to near-unfaithful parameterizations is similar between the two algorithms, with the MMPC algorithm having higher true positive rates and the PC algorithm having lower false positive rates.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity analysis of violations of the faithfulness assumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000334334500014"}
