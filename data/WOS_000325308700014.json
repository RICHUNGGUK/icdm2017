This result shows that at least 2(h) (n - h) edges of G(n) have to be removed to get a disconnected graph that contains no vertices of degree less than h. Compared with previous results, this result enhances fault-tolerant ability of the above-mentioned networks theoretically. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
