Firstly, the implementation of a local multiple marker method removes the strong increase in computational time with the number of droplets. Secondly, the deflation method [2] is used as a second-level preconditioner in the pressure solver to reduce the number of iterations. Finally, three-dimensional domain decompositioning is used instead of a one-dimensional one. For the buoyant rise of 48 droplets in a periodic box an overall speed-up by a factor eight is achieved.
