To achieve high-parsing performance for spoken monologues, simplifying the structure by dividing a sentence into suitable language units could prove effective. This paper proposes a method for dependency parsing of Japanese spoken monologues based on sentence segmentation. In this method, dependency parsing is executed in two stages: at the clause level and the sentence level. First, dependencies within a clause are identified by dividing a sentence into clauses and executing stochastic dependency parsing for each clause. Next, dependencies across clause boundaries are identified stochastically, and the dependency structure of the entire sentence is thus completed. An experiment using a spoken monologue corpus shows the effectiveness of this method for efficient dependency parsing of Japanese monologue sentences.", "paper_title": "Dependency parsing of Japanese monologue using clause boundaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000250467300006"}
