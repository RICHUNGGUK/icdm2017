Our algorithm goes further to impose a coherence objective. A synthesis is coherent if every local neighborhood of the filled hole is similar to some local neighborhood of the input mesh. This requirement avoids undesired features such as can occur in context-based completion. We demonstrate the algorithm's ability to fill holes that were difficult or impossible to fill in a compelling manner by earlier approaches.", "paper_title": "Context-Based Coherent Surface Completion", "paper_id": "WOS:000332118300005"}
