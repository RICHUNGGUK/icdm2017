First, an alternate expression is derived for the A and C estimates. It is shown that the Chiuso and Picci result ( Chiuso and Picci 2004) stating that the A and C estimates delivered by this algorithm robust version and by the Verhaegen's MOESP (Verhaegen and Dewilde 1992a, Verhaegen and Dewilde 1992b, Verhaegen 1993, Verhaegen 1994) are equal, can be obtained from this expression. An alternative approach for the estimation of matrices B and D in subspace identification is also described. It is shown that the least squares approach for the estimation of these matrices estimation can be just expressed as an orthogonal projection of the future outputs on a lower dimension subspace in the orthogonal complement of the column space of the extended observability matrix. Since this subspace has a dimension equal to the number of outputs, a simpler and numerically more efficient ( but equally accurate) new subspace algorithm is provided.", "paper_title": "A new insight to the matrices extraction in a MOESP type subspace identification algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000239238000009"}
