Using the loop parameter optimization method and the low-jitter circuit design technique, the rms and peak-to-peak jitter of the recovered 625-MHz clock are 9.4 and 46.3 ps, respectively, which meet the jitter specifications stipulated in ITU-T recommendation G.958. The recovered and frequency divided 625 MHz clock has a phase noise of -83.8 dBc/Hz at 20 kHz offset in response to 2.5 Gb/s PRBS input data (2(23)-1), and the 2.5 Gb/s PRBS data has been demultiplexed into four 625 Mb/s data. The power dissipation is only 0.3 W under a single 3.3 V supply (excluding output buffers).", "paper_title": "2.5-Gb/s low-jitter low-power monolithically integrated optical receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000304101200010"}
