Therefore this paper presents a power control game theoretic approach for WMSNs by studying the effect of transmission power on QoS and energy efficiency. The game approach determines the transmission strategy using utility optimization according to the fluctuation of channel states. Here, the utility function is defined by effective throughput per unit power while satisfying the user's delay QoS constraints. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the proposed game are proved. Finally, the simulation results show that each user chooses the optimal transmission power to maximize its utility based on other constant parameters and the effects of delay constraints on the user's utility are quantified as well.", "paper_title": "A game theoretic approach for power allocation with QoS constraints in wireless multimedia sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287081100007"}
