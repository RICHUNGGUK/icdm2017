In addition, more implementation is to be expected in the field of container yard and depot as well as in logistics-related activities. Seaports, especially container terminals, are expected to become one of the efficient nodes among all logistics activities with the help of IoT technology in the operation practice of sea port, which plays an essential role in transportation; there is a trend that IoT technology, including RFID technology, is to be adopted to fulfill future electronic identity verification and remote location and control over cargo. A goal of this article is to critically evaluate RFID application for operational procedures in port-based container logistics. Based on that, some previously used technologies are briefly introduced with their effectiveness and efficiencies so that comparison can be made. We also discuss current application of RFID technology in the field of container logistics. Furthermore, RFID application trend from wider perspectives is also observed. That is to say, applications derived from cargo demand side and supply chain/network management side can also be triggers that lead to increase in the number of application in the near future.", "paper_title": "RFID TECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATION TO PORT-BASED CONTAINER LOGISTICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000299775900005"}
