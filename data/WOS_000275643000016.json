However, it is still hard for them to share interaction with others efficiently because of the limited Communication means. In order for learners to study collaboratively with others and immerse in learning, it is important for them to grasp directly the actions occurred in the learning environment, such as making utterances, facing to other learners, writing memos, etc. Moreover, they should observe the collaborative learning environment appropriately according to their focusing intentions. In this paper, we analyze the activities occurred in the collaborative learning environment, and propose a method for detecting focusing intention of the learner. Then, we address the effective view change based on the focusing intention in the collaborative learning environment. From our experimental result, our method of focusing intention could detect 70% of focusing targets of learners correctly. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
