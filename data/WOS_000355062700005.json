However, the huge amount of data collected by wireless sensors in IoT will impose a big challenge that can only be met by cloud computing. In particular, ensuring security in the cloud-end is necessary. Previous studies have mainly focused on secure cloud-end storage, whereas secure cloud-end computing is much less investigated. The current practice is solely based on Virtual Machines (VM), and cannot offer adequate security because the guest Operating Systems (OS) often can be compromised (e.g., by exploiting their vulnerabilities). This motivates the need of solutions for more secure cloud-end computing. This paper presents the design, implementation and analysis of a candidate solution, called Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which takes advantage of both virtualization and trusted computing technologies simultaneously. The novelty behind TEE is the virtualization of the Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
