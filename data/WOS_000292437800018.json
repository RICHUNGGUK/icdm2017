As with other components, turboTDDFT is optimized to run on a variety of different platforms, from laptops to massively parallel architectures, using native mathematical libraries (LAPACK and FFTW) and a hierarchy of custom parallelization layers built on top of MPI. Program summary Program title: turboTDDFT Catalogue identifier: AEIX_v1_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEIX_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License V 2.0 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 3 559 889 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 254 283 981 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 95 Computer: Any computer architecture Operating system: GNU/Linux, AIX, IRIX, Mac OS X, and other UNIX-like OS's Classification: 16.2, 16.6, 7.7 External routines: turboTDDFT is a tightly integrated component of the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution and requires the standard libraries linked by it: BLAS, UNPACK, FFTW, MPI. Nature of problem: Calculation of the optical absorption spectra of molecular systems. Solution method: The dynamical polarizability of a system is expressed in terms of the resolvent of its Liouvillian super-operator within time-dependent density-functional theory, and calculated using a non-Hermitean Lanczos method, whose implementation does not require the calculation of any virtual states. Pseudopotentials (both norm-conserving and ultrasoft) are used in conjunction with plane-wave basis sets. Restrictions: Spin-restricted formalism. Linear-response regime. No hybrid functionals. Adiabatic XC kernels only. Unusual features: No virtual orbitals are used, nor even calculated. A single Lanczos recursion gives access to the whole optical spectrum. Additional comments: lull The distribution file for this program is over 254 Mbytes and therefore is not delivered directly when download or E-mail is requested. Instead a html file giving details of how the program can be obtained is sent. Running time: From a few minutes for small molecules on serial machines up to many hours on multiple processors for complex nanosystems with hundreds of atoms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
