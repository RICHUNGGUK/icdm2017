Industrial success stories in applying feature models for modeling software product lines, and using them for configuring software-intensive systems motivate academia to discover ways to integrate different feature dependencies into the feature model, and automate verified feature configuration. In this paper we demonstrate how ontologies and Semantic Web technologies facilitate seamless integration of required external services and deployment platform capabilities into the feature model. Furthermore, we also contribute with an algorithm for automating staged configuration using Semantic Web reasoners to discover unfeasible features of the feature model.", "paper_title": "AUTOMATED STAGED CONFIGURATION WITH SEMANTIC WEB TECHNOLOGIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000285583900002"}
