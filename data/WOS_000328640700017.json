The similarity between genetic distance in PC plots and geographical distance has shown to be quite impressive. However, in most situations, individual ancestral origins are not precisely known or they are heterogeneously distributed; hence, they are hardly linked to a geographical area. We have developed GeneOnEarth, a user-friendly web-based tool to help geneticists to understand whether a linear isolation-by-distance model may apply to a genetic data set; thus, genetic distances among a set of individuals resemble geographical distances among their origins. Its main goal is to allow users to first apply a by-view Procrustes method to visually learn whether this model holds. To do that, the user can choose the exact geographical area from an on line 2D or 3D world map by using, respectively, Google Maps or Google Earth, and rotate, flip, and resize the images. GeneOnEarth can also compute the optimal rotation angle using Procrustes analysis and assess statistical evidence of similarity when a different rotation angle has been chosen by the user. An online version of GeneOnEarth is available for testing and using purposes at http://bios.ugr.es/GeneOnEarth.", "paper_title": "GeneOnEarth: Fitting Genetic PC Plots on the Globe", "paper_id": "WOS:000328640700017"}
