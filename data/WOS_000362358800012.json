However, even with the recent development of fast algorithms, learning speed and the ability to handle large-scale tasks are still open problems. This paper proposes algorithms for large-scale support vector machines (SVM) classification and other tasks using additive kernels. First, a linear regression SVM framework for general nonlinear kernel is proposed using linear regression to approximate gradient computations in the learning process. Second, we propose a power mean SVM (PmSVM) algorithm for all additive kernels using nonsymmetric explanatory variable functions. This nonsymmetric kernel approximation has advantages over the existing methods: 1) it does not require closed-form Fourier transforms and 2) it does not require extra training for the approximation either. Compared on benchmark large-scale classification data sets with millions of examples or millions of dense feature dimensions, PmSVM has achieved the highest learning speed and highest accuracy among recent algorithms in most cases.", "paper_title": "Linear Regression-Based Efficient SVM Learning for Large-Scale Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000362358800012"}
