Our method involves the definition of flow path lines in the presence of obstacles, modeling of different types of water forms, and combinations of them in space and tune. There are several notable features with our method: easy setting with little user intervention, modeling of complex water forms that represent more energetic water behavior than has been encompassed by semi-automatic means so far, and the adaptive change of animated Water forms to the variation of obstacle object in number, size, and shape in the water path. A number of formulae for managing shape and time variance in these animations are given. We tested our method with both still and moving objects that have different shape and size in the Water and relevant examples are given in the paper.
