In this paper, we settle this open problem proposed by Papadimitriou [9] fifteen years ago. The result also allows us to derive the computational complexity characterization of a discrete version of the 2-dimensional Brouwer fixed point problem, improving a recent result of Daskalakis, Goldberg and Papadimitriou [4]. Those hardness results for the simplest version of those problems provide very useful tools to the study of other important problems in the PPAD class.", "paper_title": "On the complexity of 2D discrete fixed point problem (extended abstract)", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500043"}
