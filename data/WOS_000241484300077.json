The main aim of this work is to extend the previously introduced SCA-based approach to crowd modeling and simulation, in order to explicitly represent agents' emotional states and to study the role of emotion interaction and diffusion within crowding situations.", "paper_title": "Towards affective situated cellular agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300077"}
