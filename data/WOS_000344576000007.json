Indeed, the history seems sanctioning that the <life-quality> on the earth has been expanding, with enhanced chances and increased resources, compared to the native prospects of the wilderness. Only at the millennium turnover, the ecology globalisation shows the impeding threats of over-depletion/pollution, exceeding the extant recovery and reclamation capabilities of the environment. The new imperative turns to be the <sustainable growth>, with caginess in defining if the trends can be positive, being conditioned by the empowered recycling, retrieval and renovation measures. In fact, sustainability requires lifecycle supply-chain visibility, resource bookkeeping and revamp planning. The lifecycle starts when the idea of a product is born and lasts until complete disposal after realisation and operation. In the musts' specification/analysis, the crucial policy (global plans, detailed design, assembly plots, etc.) are followed by manufacturing, testing, delivery, diagnostics and operation, advertising, service, maintenance, etc.; then, disassembly and firing are scheduled, requiring reclamation and recovery, via re-cycling (material reprocessing) or re-using (part refurbishing). The present study summarises pilot cues for understanding the product-process agendas, using the TYPUS metrics and the KILT model, prospected by the authors, in previous works.", "paper_title": "Understanding the Growth by KILT Model and TYPUS Metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000344576000007"}
