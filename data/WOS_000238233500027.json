The system is composed of a miniaturized pressure measurement capsule and an external receiver. The performance of the telemetry capsule for monitoring pressure in the gastrointestinal tract is demonstrated by the results of animal in-vivo experiments.", "paper_title": "Telemetry capsule for pressure monitoring in the gastrointestinal tract", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500027"}
