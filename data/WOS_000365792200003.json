In particular, the consistent answers of a query on an inconsistent database provide sound semantics and the guarantee that the values obtained are those returned by the query on every repair of the given inconsistent database. In this paper, we carry out a systematic investigation of the data complexity of the consistent answers of conjunctive queries for set-based repairs and with respect to classes of constraints that, in recent years, have been extensively studied in the context of data exchange and data integration. Our results, which range from polynomial-time computability to undecidability, complement or improve on earlier work, and provide a fairly comprehensive picture of the data complexity of consistent query answering. We also address the problem of finding a \"representative\" or \"useful\" repair of an inconsistent database. To this effect, we introduce the notion of a universal repair, as well as relaxations of it, and then apply it to the investigation of the data complexity of consistent query answering.", "paper_title": "On the Data Complexity of Consistent Query Answering", "paper_id": "WOS:000365792200003"}
