In order to investigate the principal features of active adaptation, we developed a human-agent collaborative experimental environment called WAITER (waiter agent interactive training experimental restaurant) and conducted two types of experiments, a Wizard of OZ (WOZ) agent experiment and an autonomous agent experiment. The objective of these experiments is to observe how human users perceive the agents and change their instructions when interacting with adaptive agents. The results indicate that humans can recognize changes in the agent's actions and change their instruction methods accordingly. This implies that active adaptation of the agents may encourage the adaptation of the human users and help to build an adaptation loop between them. The experimental results also suggest that active adaptation may play an important role in a human-agent collaborative task.", "paper_title": "Active adaptation in human-agent collaborative interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000292000700002"}
