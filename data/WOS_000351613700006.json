A computational approach based on elimination theory algorithms is proposed to find invariant surfaces of multidimensional polynomial differential equation systems; this approach allows one to reduce the investigation of the system dynamics to studying the dynamics of a lower-order system. In addition, an effective approach based on the Lyapunov function is proposed to investigate the Andronov-Hopf bifurcation; this approach is used to find such bifurcations in the model under study.", "paper_title": "Qualitative investigation of a gene model using computer algebra algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000351613700006"}
