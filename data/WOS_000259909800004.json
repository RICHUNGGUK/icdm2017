Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, Monograph No. 14, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1953, pp. 49-74, Chapter III], called the causal ordering algorithm (COA), used for constructing the \"causal ordering\" of a system given a complete specification of the system in terms of a set of \"structural\" equations that govern the variables in the system. This algorithm constructs a graphical characterization of the model in a form that we call a partial causal graph. Simon argued in [H.A. Simon, Causal ordering and identifiability, in: W.C. Hood, T.C. Koopmans (Eds.), Studies in Econometric Method. Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, Monograph No. 14, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1953, pp. 4974, Chapter III] and subsequent papers that a graph so generated explicates causal structure among variables in the model. We formalize this claim further by proving that any causal model based on a one-to-one correspondence between equations and variables must be consistent with the COA. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
