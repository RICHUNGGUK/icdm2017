This problem has been studied for more than 20 years with many sufficient conditions, and the asymptotically necessary and sufficient (ANS) conditions with respect to the common-quadratic Lyapunov, function, having being obtained. This paper considers general forms of homogeneous polynomially nonquadratic Lyapunov (HPNQL) function and homogeneous polynomially parameterized nonparallel distributed compensation (HPP-non-PDC) law. By generalization of the procedure based on Polya's theorem and techniques used for parameter-dependent linear matrix inequality (PD-LMI) which have been studied previously in different contexts, ANS stability conditions with respect to the general HPNQL function are obtained.", "paper_title": "Homogeneous Polynomially Nonquadratic Stabilization of Discrete-Time Takagi-Sugeno Systems via Nonparallel Distributed Compensation Law", "paper_id": "WOS:000283370100014"}
