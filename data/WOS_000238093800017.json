Positional information of DNA is utilized for scaling up the address space of the DNA memory. Use of the optical techniques is useful in controlling positional addresses in parallel. We performed some experiments on control of the reactions of hairpin DNA molecules on a microscopic bead. Experimental results demonstrate that operations of writing and erasing of data DNA on a bead for the photonic DNA memory can be achieved by using optical techniques.", "paper_title": "Control of DNA molecules on a microscopic bead using optical techniques for photonic DNA memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000238093800017"}
