Given an arbitrary, not necessarily multi-homogeneous, system, one can ask for the optimal multi-homogenization that would minimize the Bezout number. In this paper it is proved that the problem of computing, or even estimating, the optimal multi-homogeneous Bezout number is actually NP-hard. In terms of approximation theory for combinatorial optimization, the problem of computing the best multi-homogeneous structure does not belong to APX, unless P = NP. Moreover, polynomial-time algorithms for estimating the minimal multi-homogeneous Bezout number up to a fixed factor cannot exist even in a randomized setting, unless BPP superset of NP.", "paper_title": "Computing minimal multi-homogeneous Bezout numbers is hard", "paper_id": "WOS:000245244400014"}
