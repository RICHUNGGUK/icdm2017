CONWIP, one of these production control systems, has a high potential of becoming the best one available because it suits a variety of production environments and is easy to implement. In the following paper, we compare the single-loop and multi-loop CONWIP production control systems for an actual lamp assembly production line producing different kinds of products with discrete distribution processing time and demand. A model is formulated with respect to total cost and service level. A novel rule-based genetic algorithm (GA) approach is proposed for the multi-loop CONWIP system to find the optimum parameter setting. The results have shown that the single-loop CONWIP production control system is more efficient than the multi-loop system. It can greatly decrease the total cost and the WIP (Work-In-Process) with zero shortage probability.", "paper_title": "CONWIP based control of a lamp assembly production line", "paper_id": "WOS:000248610400006"}
