One of the forms of carrying out this hybridization process is by using multi-objective optimization estimation of distribution algorithms (MOEDAs). However, it has been pointed out that current MOEDAs have an intrinsic shortcoming in their model-building algorithms that hamper their performance. In this work, we put forward the argument that error-based learning, the class of learning most commonly used in MOEDAs is responsible for current MOEDA underachievement. We present adaptive resonance theory (ART) as a suitable learning paradigm alternative and present a novel algorithm called multi-objective ART-based EDA (MARTEDA) that uses a Gaussian ART neural network for model-building and a hypervolume-based selector as described for the HypE algorithm. In order to assert the improvement obtained by combining two cutting-edge approaches to optimization an extensive set of experiments are carried out. These experiments also test the scalability of MARTEDA as the number of objective functions increases.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective optimization with an adaptive resonance theory-based estimation of distribution algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000330232900004"}
