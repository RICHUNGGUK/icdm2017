The proposed model, making use of the information from technical indices and candlestick chart, is trained to generate portfolio investment advice. Experimental results on the Japanese stock market show that the decision-making model using time adapting genetic network programming (TA-GNP) method outperforms other traditional models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. A comprehensive analysis of the results is provided, and it is clarified that the TA-GNP method is effective on the portfolio optimization problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
