As the Internet of the future becomes increasingly service centric, this brings with it a number of well established challenges. With large volumes of services, service discovery becomes one of the most decisive issues, and even fundamental tasks such the management and maintenance of services become challenging. Also, as services evolve and change to meet users demands, an efficient delivery mechanism (routing and resource management) is required in the underlying network. In order to address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated bio-inspired service management and distributed routing solution for future service environments. The proposed solution will demonstrate how biological processes can improve both the individual layers of service management and underlying infrastructure, as well as improve overall performance when these two layers are integrated. Simulation results are presented to help validate the proposed solution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
