The activities are properly classified and labeled according to a specific ontology, which guides the reasoning process. The recommender takes into account many different kinds of data: demographic information, travel motivations, the actions of the user on the system, the ratings provided by the user, the opinions of users with similar demographic characteristics or similar tastes, etc. The system has been fully designed and implemented in the Science and Technology Park of Tourism and Leisure. The paper presents a numerical evaluation of the correlation between the recommendations and the user's motivations, and a qualitative evaluation performed by end users. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
