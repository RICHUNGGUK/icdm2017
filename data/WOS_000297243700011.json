In multi-objective optimization problems, the implementation of local search is a non-trivial task, as determining a goal for local search in presence of multiple conflicting objectives becomes a difficult task. In this paper, we borrow a multiple criteria decision making concept of employing a reference point based approach of minimizing an achievement scalarizing function and integrate it as a search operator with a concurrent approach in an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm. Simulation results of the new concurrent-hybrid algorithm on several two to four-objective problems compared to a serial approach, clearly show the importance of local search in aiding a computationally faster and accurate convergence to the Pareto optimal front.", "paper_title": "Improving convergence of evolutionary multi-objective optimization with local search: a concurrent-hybrid algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000297243700011"}
