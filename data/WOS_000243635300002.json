Our rough bottom-up ontologies are based on simple relations like association and inheritance, as well as on value restrictions, and can be used to enrich and update existing upper ontologies. Then, we show how automatically generated assertions based on our bottom-up ontologies can be associated with a flexible degree of trust by nonintrusively collecting user feedback in the form of implicit and explicit votes. Dynamic trust-based views on assertions automatically filter out imprecisions and substantially improve metadata quality in the long run.", "paper_title": "Bottom-up extraction and trust-based refinement of ontology metadata", "paper_id": "WOS:000243635300002"}
