The process is divided into two stages. The first stage is to apply the Process Capability Indices (PCI) for quality management so as to develop a new performance appreciation method. Investors can utilize the ISCI index to rapidly evaluate individual stock performance and then select those stocks which can lead to achieve investment satisfaction. In the second stage, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with moving interval windows is applied to find the optimal investment allocation of the stocks in this portfolio. Based on those algorithms we can ensure investment risk control and obtain a more profitable stock investment portfolio. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
