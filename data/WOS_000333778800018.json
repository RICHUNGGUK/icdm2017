Collective opinions solicited from friends are largely beneficial for online purchase support and can create significant opportunities for sales. In this paper, a social appraisal mechanism composed using the methodologies of social companionship analysis, collective opinion analysis, and consensus decision analysis is proposed for the online users of the micro-blogosphere. The proposed mechanism can successfully summarize collective opinions and expedite the decision-making process that characterizes users' purchasing behaviors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
