Design/methodology/approach - The general structure and the field characteristics of the general systemic yoyo model are employed as the basis of our exploration in this paper. Then, methods of quantitative analysis are introduced to address some of the problems encountered. Findings - Among several new results, many important concepts, such as ring-shaped electric fields, cylinders of equal potential intensities, yoyo resistances, yoyo capacitors, etc. are introduced and studied in some detail. Several important Laws in electromagnetic theory, such as Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's laws, etc. are generalized to the case of the general systemic yoyo model. The refined theory is applied to provide theoretical explanations for some laboratory-observed phenomena that cannot be well illustrated by either Faraday's theory of electromagnetic induction or Lenz's law. Originality/value - Phenomena related to electricity and magnetism are explained the first time in history by using a unified model: the systemic yoyo model. At the same time, some well established Laws in physics are generalized to scenarios of this general mode with the hope that these new Laws can be applied equally well to natural and social sciences in the coming years.", "paper_title": "Ring-shaped composite fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000277539100010"}
