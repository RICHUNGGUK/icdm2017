Previous methods have attempted to filter sparsely sampled MC renders but these methods have high reconstruction overheads. Recent work has shown fast performance for individual effects, like soft shadows and indirect illumination, using axis-aligned filtering. While some components of light transport such as indirect or area illumination are smooth, they are often multiplied by high-frequency components such as texture, which prevents their sparse sampling and reconstruction. We propose an approach to adaptively sample and filter for simultaneously rendering primary (defocus blur) and secondary (soft shadows and indirect illumination) distribution effects, based on a multi-dimensional frequency analysis of the direct and indirect illumination light fields. We describe a novel approach of factoring texture and irradiance in the presence of defocus blur, which allows for pre-filtering noisy irradiance when the texture is not noisy. Our approach naturally allows for different sampling rates for pri- mary and secondary effects, further reducing the overall ray count. While the theory considers only Lambertian surfaces, we obtain promising results for moderately glossy surfaces. We demonstrate 30x sampling rate reduction compared to equal quality noise-free MC. Combined with a GPU implementation and low filtering overhead, we can render scenes with complex geometry and diffuse and glossy BRDFs in a few seconds.", "paper_title": "Factored axis-aligned filtering for rendering multiple distribution effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000340000100024"}
