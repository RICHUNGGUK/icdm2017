When a job makes a run attempt, it learns only whether the attempt succeeded or failed. We first analyze binary exponential backoff, and show that it achieves a makespan of V2(Theta(root log n)) with high probability, where V is the total work of all n contending jobs. This bound is significantly larger than when jobs are constant sized. A variant of exponential backoff, however, achieves makespan O(V log V) with high probability. Finally, we introduce a new protocol, size-hashed backoff, specifically designed for jobs of multiple sizes that achieves makespan O(V log(3) log V). The error probability of the first two bounds is polynomially small in n and the latter is polynomially small in log V.", "paper_title": "Contention resolution with heterogeneous job sizes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200011"}
