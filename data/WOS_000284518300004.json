The scheme is built upon refinement of a family of generalized B-splines that unify classic B-splines with algebraic-trigonometric B-splines and algebraic-hyperbolic B-splines. The scheme of order k produces C(k-2)-continuous limit curves representing such splines. Many known subdivisions are special cases of the proposed subdivision scheme. By assigning an appropriate initial tension parameter, many analytic curves commonly used in engineering applications, such as Lissajous curves, conics, trigonometric function curves, hyperbolic function curves. catenary curves and helixes, etc., can also be exactly defined under the generalized subdivision scheme. Numerous examples are also provided to illustrate how the initial tension parameter and the control points are assigned for reproducing such analytic curves. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
