In information systems, security risks are caused by various interrelated internal and external factors. A security vulnerability could also propagate and escalate through the causal chains of risk factors via multiple paths, leading to different system security risks. In order to identify the causal relationships among risk factors and analyze the complexity and uncertainty of vulnerability propagation, a security risk analysis model (SRAM) is proposed in this paper. In SRAM, a Bayesian network (BN) is developed to simultaneously define the risk factors and their causal relationships based on the knowledge from observed cases and domain experts. Then, the security vulnerability propagation analysis is performed to determine the propagation paths with the highest probability and the largest estimated risk value. SRAM enables organizations to establish proactive security risk management plans for information systems, which is validated via a case study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
