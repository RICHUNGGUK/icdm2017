A noisy environment interacting with the spin network is modeled both in a classical scenario, with a classical fluctuating field, and in a fully quantum scenario, in which the spins are coupled with a bath of harmonic oscillators. We compare the realization of cloning with spin networks and with traditional quantum gates in the presence of noise, and show that spin network cloning is more robust.", "paper_title": "Effects of noise on spin network cloning", "paper_id": "WOS:000239645700010"}
