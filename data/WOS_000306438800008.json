We first analyze the factors need considered in network planning. After introducing the WiMAX-R network architecture, the WiMAX-R network planning process is presented in detail. The process comprises application analysis, capacity prediction, network parameters configuring, coverage planning, handover planning and network simulation validation. In each step, Mobile WiMAX technical features and railway environment characters are both take into consideration. Finally, we simulated a WiMAX-R planning example based on OPNET platform. The simulation results showed that the designed WiMAX-R network can perfectly satisfy the applications' QoS requirements.", "paper_title": "Network Planning for WiMAX-R Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000306438800008"}
