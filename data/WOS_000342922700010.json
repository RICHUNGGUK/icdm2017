The forecast of traffic density reduces traffic congestion and improves transportation mobility. This study describes a novel methodology for traffic prediction by extracting important time-related association rules using an evolutionary algorithm named genetic network programming (GNP). The extracted rules provide a useful means for forecasting the future traffic density level of traffic networks. The proposed methodology is implemented and experimentally evaluated using a large-scale real-time traffic simulator named SOUND/4U. The routing algorithm combined with the traffic prediction was also studied using different environments.", "paper_title": "Traffic Density Prediction with Time-Related Data Mining using Genetic Network Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000342922700010"}
