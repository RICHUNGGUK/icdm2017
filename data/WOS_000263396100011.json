Different terms (i.e., words, phrases, or any other indexing units used to identify the contents of a text) have different importance in a text. The term weighting methods assign appropriate weights to the terms to improve the performance of text categorization. In this study, we investigate several widely used unsupervised (traditional) and supervised term weighting methods on benchmark data collections in combination with SVM and kNN algorithms. In consideration of the distribution of relevant documents in the collection, we propose a new simple supervised term weighting method, i.e., tf.rf, to improve the terms' discriminating power for text categorization task. From the controlled experimental results, these supervised term weighting methods have mixed performance. Specifically, our proposed supervised term weighting method, tf.rf, has a consistently a better performance than other term weighting methods while most supervised term weighting methods based on information theory or statistical metric perform the worst in all experiments. On the other hand, the popularly used tf.idf method has not shown a uniformly good performance in terms of different data sets.", "paper_title": "Supervised and Traditional Term Weighting Methods for Automatic Text Categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000263396100011"}
