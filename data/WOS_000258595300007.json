The classifier provides class probability maps based on class representative local features, and the geodesic active region formulation enables the partitioning of the image according to the region information. We demonstrate automatic segmentation results of the myocardium in cardiac late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) data using coupled level set curve evolutions, in which the classifier is incorporated both from a region term and from a shape term from particle filtering. The results show potential for clinical studies of scar tissue in late CE-MRI data.", "paper_title": "Unifying statistical classification and geodesic active regions for segmentation of cardiac MRI", "paper_id": "WOS:000258595300007"}
