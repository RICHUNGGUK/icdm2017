In this paper an effective method for local bandwidth selection is proposed. For local bandwidth selection, due to data sparsity and other reasons, extremely small bandwidths are sometimes selected, which lead to severe undersmoothing. To circumvent this difficulty, the main idea behind the proposed method is to choose the largest bandwidth that still achieves the optimal rate. When coupled with practical bias reduction techniques, the bandwidth selected from this method can be applied simultaneously to conduct both local point and interval estimation. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which compares favorably with other existing approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
