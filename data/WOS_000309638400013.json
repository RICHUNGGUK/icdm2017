In this paper, we observe that pseudo-M V algebras can be described as monoids with a single negation. This leads to a characterization of pseudo-M V algebras as semiregular L-algebras with negation, especially, the proof neither makes use of the self-similar closure, nor of l-group interval representation. As an application, a new proof of Dvurecenskij's representation theorem for pseudo-MV algebras is obtained.", "paper_title": "Pseudo-MV algebras as L-algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000309638400013"}
