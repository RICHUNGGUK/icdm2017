However, the influence of optimism and pessimism on subjective judgments and the cognitive dissonance that accompanies the decision making process have not been studied thoroughly. This paper presents a new method to reduce cognitive dissonance and to relate optimism and pessimism in multiple criteria decision analysis in an interval-valued fuzzy decision environment. We utilized optimistic and pessimistic point operators to measure the effects of optimism and pessimism, respectively, and further determined a suitability function through weighted score functions. Considering the two objectives of maximal suitability and dissonance reduction, several optimization models were constructed to obtain the optimal weights for the criteria and to determine the corresponding degree of suitability for alternative rankings. Finally, an empirical study was conducted to validate the feasibility and applicability of the current method. We anticipate that the proposed method can provide insight on the influences of optimism, pessimism, and cognitive dissonance in decision analysis studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
