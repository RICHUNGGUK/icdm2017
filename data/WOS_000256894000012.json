Information sources are often insufficient to infer the occurrence of hazards with certainty, requiring recognition to be based on patterns of occurrences distributed over space and time. We introduce a generic framework that supports a quick response to changes in patterns of occurrences, using multiple inferencing techniques. We demonstrate, with a case study of detecting DoS attacks, that our approach is more flexible and accessible than custom-coded solutions, supporting multiple statistical inferencing techniques when such results are available.", "paper_title": "Inference of security hazards from event composition based on incomplete or uncertain information", "paper_id": "WOS:000256894000012"}
