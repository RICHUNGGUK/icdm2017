This contribution presents a methodology and a software tool for the early conceptual design phase, which is characterized by limited and uncertain information on the available process units. The proposed methodology supports the graphical modeling of hierarchical superstructures which are subsequently optimized by a hybrid evolutionary algorithm considering uncertainties in model parameters.
