This paper considers the influence of business-level indicators on network management decisions related to low-level network control mechanisms. It provides a formal understanding of all involved aspects, the representation of the adjustable parameters, and the network control mechanisms that enable the reconfiguration of access network entities from a business perspective (i.e., users' information, operator's goals). The effectiveness of our approach is validated through a simulation environment that we developed on OPNET.", "paper_title": "A Business-Oriented Management Framework for Mobile Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000306175200005"}
