Thus, human intervention is needed to select the heart sound signal with the best quality or the least noise. This paper presents an automatic scheme for optimum sequence selection to avoid such human intervention. A quality index, which is based on finding that sequences with less random noise contamination have a greater degree of periodicity, is defined on the basis of the cyclostationary property of heart beat events. The quality score indicates the overall quality of a sequence. No manual intervention is needed in the process of subsequence selection, thereby making this scheme useful in automatic analysis of heart sound signals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
