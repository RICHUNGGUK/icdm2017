The omega-amino groups of D-Daa(2) and Daa(4) are coupled with)C=0 into the urea, restraining 1 and 2 with 16- and 14-membered rings and leading to potent and impotent mu/delta opioid peptides, respectively. To the current task, we took from an earlier work (Filip et al, J. Pept. Sci. 11(2005)347-352) the NMR NOE- and J-data in H(2)O/D(2)O; and the selection of the ensembles of 1 and 2, 822 and 788 conformational families, respectively, obtained by using the EDMC/ECEPP3 method. Here, we generated ensembles of 1 and 2 using AMBER molecular dynamics in explicit water to eventually selected 686 and 761 conformers for 1 and 2, respectively. We did numbers of fits for both types of the conformational ensembles of I and 2 to their NOE- and J-data using a common method i.e. maximum entropy approach (Groth et al,J. Biomol. NMR 15(1999)315-330). Both types of the well structurally diversified ensembles fit to quite different equilibria in regressions to common experimental NOE- and J-restraints using maximum entropy principle, which is a disappointing message. Intriguing is startlingly small standard deviation in J-couplings: al sigma(JNH alpha H) approximate to 0.01 Hz for LES-MD/AMBER ensemble, contrary to sigma(JNH alpha H) = 0.8 - 1.1 Hz for the EDMC/ECEPP ensemble, over the wide range of entropy, i.e. relatively insensitive to it. A similar feature is not the case when comparing sigma(NoE) in both methods. Hence, at minute entropy contributions, it follows that J does or does not transpose \"overfitted\" into the final sigma(J) in the AMBER or ECEPP ensemble, respectively. Could this be an effect of softness of the AMBER flexible-valence force field compared to ECEPP rigid-geometry, and its effect on ensemble sampling? We do not know an answer. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
