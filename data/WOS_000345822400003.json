Their performance can be measured by their Communication efficiency, defined as the number of links used forever. In this regard, in a communication-efficient algorithm only n links are used forever, n being the number of processes in the system. In this paper, we present communication optimality, a communication efficiency degree reached when only c links are used forever, c being the number of correct processes. We show that c is the minimum number of links used forever required to implement lozenge P and that c is also optimal for lozenge S and Omega when c < n. Finally, we propose two communication-optimal lozenge P algorithms following respectively one-to-all and one-to-one communication patterns to manage suspicions, showing that there is a trade-off between detection latency and sporadic communication overhead.
