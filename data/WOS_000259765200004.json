While Hamori embeds the sequence into Euclidean space, we use analogous embedding into the strong product of graphs, K-4 boxed times P-n with weighted edges. Based on this representation, a novel numerical characterization is proposed which is based on the products of ten eigenvalues from the start and the end of the descending ordered list of the eigenvalues of the L/L matrices associated with DNA. The examination of similarities/dissimilarities among coding sequences of the first exon of the beta-globin gene of different species illustrates the utility of the approach.", "paper_title": "A numerical characterization of modified Hamori curve representation of DNA sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000259765200004"}
