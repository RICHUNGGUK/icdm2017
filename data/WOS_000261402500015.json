In a CBIR system, an image is usually represented as a set of low level descriptors from which a series Of underlying similarity or distance functions are used to conveniently drive the different types of queries. Recent work deals with combination of distances or scores from different and usually independent representations in an attempt to induce high level semantics from the low level descriptors of the images. Choosing the best method to combine these results requires a careful analysis and, in most cases, the use of ad-hoc strategies. Combination based on or derived from product and sum rules are common approaches. In this paper we propose a method to combine a given set of dissimilarity functions, For each similarity function. a probability distribution is built. Assuming statistical independence, these are used to design a new similarity measure which combines the results obtained with each independent function. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
