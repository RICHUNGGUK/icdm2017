Currently, Web service brokerage focuses on centralized or replicated architectures. We argue that such systems are not efficient when it comes to dynamic, respectively ad hoc, Web service provisioning. We propose a distributed peer to peer Web service registry solution based on lightweight Web service profiles. We further introduce the notion of views that allow the specification of arbitrary contexts of Web services and provide a working example to illustrate our approach. Finally, we present a prototype that uses tuple spaces as global storage and communication means.", "paper_title": "Integration of transient Web services into a virtual peer to peer Web service registry", "paper_id": "WOS:000239868700001"}
