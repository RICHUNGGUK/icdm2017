The objective is to maximise the number of targets covered while selecting at most k nodes and at most k(i) channels with each selected node v(i). Our problem is a general case of the maximum coverage problem. We propose two algorithms: the first one is based on linear programming and PIPAGE rounding, in which its approximation ratio is 1/K(1-(1-1/m)(m)), where m is the number of the dominating nodes and K = max k(i). The second algorithm is based on greedy strategy with low time complexity. The simulation shows that the both two algorithms have good performance.", "paper_title": "An approximation algorithm for dominating nodes selection in multi-channel multi-radio wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300741500007"}
