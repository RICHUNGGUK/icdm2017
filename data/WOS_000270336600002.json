In order to alleviate this problem one can decompose the STG into smaller components. This paper deals with the decomposition method of Vogler and Wollowski and introduces several strategies for its efficient implementations. Furthermore, this approach is combined with another method to alleviate state space explosion, which is based on Petri net unfoldings. The developed algorithms are compared by means of benchmark examples, and the experimental results show significant improvement in terms of memory usage and runtime compared with other existing methods.", "paper_title": "STG decomposition strategies in combination with unfolding", "paper_id": "WOS:000270336600002"}
