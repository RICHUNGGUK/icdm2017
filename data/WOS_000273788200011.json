In other words, all data necessary for running the company are available in enterprise models. However, these data are not in the proper format for some tasks such as scheduling and optimization. Namely, the concepts and terminology used in enterprise models are different from what is traditionally used in scheduling and optimization software. This paper deals with the automated translation of data from the enterprise model to a scheduling model and back. In particular, we describe how to extract data from the enterprise model for solving the scheduling problem using constraint-based solvers.", "paper_title": "From enterprise models to scheduling models: bridging the gap", "paper_id": "WOS:000273788200011"}
