Within the VIEW of the Future project (IST-2000-26089), two automotive companies, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Volvo Technology Corporation, had a need for targeted evaluation of practical issues in their potential use of VR/VE technology. PSA Peugeot Citron would like to use visualization technology to accelerate and increase the efficiency of their product design cycle. A series of short experiments were conducted to enable PSA Peugeot Citroen to define the technological specifications of a CAVE-type system they would be purchasing to achieve their design goals. The results documented the fidelity of the visualization environment and user experience of the different configuration set-ups. For example, although passive stereo offered more brightness and better representation of colours, PSA Peugeot Citroen employees preferred active stereo due to the distracting ghosting effect present when using passive stereo. Thus PSA Peugeot Citroen chose to implement active stereo in their new system. There is a need for the engineers at the Volvo product companies to present more realistic vehicle components, e.g. car interior parts, in early product development phases. It is not known if the present computer graphics technology can represent vehicle components with high realism in practical applications. In the study reported here, we investigated the perception of visual appearance of virtual surface materials as well as real material samples by Volvo engineers. There was a general loss of information in the VE material representations, e.g. in terms of depth and colour information resulting in dull images. Further research needs to be conducted to examine different methods of producing virtual materials and compare the differently generated virtual materials, in addition to assessing their realism using different types of display technology. This would enable us to find the best method of virtual material production in conjunction with a system which best displays these virtual representations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
