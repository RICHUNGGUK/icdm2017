We propose a method that can be used to identify every error when the circuit test frequency is higher than the tester frequency. Our approach requires very little extra hardware for diagnosis and the test application time required to identify errors is a linear function of the frequency ratio between the cur and the tester.", "paper_title": "Error identification in at-speed scan BIST environment in the presence of circuit and tester speed mismatch", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290400036"}
