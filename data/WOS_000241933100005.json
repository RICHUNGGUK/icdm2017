It is able to generate error correction signals to drive learning and for the acquisition of memory skills. The cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) is a neural network inspired by the neurophysiologic theory of the cerebellum and is recognized for its localized generalization and rapid algorithmic computation capabilities. The main deficiencies in the basic CMAC structure are: 1) it is difficult to interpret the internal operations of the CMAC network and 2) the resolution (quantization) problem arising from the partitioning of the input training space. These limitations lead to the synthesis of a fuzzy quantization technique and the mapping of a fuzzy inference scheme onto the CMAC structure. The discrete incremental clustering (DIC) technique is employed to alleviate the quantization problem in the CMAC structure, resulting in the fuzzy CMAC (FCMAC) network. The Yager inference scheme.(Yager), which possesses firm fuzzy logic foundation and maps closely to the logical implication operations in the classical (binary) logic framework, is subsequently mapped onto the FCMAC structure. This results in a novel fuzzy neural architecture known as the fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller-Yager (FCMAC-Yager) system. The proposed FCMAC-Yager network exhibits learning and memory capabilities of the cerebellum through the CMAC structure while emulating the human way of reasoning through the Yager. The new FCMAC-Yager network employs a two-phase training algorithm consisting of structural learning based on the DIC technique and parameter learning using hebbian learning (associative long-term potentiation). The proposed FCMAC-Yager architecture is evaluated using an extensive suite of real-life applications such as highway traffic-trend modeling and prediction and performing as an early warning system for bank failure classification and medical diagnosis of breast cancer. The experimental results are encouraging.", "paper_title": "FCMAC-Yager: A novel Yager-inference-scheme-based fuzzy CMAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000241933100005"}
