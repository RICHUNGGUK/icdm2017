In this paper, we propose a language BPEL0 to capture the important features of BPEL4WS, with the scope-based compensation handling mechanism, which allow the users to specify the compensation behaviors of processes in application-specific manners. The operational semantics of BPEL0 is formalized, with some key concepts related to compensation handling, i.e., the compensation closure and compensation context. Based on the achieved semantics, the concept of bisimulation in hierarchy structure is investigated, which is used to define the equivalence between BPEL0 programs.", "paper_title": "Theoretical foundations of scope-based compensable flow language for web service", "paper_id": "WOS:000239478000019"}
