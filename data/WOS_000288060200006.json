As a starting point we study the interplay between two research disciplines that until now have been hardly related to each other: Ayurveda and multi-agent systems. We consider some possible results of the cross fertilisation like for instance the application of ayurvedic knowledge to improve the skills of practical reasoning agents.", "paper_title": "Ayurveda for agents: an attempt to bring the sciences of natural and artificial intelligence closer together", "paper_id": "WOS:000288060200006"}
