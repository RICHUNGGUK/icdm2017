In this paper we propose a novel framework to extract the topology of volumetric data distinguished from the commonly-used piecewise linear framework. The data is reconstructed into a C-2-continuous quasi-interpolated space first by 7-directional box spline, where the value evaluation and differential calculations are both direct and accurate. Then Newton-Armijo method and homotopy continuation method are combined to solve critical points, and topological structures are extracted by connecting saddle-extremum arcs generated by a kind of numerical integral method. The parallel architecture of GPU is also applied to ensure the efficiency of our algorithms. A number of examples illustrate that our framework provides much smoother and clearer results compared with the piecewise linear framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
