Previous work, based on salt bridge calculations, has demonstrated that the L5/5 registration, Milano mutant, and Paris mutant are preferred conformations for apolipoprotein A-I. The salt bridge scoring indicated better energetic scoring in these alignments. The Paris (R151C) and Milano (R173C) mutants indicate a mode of change must be available. To find proper registration, one proposed change is a 'rotationally' independent circular motion of the two protein monomers about the lipid unilamellar bilayer core. Here, we present computational data for independent inter-ring rotation of the two alpha-helical monomers about the lipid unilamellar bilayer core. The simulations presented here support the existing double-belt model. We find the rotation of the two protein monomers is able to occur with biasing. We determine that a cysteine mutant at Glu107 as a possible target for future mutational studies. Since HDL remodeling is necessary for cholesterol transport, our model for remodeling through dynamics has substantial biomedical implications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
