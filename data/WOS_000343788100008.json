More specifically it includes four commonly used distributions from which to simulate data, four estimators of the central orientation, six confidence region estimation procedures and two approaches to visualizing rotation data. All of these features are available for two different parameterizations of rotations: three-by-three matrices and quaternions. In addition, two datasets are included that illustrate the use of rotation data in practice.", "paper_title": "rotations: An R Package for SO(3) Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000343788100008"}
