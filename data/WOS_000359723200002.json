In this study, with the support of remote sensing and Geographic Information System, 4 factor groups comprising 10 separate subfactors of landslide-related data layers were selected to establish a susceptibility evaluation model based on the back-propagation neural network including slope, aspect, plan curvature, strata and lithology, distance to faults, land use/land cover, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Water Index, distance from roads, and effect of rivers. During model development, a three-layered interconnected neural network structure of 10 (input layer) x 20 (hidden layer) x 1 (output layer) was used for evaluating the landslide susceptibility in Guojiaba. At the same time, a back-propagation algorithm was applied to calculate the weights between the input layer and the hidden layer and between the hidden layer and the output layer. The results showed that the effect of slope has the highest weight value (0.2051), which is more than two times that of the other factors, followed by strata and lithology (0.1213) and then the effect of rivers (0.1201). At the end of the susceptibility evaluation, the area was divided into four zones such as very high, high, moderate and low susceptibility. For verification, the receiver operating characteristic curve for the back-propagation neural network-derived landslide susceptibility evaluation model was drawn, and the results showed that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.8790 and the prediction accuracy was 88%. Furthermore, the results obtained from this article were then verified by comparing with the existing landslide historical data and multiple field-verified results. Lastly, the landslide susceptibility map will help decision makers in risk management, site selection, site planning, and the design of control engineering.", "paper_title": "Landslide susceptibility evaluation based on BPNN and GIS: a case of Guojiaba in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area", "paper_id": "WOS:000359723200002"}
