It is based on a syntactic-semantic approach of natural language and it exploits the formalism of conceptual graphs for representing the elements of information related to a domain. ZDoc was developed in order to build lexical, semantic and pragmatic resources used to match graphs on documents. It is thus possible either to locate a given information or to list the elements of information contained in a document or in a document flow.", "paper_title": "Modelling knowledge with ZDoc for the purposes of information retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800112"}
