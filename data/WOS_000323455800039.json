Optimal encoding schemes and efficient heuristics were studied in various settings, while also leading to new results for network coding such as improved gaps between linear and non-linear capacity as well as hardness of approximation. The problem of broadcasting with side information, a generalization of the index coding problem, begins with a sender and sets of users and messages. Each user possesses a subset of the messages and desires an additional message from the set. The sender wishes to broadcast a message so that on receipt of the broadcast each user can compute her desired message. The fundamental parameter of interest is the broadcast rate, beta, the average communication cost for sufficiently long broadcasts. Though there have been many new nontrivial bounds on beta by Bar-Yossef et al. (2006), Lubetzky and Stav (2007), Alon et al. (2008), and Blasiak et al. (2011) there was no known polynomial-time algorithm for approximating beta within a nontrivial factor, and the exact value of beta remained unknown for all nontrivial instances. Using the information theoretic linear program introduced in Blasiak et al. (2011), we give a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing instances with beta = 2 and pinpoint beta precisely for various classes of graphs (e. g., various Cayley graphs of cyclic groups). Further, extending ideas from Ramsey theory, we give a polynomial-time algorithm with a nontrivial approximation ratio for computing beta. Finally, we provide insight into the quality of previous bounds by giving constructions showing separations between beta and the respective bounds. In particular, we construct graphs where beta is uniformly bounded while its upper bound derived from the naive encoding scheme is polynomially worse.", "paper_title": "Broadcasting With Side Information: Bounding and Approximating the Broadcast Rate", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800039"}
