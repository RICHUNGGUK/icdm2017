However, the intrinsically passive features of existing RFID systems, to which we refer as first-generation RFID systems, render their adaptation to real-world dynamics in order to efficiently comply with up-to-date application-specific requirements difficult. To address this challenging issue, we propose an evolution to second-generation RFID systems characterized by the introduction of encoded rules that are dynamically stored in RFID tags. This novel approach facilitates the systems' operation to perform actions on demand for different objects in different situations, and enables improved scalability. Based on 2G-RFID-Sys, we propose a novel e-healthcare management system, and explain how it can be employed to leverage the effectiveness of existing ones. It is foreseeable that the flexibility and scalability of 2G-RFID-Sys will support more automatic and intelligent applications in the future.", "paper_title": "A 2G-RFID-BASED E-HEALTHCARE SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000274816900008"}
