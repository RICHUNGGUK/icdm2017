The controller considered here is designed for a nonholonomic vehicle with on-axle passive trailers. The main problem investigated is the optimal parametrization of the transverse functions in order to ensure low sensitivity to the measurement noise and high tracking accuracy. Theoretical analysis referring to transverse function scaling using dilation is illustrated by results of extensive numerical simulations. Taking into account these results the controller properties are considered. Finally, possibility of the controller implementation is discussed.", "paper_title": "Motion Control of Vehicles with Trailers Using Transverse Function Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000350657800006"}
