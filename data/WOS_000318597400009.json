The main problem with using CIT is that it requires an objective and fast decision algorithm under the constraint of limited available information. In this study, we developed a simple and feasible hierarchical knowledge base construction and test method for efficient concealed information detection based on objective EEG measures. We describe how a hierarchical feature space was formed and which level of the feature space was sufficient to accurately predict concealed information from the raw EEG signal in a short time. A total of 11 subjects went through an autobiographical paradigm test. A high accuracy of 95.23% in recognizing concealed information with a single EEG electrode within about 20 seconds demonstrates effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "A New Method for EEG-Based Concealed Information Test", "paper_id": "WOS:000318597400009"}
