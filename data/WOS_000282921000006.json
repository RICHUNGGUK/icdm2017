These codes are derived from self-dual, quasi self-dual and denser tessellations associated with embeddings of self-dual complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs on the corresponding compact surfaces. The majority of the new classes has the self-dual tessellations as their algebraic and geometric supporting mathematical structures. Every code achieves minimum distance 3 and its encoding rate is such that k/n -> 1as n -> infinity, except for the one case where k/n -> 1/3 as n -> infinity.", "paper_title": "NEW CLASSES OF TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM CODES ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-DUAL, QUASI SELF-DUAL AND DENSER TESSELLATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282921000006"}
