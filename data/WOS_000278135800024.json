However, interactive collaboration systems which control editing of an object among multiple users are often limited to a simple \"locking\" mechanism based on a conventional client/server architecture, where only one user edits the object which is located in a specific server, while all other users become viewers. Such systems fail to provide the needs of a modern day telemedicine applications that demand simultaneous editing of the medical data distributed in diverse local sites. In this study, we introduce a novel system for telemedicine applications, with its application to an interactive segmentation of volumetric medical images. We innovate by proposing a collaborative mechanism with a scalable data sharing architecture which makes users interactively edit on a single shared image scattered in local sites, thus enabling collaborative editing for, e.g., collaborative diagnosis, teaching, and training. We demonstrate our collaborative telemedicine mechanism with a prototype image editing system developed and evaluated with a user case study. Our result suggests that the ability for collaborative editing in a telemedicine context can be of great benefit and hold promising potential for further research.", "paper_title": "Collaborative telemedicine for interactive multiuser segmentation of volumetric medical images", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800024"}
