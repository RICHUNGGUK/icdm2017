We attempt to solve the primal quadratic programming problems of twin SVM by converting them into smooth unconstrained minimization problems. The smooth reformulations are solved using the well-known Newton-Armijo algorithm. The effectiveness of the enhanced method is demonstrated by experimental results on available benchmark datasets.
