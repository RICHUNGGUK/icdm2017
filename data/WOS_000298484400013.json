Generally, the network is configured to observe multiple events and to react upon each individual event accordingly. Time delay, energy efficiency and reliability are three important aspects of WSAN that require special attention. To ensure efficient and reliable operations of such heterogeneous WSAN, new communication protocols are imperative. In this paper, we propose an integrated cluster-based coordination and routing (CCR) framework for WSAN, whose prime objective is to ensure reliable action with efficient energy consumption. In CCR, sensor nodes are first configured to form clusters by taking into account the residual energy of nodes and network density. Once the clusters are formed, cluster-heads coordinate with the actors to form interactive regions. The reliability of action is addressed in terms of in time data delivery to actors in interactive regions and actor-actor coordination to make sure that an actor perform action in the reported region. A novel real-time data aggregation (RDA) approach is also incorporated in the framework to conserve energy by minimizing the number of transmissions and achieve fairness. Simulation experiments prove that the framework achieves energy efficiency and reports in-time event to the actors for reliable actions.
