A modified CNFT equation is introduced and allows for a locally defined inhibition to spatially expand within the network and results in a global competition extending far beyond the range of local connections by virtue of diffusion of inhibition. The resulting model is able to attend to a moving stimulus in the presence of a very high level of noise, several distractors or a mixture of both.", "paper_title": "Dynamic neural field with local inhibition", "paper_id": "WOS:000235368600001"}
