However, the rapid growth of patent documents, the lengthy text and the rich of content in technical terminology, and the complicated relationships among the patents, make it taking a lot of human effort for conducting analyses. As a result, an automated system for assisting the inventors in patent analysis as well as providing support in technological innovation is in great demand. In this paper, a Semantic-based Intellectual Property Management System (SIPMS) has been developed for supporting the management of intellectual properties (IP). It incorporates semantic analysis and text mining techniques for processing and analyzing the patent documents. The method differentiates itself from the traditional technological management tools in its knowledge base. Instead of eliciting knowledge from domain experts, the proposed method adopts global patent databases as sources of knowledge. The system enables users to search for existing patent documents or relevant IP documents which are related to a potential new invention and to support invention by providing the relationships and patterns among a group of IP documents. The method has been evaluated by benchmarking with the performance against traditional text mining technique and has successfully been implemented at a selected reference site. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
