This mechanism can easily find random patterns in the data which will-even though the estimating method itself may be unbiased (such as relative frequency)-have optimistically high quality estimates. It is generally believed that the problem, which eventually leads to overfitting, can be alleviated by using m-estimate of probability. We show that this can only partially mend the problem, and propose a novel solution to making the common rule evaluation functions account for multiple comparisons in the search. Experiments on artificial data sets and data sets from the UCI repository show a large improvement in accuracy of probability predictions and also a decent gain in AUC of the constructed models.", "paper_title": "Why is rule learning optimistic and how to correct it", "paper_id": "WOS:000242308000028"}
