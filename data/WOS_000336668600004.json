The need to integrate these different systems and applications is often prominent for satisfying business requirements and needs. In an effort to help researchers in industrial informatics understand the state-of-the-art of the enterprise application integration, we examined the architectures and technologies for integrating distributed enterprise applications, illustrated their strengths and weaknesses, and identified research trends and opportunities in this increasingly important area.", "paper_title": "Integration of Distributed Enterprise Applications: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600004"}
