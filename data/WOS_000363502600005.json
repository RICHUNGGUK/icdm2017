In order to demonstrate the proposed technique, a four-pole dual-band bandpass filter is designed, fabricated and measured using vector network analyzer. Measurement results which are well agreed with simulation results are presented. Moreover, four-pole substrate integrated folded waveguide SIFW dual-band bandpass filter, using two layers of slotted folded waveguide resonators, is demonstrated. The proposed filter has a compact size and it is excellent candidate for the application of wireless communication systems.
