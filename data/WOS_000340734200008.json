The methodology applies for reduced and integral sliding mode control, both continuous- and discrete-time; it takes advantage of the Finsler's lemma to provide a greater degree of freedom than existing approaches for sliding subspace design. The sliding surfaces thus constructed are systematically found via convex optimization techniques, which are efficiently implemented in commercially available software. Examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "SLIDING SUBSPACE DESIGN BASED ON LINEAR MATRIX INEQUALITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000340734200008"}
