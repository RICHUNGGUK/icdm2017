We present a generalization of the composition of weighted transducers, n-w ay composition, which is dramatically faster in practice than the standard composition algorithm when combining more than two transducers. The worst-case complexity of our algorithm for composing three transducers T(1), T(2), and T(3) resulting in T, is O(vertical bar T vertical bar(Q) min(d(T(1))d(T(3)), d(T(2))) + vertical bar T vertical bar(E)), where vertical bar.vertical bar(Q) denotes the number of states, vertical bar.vertical bar(E) the number of transitions, and d(.) the maximum out-degree. As in regular composition, the use of perfect hashing requires a pre-processing step with linear-time expected complexity in the size of the input transducers. In many cases, this approach significantly improves on the complexity of standard composition. Our algorithm also leads to a dramatically faster composition in practice. Furthermore, standard composition can be obtained as a special case of our algorithm. We report the results of several experiments demonstrating this improvement. These theoretical and empirical improvements significantly enhance performance in the applications already mentioned.", "paper_title": "N-WAY COMPOSITION OF WEIGHTED FINITE-STATE TRANSDUCERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268592200005"}
