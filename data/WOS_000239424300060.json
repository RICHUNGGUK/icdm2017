The development of such systems requires computational efforts which is often challenging and off-putting. The main contribution of our work is the idea to go one step further from sharing user model data (interoperable user models) towards the exchange of user model reasoning strategies (interoperable user modeling). In this paper we discuss, exemplified in a concrete scenario, how Semantic Web techniques may be applied to the field of the Adaptive Systems in order to have a more effective and reliable user model interoperability, considering both the perspectives of User Modeling Servers and Web Servers.", "paper_title": "From interoperable user models to interoperable user modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300060"}
