Since in most databases, the frequency distribution of genes is right skewed, we show here that its use can lead to excessive false-positive discoveries. We propose to apply Zelen's exact test on a stratification of the gene set; this solves the false discovery problem, and should avoid misleading interpretations of lists of genes produced by various genome-wide analysis technologies.
