This problem is a natural extension of minimizing the sum of flow times in the presence of release time by considering the possibility of delivering jobs in batches and introducing batch delivery costs. The scheduling objective adopted is that of minimizing the sum of flow times and delivery costs. The extended problem arises in the context of coordination between machine scheduling and a distribution system in a supply chain network. Structural properties of the problem are investigated and used to devise a branch-and-bound solution scheme. Computational experiments show significant improvement over an existing dynamic programming algorithm. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
