A typical multistage measurement model, that also includes a measurement stage with more than one output quantity is the calculation of the coefficients of a calibration curve, constructed by means of least squares regression and the subsequent use this calibration curve for the estimation of a quantity value. In the present work the Monte Carlo Method was used to evaluate the component of measurement uncertainty from a calibration curve used for the determination of the total nitrogen found in a gasoline sample. The slope and the intercept of the calibration curve were treated as a vector output quantity characterized by a joint probability distribution (bivariate Gaussian) and two types of coverage regions were estimated (rectangular and ellipsoid). The Monte Carlo Method algorithm employing fixed number of trials (10(6)) gave a predicted value of 2.09 mg L-1, a standard measurement uncertainty of 0.04 mg L-1 and a 95% symmetrical coverage interval [2.01-2.17] mg L-1. The standard measurement uncertainty obtained by MCM agrees well with the outcome of the equation giving the standard error of the estimate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
