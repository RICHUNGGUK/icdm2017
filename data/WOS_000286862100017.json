For the class of languages that are generated by RPCGSs with constant communication complexity we derive a characterisation in terms of a restricted type of freely rewriting restarting automaton. From this characterisation we obtain that these languages are semi-linear, and that for RPCGSs with constant communication complexity, the centralised variant has the same generative power as the non-centralised variant.
