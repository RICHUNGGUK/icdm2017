The concept of generalized consistent decision formal context is introduced and its equivalent definitions are examined. We suggest a theory of knowledge reduction for generalized consistent decision formal context and give the judgement theorems and discernibility matrix. Based on discernibility matrix, we provide the approaches to knowledge reduction in generalized consistent decision formal context of concept lattice.
