A GPS spoofer can manipulate PMU time stamps by injecting a counterfeit ensemble of GPS signals into the antenna of the PMU's time reference receiver. A spoofer-induced timing error of only a few tens of microseconds causes a PMU to violate the maximum phase error allowed by the applicable standard. These and other larger errors can give automated or human power grid controllers a false perception of the state of the grid, leading to unnecessary, and possibly destabilizing, remedial control actions. To emphasize this threat, this paper shows that a particular PMU-based automatic control scheme currently implemented in Mexico whose control architecture and setpoints have been published in the open literature could be induced by a GPS spoofing attack to trip a primary generator.
