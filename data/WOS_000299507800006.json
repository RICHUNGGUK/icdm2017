The proposed method is performed at the postplacement stage and consists of three major steps: 1) feasible moving region construction of each register considering timing slack; 2) mesh grid wire generation and placement; and 3) incremental register placement for stub wire minimization considering power density and timing slack. The advantages of the proposed method are the reduced power dissipation-28% on average on the benchmark circuits-the optimized power density, and the guaranteed nonnegative timing slack. These advantages are possible through a decreased timing slack (1.1% of the clock period) and change in the logic wirelength (+5.9%) on the benchmark circuits.", "paper_title": "Integrated Clock Mesh Synthesis with Incremental Register Placement", "paper_id": "WOS:000299507800006"}
