We prove that, in every dimension at least 2, no memoryless online algorithm can achieve a constant competitive ratio, under a weak symmetry constraint on the algorithm. This generalizes in several aspects the lower bounds obtained by Koutsoupias and Taylor [The CNN Problem and other k-server variants, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 324 (2004) 347-359] for the original problem. The proof consists in the analysis of carefully selected random walks, which appear naturally in the framework of memoryless algorithms.
