These systems pose further challenges by having an order of magnitude higher memory requirement due to much wider instruction words than typical VLIW/TTA architectures. Current compression schemes are evaluated. A highly efficient and novel dictionary-based lossless compression technique is implemented and compared against a previous implementation for a reconfigurable system. This paper looks at several conflicting design parameters, such as the compression ratio, silicon area, latency, and power consumption. Compression ratios in the range of 0.32 to 0.44 are recorded with the proposed scheme for a given set of test programs. With these test programs, a 60% overall silicon area saving is achieved, even after the decompressor hardware overhead is taken into account. The proposed technique may be applied to any architecture which exhibits common characteristics to the example reconfigurable architecture targeted in this paper.", "paper_title": "Code Compression and Decompression for Coarse-Grain Reconfigurable Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000261447900002"}
