To accommodate the above issues in a wide-range phase-locked loop (PLL), a self-healing prescaler, a self-healing voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), and a calibrated charge pump (CP) are presented. This PLL is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology and its active area is 0.0182 mm. For the self-healing VCO, its measured frequency range is from 60 to 1489 MHz. When this PLL operates at 855 MHz, the measured rms and peak-to-peak jitters are 8.03 and 55.6 ps, respectively. The measured reference spur is -52.89 dBc. This PLL consumes 4.3 mW from 1.2 V supply without buffers.", "paper_title": "A Wide-Range PLL Using Self-Healing Prescaler/VCO in 65-nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000314022300006"}
