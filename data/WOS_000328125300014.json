The kernel function can transform nonlinear data into a high dimensional feature space. It increases the probability of the linear separability of the patterns within the transformed space and simplifies the associated data structure. According to the distribution of various datasets, three local learning operators are designed; meanwhile double mutation operators incorporated into local learning operators to further enhance the ability of global exploration and overcome premature convergence effectively. The performance comparisons of the proposed method with k-means, kernel k-means, global kernel k-means and spectral clustering algorithms on artificial datasets and UCI datasets indicate that the proposed clustering algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms.", "paper_title": "Kernel clustering using a hybrid memetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000328125300014"}
