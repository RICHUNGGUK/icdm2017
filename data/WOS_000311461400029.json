This information is especially useful when to conduct environmental and human hazard assessment. The most critical rate limiting step in the chemical safety assessment workflow is the availability of high quality data. This paper describes an ADMET structure-activity relationship database, abbreviated as admetSAR. It is an open source, text and structure searchable, and continually updated database that collects curates and manages available ADMET-associated properties data from published literatures. In admetSAR, over 210 000 ADMET annotated data points for more than 96 000 unique compounds with 45 kinds of ADMET-associated properties, proteins, species or organisms have been carefully curated from a large number of diverse literatures. The database provides a user-friendly interface to query a specific chemical profile, using either CAS registry number, common name or structure similarity. In addition, the database includes 22 qualitative classification and 5 quantitative regression models with highly predictive accuracy, allowing to estimate ecological/mammalian ADMET properties for novel chemicals. The admetSAR is accessible free of charge at http://www.admetexp.org.", "paper_title": "admetSAR: A Comprehensive Source and Free Tool for Assessment of Chemical ADMET Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000311461400029"}
