Our scope is to implement a low-power, area-efficient autonomously reconfigurable digital signal processing architecture that is tailored for the realization of arbitrary response FIR filters using Xilinx FPGAs. The implementation of design addresses area efficiency and flexibility allowing dynamically inserting and/or removing the partial modules to implement the partial reconfigurable FIR filters with various taps. This FIR filter design method shows the configuration time improvement, good area efficiency and flexibility by using the dynamic partial reconfiguration method.", "paper_title": "Dynamic partial reconfigurable FIR filter design", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036500005"}
