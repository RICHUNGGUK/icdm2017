In this paper, the global robust stability problem of TS fuzzy cellular neural networks with parameter uncertainties and stochastic perturbations is investigated. Based on the Lyapunov method and stochastic analysis approaches, the globally robust asymptotically stable condition is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be easily solved by some standard numerical packages. A simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.
