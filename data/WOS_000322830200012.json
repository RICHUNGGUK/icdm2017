This paper describes a test compaction procedure that enhances the ability of test-merging to reduce the number of tests in an incompletely specified test set that consists of both broadside and skewed-load tests for transition faults. In a basic step, the procedure attempts to remove a test t by combining it with several other tests, even if the tests are not compatible or have different types. This increases the possibility that all the faults detected by t will be detected by other tests, and t will be removed. Simulation results demonstrate reductions in numbers of tests beyond those achieved by test-merging with the same or lower numbers of specified values.", "paper_title": "On Test Compaction of Broadside and Skewed-Load Test Cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000322830200012"}
