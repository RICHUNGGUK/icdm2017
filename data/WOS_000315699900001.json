The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of fuzzy solutions are proposed and some operators to finding the solution of FSME are exploited. Furthermore, an iterative scheme which can solve two n x n system instead one 2n x 2n system is presented to solving extended fuzzy linear system. Several numerical examples are performed to illustrate developed theory.", "paper_title": "A note on solving the fuzzy Sylvester matrix equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000315699900001"}
