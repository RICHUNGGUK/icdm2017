However, in 1961, Durbin showed that the power of the KS test often can be increased, for a given significance level, by a well-chosen transformation of the data. Simulation experiments reported here show that the power can often be more consistently and substantially increased by a different transformation. We first transform the given sequence to a sequence of mean-1 exponential random variables, which is equivalent to a rate-1 Poisson process. We then apply the classical conditional-uniform transformation to convert the arrival times into i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. And then, after those two preliminary steps, we apply the original Durbin transformation. Since these KS tests assume a fully specified cdf, we also investigate the consequence of having to estimate parameters of the cdf.", "paper_title": "The Power of Alternative Kolmogorov-Smirnov Tests Based on Transformations of the Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000367932100004"}
