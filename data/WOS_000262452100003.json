Incremental diagnosis is essential for on-line diagnosis and the diagnosis is usually performed on-line. However, the observations are often uncertain. To address this problem, a new concept of two restricted successive temporal windows is proposed. Thereafter, an approach is given to support on-line incremental model-based diagnosis of discrete event systems with uncertain observations. All the observation sequences emitted by the previous window can be produced if the second temporal window is long enough (bigger than the maximal delay of transmission). In this way, the global emitted observation sequences can be inferred as well. The proposed approach is sound, complete, timely and universal. In particular, it is well suited for on-line diagnosis of discrete event systems when the received observations are too dense to find, in time, so-called \"sound windows\" by traditional approaches.", "paper_title": "On-line diagnosis of discrete event systems with two successive temporal windows", "paper_id": "WOS:000262452100003"}
