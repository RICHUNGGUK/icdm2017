Modern backbone networks use a mesh of fiber optic cables, which are, due to their ubiquitous deployment, prone to failures. The goal of this paper is to develop efficient computational methods for assessing the expected traffic loss in such networks. We present both analytical and simulation approaches for this problem. Our analytical approach is based on the cut set enumeration technique, while our simulation approach is based on Monte Carlo sampling techniques. To facilitate the computational process, we employ artificial intelligence methods based on genetic algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
