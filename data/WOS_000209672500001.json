Such a connected vehicle solution is expected to be the next frontier for automotive revolution and the key to the evolution to next generation intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). Moreover, connected vehicles are also the building blocks of emerging Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Extensive research activities and numerous industrial initiatives have paved the way for the coming era of connected vehicles. In this paper, we focus on wireless technologies and potential challenges to provide vehicle-to-x connectivity. In particular, we discuss the challenges and review the state-of-the-art wireless solutions for vehicle-to-sensor, vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-Internet, and vehicle-to-road infrastructure connectivities. We also identify future research issues for building connected vehicles.", "paper_title": "Connected Vehicles: Solutions and Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000209672500001"}
