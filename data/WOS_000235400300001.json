We present an ontology-based semantic mediation approach and its application to spatial system interoperability. The approach is based oil three contexts described by ontologies used to capture the semantics of data sources and to resolve their semantic discrepancies. The global ontology context defines generic application domain mediation concepts while the ontology local contexts are devoted to the description of local concepts. The cooperation contexts provide semantic concepts that encapsulate three key components: (1) semantic roles defined by ontological agreements oil the global ontology, (2) virtual views defined oil the local ontologies, and (3) context transformation mappings used to define interontology relationships. We illustrate the proposed mediation approach on spatial information systems, relying on the description and reasoning capabilities of OWL to establish relations between concepts of the different ontologies.
