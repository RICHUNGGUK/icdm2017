It is a first application of anticipatory learning to a real world exploration tasks. The results of experiments with Monk's, Voting-record and WBC problems are shown as well as comparison of these results with other systems is presented. ACS handles these tasks quite well even though it is designed for a different kind of problems. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
