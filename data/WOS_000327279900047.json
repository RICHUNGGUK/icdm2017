However, it still remains a challenging problem due to the insufficient nature of word occurrences in short-text documents, although some recently developed methods which exploit syntactic or semantic information have enhanced performance in short-text classification. The language-dependency problem, however, caused by the heavy use of grammatical tags and lexical databases, is considered the major drawback of the previous methods when they are applied to applications in diverse languages. In this article, we propose a novel kernel, called language independent semantic (LIS) kernel, which is able to effectively compute the similarity between short-text documents without using grammatical tags and lexical databases. From the experiment results on English and Korean datasets, it is shown that the LIS kernel has better performance than several existing kernels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
