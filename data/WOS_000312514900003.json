Each solution provides a specific functionality and/or requires operations of particular nodes. The current trend is towards the co-existence of these solutions, though the impact of doing so has not been yet fully understood. This article reviews key standards for providing IP mobility support, the functionality achieved by combining them, and the performance cost of each combination in terms of protocol overhead and handover latency. We show that combining different mobility mechanisms has a non-negligible cost. Finally we identify a strategy for combining mobility protocols and properties that facilitate this combination.
