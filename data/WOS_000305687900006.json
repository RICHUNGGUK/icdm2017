It is necessary that the system meets the deadlines of program execution and the system reliability requirements implying that the system must tolerate both hardware and software failures. The formal statement of this problem is presented, a method for its solution using an iterative scheduling algorithm based on the method of simulated annealing is proposed, and an experimental study of the proposed algorithm is conducted.", "paper_title": "Algorithm for synthesis of real-time systems under reliability constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000305687900006"}
