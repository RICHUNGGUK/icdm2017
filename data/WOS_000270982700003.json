We used a public multimodal mixed reality installation, the Synthetic Oracle, and a between-groups design to study the effects of implicit (e. g., passively walking) or explicit (e. g., pointing) interaction modes on the users' emotional and engagement experiences, and we assessed it using questionnaires. Additionally, real-time arm motion data was used to categorize the user behavior and to provide interaction possibilities for the explicit interaction group. The results show that the online behavior classification corresponded well to the users' interaction mode. In addition, contrary to the explicit interaction, the engagement ratings from implicit users were positively correlated with a valence but were uncorrelated with arousal ratings. Interestingly, arousal levels were correlated with different behaviors displayed by the visitors depending on the interaction mode. Hence, this study confirms that the activity level and behavior of users modulates their experience, and that in turn, the interaction mode modulates their behavior. Thus, these results show the importance of the selected interaction mode when designing users' experiences in VMRE.", "paper_title": "The Effects of Explicit and Implicit Interaction on User Experiences in a Mixed Reality Installation: The Synthetic Oracle", "paper_id": "WOS:000270982700003"}
