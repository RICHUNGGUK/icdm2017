By virtue of the topological map whose nodes are represented with the free beams of the laser range finder together with the visual scale-invariant features, the mobile robot can autonomously navigate in unknown, large-scale and indoor environments. Different from the traditional navigation methods that rely on precise global localization, the robot locates itself qualitatively by location recognition rather than calculating its global pose in the world reference frame. By combining the reactive navigational method, Beam Curvature Method (BCM), with the topological map, a smooth, real-time navigation without precise localization can be realized.
