The new bounds coincide and yield single-letter capacity characterizations for a class of channels with the state process known at the receiver, including channels whose long-term marginal state distribution is independent of the input process. Analogous results are established for finite-state multiple access channels.", "paper_title": "Tighter Bounds on the Capacity of Finite-State Channels Via Markov Set-Chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000282001700003"}
