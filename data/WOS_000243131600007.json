The SASMINT system introduced in this paper proposes a (semi-) automated approach to tackle the following: 1) identification of the syntactic/semantic/structural similarities between the donor and recipient schemas to resolve their heterogeneities, 2) suggestion of corresponding mappings among the pairs of matched components, 3) facilitation of user-interaction with the system, necessary for validation/enhancement of results, and 4) generation of a proposed integrated schema, and a set of derivation rules for each of its components to support query processing against integrated sources. Unlike other systems that typically apply one specific algorithm, SASMINT applies a hybrid approach for schema matching that combines a selection of algorithms from NLP and graph theory. Furthermore, SASMINT exploits the user-validated schema matching results in its semi-automatic generation of the integrated schema and its necessary derivations.", "paper_title": "SASMINT system for database interoperability in collaborative networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243131600007"}
