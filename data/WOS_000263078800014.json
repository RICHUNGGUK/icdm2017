Let P and V be a prover and a verifier in GPS and < g > be a multiplicative group. P holds a secret key s is an element of [0,S) and publishes I = g(-1). In each elementary round: (1) P sends to V x = g(r) where r is chosen randomly from [0,A), (2) V sends to P a random c is an element of [0, B), and (3) P sends y = r+cs (no modulus computation). Since there is no modular reduction on y, a key issue is whether GPS leaks information about s. It has been proved that GPS is statistical zero-knowledge, if in asymptotic sense, lBS/A is negligible, where e is the number of elementary rounds in one complete identification trial. In this paper, first we will show the followings. (1) We can construct a concrete attack procedure which reveals one bit of secret key s from the specified value range of y unless BS/A is negligible. We reconfirm that we must set A extremely large compared to BS. (2) This drawback can be avoided by modifying GPS into a new scheme, GPS(+), in which P does not send the value of y in the specified range where y reveals some information about s. GPS(+) ensures perfect ZK only by requiring both A > BS and A being a multiple of the order of y, while it allows an honest P to be rejected with probability at most BS/(2A) in one elementary round. Under the standard recommended parameters for 80-bit security where l = 1, vertical bar S vertical bar = 160, and vertical bar B vertical bar = 35, vertical bar A vertical bar = 275 is recommended for GPS in GPS' paper. On the other hand, GPS' can guarantee 80-bit security and less than one false rejection on average in 100 identifications with only vertical bar A vertical bar = 210 with the same parameters as above. In practice, this implies 275-210 = 65 bits (approximate to 24%) reductions on storage requirement. We have confirmed that the reduce of A also reduces approximately 4% of running time for online response using a certain implementation technique for GPS' by machine experiment.", "paper_title": "A New 'On the Fly' Identification Scheme: An Asymptoticity Trade-Off between ZK and Correctness", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078800014"}
