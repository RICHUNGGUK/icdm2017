The fact that the flow-cut gap in general graphs can be large, poses some difficulty in establishing a hardness result. Instead, the authors introduce a single-source version of the problem where the flow-cut gap is known to be one. They then show that this restricted problem is coNP-Hard. This version also captures, as special cases, the fractional relaxations of several problems including the spanning tree problem, the Steiner tree problem, and the shortest path problem.
