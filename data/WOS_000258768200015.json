In this paper, it is first shown that the temperature dependences of the mobility and the saturation velocity need to be treated separately in modeling the current with the temperature effects. A new compact temperature-dependent model for the ON-current is presented based on the alpha-power law and is verified with BSIM3. Then, the scaling of the ON-current temperature dependence is discussed. It is also shown in this paper that the temperature effects will have an increasing impact on repeater-insertion methodology. Furthermore, the temperature-dependence scaling of the leakage current is analyzed. It is shown that its temperature dependence decreases with technology scaling, but temperature-aware power-reduction techniques will actually save larger fraction of the total power due to the increasing dominance of leakage power.", "paper_title": "On the scaling of temperature-dependent effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000258768200015"}
