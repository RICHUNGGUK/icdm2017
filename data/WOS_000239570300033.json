There are three aspects that our language framework would like to focus on. Firstly, the content server can specify its intended authorization and task to multiple web intermediary proxies in its content objects easily. Secondly, a web intermediary performing value-added services through content adaptation needs to leave its modification footprints for possible verification by client. Thirdly, a client is facilitated to verify the received message with the server's authorizations and intermediaries' footprints without affecting his perceived web latency. We demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of this language framework through its actual implementation.", "paper_title": "Data integrity related markup language and HTTP protocol support for web intermediaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300033"}
