We demonstrate high accuracy of the approximate solutions for general diffusion tensors, the second-order convergence rate for the scalar unknown and the first order convergence rate for the vector unknown on smooth or slightly distorted meshes, on non-matching meshes, and even on meshes with irregular-shaped polyhedra with flat faces. We show that in general the meshes with non-flat faces require more than one flux unknown per mesh face to get optimal convergence rates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
