Subsequent structural refinements were performed to mimic the receptor's natural membrane environment by using molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the GBSW implicit membrane model. Through molecular docking and further simulations, possible binding modes of subtype-selective alpha(1A)-AR antagonists, Silodosin, RWJ-69736 and (+)SNAP-7915, were examined. Results of the modeling and docking studies are qualitatively consistent with available experimental data from mutagenesis studies. The homology model built should be very useful for designing more potent subtype-selective alpha(1A)-AR antagonists and for guiding further mutagenesis studies.", "paper_title": "Computational studies of the binding site of alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonists", "paper_id": "WOS:000258611500009"}
