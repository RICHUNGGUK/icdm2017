The system is developed with a view to improve decision analysis and support for users or companies. In order to achieve the object of decision support for the user, we provide a graphic user interface (GUI) to support user making decision real time. User can simulate the real condition via GUI in our electric taxi DAR operation system to observe the simulation process and the result to help reasonable decision-making immediately. We validate our multi-agent simulation model with the electric taxi DAR operation system case study. Finally, according to the analysis result, we demonstrate that our multi-agent simulation model and GUI can help users or companies quickly make a quality and accurate decision to reduce the decision-making cost and time. In this condition, users or companies can strengthen their competitive advantage and response ability with the reduction of decision-making risk. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
