Many transactional memory systems have been proposed to be used to solve the synchronization problem of multicore processors. Hardware transactional memory is one of the critical methods to speedup communications in multicore environment. In this paper, we give a review of the current hardware transactional memory systems for multicore processors. We take a top-down approach to characterizing and classifying various hardware transactional design issues and present a taxonomy of hardware transactional memory systems which is consist of the five fundamental design issues: version management, conflict detection, contention management, virtualization and nesting. Finally, we discussed the active research challenge: the relationship between transactional memory and Input/Output operations and system calls. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier BM.
