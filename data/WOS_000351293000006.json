Design/methodology/approach - The proposed model was empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 318 users on their perceptions of mobile SNSs. A structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the relationships of the research model. Findings - The results revealed that mobile convenience, service compatibility, security risk, and cognitive effort have a significant and indirect impact on the user acceptance of mobile SNSs through their respective paths on hedonic value and utility value. Practical implications - Mobile SNSs practitioners should focus on enhancing users' mobile value through perceived benefits, lower perceived costs, and simultaneously developing social influence to further boost users' intention to use for mobile social networking services. Originality/value - This study contributes to a theoretical understanding of factors that explain users' intention to use the mobile SNSs.", "paper_title": "Predicting mobile social network acceptance based on mobile value and social influence", "paper_id": "WOS:000351293000006"}
