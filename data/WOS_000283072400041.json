We first prove a \"unit-resource\" capacity theorem that applies to the scenario where only the above three noiseless resources are available for consumption or generation. The optimal strategy mixes the three fundamental protocols of teleportation, superdense coding, and entanglement distribution. We then provide an achievable rate region and a matching multiletter converse for the \"direct-static\" capacity theorem. This theorem applies to the scenario where a large number of copies of a noisy bipartite state are available (in addition to consumption or generation of the above three noiseless resources). Our coding strategy involves a protocol that we name the classically assisted state redistribution protocol and the three fundamental protocols. We finally provide an achievable rate region and a matching multiletter converse for the \"direct-dynamic\" capacity theorem. This theorem applies to the scenario where a large number of uses of a noisy quantum channel are available in addition to the consumption or generation of the three noiseless resources. Our coding strategy combines the classically enhanced father protocol with the three fundamental unit protocols.", "paper_title": "Trading Classical Communication, Quantum Communication, and Entanglement in Quantum Shannon Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000283072400041"}
