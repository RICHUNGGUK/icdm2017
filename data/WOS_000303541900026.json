Molecular imprinting is a technique for the preparation of polymer materials with specific molecular recognition receptors. The preparation of imprinted polymers requires polymer precursors such as functional monomer, cross-linking monomer, solvent, an initiator of polymerization and thermal or UV radiation. A virtual library of functional monomers was prepared based on interaction binding scores computed using HyperChem Release 8.0 software. Initially, the possible minimum energy conformation of the monomers and BAP were optimized using the semi-empirical (PM3) quantum method. The binding energy between the functional monomer and the template (BAP) was computed using the Hartree-Fock (HF) method with 6-31 G basis set, which is an ab initio approach based on Moller-Plesset second order perturbation theory (MP2). From the computations, methacrylic acid (MAA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) were selected for preparation of BAP imprinted polymer. The larger interaction energy (Delta E) represents possibility of more affinity binding sites formation in the polymer, which provides high binding capacity. The theoretical predictions were complimented through adsorption experiments. There is a good agreement between experimental binding results and theoretical computations, which provides further evidence of the validity of the usefulness of computational screening procedures in the selection of appropriate MIP precursors in an experiment-free way.", "paper_title": "Combinatorial screening of polymer precursors for preparation of benzo[alpha] pyrene imprinted polymer: an ab initio computational approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000303541900026"}
