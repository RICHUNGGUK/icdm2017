This paper first classifies and summarizes the study of attacks against anonymous communication system in recent years, then analyzes the trend of the research on different attack technologies; secondly, it provides a comparative analysis of defense capability the mainstream anonymous communication system to the various attacks; Finally, combining the advantages and disadvantages of different systems, the authors propose an improved node selection and router forwarding algorithms for anonymous communication systems, and design an architecture of anonymous communications software based on the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Towards Attacks and Defenses of Anonymous Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000361372000030"}
