Adaptive feature extraction circuits are assisted by hardware embedded training to dynamically activate only the most relevant features. This selection is done in a context- and power cost-aware manner, through modification of the C4.5 algorithm. As proof-of-principle, a Voice Activity Detector illustrates the context-dependent relevance of features, demonstrating average circuit power savings of 70%, without accuracy loss. The RECAS database developed for experimenting with this context- and dynamic resource-cost-aware training is presented and made open-source for the research community. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
