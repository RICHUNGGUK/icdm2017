Measurement and maximization of network resilience that accounts for both in the context of intermodal freight transport are addressed herein. That is, the problem of measuring a network's maximum resilience level and simultaneously determining the optimal set of preparedness and recovery actions necessary to achieve this level under budget and level-of-service constraints is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program. An exact methodology, employing the integer L-shaped method and Monte Carlo simulation, is proposed for its solution. Optimal allocation of a limited budget between preparedness and recovery activities is explored on an illustrative problem instance involving a network abstraction of a United States rail-based intermodal container network.
