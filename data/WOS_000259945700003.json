And WSN has emerged as an event-driven paradigm based on the collective effort of numerous sensing nodes. Data aggregation, eliminating data redundancy to improve the energy efficiency, is essential for WSNs. Moreover, due to dynamic topology and random deployment, incorporating adaptive behavior into protocols for WSNs is very important. Hence, we propose an adaptive data aggregation (ADA) scheme for clustered WSNs in this paper. In ADA scheme, the temporal aggregation degree controlled by the reporting frequency at sensor nodes and the spatial aggregation degree controlled by the aggregation ratio at cluster heads (CHs) are determined by the current scheme state according to the observed reliability. Furthermore, the function of the ADA scheme is mainly performed at sink node, with a little function at CHs and sensor nodes. Performance results show that the scheme state converges to the desired reliability starting from any initial state. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.
