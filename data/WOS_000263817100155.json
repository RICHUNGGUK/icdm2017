The objective of FSSP is to find an appropriate sequence of jobs in order to minimize makespan. Makespan means the maximum completion time of a sequence of jobs running on the same machines in flow-shops. By the RK encoding scheme, we can exploit the global search ability of PSO thoroughly. By the IE scheme, we can enhance the local search ability of particles. The experimental results show that the solution quality of FSSP based on the proposed HPSO is far better than those based on CA [Lian, Z., Gu, X., & Jiao, B. (2008).
