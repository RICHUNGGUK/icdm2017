The first setting we consider is that of quantum rate-distortion coding with the help of a classical side channel. Our result here is that the regularized entanglement of formation characterizes the quantum rate-distortion function, extending earlier work of Devetak and Berger. We also combine this bound with the entanglement-assisted bound from our prior work to obtain the best known bounds on the quantum rate-distortion function for an isotropic qubit source. The second setting we consider is that of quantum rate-distortion coding with quantum side information (QSI) available to the receiver. In order to prove results in this setting, we first state and prove a quantum reverse Shannon theorem with QSI (for tensor-power states), which extends the known tensor-power quantum reverse Shannon theorem. The achievability part of this theorem relies on the quantum state redistribution protocol, while the converse relies on the fact that the protocol can cause only a negligible disturbance to the joint state of the reference and the receiver's QSI. This quantum reverse Shannon theorem with QSI naturally leads to quantum rate-distortion theorems with QSI, with or without entanglement assistance.", "paper_title": "Quantum Rate-Distortion Coding With Auxiliary Resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000324573500039"}
