Then, we introduce transition systems as semantics of the controlled hybrid systems and consider a control specification given by a predicate. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the predicate to be control-invariant. Next, we show that there always exists the supremal control-invariant subpredicate for any predicate. Finally, we propose a procedure to compute it and obtain a sampled-data event controller which satisfies it.", "paper_title": "Sampled-Data Event Control of Hybrid Systems for Control Specifications Given by Predicate", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078600034"}
