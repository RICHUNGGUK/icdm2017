Thus, a process called color filter array interpolation is required to reconstruct a full-color image. In this paper, an efficient interpolation scheme which exploits both spatial and inter-channel correlations is presented. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in terms of visual quality and PSNR. Furthermore, the proposed method requires low computational complexity, so it can be applied to many real-time applications where the VLSI implementation is required.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT COLOR INTERPOLATION METHOD FOR DIGITAL STILL CAMERA", "paper_id": "WOS:000275222300028"}
