Although several papers have investigated the beauty and usefulness of this data structure in the full-text indexing scenario, its impact on data compression has not been fully explored. In this paper we provide a complete theoretical analysis of a wide class of compression algorithms based on Wavelet Trees. We also show how to improve their asymptotic performance by introducing a novel framework, called Generalized Wavelet Trees, that aims for the best combination of binary compressors (like, Run-Length encoders) versus non-binary compressors (like, Huffman and Arithmetic encoders) and Wavelet Trees of properly-designed shapes. As a corollary, we prove high-order entropy bounds for the challenging combination of Burrows-Wheeler Transform and Wavelet Trees.", "paper_title": "The myriad virtues of wavelet trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500049"}
