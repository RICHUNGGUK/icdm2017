There are many types of virtualization techniques that can be employed on many levels from simple sandbox to full fledged streamlined managed access. While scaling, software lifecycles and diversity are just some of security challenges faced by VM developers the failure to properly implement those mechanisms may lead to VM escape, host access, denial of service and more. There are many exploits found in the last couple of years which were fixed on latest versions but some systems are still running them and vulnerable as presented, mostly to host based attacks and some have dramatic consequences.", "paper_title": "Virtual machine security challenges: case studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000348040800007"}
