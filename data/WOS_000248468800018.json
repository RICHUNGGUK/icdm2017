A set of local invariant features is extracted independently from each view. First we propose a new view-ordering algorithm that organizes all the unordered views into clusters of related (i.e. the same scene) views by efficiently computing the view-similarity values of all view pairs by reasonably selecting part of extracted features to match. Second a robust two-view matching algorithm is developed to find initial matches, then detect the outliers and finally incrementally find more reliable feature matches under the epipolar constraint between two views from dense to sparse based on an assumption that changes of both motion and feature characteristics of one match are consistent with those of neighbors. Third we establish the reliable multi-view matches across related views by reconstructing missing matches in a neighboring triple of views and efficiently determining the states of matches between view pairs. Finally, the reliable multi-view matches thus obtained are used to automatically track all the views by using a self-calibration method. The proposed methods were tested on several sets of real images. Experimental results show that it is efficient and can track a large set of multi-view feature matches across multiple widely separated views. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society.
