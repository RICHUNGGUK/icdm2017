In this article, the site of O-glycosylation was studied using the correlation-based feature subset (CfsSubset) selection method combined with a wrapper method. Twenty-three important biochemical features were found based on a jackknife test from original data set containing 4779 features. By using the AdaBoost method with the twenty-three selected features, the prediction model yields an accuracy rate of 88.1% for the jackknife test and 87.5% for an independent set test, with increased accuracy over the original dataset by 8.5% and 10.42%, respectively. It is expected that our feature selection scheme can be referred to as a useful assistant technique for finding effective competitive inhibitors of GalNAc-transferase.
