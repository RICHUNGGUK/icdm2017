The time-domain quantization error is digitally extracted and shaped by an asynchronous digital filter. This digitally filtered quantization error is applied to the quantizer input to increase the modulator's noise-shaping order. By using this technique in continuous-time sigma-delta modulators, the modulator's shaping property is significantly enhanced. Comparative analytical calculations and simulation results are presented to estimate the performance of modulators employing the proposed quantizer. System-level simulation results reveal a (L + 2)th order noise-shaping capability of the proposed modulator while it employs only L analog integrators. The effects of main circuit non-idealities in the modulator's performance are analytically investigated and confirmed by the simulation results.", "paper_title": "A time-domain noise-coupling technique for continuous-time sigma-delta modulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000330207600018"}
