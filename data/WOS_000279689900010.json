Furthermore, the behavior of the non-zero equilibrium point of Lorenz system is also investigated, and several sufficient and necessary conditions are provided for locally exponential stability and instability. The established theorems in this paper develop and extend the existing achievements on Lyapunov stability of Lorenz system. In conclusion, by applying the obtained results, some less conservative feedback-control laws are derived to guarantee the globally exponential stability of the chaos control of Chen system, Lu system, Yang-Chen system and Yu-Xia Li system.", "paper_title": "Sufficient and necessary conditions for Lyapunov stability of Lorenz system and their application", "paper_id": "WOS:000279689900010"}
