This paper presents a self-healing process that quantifies incident degrees of workflow activities from metrics measuring long-tail effect, application efficiency, data transfer issues, and site-specific problems. These metrics are simple enough to be computed online and they make little assumptions on the application or resource characteristics. From their degree, incidents are classified in levels and associated to sets of healing actions that are selected based on association rules modeling correlations between incident levels. We specifically study the long-tail effect issue, and propose a new algorithm to control task replication. The healing process is parametrized on real application traces acquired in production on the European Grid Infrastructure. Experimental results obtained in the Virtual Imaging Platform show that the proposed method speeds up execution up to a factor of 4, consumes up to 26% less resource time than a control execution and properly detects unrecoverable errors.
