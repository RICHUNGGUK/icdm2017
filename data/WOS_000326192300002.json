A new nonlinear finite element model for the dynamic analysis is employed to describe nonlinear modeling for three-dimensional flexible link manipulators, in which both the geometric elastic nonlinearity and the foreshortening effects are considered. In comparison to other large deformation formulations, the motion equations contain constant stiffness matrix because the terms arising from geometric elastic nonlinearity are moved from elastic forces to inertial, reactive and external forces, which are originally nonlinear. This makes the formulation particularly efficient in computational terms and numerically more stable than alternative geometrically nonlinear formulations based on lower-order terms. In this investigation, the computational method to solve the trajectory planning problem is based on the indirect solution of open-loop optimal control problem. The Pontryagin's minimum principle is used to obtain the optimality conditions, which is lead to a standard form of a two-point boundary value problem. The proposed approach has been implemented and tested on a single-link very flexible arm and optimal paths with minimum effort and minimum vibration are obtained. The results illustrate the power and efficiency of the method to overcome the high nonlinearity nature of the problem.", "paper_title": "Optimal Trajectory Planning for Flexible Link Manipulators with Large Deflection Using a New Displacements Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000326192300002"}
