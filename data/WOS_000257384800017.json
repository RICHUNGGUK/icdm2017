Although 2D mosaics have attracted a lot of attention in graphics research, the same is not true for 3D mosaics. We present in this paper a technique to simulate 3D mosaics where the size of the individual pieces vary according to the local geometry. Previous work on this topic have addressed the problem of mosaics with tiles of the same size. The user specifies the number of tiles and our system covers a given 3D shape with square-shaped tiles with size adjusted according to the local curvature of the surface. The user can also controls the number of tiles, orientation on the surface, and relative size of tiles.", "paper_title": "3D mosaics with variable-sized tiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000257384800017"}
