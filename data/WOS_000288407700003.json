Building on self-regulation theory, we examined how satisfaction in the virtual-world was affected by these personality differences. A field study was conducted to attempt to understand this; it involved 297 students engaged in a virtual tutorial group using Second Life. We found that small variations in personality between the virtual and real world groups (such as being helpful, sociable, seeking recognition, or submissive) could lead to greater satisfaction of the discussion.
