For m = 2 we determine optimal weights and analyze in detail what is the impact of the ratio |S (1)|/|S (2)| on the minimum distance. In conclusion the weighted Reed-Muller code construction is much better than its reputation. For a class of affine variety codes that contains the weighted Reed-Muller codes we then present two list decoding algorithms. With a small modification one of these algorithms is able to correct up to 31 errors of the [49,11,28] Joyner code.", "paper_title": "Weighted Reed-Muller codes revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000313056200014"}
