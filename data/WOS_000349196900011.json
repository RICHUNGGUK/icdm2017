An approach is to formulate the problem as an inverse optimization problem, in which the amounts of damage to each element are considered as the optimization variables. The objective is to set these variables such that the characteristics of the model correspond to the experimentally measured characteristics of the actual damaged structure. Since the structures are usually symmetric, this is an optimization problem with several global optimal solutions each representing a probable state of damage, where unlike many other optimization problems, it is not enough to merely find one of these optimal solutions; it is important to capture all such possible states and to compare them. In this paper, structural damage detection of planar and spatial trusses using the changes in structures' natural frequencies and mode shapes is addressed. An improved Charged System Search algorithm is developed and utilized to tackle the problem of finding as many global optimal solutions as possible in a single run. A 10-bar planar truss and a 72-bar spatial truss are considered as numerical examples. Experimental results show that it is important to incorporate mode shapes in order to determine the actual damage scenario among other possibilities. (C) 2014 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
