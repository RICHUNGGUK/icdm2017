The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold, below which iterative decoding fails to converge, is predicted by using the 3-D EXIT chart analysis. Bit error rate performances of TAPPM schemes validate the EXIT-chart-based SNR threshold predictions. Outer constituent codes of TAPPM are chosen to show the lowest SNR threshold with the aid of EXIT chart analysis.", "paper_title": "Convergence Analysis of TAPPM Decoders for Deep Space Optical Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000308261100030"}
