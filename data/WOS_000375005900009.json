The first study showed that people could distinguish between mono, stereo, Dolby surround and 3D audio of a wasp. The second study found significant effects for audio techniques on people's self-reported anxiety, presence, and spatial perception. The third study found that adding sound to a visual virtual world had a significant effect on people's experience ( including heart rate), while it found no difference in experience between stereo and 3D audio.", "paper_title": "The Effect Of 3D Audio And Other Audio Techniques On Virtual Reality Experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000375005900009"}
