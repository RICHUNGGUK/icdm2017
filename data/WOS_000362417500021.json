We first present an energy functional and then deduce a new energy functional from it by adding two barriers. The proposed model is defined as a constrained optimization problem associated with the deduced energy functional. Next, an alternating minimization scheme is used to solve the proposed model. Some theoretic analyses are given for the proposed model and algorithm. Finally, numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed model with its algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Variational Model with Barrier Functionals for Retinex", "paper_id": "WOS:000362417500021"}
