By using the properties of M-cone and inequality technique, we obtain some sufficient conditions ensuring mean square exponential stability of the zero solution of impulsive stochastic reaction-diffusion Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with delays. The sufficient conditions are easily checked in practice by simple algebra methods and have a wider adaptive range. Two examples are also discussed to illustrate the efficiency of the obtained results. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
