Generated heat, due to losses, can reduce the life time of SRMs. Therefore, taking into account thermal modeling helps to improve their performance and increase their life time. In this paper, a lumped thermal model of SRM based on the analogue circuit of conductive and convective thermal resistances is proposed. First the heat transfer equations were applied for modeling of each motor part as a thermal equivalent circuit. Then, the thermal modeling of whole SRM was done via assembling all these sub-circuits. For validity of the obtained model on a wide range of geometrical and structural properties of motor, apt heat transfer relations have been used. This comprehensive model is used to investigate the influence of dimensions on heat transfer in SRM. Finally, an optimal design of the stator yoke dimensions has been reached concerning the mechanical aspects without degrading electromagnetic characteristics of SRM. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
