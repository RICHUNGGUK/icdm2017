We study the joint optimization problem of subcarrier-pairing based relay-power allocation, relay selection, and subcarrier assignment. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. By using the dual method, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem in an asymptotically optimal manner. Simulation results show that the proposed method can improve system performance significantly over the conventional methods.", "paper_title": "Resource Allocation with Subcarrier Pairing in OFDMA Two-Way Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696000004"}
