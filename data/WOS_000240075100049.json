We make use of the Bayesian framework of Gaussian process to solve this problem. We propose the prior based on the normalized graph Laplacian, and introduce a new likelihood based on softmax function model. Both the transductive and inductive problems are regarded as MAP (Maximum A Posterior) problems. Experimental results show that our method is competitive with the existing semi-supervised transductive and inductive methods.", "paper_title": "Graph based multi-class semi-supervised learning using Gaussian process", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100049"}
