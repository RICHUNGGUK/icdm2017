To manufacture such components, a hybrid layered manufacturing technology has been proposed. Since it would be risky and expensive to make such a physical machine, virtual manufacturing technology is adopted to further study and optimize the hybrid layered manufacturing technology, so as to provide a reliable foundation for future practical manufacturing with a much better prospect of success, a shorter lead time, and a much lower investment cost. This paper develops a virtual manufacturing system for it. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
