This is difficult for large samples. We have therefore developed an algorithm for rapidly computing the evolutionary distances between closely related genomes. Results: Our distance measure is based on ungapped local alignments that we anchor through pairs of maximal unique matches of a minimum length. These exact matches can be looked up efficiently using enhanced suffix arrays and our implementation requires approximately only 1 s and 45 MB RAM/Mbase analysed. The pairing of matches distinguishes non-homologous from homologous regions leading to accurate distance estimation. We show this by analysing simulated data and genome samples ranging from 29 Escherichia coli/Shigella genomes to 3085 genomes of Streptococcus pneumoniae.", "paper_title": "andi: Fast and accurate estimation of evolutionary distances between closely related genomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000354453700002"}
