Potential steps are chosen such that they minimize (or at least significantly reduce) the overestimating function. del f (x)(inverted perpendicular) s + s(inverted perpendicular) Bs/2+ q parallel to s parallel to(3)/3 with B approximate to H(x). This ensures f (x + s) < f (x) unless the approximating Hessian B = B-inverted perpendicular differs significantly from H(x) or the scalar q > 0 is too small. Either one or both quantities may be updated after unsuccessful and successful steps alike. For an algorithm employing both the symmetric rank one update and a shifted version of the BFGS formula we show that either inf parallel to del f parallel to = 0 or sup parallel to B parallel to = infinity, provided the Hessian H(x) is Lipschitz on some neighbourhood of a bounded level set.
