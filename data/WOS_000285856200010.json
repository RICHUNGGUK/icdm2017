We propose a graph-theoretic template (causal network) based method for intelligent process monitoring. We validate our results with the aid of existing knowledge and available literature. The proposed method is quite general and can be extended to analyze several physical, chemical or biological systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
