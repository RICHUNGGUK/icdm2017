By semantic interaction we understand the act of modifying the internal knowledge representation (in the form of semantic network or ontology) as a result of communication between agents. The proposed framework takes into account the latest results investigating structure of large semantic networks and communication patters in diverse multiagent environments.", "paper_title": "Towards a computational framework for modeling semantic interactions in large multiagent communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100129"}
