However, it is not always easy for individuals to personally recognize the optimal conditions for exercise and physical activity. Wearable acceleration-based pedometers have become widely used in estimating the amount of physical activity, and to a limited extent, providing information regarding exercise intensity, but they have never been used to assess adaptation to exercise. In order to realize simultaneous activity monitoring for multiple users exercising outdoors, we developed a prototype wireless local area network (WLAN) based system. In our system, a WLAN is deployed outside, and a user wearing a smart phone and monitoring device exercises freely within the coverage area of the wireless network. By doing so, the developed system is able to monitor the activity of each user and measures various parameters including those related to exercise adaptation. In a demonstration experiment, the developed system was evaluated and used to monitor users enjoying a Nordic walk, after which users were immediately able to receive their exercise report. In this paper, we discuss the requirements and issues in developing an activity monitoring system and report the findings we obtained through the demonstration experiment.", "paper_title": "Development of a WLAN Based Monitoring System for Group Activity Measurement in Real-Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000290362900002"}
