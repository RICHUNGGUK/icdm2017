This is achieved through constructing new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and improving Jensen's inequality. Unlike existing work in this area, the approach developed in this paper employs neither free-weighing matrices nor model transformations. As a result, simplified yet improved stability conditions are obtained for T-S fuzzy systems with norm-bounded-type uncertainties. For controller synthesis of the fuzzy systems, the stabilization problem with memoryless state feedback control is solved via utilizing a cone complementarity minimization algorithm. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
