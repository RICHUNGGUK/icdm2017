To solve this problem, a composite HAFC (CHAFC), which combines the HAFC with composite adaptation technique, is proposed in this paper. Outside of the approximation region, a robust stabilization controller is developed to achieve semi-global stability of the closed-loop system. Within the approximation region, a series-parallel identification model is introduced into an indirect HAFC to construct a CHAFC that can simultaneously achieve fuzzy identification and H-infinity tracking control. It is proved that the closed-loop system obtains H-infinity tracking performance in the sense that both tracking and modeling errors converge to small neighborhoods of zero. Simulated applications of aircraft wing rock suppression and inverted pendulum tracking demonstrate that the proposed approach not only effectively solves the aforementioned approximation problem, but also obviously outperforms previous approaches.
