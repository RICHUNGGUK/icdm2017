We consider P systems with insertion rules having one symbol context and we show that they have the computational power of context-free matrix grammars. If contexts of length two are permitted, then any recursively enumerable language can be generated. In both cases a squeezing mechanism, an inverse morphism, and a weak coding are applied to the output of the corresponding P systems. We also show that if no membranes are used then corresponding family is equal to the family of context-free languages.", "paper_title": "On the Power of Small Size Insertion P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000289028900008"}
