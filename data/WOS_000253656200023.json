However, the efficiency of the clustering depends on the schedule of the target application. For improving the energy efficiency of L0 clusters, an operation shuffling is proposed, which explores assignment of operations for each cycle, generates various schedules, and evaluates them to find an energy efficient schedule. This approach can find energy efficient schedules, however, it takes a long time to obtain the final result. In this paper, we propose a new method to directly generate an energy efficient schedule without iterations of operation shuffling. In the proposed method, a compiler schedules operations using the result of the single operation shuffling as a constraint. We propose some optimization algorithms to generate an energy efficient schedule for a given L0 cluster organization. The proposed method can drastically reduce the computational effort since it performs the operation shuffling only once. The experimental results show that comparable energy reduction is achieved by using the proposed method while the computational effort can be reduced significantly over the conventional operation shuffling.", "paper_title": "Efficient method to generate an energy efficient schedule using operation shuffling", "paper_id": "WOS:000253656200023"}
