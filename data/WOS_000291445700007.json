The actors project approach provides temporal isolation through resource reservation over a multicore platform, adapting the available resources on the basis of the overall quality requirements. The architecture is fully operational on both ARM MPCore and x86 multicore platforms.", "paper_title": "RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ON MULTICORE SYSTEMS: THE ACTORS APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000291445700007"}
