ALG is capable of generating individual or matched components as well as placement and routing. ALG takes performance considerations into account, optimizing the layout in each step. A distinguishing feature of the tool is primarily providing spectra of generation possibilities ranging from full custom to automatic generation. ALG is not only designed to work as a standalone tool but also implemented to be the final step of an analog automation How. The flow supports circuit level specification in addition to layout level user specifications, so that it can be integrated into an analog automation system. Another feature of ALG is its interaction with a layout adviser tool, namely, YASA. YASA performs sensitivity simulations using a spicelike simulator providing sensitivities of performance parameters with respect to circuit parameters.", "paper_title": "Analog Layout Generator for CMOS Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164100004"}
