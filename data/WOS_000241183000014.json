A new recursive algorithm is presented, which produces the minimal nonlinear feedback shift register of a given sequence. Further, a connection between the nonlinear complexity and the compression capability of a sequence is established. A lower bound for the Lempel-Ziv compression ratio that a given sequence can achieve is proved, which depends on its nonlinear complexity.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear complexity of binary sequences and connections with Lempel-Ziv compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000014"}
