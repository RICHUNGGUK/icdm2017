The aim of this second paper, which follows (Antoine and Duboscq, 2014), is to first present the various pseudospectral schemes available in GPELab for computing the deterministic and stochastic nonlinear dynamics of Gross-Pitaevskii equations (Antoine, et al., 2013). Next, the corresponding GPELab functions are explained in detail. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to show how the code works for the complex dynamics of BEC problems.

Ireland Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 27209 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 283623 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Matlab. Computer: PC, Mac. Operating system: Windows, Mac OS, Linux. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes RAM: 4000 Megabytes Classification: 2.7, 4.6, 7.7. Catalogue identifier of previous version: AETU_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 185(2014)2969 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Simulation of dynamical solutions for a class of systems (multi-components) of time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equations in Id, 2d and 3d. This program is particularly well designed for the simulation of the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates as well as the computation of ground states. Solution method: We use spectral schemes in space and splitting/relaxation scheme in time. Reasons for new version: To include dynamic simulations. Summary of revisions: It is now possible to do dynamical simulations with the code. Running time: From a few seconds for simple problems to a few minutes for more complex situations on a medium computer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
