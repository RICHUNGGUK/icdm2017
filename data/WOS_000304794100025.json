This modeling system combines the advantages of a direct mesh-based sketch in which the user can draw the mesh directly in the space by moving the wand and the control curve sketch to express the detailed shape of the model. The created surface is also divided by using the control curve so that different resolution surfaces can be set for each surface and partially complicated parts can be sketched. While using SPACESKETCH, we introduced the advantages of using a new interface that uses mesh-based sketch and control curve sketch simultaneously to create various models and how to apply multi-resolution. Through this process, we show that mesh-based sketch and control curve sketch simultaneously to complement each other in a multi-resolution real time environment is very useful in concept sketching in a 3D environment using a spatial input device.
