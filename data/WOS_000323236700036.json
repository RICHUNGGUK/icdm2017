In the new scheme, Gabor wavelet magnitude and Local Binary Pattern operator are combined, so the new feature vector has excellent stability. We introduce Block-based Linear Discriminant Analysis (BLDA) to reduce the dimensionality of the GLBP feature vector and enhance its discriminability at the same time. The results of an experiment show that the proposed approach has excellent performance compared to other competitive approaches in current literatures.", "paper_title": "Finger Vein Recognition with Gabor Wavelets and Local Binary Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000323236700036"}
