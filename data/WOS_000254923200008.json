However, data items are not allocated more than once per broadcast cycle to a single channel. Our scheme considers the numbers of copies of a data item that should be allocated in the context of the channel assignment problem and aims to reduce the average data access time by allocating a popular data item more than once per cycle to the channel to which it is assigned. The number of times that each data item is allocated reflects its access probability. Simulation results show that our scheme reduces the average expected delay, especially when there are few channels.", "paper_title": "Effective generation of data broadcast schedules with different allocation numbers for multiple wireless channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000254923200008"}
