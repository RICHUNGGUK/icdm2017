A 3D protein structure is represented by an ordered point set A={a (1),aEuro broken vertical bar,a (n) }, where each a (i) is a point in 3D space. Given two ordered point sets A={a (1),aEuro broken vertical bar,a (n) } and B={b (1),b (2),aEuro broken vertical bar b (n) } containing n points, and a threshold d, the largest well predicted subset problem is to find the rigid body transformation T for a largest subset B (opt) of B such that the distance between a (i) and T(b (i) ) is at most d for every b (i) in B (opt) . A meaningful prediction requires that the size of B (opt) is at least alpha n for some constant alpha (Li et al. in CPM 2008, 2008). We use LWPS(A,B,d,alpha) to denote the largest well predicted subset problem with meaningful prediction. An (1+delta (1),1-delta (2))-approximation for LWPS(A,B,d,alpha) is to find a transformation T to bring a subset B'aS dagger B of size at least (1-delta (2))|B (opt) | such that for each b (i) aB', the Euclidean distance between the two points distance (a (i) ,T(b (i) ))a parts per thousand currency sign(1+delta (1))d. We develop a constant time (1+delta (1),1-delta (2))-approximation algorithm for LWPS(A,B,d,alpha) for arbitrary positive constants delta (1) and delta (2). To our knowledge, this is the first constant time algorithm in this area. Li et al. (CPM 2008, 2008) showed an time randomized (1+delta (1))-distance approximation algorithm for the largest well predicted subset problem under meaningful prediction. We also study a closely related problem, the bottleneck distance problem, where we are given two ordered point sets A={a (1),aEuro broken vertical bar,a (n) } and B={b (1),b (2),aEuro broken vertical bar b (n) } containing n points and the problem is to find the smallest d (opt) such that there exists a rigid transformation T with distance(a (i) ,T(b (i) ))a parts per thousand currency signd (opt) for every point b (i) aB. A (1+delta)-approximation for the bottleneck distance problem is to find a transformation T, such that for each b (i) aB, distance (a (i) ,T(b (i) ))a parts per thousand currency sign(1+delta)d (opt) , where delta is a constant. For an arbitrary constant delta, we obtain a linear O(n/delta (6)) time (1+delta)-algorithm for the bottleneck distance problem. The best known algorithms for both problems require super-linear time (Li et al. in CPM 2008, 2008).", "paper_title": "Constant time approximation scheme for largest well predicted subset", "paper_id": "WOS:000316020900002"}
