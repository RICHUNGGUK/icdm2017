The simulation of flows in non-homogeneous and non-isotropic porous media with full tensor diffusion coefficients, which is a common situation associated with the miscible displacement of contaminants in aquifers and the immiscible and incompressible two-phase flow of oil and water in petroleum reservoirs, involves the numerical solution of an elliptic type equation in which the diffusion coefficient can be discontinuous, varying orders of magnitude within short distances. In the present work, we present a vertex-centered edge-based finite volume method (EBFV) with median dual control volumes built over a primal mesh. This formulation is capable of handling the heterogeneous and anisotropic media using structured or unstructured, triangular or quadrilateral meshes. In the EBFV method, the discretization of the diffusion term is performed using a node-centered discretization implemented in two loops over the edges of the primary mesh. This formulation guarantees local conservation for problems with discontinuous coefficients, keeping second-order accuracy for smooth solutions on general triangular and orthogonal quadrilateral meshes. In order to show the convergence behavior of the proposed EBFV procedure, we solve three benchmark problems including full tensor, material heterogeneity and distributed source terms. For these three examples. numerical results compare favorably with others found in literature. A fourth problem, with highly non-smooth solution, has been included showing that the EBFV needs further improvement to formally guarantee monotonic solutions in such cases.
