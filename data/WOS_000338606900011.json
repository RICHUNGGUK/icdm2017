The GammaKey system, operating on a standard PC, replicates the functionality of earlier dedicated computer systems, allows the exchange of data in the DICOM format and has an open architecture enabling the development of new diagnostic techniques. The main purpose of the GammaKey is to enable the continued use of old GSCs which have functional scintillation crystals, but also to permit data exchange with new digital GSCs. The GammaKey has been technically validated by standards established by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. The GammaKey has been used for seven years in two leading centres for nuclear medicine in Serbia (the Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, and the Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Novi Sad) in approximately 30,000 patients. Clinical application proves that the GammaKey is a robust and reliable system with high-quality image output. Data processing can be upgraded with non-standard features added on request as shown in two examples: (1) the testing of splenectomy efficacy in the case of thrombocytopenia with normal production; and (2) the detection and localisation of parathyroid adenomas.
