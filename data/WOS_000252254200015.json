The retexturing results have the similar distortion and shading effect conforming to the unknown underlying geometry and lighting conditions. For replacing textures in a single image, two important steps are developed: The stretch-based mesh parameterization incorporating the recovered normal information is deduced to imitate perspective distortion of the region of interest; the Poisson-based refinement process is exploited to account for texture distortion at fine scale. The luminance of the input image is preserved through color transfer in YCbCr color space. Our approach is independent of the replaced textures. Once the input image is processed, any new textures can be applied to efficiently generate the retexturing results. For video retexturing, we propose key-frame-based texture replacement extended and generalized from the image retexturing. Our approach repeatedly propagates the replacement results of key frames to the rest of the frames. We develop the local motion optimization scheme to deal with the inaccuracies and errors of robust optical flow when tracking moving objects. Visibility shifting and texture drifting are effectively alleviated using graphcut segmentation algorithm and the global optimization to smooth trajectories of the tracked points over temporal domain. Our experimental results showed that the proposed approach can generate visually pleasing results for retextured images and video.", "paper_title": "Mesh-guided optimized retexturing for image and video", "paper_id": "WOS:000252254200015"}
