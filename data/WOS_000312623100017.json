Eccentricity of vertex i in a graph G is the path length from verte i to vertex j that is farthest from i. In this paper, an algorithm is presented for computing the Eccentric connectivity index of any simple connected graph. Furthermore the Eccentric connectivity index is computed for HAC(5)C(7)[p,q] and HAC(5)C(6)C(7)[p,q] Nanotubes by GAP program.", "paper_title": "Eccentric Connectivity Index of HAC(5)C(7)[p,q] and HAC(5)C(6)C(7)[p,q] Nanotubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000312623100017"}
