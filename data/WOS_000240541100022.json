Because so many important problems remain unsolved mainly due to their intrinsic computational complexity, it would be embarrassing not to develop parallel implementations of polynomial homotopy continuation methods. This paper concerns the development of \"parallel PHCpack\", a project which started a couple of years ago in collaboration with Yusong Wang, and which currently continues with Anton Leykin (parallel irreducible decomposition) and Yan Zhuang (parallel polyhedral hornotopies). We report on our efforts to make PHCpack ready to solve large polynomial systems which arise in applications.", "paper_title": "Parallel homotopy algorithms to solve polynomial systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240541100022"}
