The applications hosted by the WSN may have different characteristics. This research investigates the importance of using information about the characteristics of the applications and the state of the network while allocating the sensor nodes to requests for applications. A number of static and dynamic allocation algorithms are investigated. Results of simulation experiments demonstrate that the lifetime of a WSN can be effectively increased by using information about the applications and the state of the WSN. Insights into the relationship between system performance and various system and workload characteristics gained from the simulation experiments are presented.", "paper_title": "Techniques for Allocation of Sensors in Shared Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358594700003"}
