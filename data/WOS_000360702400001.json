As a special case, we obtain a Szemer,di-Trotter type theorem for 2-planes in , provided and the planes intersect transversely. As a further special case, we obtain a Szemer,di-Trotter type theorem for complex lines in with no restrictions on m and n (this theorem was originally proved by Tth using a different method). As a third special case, we obtain a Szemer,di-Trotter type theorem for complex unit circles in .
