In 2011 the author proved the same assertion for polyhedra in R-4. In this paper, we prove that the same result is true in arbitrary dimension n >= 3. Moreover, we show that this is true not only for simplicial polyhedra, but for all polyhedra with triangular 2-faces. As a corollary, we obtain the proof in arbitrary dimension of the well-known Bellows Conjecture posed by Connelly in 1978. This conjecture claims that the volume of any flexible polyhedron is constant. Moreover, we obtain the following stronger result. If P-t, t is an element of[0, 1], is a continuous deformation of a polyhedron such that the combinatorial type of P-t does not change and every 2-face of P-t remains congruent to the corresponding face of P-0, then the volume of Pt is constant. We also obtain non-trivial estimates for the oriented volumes of complex simplicial polyhedra in C-n from their orthogonal edge lengths.", "paper_title": "Generalization of Sabitov's Theorem to Polyhedra of Arbitrary Dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000341913500002"}
