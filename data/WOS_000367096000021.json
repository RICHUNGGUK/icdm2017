Therefore, a CU depth prediction algorithm is proposed for motion estimation process of HEVC. At first, an efficient CTU depth prediction algorithm is proposed to reduce redundant depth. Then, CU size termination and skip algorithm is proposed based on the neighboring block depth and motion consistency. Finally, the overall algorithm, which has excellent complexity reduction performance for high resolution application is proposed. Moreover, the proposed method achieves steady performance, and it can significantly reduce the encoding time in different environment configuration and quantization parameter. The simulation experiment results demonstrate that, in the RA case, the average time saving is about 56% with only 0.79% BD-bitrate loss for the high resolution, and this performance is better than the previous state of the art work.", "paper_title": "High Efficiency CU Depth Prediction Algorithm for High Resolution Applications of HEVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000367096000021"}
