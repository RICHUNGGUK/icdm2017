The scheme verifies that, for each sensors-estimator combination, suitable residual variables lie inside pre-computed sets and selects a more appropriate combination based on a chosen criterion. An active fault tolerant output feedback controller yields an MPC-based control law and, by means of the notion of a \"tube\" of trajectories, we ensure robust closed-loop exponential stability and good performance in the fault-free case and under the occurrence of abrupt sensor faults.", "paper_title": "ROBUST MULTISENSOR FAULT TOLERANT MODEL-FOLLOWING MPC DESIGN FOR CONSTRAINED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302013000016"}
