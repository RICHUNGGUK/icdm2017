It is an exploratory research of biological cryptology. Similar to conventional public-key cryptology, DNA-PKC uses two pairs of keys for encryption and signature, respectively. Using the public encryption key, everyone can send encrypted message to a specified user, only the owner of the private decryption key can decrypt the ciphertext and recover the message; in the signature scheme, the owner of the private signing key can generate a signature that can be verified by other users with the public verification key, but no else can forge the signature. DNA-PKC differs from the conventional cryptology in that the keys and the ciphertexts are all biological molecules. The security of DNA-PKC relies on difficult biological problems instead of computational problems; thus DNA-PKC is immune from known attacks, especially the quantum computing based attacks.", "paper_title": "Asymmetric encryption and signature method with DNA technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000276599800007"}
