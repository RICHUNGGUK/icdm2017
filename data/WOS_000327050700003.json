We analyze the driving force system of Ecosystem of Cyber-society using the theory of System Dynamics and propose a theoretical framework, and then present its operation mechanism systematically.", "paper_title": "Operation Mechanism of the Driving Force System of Ecosystem of Cyber-society Based on the System Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000327050700003"}
