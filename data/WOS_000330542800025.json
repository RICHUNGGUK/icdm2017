Several members of this class take advantage of the Lewis acidic properties of zinc ions to carry out their various catalytic transformations including isomerization or amide cleavage. These enzymes have been validated as drug targets for a number of diseases including cancer; however, despite their pharmaceutical relevance and the availability of crystal structures, structure-based drug design methods have been poorly and indirectly. parametrized for these classes of enzymes. More specifically, the metal coordination component and proton transfers of the process of drugs binding to metalloenzymes have been inadequately modeled by current docking programs, if at all. In addition, several known issues, such as coordination geometry, atomic charge variability, and a potential proton transfer from small molecules to a neighboring basic residue, have often been ignored. We report herein the development of specific functions and parameters to account for zinc-drug coordination focusing on the above-listed phenomena and their impact on docking to zinc metalloenzymes. These atom-type-dependent but atomic charge-independent functions implemented into FITTED 3.1 enable the simulation of drug binding to metalloenzymes, considering an acid base reaction with a neighboring residue when necessary with good accuracy.", "paper_title": "Docking Ligands into Flexible and Solvated Macromolecules. 6.
