Inherently discrete concurrency corresponds to a parallel continuous concept: a discrete state space corresponds to a differential manifold, an execution path corresponds to a flow line of a dynamical system. To model non-determinacy within dynamical systems, we introduce a new geometrical object, a section cone. A section cone is a convex set in the space of vector fields, all elements having the same singular points. We show that it is enough to consider flow lines of a single vector field in order to capture the behavior of all flow lines in the section cone up to homotopy (corresponding to equivalence of executions).", "paper_title": "Geometric analysis of nondeterminacy in dynamical systems - Towards a geometric analysis of concurrent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243903600004"}
