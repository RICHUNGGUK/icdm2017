Chinese scientific papers in nanotechnology are analyzed to indicate overall trends, leading fields and the most prolific institutions. Patterns of China-US nanotechnology paper co-authorship are examined over the period 1990-2009, with an analysis of how these patterns have changed over time. The paper combines bibliometric analysis and science mapping. We find rapid development in the number of China-US co-authored nanotechnology papers as well as structural changes in array of collaborative nanotechnology sub-fields. Implications for both China and the US of this evolving relationship are discussed.", "paper_title": "China-US scientific collaboration in nanotechnology: patterns and dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000292210200001"}
