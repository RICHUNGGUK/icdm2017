Matrices' coefficients in the summation take values in the standard simplex. This paper presents a triangulation approach to the problem of generating simplicial partitions of the standard simplex in order to set up a family of sufficient conditions and, in parallel, another family of necessary ones for fuzzy summations. The conditions proposed id this paper are asymptotically exact as the size of the involved simplices decreases; its conservativeness vanishes for a sufficiently fine partition (sufficiently dense mesh of vertex points). The set of conditions is in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), for which efficient software is available.", "paper_title": "A Triangulation Approach to Asymptotically Exact Conditions for Fuzzy Summations", "paper_id": "WOS:000270591900001"}
