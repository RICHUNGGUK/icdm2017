The proposed method interprets the stability of switched linear systems through the distance between the eigenvector sets of subsystem matrices. Thus, an explicit relation in view of stability is obtained between the family of the involved subsytems and the set of admissible switching signals.", "paper_title": "A dwell time approach to the stability of switched linear systems based on the distance between eigenvector sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000268935000005"}
