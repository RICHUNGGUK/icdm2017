These models are inspired from successful methodologies used in large eddy simulation, such as artificial viscosity, applied to standard models created by proper orthogonal decomposition of flows coupled with Galerkin projection. As a first step in the analysis and testing of our new methodology, we use the Burgers equation with a small diffusion parameter. We present a thorough numerical analysis for the time discretization of the new models. We then test these models in two problems displaying shock-like phenomena. Of course, since the Burgers equation does not model turbulence, we next need to test our new models in realistic turbulent flow settings. This is the subject of a forthcoming report.
