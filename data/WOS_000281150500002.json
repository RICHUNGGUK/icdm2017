With the rapid growth of the Internet, the emergence of many technologies such as service data partition, multi-connection and multi-path has made it possible to frequently exchange complex information between layers. With regard to these changes, this paper introduces \"network layered priority mapping (NLPM)\" for future Internet development. The NLPM aims to maximize the satisfaction of the Internet users. The NLPM is designed to differentiate priority of the information on different layers and integrate the information using priority mapping. With NLPM, network services can be delivered more efficiently; network utilization such as the utilization of connection, path and channel can also be improved. Model analysis, NS simulation and prototype implementation have proved the efficiency of NLPM.", "paper_title": "Network layered priority mapping theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000281150500002"}
