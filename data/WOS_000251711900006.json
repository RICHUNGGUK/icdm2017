Furthermore, we present a single preferential attachment model for the evolution of weighted networks in which the network growth is coupled with dynamical evolution of weights and intrinsic strength. The model yields a nontrivial time evolution of nodes' properties and generalized power law distributions for the weight, strength and degree, as confirmed in many real networks. The numerical simulation results are in good agreement with the analytical expressions.", "paper_title": "Weighted evolving networks with intrinsic strength", "paper_id": "WOS:000251711900006"}
