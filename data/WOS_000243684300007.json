The layered solid considered is located above the bedrock. whose material properties are assumed to be much stiffer than the solid, and known power spectrum densities of the non-stationary random excitations are input at the bedrock. The governing differential equations are derived in the frequency and wavenumber domain and the response power spectrum densities of the ground are investigated. The solution method presented uses the pseudo-excitation method in combination with the precise integration method and the extended Wittrick-Williams algorithm. The examples have up to three layers.
