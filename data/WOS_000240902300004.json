This motivates the research presented in this paper. A heuristic algorithm is formulated for static traffic grooming in WDM uni-directional ring networks with an eye to minimize the number of required ADMs. The distinguished feature of the proposed heuristic is that it pairs up the calls of a given static traffic to approach the solution. The proposed heuristic is compared with the previous approach with same network configuration and traffic matrix to establish its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "A heuristic solution to SONET ADM minimization for static traffic grooming in WDM uni-directional ring networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240902300004"}
