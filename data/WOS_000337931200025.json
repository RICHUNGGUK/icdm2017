In this paper, we propose a new secure provenance scheme based on group signature and attribute-based signature techniques. The proposed provenance scheme provides confidentiality on sensitive documents stored in a cloud, unforgeability of the provenance record, anonymous authentication to cloud servers, fine-grained access control on documents, and provenance tracking on disputed documents. Furthermore, it is assumed that the cloud server has huge computation capacity, while users are regarded as devices with low computation capability. Aiming at this, we show how to utilize the cloud server to outsource and decrease the user's computational overhead during the process of provenance. With provable security techniques, we formally demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme under standard assumptions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
