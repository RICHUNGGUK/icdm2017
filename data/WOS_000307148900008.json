A nonlocal correction is here introduced in order to capture the degradation of the bond due to splitting cracks. Damage of the interface is also modeled as a function of the rib spacing, allowing application of the model to different bar diameters. The model is able to capture the transition from splitting to pull-out failure and to yielding of bars with the same set of predefined interface parameters, showing the predictive character of the model. The development of macroscopic cracks is also correctly simulated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
