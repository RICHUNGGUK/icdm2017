Methods: Sixty consecutive candidates for elective LC were randomly assigned to four groups. Group A included 15 patients preoperatively informed regarding K through the MCD presented by Registered Nurse (RN). Patients in group B (n = 15) were informed through a leaflet. Patients in group C (n = 15) were informed verbally from a RN. Finally, the control Group 0 included 15 patients informed conventionally by the attending surgeon and anesthesiologist, as every other patient included in groups A, B, and C. Preoperative assessment of knowledge about LC was performed after each informative session through a questionnaire. Evaluation of preoperative anxiety was conducted using APAIS scale. Postoperative pain and nausea scores were measured using on NRS scale, 16 hours after the patient had returned to the word. Results: Statistical processing of the results (single linear regression) showed that patients in groups A, B, and C achieved a higher knowledge score, less preoperative anxiety score and less postoperative pain and nausea, compared to Group D. In multiple regression analysis, group A had a higher knowledge score compared to the four groups (p < 0.001 r(2) = 0.41). Conclusion: Informative sessions using MCD is an effective means of improving patient's preoperative knowledge, especially in day-surgery cases, like LC.", "paper_title": "The effect of interactive multimedia on preoperative knowledge and postoperative recovery of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy", "paper_id": "WOS:000249094000004"}
