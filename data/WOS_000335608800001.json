This paper is intended to offer a global view of the development on this branch until now, focusing in the different approaches dealing with quantification, specially those involving imprecision, called fuzzy quantification. We put attention to the different mechanisms for defining them, the evaluation methods for measuring their fulfilment, as well as the properties they should satisfy. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
