The filtered vorticity transport equation is solved using the vortex-in-cell scheme in conjunction with the dynamic eddy viscosity subgrid-scale models. The transport equation for FDF is solved using the Lagrangian Monte-Carlo method. The methodology is tested on a chemically reacting spatially growing mixing layer with no heat release. The effects of Damkohler number (Da) on the concentration structure of the reacting mixing layer, the mean reactant and product concentrations and on the reactant FDF are investigated. It is shown that mixing has a greater effect on scalar field within the vortex structure as compared with the braid regions. Also for high Da, the reaction zones are mainly limited to the thin reacting interfacial zones, i.e. the contact zone between the reactants, whereas for low Da, the reacting zones are spread as reacting pockets within the vortex structure. The effects of Da on mean reactant and product concentrations, root-mean-square concentration fluctuations and probability density are discussed.
