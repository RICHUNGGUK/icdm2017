This scheme periodically combines the content files and allows them to obtain the combined content files while keeping the price unchanged from the single-content price in order to induce altruistic clients to download content files that are most likely to contribute to localizing network traffic. However, the selection algorithm in our prior work determined which and when content files should be combined according to the cache states of all clients, which is a kind of unrealistic assumption in terms of computational complexity. This paper proposes a new concept of virtual local server to reduce the computational complexity. We could say that the source server in our mechanism has a virtual caching network inside that reflects the cache states of all clients in the 'actual' caching network and combines content files based on the virtual caching network. In this paper, without determining virtual caching network according to the cache states of all clients, we approximately estimated the virtual caching network from the cache states of the virtual local server of the local domain, which is the aggregated cache state of only altruistic clients in a local domain. Furthermore, we proposed a content selection algorithm based on a virtual caching network. In this paper, we used news life-cycle model as a content model that had the severe changes in cache states, which was a striking instance of dynamic content models. Computer simulations confirmed that our proposed algorithm successfully localized network traffic.", "paper_title": "An Approximated Selection Algorithm for Combinations of Content with Virtual Local Server for Traffic Localization in Peer-Assisted Content Delivery Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329009300019"}
