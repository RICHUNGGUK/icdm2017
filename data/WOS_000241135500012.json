This paper focuses on how to implement content based collaboration. In order to combine the advantage of nature language processing technology in content parsing, we present the shallow nature language parsing technology in collaborative editing system. This technology is based on the segmentation and the text classification. This paper also discusses the reason why the shallow nature language parsing technology is useful in content based collaboration and its further use in collaborative editing system. In addition, it has already been used in our collaborative multimedia editing system which is designed for Chinese teaching material editor. From the result of experiment, it shows that. the system really reduces the time in editing collaboration.", "paper_title": "A collaborative multimedia editing system based on shallow nature language parsing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500012"}
