With the consideration of self-organization effect and planning effect during evolution, the authors try to demonstrate the impact of preferential attachment, module scale and module structure on the evolving network model. Design/methodology/approach - The roadway network is built in the form of abstract network by dual approach. By using the evolving model of modular growth, the authors analyze the effects and mechanism of the evolving process. Then through numerical analysis, the impact of evolving effects on urban roadway network topology structure is discussed from the aspects of preferential attachment, module scale and module structure. Findings - The module structure property, small-world property and scale-free property of roadway network can be affected with various degrees by the change of preferential attachment and module scale. However, the impact of module structure on network properties is small, which can be ignored. Therefore, in practice, the self-organization effect and planning effect of evolving network can be reached by changing the preferential attachment and module scale, so as to generate the network structure with specific properties. Research limitations/implications - Some local events, such as road extensions, road demolition and intersection rebuilding, exist during the evolving process under real-world situation. While those cases have not been considered in preferential attachment. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to take these factors into consideration in further research. Practical implications - The paper has implications for practice in urban transportation planning and roadway constructions, which can help to guide the planning of urban roadway and to adjust or restore partial network when broken down according to the evolving law. Originality/value - The impact of preferential attachment, module scale and module structure on the evolving network model is measured. And the relationship between different network properties can be used to build some patterns of network. From this point of view, the development of urban roadway network can be predicted and intervened.", "paper_title": "Analysis on evolving model with modular growth of urban roadway network topology structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000357420000002"}
