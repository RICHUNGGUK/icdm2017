The proposed TSS-LS utilizes two different thresholds and search windows to achieve fast acquisition. Furthermore, unlike the TSS-BS in which the bit reversal algorithm is applied in both steps, the linear search is adopted for the second step in the proposed TSS-LS to correctly find the starting point in the range of effective delay spread of the multipath channels, and to obtain reliable bit error rate performance of the UWB systems.", "paper_title": "A rapid and reliable two-step search scheme for UWB signal acquisition in multipath channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840400029"}
