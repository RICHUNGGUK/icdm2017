Different from previous works in the literature, we set a different value to retransmission probability at each contention and propose a retransmission analytical model for burst segmentation contention resolution scheme. In addition, we consider the effect of relevance in traffic come from multiple paths. We take into account the load at each link (include the given links and the other correlated links taking traffic) due to both the fresh and the retransmitted traffic and calculate the path blocking probability and the byte loss probability (ByLP) in cases of without and with full-wavelength conversion to evaluate the network performance. An extensive simulation is proposed to validate our analytical model, and results have shown that both path blocking probability and ByLP are affected by the load and the retransmission probability in each contention along a path and the correlated traffic carried links on the path.", "paper_title": "A Controlled Retransmission Scheme for Burst Segmentation in OBS Networks on the Consideration of Path Relevance", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400030"}
