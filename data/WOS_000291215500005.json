Torsional excitation was simulated based on an engine dynamic model by considering flexibility of crankshaft, maximum fire pressure and variable inertia. Gear mesh stiffness coefficient, mesh error excitation, bearing dynamic stiffness coefficient and damping coefficient were numerically calculated. The virtual prototype model of power train system including all aforementioned excitations was constructed. Dynamic responses of transmission shaft working with multi-source excitations were analyzed. The impact of each excitation source was discussed.", "paper_title": "Multi-Body Dynamics Simulation of A Tracked Vehicle Power Train in Consideration of Multi-Source Excitations", "paper_id": "WOS:000291215500005"}
