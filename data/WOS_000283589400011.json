Different eye diagrams are obtained under various IP traffic types and input optical powers. When the input power of a single channel is larger than 3 dBm, the effect of IP bursty traffic will deteriorate eye diagrams dramatically in a 40-channel WDM network. We also calculate the FWM powers and interchannel power distribution under different IP traffic loads. Based on the interchannel power distribution, we could find out which channels affect the probe channel seriously by the FWM effect. All these numerical results are useful for the Quality-of-Service (QoS) design, traffic grooming, lightpath routing, and wavelength assignment of IP over WDM networks.", "paper_title": "Investigations on combined XPM and FWM effects on optical pulse propagation in dynamic IP traffic over WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283589400011"}
