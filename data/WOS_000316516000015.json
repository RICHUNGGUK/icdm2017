In this paper, a knowledge-based modeling approach, PAM (disruption-handling Policies, local search Algorithms and object-oriented Modeling), is developed, which combines the scheduling knowledge of experienced schedulers with the optimization knowledge concerning models and algorithms in the field of Operations Research to obtain an effective solution in real time. Experienced schedulers can respond to different disruptions promptly with heuristic adjustment based on their experience, but their solutions may be inaccurate, inconsistent, or even infeasible. This method is limited when the problem becomes large-scale. The model-algorithm method can handle large-scale problems, but it has to predefine a specific disruption and a specific distribution state for constructing a model and algorithm, which is inflexible, time-consuming and consequently unable to promptly obtain solutions for responding to different disruptions in real time. PAM modeling approach combines the advantages and eliminates the disadvantages of the two methods aforementioned. Computational experiments show that solutions achieved by this modeling approach are practical and the speed of achieving the solutions is fast enough for responding to disruptions in real time.
