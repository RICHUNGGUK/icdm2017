Traditionally, AP is based on CMOS technology, similar to other classes of massively parallel SIMD processors. The main component of AP is a Content Addressable Memory (CAM) array. As CMOS feature scaling slows down, CAM experiences scalability problems. In this work, we propose and investigate an AP based on resistive CAM-the Resistive AP (ReAP). We show that resistive memory technology potentially allows scaling the AP from a few millions to a few hundred millions of processing units on a single silicon die. We compare the performance and power consumption of a ReAP to a CMOS AP and a conventional SIMD accelerator (GPU) and show that ReAP, although exhibiting higher power density, allows better scalability and higher performance.", "paper_title": "Resistive Associative Processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000367259100016"}
