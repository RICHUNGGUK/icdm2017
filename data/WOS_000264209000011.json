The most importance role of the intelligent building is the security system. We develop a Multi sensor-based intelligent security robot (ISR) that is widely employed in intelligent buildings. The intelligent security robot can detect abnormal and dangerous situations and notify users. The robot has the shape of cylinder and its diameter, height, and weight are 50 cm, 130 cm and 100 kg respectively. The function of the ISR contains six parts. There is the software development system; avoiding obstacle and motion planning system, image system, sensor system, remote supervise system and other systems. We develop a multi sensor-based sensor system in the ISR. We use multiple multisensor fusion algorithms to get an exact decision in the detection subsystem of the sensor system. There is an adaptive fusion method, a rule based method, and a statistical signal method. We demonstrate the remote supervisory system to control the ISR using a direct control mode and a behavior control mode. We think that the man-machine interface in a security robot system must have mobility and convenience. Therefore, we use a touch screen to display the system state, and design a general user interface (GUI) to service the user and visitors. The user can remotely control the appliance using a cell phone through a GSM modem, too. The appliance module can feedback reaction results to the user through a cell phone. Finally, we implement the fire detection system in the intelligent security robot (Chung-Cheng-1). If a fire occurs, the intelligent security robot can find out the fire source using the fire detection system. In intruder detection, we program the same scenario to detect the intruder using the intelligent security robot. The intelligent security robot transmits the message of the detection result to the user using a GSM modem for a fire event or intruder, and transmits the detection result to a client computer through the internet.
