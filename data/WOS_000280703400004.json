This analysis is done through the use of a novel bibliometric technique called tri-occurrence analysis, in which the descriptor 'information retrieval' is used as a filter term within the traditional technique of co-occurrence analysis. The resulting data is visualized by means of Pathfinder Network analysis. The findings provide evidence of an evolution in the IR landscape over the three decades from an emphasis on systems-, storage- and education-related research in the 1980s to database-, user interface- and information service-related research in the 1990s and to web-related research in the 2000s. This work provides additional validation of the use of tri-occurrence analysis as a useful bibliometric technique.", "paper_title": "Visualizing changes over time: A history of information retrieval through the lens of descriptor tri-occurrence mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000280703400004"}
