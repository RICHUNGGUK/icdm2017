Since sensor nodes are equipped with limited computing power, storage, and communication modules, authenticating remote users in such resource-constrained environments is a paramount security concern. To overcome the weaknesses of Yeh et al.'s protocol, we proposed a new authentication protocol for wireless sensor networks using elliptic curves cryptography. The comparisons show that our protocol is more suitable for WSNs.", "paper_title": "A New User Authentication Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks Using Elliptic Curves Cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000317773200001"}
