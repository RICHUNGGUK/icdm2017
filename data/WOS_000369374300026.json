The proposed system consists of two parts: a sender system, and a receiver system. The sender system converts a digital password into a color-coded image using a color displaying screen attached to a sender device. The receiver system detects these color-coded images using a camera, extracts the color values, and decodes them into the original digital password. We measured the data transfer accuracy of the visual communication system, and found that the average accuracy at the bit level was about 99.2% at the suggested experiment environment, to show that this system can work in real situations.", "paper_title": "User Authentication System using Visual Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000369374300026"}
