However, existing leakage detection techniques do not work well in monitoring the underground pipelines due to the harsh underground environmental conditions. In this paper, a new solution, the magnetic induction (MI)-based wireless sensor network for underground pipeline monitoring (MISE-PIPE), is introduced to provide low-cost and real-time leakage detection and localization for underground pipelines. MISE-PIPE detects and localizes leakage by jointly utilizing the measurements of different types of sensors that are located both inside and around the underground pipelines. By adopting an MI waveguide technique, the measurements of different types of the sensors throughout the pipeline network can be reported to the administration center in real-time. The system architecture and operational framework of MISE-PIPE is first developed. Based on the operational framework, research challenges and open research issues are then discussed.
