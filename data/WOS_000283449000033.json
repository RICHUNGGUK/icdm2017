Hence, the performance of wireless sensor networks is characterized by the rate at which data can be disseminated from or aggregated to a data sink. In this paper, the problem of data aggregation at a single sink is considered. It is shown that a data aggregation rate of Theta(log n/n) per node is optimal and that this rate can be achieved in regular wireless sensor networks using a generalization of cooperative beamforming called cooperative time-reversal communication.", "paper_title": "Order-Optimal Data Aggregation in Regular Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283449000033"}
