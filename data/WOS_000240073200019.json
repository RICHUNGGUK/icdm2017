However, proposed schemes do not provide mechanisms for key revocation and key renewal. In this paper, we propose the first key revocation and key renewal mechanisms for IBC schemes that are especially designed for MANETs. In our fully self-organized revocation scheme, each node monitors nodes in communication range and securely propagates its observations. The public key of a node is revoked if a minimum number of nodes accused the node. To enable key renewal, we introduce a modified format for ID-based public keys, such that new keys can be issued for the same identity. The introduced revocation scheme is efficient because it uses pre-shared keys from the Weil pairing and messages are sent to an m-hop neighborhood instead to the entire network.", "paper_title": "Key revocation for identity-based schemes in mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240073200019"}
