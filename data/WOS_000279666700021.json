This site offers a wide range of statistical metrics for the testing and evaluation of hydrological modelling outputs. In providing computational support to the international scientific community the authors are aiming to ensure that reported studies are based on consistent and accurate evaluations expressed in terms of recognised global standards. This article reports a number of recent improvements to the resource. These developments include a fresh user interface, additional statistical measures of model performance, a graphing facility, and an option to perform the simultaneous analysis of multiple model outputs. Through continuing development of this open access resource the authors are attempting to share and promote: the latest analytical procedures; discussions on current thinking; and a dynamic hydrological modelling tool that is evolving in parallel with its associated application domain.
