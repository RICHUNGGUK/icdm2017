The authors introduce a user-centric approach to organizing search results for the common ranked-list search interface and the alternative clustering interface, letting users personalize how the results are organized. Such personalized views can be combined to provide an aggregated view as a mass-collaborative way of improving search performance. Two working prototypes, Rants and Clustering Wild, show how the approach can serve as a complementary solution for effectively organizing search results.", "paper_title": "User-Centric Organization of Search Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000318142800008"}
