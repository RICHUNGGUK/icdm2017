In this paper, we show that the same holds if additionally we require that the produced drawing be symmetric with respect to a given automorphism of the graph. This problem arises naturally in the area of automatic graph drawing, where symmetric and planar drawings are desired whenever possible.", "paper_title": "Testing Planarity of Geometric Automorphisms in Linear Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000261025400003"}
