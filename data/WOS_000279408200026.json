Firstly, the definition on finite-time stability (FTS) for continuous-time nonlinear systems is provided and we give a novel and explicit interpretation for finite-time quantized guaranteed cost control. Secondly, sufficient conditions for the existence of state feedback controller are derived in terms of linear matrix inequities (LMIs), which guarantee the requirements of the provided performance criterion. The related optimization problem is also offered to minimize the guaranteed cost performance bound. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to show the validity of the proposed scheme.
