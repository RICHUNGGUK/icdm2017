In existing KR frameworks, a single algorithm is usually adopted and applied for a whole image/video, regardless of region characteristics. However, their performances and computational efficiencies can differ in regions of different characteristics. To take full advantage of the KR algorithms and avoid their disadvantage, this paper proposes a kernel regression framework for video super-resolution. In this framework, each video frame is first analyzed and divided into three types of regions: flat, non-flat-stationary, and non-flat-moving regions. Then different KR algorithm is selected according to the region type. The CKR and 2-D SKR algorithms are applied to flat and non-flat-stationary regions, respectively. For non-flat-moving regions, this paper proposes a similarity-assisted steering kernel regression (SASKR) algorithm, which can give better performance and higher computational efficiency than the 3-D SKR algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the computational efficiency of the proposed framework is greatly improved without apparent degradation in performance.", "paper_title": "A Fast Kernel Regression Framework for Video Super-Resolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000333159800014"}
