Specifically in an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) the kickback noise of a comparator can noticeably affect the settling time and accuracy of the decision. This work offers an analytical treatment of kickback noise generation, and proposes a synchronized kickback noise cancellation technique, which is achieved via placing clocked NMOS-PMOS capacitors at the proper nodes to cancel out effectively those unwanted charges (electrons or holes) under different operating regions of the MOS devices. The technique is clock-rate insensitive and particularly suitable for the SAR-type ADC as it will not alter the charge stored in the capacitor array. Optimized in 65-nm CMOS the kickback noise is <+/- 0.3 mV in 30x Monte-Carlo simulations at both 50- and 500-MHz clock rates. For 10-bit resolution in a full scale of 1 V-pp, the kickback noise of the proposed comparator comparing with the conventional one is improved by 48x, from 6.27 to 0.13 LSB.", "paper_title": "Systematic analysis and cancellation of kickback noise in a dynamic latched comparator", "paper_id": "WOS:000326453400018"}
