Three probabilistic hybrid heuristics are presented for solving permutation flowshop scheduling problem. The proposed methodology combines elements from both constructive heuristic search and a stochastic improvement technique. The stochastic method used in this paper is simulated annealing (SA). Experiments have been run on a large number of randomly generated test problems of varying jobs and machine sizes. Our approach is shown to outperform best-known existing heuristics, including the classical NEH technique (OMEGA, 1983) and the SA based on (OMEGA, 1989) of Osman and Potts. Statistical tests of significance are performed to substantiate the claims of improvement. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
