The Mertens conjecture that vertical bar M(x)vertical bar/root x < 1 for all x > 1 was disproved in 1985 by Odlyzko and te Riele [13]. In the present paper, the known lower bound 1.06 for lim sup M(x)/root x is raised to 1.218, and the known upper bound -1.009 for lim inf M(x)/root x is lowered to -1.229. In addition, the explicit upper bound of Pintz [14] on the smallest number for which the Mertens conjecture is false, is reduced from exp(3.21 x 10(64)) to exp(1.59 x 10(40)). Finally, new numerical evidence is presented for the conjecture that M(x)/root x = Omega +/-(root log log log x).", "paper_title": "The Mertens conjecture revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566700012"}
