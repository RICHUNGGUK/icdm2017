The network must provide sustained throughput and ultra-low latencies. In this paper we propose new pipelined switch designs focused in reducing the switch latency. We identify the switch components that limit the switch frequency: the arbiter. Then, we simplify the arbiter logic by using multiple smaller arbiters, but increasing greatly the switch area. To solve this problem, a second design is presented where the routing traversal and arbitrations tasks are mixed. Results demonstrate a switch latency reduction ranging from 10% to 21%. Network latency is reduced in a range from 11% to 15%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "A low-latency modular switch for CMP systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298456500009"}
