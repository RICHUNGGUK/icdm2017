The major goal of this procedure is the efficient deployment of the system and management of the distributed segmented parts while minimizing the signaling overhead in the network. As we show here. it can take place even during the operational phase of the network when certain shortcomings appear. In this work, we present an approach based on graph theory for the segmentation of cellular networks at the Base Station Controller (BSC) level that achieves it significant increase in the performance of the network. In particular, with the proposed method, both the handover attempts when a mobile station is moving to a cell belonging to a different BSC as well as the corresponding handover failure rate are decreased significantly. allowing for it Continuous network Upgrade.
