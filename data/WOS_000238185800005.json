This feature makes the attack less vulnerable to detection by current IDS systems. which usually expect high rate traffic. The intruder call take advantage of some knowledge about the inter-output times in the server to build the attack. We have simulated and tested it in a real environment. obtaining worrying conclusions due to the efficiency achieved by the attack, with low effort from the attacker.", "paper_title": "Low rate DoS attack to monoprocess servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000238185800005"}
