Erlebach and van Leeuwen (2008) introduced this problem as the geometric version of the unique coverage problem, and gave a polynomial-time 18-approximation algorithm. In this paper, we improve this approximation ratio 18 to 2 +4/root 3+epsilon (<4.3095+epsilon) for any fixed constant epsilon>0. Our algorithm runs in polynomial time which depends exponentially on 1/epsilon. The algorithm can be generalized to the budgeted unique unit-disk coverage problem in which each point has a profit, each disk has a cost, and we wish to maximize the total profit of the uniquely covered points under the condition that the total cost is at most a given bound.
