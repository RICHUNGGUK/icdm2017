However, pure RT-DVS approaches rarely take into account the actual performance requirements of the target applications. With the primary goal of further reducing energy consumption while satisfying Quality of Control (QoC) requirements in real-time control systems, an enhanced dynamic voltage scaling (EDVS) scheme is suggested. Following the direct feedback scheduling methodology, EDVS exploits a QoC-aware adaptive resource allocation mechanism. It enables flexible timing constraints on control tasks, which facilitates further energy saving over pure RT-DVS. Simulation experiments argue that EDVS is highly cost-effective and can save much more energy over the optimal pure RT-DVS scheme, while providing comparable QoC.", "paper_title": "An enhanced dynamic voltage scaling scheme for energy-efficient embedded real-time control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800059"}
