A pair of vertex sets A, B subset of V( G) is a 2/3-separation of order |A boolean AND B| if A boolean OR B = V(G), there is no edge between A - B and B - A, and both A - B and B - A have weight at most 2 3 the total weight of G. Let l is an element of Z(+) be fixed. Alon et al. [1990] presented an algorithm that in O(n(1/2)m) time, outputs either a K-l-minor of G, or a separation of G of order O(n(1/2)). Whether there is a O(n + m)- time algorithm for this theorem was left as an open problem. In this article, we obtain a O(n + m)- time algorithm at the expense of a O(n(2/3)) separator. Moreover, our algorithm exhibits a trade-off between time complexity and the order of the separator. In particular, for any given epsilon is an element of [0, 1/2], our algorithm outputs either a K-l-minor of G, or a separation of G with order O(n((2-epsilon)/3)) in O(n(1+epsilon) + m) time. As an application we give a fast approximation algorithm for finding an independent set in a graph with no K-l-minor.", "paper_title": "A Linear-Time Algorithm to Find a Separator in a Graph Excluding a Minor", "paper_id": "WOS:000271945600006"}
