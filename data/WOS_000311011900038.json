We first describe the equivocation Delta(m) of the secret vector (s) over right arrow = [s(1), . . . , s(l)] given m shares in terms of the RDLP of linear codes. We also characterize two thresholds t(1) and t(2) in the secret sharing schemes by the RGHW of linear codes. One shows that any set of at most t(1) shares leaks no information about (s) over right arrow, and the other shows that any set of at least t(2) shares uniquely determines (s) over right arrow. It is clarified that both characterizations for t(1) and t(2) are better than Chen et al.'s ones derived by the regular minimum Hamming weight. Moreover, this paper characterizes the strong security in secret sharing schemes based on linear codes, by generalizing the definition of strongly-secure threshold ramp schemes. We define a secret sharing scheme achieving the alpha-strong security as the one such that the mutual information between any r elements of (s(1), . . . , s(l)) and any alpha - r + 1 shares is always zero. Then, it is clarified that secret sharing schemes based on linear codes can always achieve the alpha-strong security where the value alpha is precisely characterized by the RGHW.", "paper_title": "Secret Sharing Schemes Based on Linear Codes Can Be Precisely Characterized by the Relative Generalized Hamming Weight", "paper_id": "WOS:000311011900038"}
