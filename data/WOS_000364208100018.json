The proposed filter bank is designed by integrating spectral parameter approximation (SPA) technique with the modified coefficient decimation method (MCDM), referred to as SPA-MCDM-FB. The architectural details, design examples and complexity comparisons show that the SPA-MCDM-FB is easy to design and offers substantial savings in gate count, number of variable multipliers and group delay over other filter banks. Moreover, these savings increase further with the increase in the filter-bank resolution (i.e., number of subbands). The SPA-MCDM-FB is then combined with the upper confidence bound (UCB)-based decision-making algorithm to search the vacant band(s) of any desired bandwidth for spectrum-sensing application in cognitive radio (CR). The simulations results verify that the proposed scheme offers superior performance [i.e., improved utilization of vacant subband(s)] and needs fewer gate counts compared to uniform filter bank and UCB-algorithm-based schemes. Furthermore, the functionality and advantages of the SPA-MCDM-FB are also verified for the channelization operation in CR supporting multiple communication standards.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable Filter Bank With Complete Control Over Subband Bandwidths for Multistandard Wireless Communication Receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208100018"}
