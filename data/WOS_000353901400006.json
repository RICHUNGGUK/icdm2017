There has been significant progress in CP-ABE over the recent years because of two properties called traceability and large universe, greatly enriching the commercial applications of CP-ABE. Traceability is the ability of ABE to trace the malicious users or traitors who intentionally leak the partial or modified decryption keys for profits. Nevertheless, due to the nature of CP-ABE, it is difficult to identify the original key owner from an exposed key since the decryption privilege is shared by multiple users who have the same attributes. On the other hand, the property of large universe in ABE enlarges the practical applications by supporting flexible number of attributes. Several systems have been proposed to obtain either of the above properties. However, none of them achieve the two properties simultaneously in practice, which limits the commercial applications of CP-ABE to a certain extent. In this paper, we propose two practical large universe CP-ABE systems supporting white-box traceability. Compared with existing systems, both the two proposed systems have two advantages: 1) the number of attributes is not polynomially bounded and 2) malicious users who leak their decryption keys could be traced. Moreover, another remarkable advantage of the second proposed system is that the storage overhead for traitor tracing is constant, which are suitable for commercial applications.", "paper_title": "White-Box Traceable Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption Supporting Flexible Attributes", "paper_id": "WOS:000353901400006"}
