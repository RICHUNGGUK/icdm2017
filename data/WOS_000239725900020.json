We introduce FCP, a publicly accessible web tool dedicated to analyzing the current state and trends of the population of structures within protein families. FCP offers both graphical and quantitative data on the degree of functional coverage of enzymes and nuclear receptors by existing structures, as well as on the bias observed in the distribution of structures along their respective functional classification schemes.", "paper_title": "FCP: functional coverage of the proteome by structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000239725900020"}
