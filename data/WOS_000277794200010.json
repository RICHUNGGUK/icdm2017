By a reformulation of the governing equations, it is shown that the derivatives necessary to evaluate the sensitivity of a given performance measure corresponding to the current design configuration can be obtained through a post-processing step by the same finite element solver used to solve the discrete state equations. The procedure is illustrated for some examples with known analytical expression of the sensitivity and then applied to several practical problems in the design of an extrusion process.
