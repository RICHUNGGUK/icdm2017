This joins two themes: we extend our earlier work, having iteration but only qualitative (Morgan 2009), by making it quantitative; and we extend our earlier quantitative work (McIver et al. 2010) by including iteration. We advocate stepwise refinement and source-level program algebra - both as conceptual reasoning tools and as targets for automated assistance. A selection of algebraic laws is given to support this view in the case of quantitative noninterference; and it is demonstrated on a simple iterated password-guessing attack.", "paper_title": "Hidden-Markov program algebra with iteration", "paper_id": "WOS:000347805000005"}
