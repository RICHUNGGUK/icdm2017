However, TCP still faces several performance degradation issues due to the disparities in bandwidth and propagation delay between different access networks. Particularly, during vertical handoffs, some undesirable phenomena may erroneously trigger TCP congestion-control actions and thus degrade TCP performance. In this article we tackle the spurious timeout problem frequently associated with handovers from fast to slow links. We propose three network-layer schemes: Fast ACK, Slow ACK, and ACK Delaying. These schemes require only minor modifications to the network layer of mobile receivers and no change to the TCP protocol and the TCP sender. The simulation results show that these schemes can effectively improve TCP performance during soft vertical handoffs.", "paper_title": "Adding network-layer intelligence to mobile receivers for solving spurious TCP timeout during vertical handoff", "paper_id": "WOS:000242460800004"}
