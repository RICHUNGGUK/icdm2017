It is revealed that the conventional DA ML estimate is a special case of the novel DA ML estimate, and both the proposed DA ML and the proposed blind ML SNR estimation techniques can offer satisfactory, SNR estimation without introducing significant additional complexity to the existing hybrid ARQ scheme. Based on the ACNSS, both the generalized deterministic and the random Cramer-Rao lower bounds (GCRLBs), which include the traditional Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) as special cases, are also derived. Finally, the applicability of the proposed SNR estimation techniques based on the AONSS and the DONSS are validated through numerical analysis and simulation results.", "paper_title": "A Novel SNR Estimation Technique Associated with Hybrid ARQ", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773700034"}
