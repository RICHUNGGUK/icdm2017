Based on the idea of the semi-analytical finite element method (FEM), which combines general FEM with the high accuracy of a closed-form solution, a new spatial element that contains a drain well and its neighbouring smear zone is presented. This new combined element is depicted by eight global independent nodes and two local dependent nodes, and a classical analytical theory is introduced to set up the relationship between the two kinds of nodes. Because permeability diversity between the drain and the smear zone is considered, both the effects of smearing and well resistance are taken into account with the composite element method (CEM). A detailed derivation of the CEM is performed using the weighted residual method. The accuracy of the proposed method is validated with a totally penetrating, single-drain ground analysis for seven calculation conditions. Additionally, the proposed CEM saves 1/4-1/2 mesh elements and helps to avoid slender elements for the FEM analysis of the drained foundation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
