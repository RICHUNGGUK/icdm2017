These roles can be fulfilled by the functional design of scaffold pore architectures such that the scaffold provides proper mechanical and mass transport environments for new tissue formation. These roles require simultaneous design of mechanical and mass transport properties. In this paper, a numerical homogenization based topology optimization scheme was applied to the design of three dimensional unit microstructures for tissue engineering scaffolds. As measures of mechanical and mass transport environments, target effective bulk modulus and isotropic diffusivity were achieved by optimal design of porous microstructure. Cross property bounds between bulk modulus and diffusivity were adapted to determine feasible design targets for a given porosity. Results demonstrate that designed microstructures could reach cross property bounds for porosity ranging from 30% to 60%.", "paper_title": "Topology optimization of three dimensional tissue engineering scaffold architectures for prescribed bulk modulus and diffusivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000280943700011"}
