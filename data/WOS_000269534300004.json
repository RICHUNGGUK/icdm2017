We provide a general constrained optimization formulation for efficient replication and study it via analysis and simulations employing a discrete random walk mobility model for the vehicles. Our solution space comprises of a family of popularity based replication schemes each characterized by an exponent n. We find that the optimal replication exponent depends significantly on factors such as the total system storage, data item size, and vehicle trip duration. With small data items and long client trip durations, n similar to aEuro parts per thousand 0.5 i.e., a square-root replication scheme provides the lowest aggregate latency across all data item requests. However, for short trip durations, n moves toward 1, making a linear replication scheme more favorable. For larger data items and long client trip durations, we find that the optimal replication exponent is below 0.5. Finally, for these larger data items, if the client trip duration is short, the optimal replication exponent is found to be a function of the total storage in the system. Subsequently, the above observations are validated with two real data sets: one based on a city map with freeway traffic information and the other employing encounter traces from a bus network.", "paper_title": "Static Replication Strategies for Content Availability in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000269534300004"}
