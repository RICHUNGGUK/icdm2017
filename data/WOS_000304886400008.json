The model retains both the advantages and the standard procedure of using a constant transformation matrix in the conventional MRT scheme on a square lattice, leading to easy implementation in the algorithm. This allows flow problems characterized by dominant feature in one direction to be solved more efficiently. Two numerical tests have been carried out and shown that the proposed model is able to capture complex flow characteristics and generate an accurate solution if an appropriate lattice ratio is used. The model is found to be more stable compared to the original rectangular lattice Boltzmann method using the single relaxation time.", "paper_title": "MRT RECTANGULAR LATTICE BOLTZMANN METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000304886400008"}
