Our proposed framework, Automated Covert Channel Modeling (ACCM), can provide a reliable and valid implementation method for fully functional covert communication techniques that can be used to study various concepts, characteristics and features of covert communication. ACCM exploits the shared features of covert channel algorithms to define common blocks and automatically converts tasks and events of the common blocks to executable codes. In order to verify the accuracy of our proposed ACCM framework, we implement two different covert channel algorithms that are referenced repeatedly in literature. We demonstrate that the characteristics obtained from implementing covert communication using the ACCM framework match the theoretical concepts of network communication and the expected results.
