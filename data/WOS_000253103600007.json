From the results of dynamic tests, the fundamental frequencies of the Howa brick chimney are estimated to be about 3.06 Hz and 2.69 Hz in north-south and east-west directions, respectively. The natural modes and damping factors are identified by ARMAV (auto-regressive moving average vectors) model. The numerical model updating based on IEM (inverse eigensensitivity method) is applied to two models with two updating procedures; using only frequencies and both frequencies and mode shapes. The updating results show the mode shapes are very important to obtain the good results for the numerical model updating. From the results of the numerical model updating, the damaged areas are identified; these are found to correspond well to the position of the cracks of the static collapse test.
