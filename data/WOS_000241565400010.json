In the past, several simulation approaches have been proposed in this aspect, however, they had not gotten a satisfactory result. This paper presents an approach with which a network model is considered for the simuleting the train schedule on rail networks. Here the stations and section tracks of the rail network are respectively regarded as the nodes and edges of the network model. Using the proposed model, we simulate the train schedule with double-track sections. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model can be successfully used for the simulations of the train schedule on a rail networks. Some phenomena observed in real rail networks can be reproduced, such as the characteristic behavior of train movement. Moreover, the proposed model can handle the perturbations in the train schedule well.", "paper_title": "Network-based simulation approach for scheduling trains on rail networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241565400010"}
