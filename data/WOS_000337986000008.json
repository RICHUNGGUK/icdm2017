The study uses an artificial viscosity approach similar to the high-wavenumber biased artificial viscosity approach (Cook and Cabot, 2005, 2004; Kawai and Lele, 2008) [1-3], extended to an unstructured grid setup. The model employs a bulk viscosity for treating shocks, a shear viscosity for treating turbulence, and an artificial conductivity to handle contact discontinuities. The high-wavenumber biased viscosity is found to stabilize numerical calculations and reduce oscillations near discontinuities. Promising results are demonstrated for 1D and 2D test problems.
