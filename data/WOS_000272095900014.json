Although many studies have been conducted to assess users' satisfaction with mobile applications, none has focused on the ways in which the three quality factors associated with mobile banking - system quality, information quality and interface design quality - affect consumers' trust and satisfaction. Our proposed research model, based on DeLone and McLean's model, assesses how these three external quality factors can impact satisfaction and trust. We collected 276 valid questionnaires from mobile banking customers, then analyzed them using structural equation modeling. Our results show that system quality and information quality significantly influence customers' trust and satisfaction, and that interface design quality does not. We present herein implications and suggestions for further research. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
