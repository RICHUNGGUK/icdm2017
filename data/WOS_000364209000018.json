However, the basic optical devices employed to construct WDM-based ONoCs are imperfect and suffer from inevitable power loss and crosstalk noise. Furthermore, when employing WDM, optical signals of various wavelengths can interfere with each other through different optical switching elements within the network, creating crosstalk noise. As a result, the crosstalk noise in large-scale WDM-based ONoCs accumulates and causes severe performance degradation, restricts the network scalability, and considerably attenuates the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we systematically study and compare the worst case as well as the average crosstalk noise and SNR in three well-known optical interconnect architectures, mesh-based, folded-torus-based, and fat-tree-based ONoCs using WDM. The analytical models for the worst case and the average crosstalk noise and SNR in the different architectures are presented. Furthermore, the proposed analytical models are integrated into a newly developed crosstalk noise and loss analysis platform (CLAP) to analyze the crosstalk noise and SNR in WDM-based ONoCs of any network size using an arbitrary optical router. Utilizing CLAP, we compare the worst case as well as the average crosstalk noise and SNR in different WDM-based ONoC architectures. Furthermore, we indicate how the SNR changes in respect to variations in the number of optical wavelengths in use, the free-spectral range, and the microresonators Q factor. The analyses' results demonstrate that the crosstalk noise is of critical concern to WDM-based ONoCs: in the worst case, the crosstalk noise power exceeds the signal power in all three WDM-based ONoC architectures, even when the number of processor cores is small, e.g., 64.", "paper_title": "Crosstalk Noise in WDM-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip: A Formal Study and Comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000018"}
