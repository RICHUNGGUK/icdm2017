Our model extends the basic epidemic algorithm by adapting key operational parameters (i.e., the forwarding probability and validity period) of the data dissemination process. The main idea is that the forwarding probability is tuned according to the variability of the involved DS. Our findings from the introduction of this adaptive epidemic are quite promising. Our scheme supersedes conventional probabilistic information dissemination algorithms in terms of efficiency and reliability. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
