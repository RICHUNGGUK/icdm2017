Since manually correcting the mapping is an extremely cumbersome and time-consuming task, we have developed the MapFace editor The editor provides a convenient way of navigating the annotated information gained from the MMTx output, and enables users to correct this Information on both a conceptual and a syntactical level, and thus it greatly facilitates the handling of the MMTx program. Additionally, the editor provides enhanced visualization features to support the correct interpretation of medical concepts within the text We paid special attention to ensure that the MapFace editor is an intuitive and convenient tool to work with Therefore, we recently conducted a usability study in order to create a well founded background serving as a starting point for further Improvement of the editor's usability (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Easing semantically enriched information retrieval-An interactive semi-automatic annotation system for medical documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000277930900005"}
