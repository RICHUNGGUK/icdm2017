The D-ABB is used to compensate for die-to-die (D2D) and within-die (WID) parameter variations, and accordingly, improves the circuit yield regarding the speed, the dynamic power, and the leakage power. The D-ABB circuit consists of threshold voltage estimation circuits and direct control of the body bias performed by on-chip direct controller circuits. Circuit level simulation results of a circuit block case study, extracted from a real microprocessor critical path, referring to an industrial hardware-calibrated 65-nm CMOS technology transistor model, are presented. These results show that the proposed D-ABB reduces the standard deviations of the frequency, the dynamic power, and the leakage power by factors of 5.5X, 6.4X, and 4.5X, respectively, when both D2D and WID variations are considered. In addition, in the presented case study, initial total yields of 16.8% and 13% are improved to 100% and 91.4%, respectively. The proposed D-ABB circuit exhibits lower area overhead compared to the other ABB circuits reported in the literature.", "paper_title": "A Novel Low Area Overhead Direct Adaptive Body Bias (D-ABB) Circuit for Die-to-Die and Within-Die Variations Compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293755900011"}
