In the proposed system, the estimated task-force is further divided into core (permanent members of the institution(s)) and collaborators (more mobile members), and allows normalization of scientific production. Research groups/institutions/countries of different sizes/scientific areas can, thus, be directly compared and the time evolution of these groups inspected. Results are presented for the characterization of four universities (from Portugal, Sweden and USA) in the 2008-2012 period, for the research area of Chemistry. It is shown that it is possible not only to estimate the task-force, but also to derive new, relevant indicators for the set under analysis. Aspects pertaining to collaboration fluxes are also assessed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
