We developed a graphical software package based on a novel approach that can consistently identify CNVs of all types (homozygous deletions, heterozygous deletions, heterozygous duplications) from exome-sequencing data without the need of a paired control. The algorithm compares coverage depth in a test sample against a background distribution of control samples and uses principal component analysis to remove batch effects. It is user friendly and can be run on a personal computer.", "paper_title": "FishingCNV: a graphical software package for detecting rare copy number variations in exome-sequencing data", "paper_id": "WOS:000319428600015"}
