Cloud platform is an alternative to crack the nut because it gives concurrent considerations to both high-performance computing and high-extensible data storage. Therefore, we use Hadoop to construct a trial cloud platform to tackle the challenges derived from the heavy traffic, and perform network traffic analysis and target packet dissection. Our testbed evaluates the performance against different processing strategies, and shows the statistic results. According to the experimental results, the Hadoop-based platform can fit to process massive traffic data very well, and it's appropriate to manage today's data centers with cloud computing services.", "paper_title": "Network Traffic Analysis with Cloud Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000312045300010"}
