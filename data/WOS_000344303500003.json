Looking for small universal computing devices is a classical research topic in computer science. In this work, we investigate small universal SNPA systems as both devices computing functions and devices generating sets of numbers. Specifically, as devices of computing functions, a universal SNPA system (without delay and forgetting rules) using 57 neurons and 19 astrocytes is obtained; as generators of sets of numbers, a universal SNPA system (without delay and forgetting rules) using 54 neurons and 17 astrocytes is found. These improve previous results on SN P systems without astrocytes and show the role of these features.", "paper_title": "Small Universal Spiking Neural P Systems with Astrocytes", "paper_id": "WOS:000344303500003"}
