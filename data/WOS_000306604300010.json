RING consists of three modules: (a) a compiler that translates inputs written as a program in an English-like reaction language into internal representations and instructions, (b) a network generator that constructs an exhaustive reaction network from reaction rules and initial reactants specified, and (c) a post-processing module that can extract pathways, mechanisms, or lumps from the network based on user-specified instructions. RING can be used, in a rule-based manner, for constructing a large and complex reaction network from a set of elementary/overall reaction rules, and for elucidating transformations occurring in these networks through identifying pathways and mechanisms to specified products.
