To this end, a novel approach that gives an alternative analytical expression using B-spline functions is presented. The basic concept lies mainly on the idea that B-spline functions form a basis for the space of splines and have refined-node representations by knot insertion. This newly-developed expression is essentially equivalent to the conventional one, but gives a more explicit formulation on this issue. For the purpose of establishing the mathematical foundation of the EMD methodology, this study may afford a favorable opportunity in this direction.", "paper_title": "B-SPLINE ANALYTICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE MEAN ENVELOPE FOR EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000278193700001"}
