Our results show that an FPGA using this fabric can achieve 1.57 times lower dynamic power consumption and 1.35 times lower average net delays with only 9% reduction in logic density over a baseline island-style FPGA implemented in the same 65-nm CMOS technology. These improvements in power and delay are achieved by 1) using only short interconnect segments to reduce routed net lengths, and 2) reducing interconnect segment loading due to programming overhead relative to the baseline FPGA without compromising routability. The new routing fabric is also well-suited to monolithically stacked 3-D-IC implementation. It is shown that a 3-D-FPGA using this fabric can achieve a 3.3 times improvement in logic density, a 2.51 times improvement in delay, and a 2.93 times improvement in dynamic power consumption over the same baseline 2-D-FPGA.", "paper_title": "A Low-Power Field-Programmable Gate Array Routing Fabric", "paper_id": "WOS:000270037400010"}
