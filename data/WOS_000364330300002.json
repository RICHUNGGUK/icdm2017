We introduce primal-dual schema based on the LP relaxations devised by Carr et al. for the minimum knapsack problem as well as for the single-demand capacitated facility location problem. Our primal-dual algorithms achieve the same performance guarantees as the LP-rounding algorithms of Carr et al. which rely on applying the ellipsoid algorithm to an exponentially-sized LP. Furthermore, we introduce new flow-cover inequalities to strengthen the LP relaxation of the more general capacitated single-item lot-sizing problem; using just these inequalities as the LP relaxation, we obtain a primal-dual algorithm that achieves a performance guarantee of 2. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm on generated problem instances.", "paper_title": "Primal-dual schema for capacitated covering problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000364330300002"}
