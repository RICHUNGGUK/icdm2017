Educators have been aware of this problem and have urged their students to prepare in different ways, such as by self-reparation, handing in a pre-laboratory assignment, or attending a pre-laboratory preparation session. Many studies report different approaches to laboratory preparation; however comparative investigations are scarce. This article reports on an empirical study that spanned over 3 years. Three preparation modes (PMs) are compared: (a) PM1pre-laboratory home assignment with the laboratory manual and virtual laboratory software; (b) PM2pre-laboratory session with a teaching assistant and preparation via the laboratory manual only; and (c) PM3pre-laboratory session with a teaching assistant and preparation via the virtual laboratory and the laboratory manual. Measurements of the laboratory learning outcomes by means of pre- and post-laboratory tests and a comprehensive laboratory report indicate that PM3 is the most efficient approach. Discussions of the result in light of pedagogical and cognitive science theories are provided. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
