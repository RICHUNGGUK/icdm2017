A typical RFID system includes transponders (tags) and interrogators (readers): tags are attached to objects/persons, and readers communicate with the tags in their transmission ranges via radio signals. RFID systems have been gaining more and more popularity in areas such as supply chain management, automated identification systems, and any place requiring identifications of products or people. RFID technology is better than barcode in many ways, and may totally replace barcode in the future if certain technologies can be achieved such as low cost and protection of personal privacy. This paper provides a technology survey of RFID systems and various RFID applications. We also discuss five critical research issues: cost control, energy efficiency, privacy issue, multiple readers' interference, and security issue.
