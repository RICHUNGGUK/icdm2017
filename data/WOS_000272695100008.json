We establish the learning rates of the least square regularized regression algorithm in reproducing kernel Hilbert space for functional data. With the iteration method, we obtain fast learning rate for functional data. Our result is a natural extension for least square regularized regression algorithm when the dimension of input data is finite.", "paper_title": "LEARNING RATES OF REGULARIZED REGRESSION FOR FUNCTIONAL DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000272695100008"}
