Especially, in the robot and security industry, security guard robot provides a variety of information to the user and achieves its duty through the Web. The communication technique for these telepresence robots takes charge of the probability of various services in the robot industry. Last year. the interface for telepresence robot has developed over the Web or RF between robots. but these systems have the demerits of limited distance or geographical limit to be established to an internet link. In this paper. we propose the SG-Robot(Security Guard Robot) that can be operated and conduct surveillance of the environment around itself anytime/anywhere using CDMA networking. SG-Robot was able to solve those problems, conduct the surveillance task and communicate between multi SG-Robot and users over the CDMA2000-1x communication network efficiently.", "paper_title": "SG-robot: CDMA network-operated mobile robot for security guard at home", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800069"}
