A matrix-free implementation is presented, and special attention is given to the treatment of the stabilization matrix to maintain a compact stencil suitable for unstructured grids. We find SIMPLER preconditioning to be robust and efficient for academic test cases and industrial test cases. Compared with the classical SIMPLE solver, SIMPLER preconditioning reduces the number of nonlinear iterations by a factor 520 and the CPU time by a factor 25 depending on the case. The flow around a ship hull at Reynolds number 2E9, for example, on a grid with cell aspect ratio up to 1:1E6, can be computed in 3 instead of 15h.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "SIMPLE-type preconditioners for cell-centered, colocated finite volume discretization of incompressible Reynolds-averaged NavierStokes equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000314475200002"}
