However, current P2P stream systems also suffer many problems, such as huge bandwidth consumption, less effective in heterogeneous environment, etc. Scalable video coding (SVC), as an extension of H.264/AVC standard, has attracted many researchers for its flexible scalability and adaptability to the heterogeneous network. Network coding, an innovation of the field of information theory, is proved to be valuable in P2P application. In this paper, we propose two different network coding schemes (multi-layer network coding and intra-layer network coding), combining with SVC technology to solve the above problems. Simulation result shows system gain significant improvement by employing network coding, especially by intra-layer network coding.", "paper_title": "AN EFFECTIVE NETWORK CODING STRATEGY WITH SCALABLE VIDEO CODING FOR PEER-TO-PEER STREAMING", "paper_id": "WOS:000296754900011"}
