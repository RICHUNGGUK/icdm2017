To address this problem for scientific computing dataflows, we propose a methodology for determining custom hybrid fixed/floating-point data representations for iterative computations.", "paper_title": "Automated Range and Precision Bit-Width Allocation for Iterative Computations", "paper_id": "WOS:000294132100001"}
