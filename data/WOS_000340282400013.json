Existing research in execution of scientific workflows in Clouds either try to minimize the workflow execution time ignoring deadlines and budgets or focus on the minimization of cost while trying to meet the application deadline. However, they implement limited contingency strategies to correct delays caused by underestimation of tasks execution time or fluctuations in the delivered performance of leased public Cloud resources. To mitigate effects of performance variation of resources on soft deadlines of workflow applications, we propose an algorithm that uses idle time of provisioned resources and budget surplus to replicate tasks. Simulation experiments with four well-known scientific workflows show that the proposed algorithm increases the likelihood of deadlines being met and reduces the total execution time of applications as the budget available for replication increases.", "paper_title": "Meeting Deadlines of Scientific Workflows in Public Clouds with Tasks Replication", "paper_id": "WOS:000340282400013"}
