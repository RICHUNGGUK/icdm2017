The proposed estimation algorithm optimizes a penalized least squares objective function to estimate the factor dimension jointly with the remaining model parameters in an iterative hierarchical order. Monte Carlo experiments show that, in many configurations of the data, such a refinement provides more efficient estimates in terms of MSE than those that could be achieved if the feasible iterative least squares estimator is calculated with an externally selected factor dimension. The method is applied to the problem of the credit spread puzzle to estimate the space of the missing risk factors jointly with the effects of the observed credit and illiquidity risks.
