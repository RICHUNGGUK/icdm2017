First, we briefly review the optimum PA scheme under perfect power control (PPC) and the CAC scheme subject to an outage constraint on the total composite received power. Then, we analyze the outage degradation due to the power control error when the optimum reference power levels under PPC are used. In order to mitigate the outage degradation, we would modify the reference power levels by incorporating a call dropping strategy and an outage-lowering strategy into the optimum PA scheme under PPC. Also, we derive a constraint inequality to determine the reverse link capacity under IPC. Finally, through numerical analyses, we compute the modified reference power levels under IPC and evaluate the reverse link capacity under IPC.
