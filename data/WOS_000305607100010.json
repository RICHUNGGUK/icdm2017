To accomplish our goal, we combine surface-based and space-based deformation transfers. Our system enhances the result of space deformation transfer, which is applicable to multi-component objects but loses details, by using surface-based deformation transfer to add fine-scale deformations. Self-collisions are handled by approximating spatial relationships between surfaces, from the result of space deformation. Experimental results show that our method can transfer fine-scale deformations such as motions of a skirt and muscle bulging.
