The need for new tools able to help clinicians in predicting ESKD risk for IgAN patients is highly recognized in the medical field. In this paper we present a software tool that exploits the power of artificial neural networks to classify patients' health status potentially leading to ESKD. The classifier lever-ages the results returned by an ensemble of 10 networks trained by using data collected in a period of 38 years at University of Bari. The developed tool has been made available both as an online Web application and as an Android mobile app. Noteworthy to its clinical usefulness is that its development is based on the largest available cohort worldwide.
