They observed that one can easily get an O(nlogn) upper bound by repeatedly removing the edges of the longest cycle. We make the first progress on this problem, showing that O(nloglogn) cycles and edges suffice. We also prove the Erds-Gallai conjecture for random graphs and for graphs with linear minimum degree.
