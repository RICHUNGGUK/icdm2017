However, data centers hosting cloud applications consume vast amounts of electrical energy, thereby contributing to high operational costs and carbon footprints. Green cloud computing solutions that can not only minimize the operational costs but also reduce the environmental impact are necessary. This study focuses on the Infrastructure as a Service model, where custom virtual machines (VMs) are launched in appropriate servers available in a data center. A complete data center resource management scheme is presented in this paper. The scheme can not only ensure user quality of service (through service level agreements) but can also achieve maximum energy saving and green computing goals. Considering that the data center host is usually tens of thousands in size and that using an exact algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem is difficult, the modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm and improved extremal optimization are employed in this study to solve the dynamic allocation problem of VMs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed resource management scheme exhibits excellent performance in green cloud computing.
