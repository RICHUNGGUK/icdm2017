However, the low level of agreement between human judges Performing the task is an issue of concern. In previous approaches, annotators were asked to identify sentences in a document set that are relevant to a given topic, and then to eliminate sentences that do not provide novel information. This paper aims to explore a new approach in which relevance and novelty judgments are made within the context of specific, factual information needs, rather than with respect to a broad topic. Design/methodology/approach - An experiment is conducted in which annotators perform the novelty detection task in both the topic-focused and fact-focused settings. Findings - Higher levels of agreement between judges are found on the task of identifying relevant sentences in the fact-focused approach. However, the new approach does not improve agreement on novelty judgments. Originality/value - The analysis confirms the intuition that making sentence-level relevance judgments is likely to be the more difficult of the two tasks in the novelty detection framework.", "paper_title": "Exploring fact-focused relevance and novelty detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000259459300004"}
