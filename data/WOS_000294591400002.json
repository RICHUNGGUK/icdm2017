We study all alternative methods which satisfy the above requirements. We compare the eight-step method with well known multistep methods in the literature. The study of the methods is based on error analysis, stability analysis and comparison with other methods. The investigated methods are applied for the numerical integration of the radial Schrodinger equation.", "paper_title": "On Eight-Step Methods with Vanished Phase-Lag and Its Derivatives for the Numerical Solution of the Schrodinger Equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000294591400002"}
