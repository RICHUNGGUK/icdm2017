The dam and a part of the reservoir with irregular geometry are modeled with finite elements. A high-order doubly asymptotic open boundary condition is developed to model the remaining part of the reservoir simplified as a semi-infinite layer of constant depth. This open boundary is temporally local, stable and converges rapidly as the order increases. It is directly coupled with the commercial software ABAQUS by using a sequential staggered implicit-implicit partition algorithm. Numerical examples demonstrate the high accuracy and long-time stability of the proposed technique. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
