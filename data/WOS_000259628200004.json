It is now possible to animate entire crowds of virtual avatars, or to display in real-time highly realistic deformable characters. This new type of applications requires that characters are deformed, either to generate a large number of individuals for creating a crowd, or to match a particular shape. To make the animation fit to the animated character and to prevent self-collisions, adapting the motion is mandatory. Unlike previous approaches which relied on skeletal models, this paper presents a method considering the actual shape of the character's body to perform the adaptation. Our approach uses spacetime optimization to remove the self-penetration, and finally re-establishes the balance of the motion. We also introduce an interpolation scheme based on radial basis functions that can blend pre-calculated adaptations, and thus achieve real-time performances.
