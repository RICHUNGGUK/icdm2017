An example is the positive partial transposition criterion. Here we present, for the first time, the analogous thing for secret correlations. We introduce a computable criterion which certifies that a probability distribution between two honest, parties and an eavesdropper cannot be (asymptotically) distilled into a secret key, The existence of non-distillable correlations with positive secrecy cost, also known as bound information, is an open question. This criterion may be the key for finding bound information. However, if it turns out that this criterion does not detect bound information, then, a very interesting consequence follows: any distribution with positive secrecy cost can increase the secrecy content of another distribution. In other words, all correlations with positive secrecy cost constitute a useful resource.", "paper_title": "A NON-DISTILLABILITY CRITERION FOR SECRET CORRELATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273154700011"}
