However, in web systems and other scenarios where the application can be used by dozens of different kinds of users, the identification of this 'typical user' is quite difficult, if not impossible. Our proposal is to avoid the construction of interactive dialogs during the design stage, building them dynamically once the specific cognitive, perceptual and motor requirements of the current user are known: that is, during the execution stage. This is the approach used by GADEA, an intelligent user interface management system (UIMS) able to separate the functionality of an application from its interface in real time. The system adapts the components of the interface depending on the information stored in a user model which is continuously updated by a small army of data-gathering agents.", "paper_title": "Improving accessibility with user-tailored interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000261831100007"}
