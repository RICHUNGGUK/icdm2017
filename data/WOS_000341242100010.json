However, the low energy capacity assigned to each node prompts users to look at an important design challenge which is lifetime maximization. Especially the availability of nodes, the sensor coverage, and the connectivity have been included in discussions on network lifetime. Therefore, designing effective techniques that conserve scarce energy resources is a critical issue in WSNs. In this regard, we are interested in developing various mechanisms to save energy based on the constraints involved for energy consumption in WSNs. Three mechanisms are proposed to reduce the number of control packets responsible for path discovery, optimize diffusion area, and balance the load distribution in the network.", "paper_title": "A NEW ENERGY-EFFICIENT NEIGHBOR DISCOVERY AND LOAD BALANCING PROTOCOL FOR MOBILE SENSOR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000341242100010"}
