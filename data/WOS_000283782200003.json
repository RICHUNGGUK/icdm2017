This paper presents a fast adaptive termination algorithm for mode selection to increase its computation speed while attempting to maintain its coding efficiency. The developed algorithm consists of the following three main steps which are applied not only to the enhancement layer but also to the base layer: a prediction step based on neighboring macroblocks, a first round check step, and a second round check step or refinement if failure occurs during the first round check. Comparison results with the existing algorithms are provided. The results obtained on various video sequences show that the introduced algorithm achieves about one-third reduction in the computation speed while generating more or less the same video quality.", "paper_title": "Fast adaptive termination mode selection for H.264 scalable video coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000283782200003"}
