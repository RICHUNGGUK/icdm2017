The approach consists of two main processing steps. First, potential airway branch and connection candidates are identified and represented by a graph structure with weighted nodes and edges, respectively. Second, an optimization algorithm is utilized for generating an airway detection result by selecting a subset of airway branches and connections based on graph weights derived from image features. The performance of the algorithm with different feature categories and their combinations was assessed on a set of 50 lung CT scans from five different cohorts, including normal and diseased lungs. Results show trade-offs between feature categories/combinations in terms of correctly (true positive) and incorrectly (false positive) identified airways. Also, the performance of features in dependence of lung cohort was analyzed. Across all cohorts, a good trade-off with high true positive rate (TPR) and low false positive rate (FPR) was achieved by a combination of gray-value, local shape, and structural features. This combination enabled extracting 91.80% of reference airways (TPR) in combination with a low FPR of 1.00%. In addition, this variant was evaluated on the public EXACT' 09 test set, and a comparison with other airway detection approaches is provided. One of the main advantages of the presented method is that it is robust against local disturbances/artifacts or other ambiguities that are frequently occurring in lung CT scans.", "paper_title": "Graph-Based Airway Tree Reconstruction From Chest CT Scans: Evaluation of Different Features on Five Cohorts", "paper_id": "WOS:000353899600005"}
