Learning the structure of the BAN classifier, a fitness function based on logarithm likelihood and the corresponding genetic operator are designed, and network structure code scheme is also designed, so that GBAN can constrict to global optimal structure. With the use of several data sets from the UCI Database, the comparisons of the classification results between GBAN and other algorithms such as TAN, BAN, GBN and Naive Bayes are given, respectively. And the results show that GBAN algorithm can get a better classification performance.", "paper_title": "CLASSIFIER LEARNING ALGORITHM BASED ON GENETIC ALGORITHMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000035"}
