Clear two-factor interactions (2fi's) can be estimated under the weak assumption that interactions involving three or more factors can be ignored. Some theoretical results on the existence of clear 2fi's in 2(IV)(m-p) : 2(l) designs are obtained, where 2(IV)(m-p) : 2(l) denotes a regular resolution IV blocked design with m treatment factors, 1 block factors, and 2(m-p) P runs. An algorithm is proposed for constructing 2(IV)(m-p) P : 2(l) designs with the maximum number of clear 2fi's. Based on this algorithm, the 16-, 32-, and 64-run 2(IV)(m-p) : 2(l) designs containing the maximum number of clear 2fi's are constructed and tabulated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
