Pinning state feedback controllers have been proved to be effective for synchronization control of state-coupled dynamical networks. We will show that pinning impulsive controllers are also effective for synchronization control of the above mentioned dynamical networks. Some generic mean square stability criteria are derived in terms of algebraic conditions, which guarantee that the whole state-coupled dynamical network can be forced to some desired trajectory by placing impulsive controllers on a small fraction of nodes. An effective method is given to select the nodes which should be controlled at each impulsive constants. The proportion of the controlled nodes guaranteeing the stability is explicitly obtained, and the synchronization region is also derived and clearly plotted. Numerical simulations are exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the pinning impulsive strategy proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Synchronization Control for Nonlinear Stochastic Dynamical Networks: Pinning Impulsive Strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000302704300009"}
