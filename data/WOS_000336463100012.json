This kind of systems has the property that the states take nonnegative values whenever the initial boundaries are nonnegative, some delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of positive 20 switched systems with state delays are given. Furthermore, the design of positive state feedback controller under which the resulting closed-loop system meets the requirements of positivity and exponential stability is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An example is included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
