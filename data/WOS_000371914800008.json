Swarm robotics has been widely considered in such situations, due to its strengths such as robustness, simplicity and scalability. Typical multi-robot foraging systems currently consider tens to hundreds of agents. This paper presents a new algorithm called Energy-aware Cooperative Switching Algorithm for Foraging (EC-SAF) that manages thousands of robots. We investigate therefore the scalability of EC-SAF algorithm and the parameters that can affect energy efficiency overtime. Results indicate that EC-SAF is scalable and effective in reducing swarm energy consumption compared to an energy-aware version of the reference well-known c-marking algorithm (Ec-marking).", "paper_title": "AN ENERGY-AWARE ALGORITHM FOR LARGE SCALE FORAGING SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000371914800008"}
