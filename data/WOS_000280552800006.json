Performance optimization of these workflows can be viewed as a search for a set of optimal values in a multidimensional parameter space consisting of input performance parameters to the applications that are known to affect their execution times. While some performance parameters such as grouping of workflow components and their mapping to machines do not affect the accuracy of the analysis, others may dictate trading the output quality of individual components (and of the whole workflow) for performance. This paper describes an integrated framework which is capable of supporting performance optimizations along multiple such parameters. Using two real-world applications in the spatial, multidimensional data analysis domain, we present an experimental evaluation of the proposed framework.", "paper_title": "Parameterized specification, configuration and execution of data-intensive scientific workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000280552800006"}
