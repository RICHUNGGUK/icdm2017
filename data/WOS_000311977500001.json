The model d-k-CSP unifies several related models such as the model RB and the model k-CSR We prove that the model d-k-CSP exhibits exact phase transitions if klnd increases no slower than the logarithm of the number of variables. A series of experimental studies with interesting observations are carried out to illustrate the solubility phase transition and the hardness of instances around phase transitions.
