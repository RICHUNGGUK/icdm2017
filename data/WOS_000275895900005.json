Tools such as PhotoDoc enable the batch processing of such documents, performing automatic border removal and perspective correction. A PhotoDoc processed document and a scanned one look very similar to the human eye if both are in true color. However, if one tries to automatically binarize a batch of documents digitized from portable cameras compared to scanners, they have different features. The knowledge of their source is fundamental for successful processing. This paper presents a classification strategy to distinguish between scanned and photographed documents. Over 16,000 documents were tested with a correct classification rate of over 99.96%.", "paper_title": "Automatically Deciding if a Document was Scanned or Photographed", "paper_id": "WOS:000275895900005"}
