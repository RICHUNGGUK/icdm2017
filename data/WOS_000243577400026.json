We demonstrate, by rigorous multiple comparison statistical tests, that these techniques can provide consistent improvements in predictive performance over single decision trees. However, within these methods, there is no clearly best-performing algorithm. This motivates a more in-depth investigation into the properties of random forests. We identify a set of parameters for the random forest that provide optimal performance across all the studied data sets. Additionally, the tree ensemble structure of the forest may provide an interpretable model, a considerable advantage over SVMs. We test this possibility and compare it with standard decision tree models.", "paper_title": "Contemporary QSAR classifiers compared", "paper_id": "WOS:000243577400026"}
