This architecture is flexible enough to enable the re-definition of behavior policies at runtime. This makes it possible to adapt the behavior of applications after deployment. It is also able to manage different cloud providers. This architecture has been implemented and the most relevant details of such implementation are also covered in this paper. Moreover, some use cases are also explained in order to provide a better description of the advantages of the proposed architecture.", "paper_title": "Towards Runtime Reconfiguration of Application Control Policies in the Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000309340700003"}
