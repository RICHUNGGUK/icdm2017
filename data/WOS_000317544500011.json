There, each tuple centre is extended with the ontological description of the coordination domain, expressed by means of the W3C standard OWL Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our coordination model smoothly extends the standard syntactic setting of tuple spaces, allowing tuple centres to encapsulate the semantic representation of the domain of discourse, and to embody semantic coordination policies. In order to test the feasibility of our approach, a prototypical implementation of our model in the TuCSoN infrastructure featuring the Pellet semantic reasoner is described and discussed.
