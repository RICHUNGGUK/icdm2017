The LMI-based criterion heavily depends on both the upper and lower bounds on time delay and its derivative, which is different from the existent ones and has wider application fields than some present results. Finally, three numerical examples can illustrate the efficiency of the new method based on the reduced conservatism which can be achieved by thinning the delay interval.", "paper_title": "Delay-Derivative-Dependent Stability for Delayed Neural Networks With Unbound Distributed Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000283422600016"}
