In this paper, we survey the advantages and limitations of known approaches, and present and discuss test results which illustrate the successes and failures of a currently popular approach based on Dijkstra's Algorithm. We conclude that the root cause of many failure cases is that the underlying algorithm assumes that the cost of traversing an edge is fixed. We propose a new polynomial-order algorithm for finding faces in wireframes. This algorithm could be adapted to any graph-theoretical least-cost circuit problem where the cost of traversing an edge is not fixed but context-dependent.
