To overcome this problem, a new regression method for multi-way data called SCREAM (Shifted Covariates REgression Analysis for Multi-way data), which is based on a combination of PARAFAC2 and principal covariates regression (PCovR), is proposed. In particular, the algorithm combines a PARAFAC2 decomposition of the X array and a PCovR-like way of computing the regression coefficients, analogously to what has been described by Smilde and Kiers (A.K. Smilde and H.A.L. Kiers, 1999) in the case of other multi-way PCovR models. The method is tested on real and simulated datasets providing good results and performing as well or better than other available regression approaches for multi-way data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
