For human structures such as abdomen, registration would involve global features such as abdominal wall as well as local target organs such as liver or spleen. A general non-rigid registration may not be sufficient to produce image matching of both global and local structures. In this study, a warping-deformable model is proposed to register images of such structures. This model uses a two-stage strategy for image registration of abdomen. In the first stage, the global-deformable transformation is used to register the global wall. The warping-transformation is used in second stage to register the liver. There is a good match of images using the proposed method (mean similarity index = 0.73545).The image matching correlation coefficients calculated from eight pairs of CT and MR images of abdomen indicates that the warping-deformable transformation gives better matching of images than those without transformation (p < 0.001, paired t-test). This study has established a model for image registration of deformable structures. This is particularly important for data mining of image content retrieval for structures which are non-rigid. The result obtained is very promising but further clinical evaluation is needed.", "paper_title": "Image fusion enhancement of deformable human structures using a two-stage warping-deformable strategy: A content-based image retrieval consideration", "paper_id": "WOS:000268574200004"}
