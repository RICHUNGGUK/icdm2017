New frames in an image sequence ( video) are segmented based on the prior segmentation of earlier frames in the sequence. The segmentation is performed by adapting a probabilistic model learned on previous frames, according to the content of the new frame. We utilize the maximum a posteriori version of the EM algorithm to segment the new image. The Gaussian mixture distribution that is used to model the current frame is transformed into a conjugate-prior distribution for the parametric model describing the segmentation of the new frame. This semisupervised method improves the segmentation quality and consistency and enables a propagation of segments along the segmented images. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on both simulated and real image data.", "paper_title": "Context-based segmentation of image sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000234517900011"}
