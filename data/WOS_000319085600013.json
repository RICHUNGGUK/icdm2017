The channel design method results in the optimum TLC design. The receiver with mixers and DC balancing circuits reduces the threshold control circuits and digital circuits to decode dicode partial response signals. Our techniques enable low inter-symbol interference (ISI) dicode partial response communications without three level decision circuits and complex threshold control circuits. The techniques were evaluated in a simulation with an EM solver and a transistor level simulation. The circuit was designed in the 90-nm CMOS process. The simulation results show 12-Gb/s operation and 52 mW power consumption at 1.2 V.", "paper_title": "Transmission Line Coupler Design and Mixer-Based Receiver for Dicode Partial Response Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085600013"}
