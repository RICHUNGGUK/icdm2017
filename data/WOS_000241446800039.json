The traditional spatial database stores the quantitative data such as coordinate, while GSW needs much qualitative information such as spatial relation. The previous qualitative spatio-temporal systems were all prototype systems which did not support general spatio-temporal relation model and data input. We design the qualitative spatial relation database (QSRDB) based on spatial reasoning. GML data can be converted to QSRDB as data input. OWL ontologies can be generated from QSRDB and applied to GSW systems.", "paper_title": "Qualitative spatial relation database for sEmantic Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800039"}
