In this work, we present a general protocol to explore systematically the activity landscape of a lead series using 11 2D and 3D structural representations. As a test case we employed a set of 48 bicyclic guanidines (BCGs) with kappa-opioid receptor binding affinity, identified in our group. MACCS keys, graph-based three point pharmacophores, circular fingerprints, ROCS shape descriptors, and the TARIS approach, that compares structures based on molecular electrostatic potentials, were employed as orthogonal descriptors. Based on 'activity cliffs' common to a series of descriptors, we introduce the concept of consensus activity cliffs. Results for the current test case suggest that the presence or absence of a methoxybenzyl group may lead to different modes of binding for the active BCGs with the K-Opioid receptor. The most active compound (IC(50) = 37 nM) is involved in a number of consensus cliffs making it a more challenge query for future virtual screening than would be expected from affinity alone. Results also reveal the importance of screening high density combinatorial libraries, especially in the \"cliff-rich\" regions of activity landscapes. The protocol presented here can be applied to other data sets to develop a consensus model of the activity landscape.", "paper_title": "Characterization of Activity Landscapes Using 2D and 3D Similarity Methods: Consensus Activity Cliffs", "paper_id": "WOS:000263658200029"}
