They left an open problem in the error resilient Lempel-Ziv algorithm with k-error protocol. The algorithm uses hash junction to eliminate the dependence between addresses in the dictionary. But hash conflicts affect the compression performance. In this paper, we have implemented a k-error protocol Lempel-Ziv algorithm with perfect hashing. By using a simple perfect hashing scheme, the hash conflicts can be easily removed and the compression performance can be improved. Experimental results also show that our algorithm can enhance the compression performance of the error resilient Lempel-Ziv code.", "paper_title": "Error resilient Lempel-Ziv data compression scheme with perfect hashing", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000024"}
