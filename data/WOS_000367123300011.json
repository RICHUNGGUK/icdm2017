As the network is a key element in integrating mobile devices to the cloud, a proper management of the mobile cloud computing environment is necessary. Such a management must take into account two main perspectives: administrator's and end-user's perspectives. The administrator is usually concerned with a more objective perspective based on Quality of Service parameters, such as throughput, delay, and jitter. On the other hand, the end-user has a more subjective perspective, observing his/her Quality of Experience when using a mobile cloud application or service. In this article, we introduce a management model and architecture for mobile cloud computing, exploiting both objective and subjective perspectives. As a proof of concept, we prototyped the architecture in a management system called CoLisEU, which allowed us to investigate this architecture and we discuss the benefits of the combined objective and subjective perspectives in our management architecture.
