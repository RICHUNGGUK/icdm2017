The location of a factor w of f(alpha) is defined to be the set of all positions in f(alpha) at which w occurs. In this paper, an explicit formula of the location of each factor in of f(alpha) is obtained. The decompositions RED(alpha) (w) and SOD(alpha) (w) of f(alpha) associated with in are established. The former one involves all return words of in while the latter one involves all occurrences of in and the corresponding separate factors and overlap factors.
