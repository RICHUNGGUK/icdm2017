We show that this implies that X is almost Euclidean in the following sense: Every n-dimensional subspace of X embeds into Hilbert space with distortion 2(2O(log*n)). On the other hand, we show that there exists a normed space Y which satisfies the J-L lemma, but for every n, there exists an n-dimensional sub-space E(n) subset of Y whose Euclidean distortion is at least 2(Omega(alpha(n))), where alpha is the inverse Ackermann function.", "paper_title": "The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma Almost Characterizes Hilbert Space, But Not Quite", "paper_id": "WOS:000274331500005"}
