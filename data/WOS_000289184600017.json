By applying a matrix calculation, the fire probability, frequency, cycle, and risk ratio for each functional area within a multi-purpose building were obtained. With assistance from the Taiwan government, the fire case investigation and statistical data for building fires were established. By adopting the risk ratio concept, the weight values for 20 fire safety assessment criteria and 4 fire safety strategies for a multi-purpose building were acquired to indicate the possible causes of fires and the quantitative extent of fire influence.
