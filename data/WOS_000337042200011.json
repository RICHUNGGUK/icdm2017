In this paper, we present a new construction of the symmetric encryption scheme in the the ideal cipher model (ICM); we prove that our scheme is KDM secure against active attacks with respect to arbitrary polynomialtime challenge functions. Our main idea is to introduce a universal hash function (UHF) h as a random value for each encryption, and then use s = h(sk) as the key of the ideal cipher F, where sk is the private key of our symmetric encryption scheme. Although many other schemes that are secure against KDM attacks have already been proposed, in both the ideal standard models, the much more significance of our paper is the simplicity in which we implement KDM security against active attacks.", "paper_title": "Construction of a key-dependent message secure symmetric encryption scheme in the ideal cipher model", "paper_id": "WOS:000337042200011"}
