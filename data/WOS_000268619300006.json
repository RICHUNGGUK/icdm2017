The method can be described as a combination of a physical behavioral model with a phenomenological rock generator. The main modules of the solution consist of a Virtual Reality system, fractal geometric modeling, and physical control models. Virtual Reality and geometric modeling compose the phenomenological rock generator, which simulates the process; while the physical behavioral model controls or affects the results of the simulation, We present the key algorithms of the visual simulation solution, such as the rapid modeling algorithm for rock with complex topology, distributed parallel rendering for large scale and complex rock objects. To evaluate the system, a virtual simulation for rocks crushed in cone crusher is introduced. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
