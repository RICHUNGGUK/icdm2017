Among them, iris recognition is considered as one of the most reliable and accurate technologies. In the preparation of iris recognition, the iris location will influence the performance of the entire system. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to locate iris and eyelids. Morphological operation is applied to remove eyelashes during iris boundary location. An optimal step length is calculated to reduce the searching time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed iris location algorithm is able to achieve a good performance with accuracy higher than 97.6%.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL IRIS LOCATION ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000264491300006"}
