This problem-oriented new DEA model can simultaneously assess the production and investment performance of insurers, differing from classical DEA models appropriate for independent performance evaluation. The mathematical solution is provided for this new model and the results show that the Canadian L&H insurance companies operated very efficiently for the examined 3-year period (1996-1998). In addition, no scale efficiency in the Canadian L&H insurance industry is found in this study. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
