In researches of bioinformatics, EST alignment can assist in studies of SNP, RNA editing, alternative splicing, etc. Different spliced alignment tools lead to different alignment results, therefore, the results of a single alignment tool seem to be arbitrary. Objective results can be obtained by analyzing the results of at least two alignment tools. However, if additional tools are adopted, increased computing time and storage capacities are required. This work deploys two different spliced alignment tools for sequencing, based on a grid computing environment, as constructed by globus, in order to solve the issues of numerous sequencing alignments and data storage. A grid environment can provide different service flows, recordings, and work monitoring states for two different splicing tools as a base of reference for node efficiency through load balance.", "paper_title": "The Deployment and Implementation of Two Spliced Alignment Tools in a Grid Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000325239100007"}
