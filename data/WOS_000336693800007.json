Comparing with the existing neural networks for solving such problems, the proposed neural network has fewer neurons and an one-layer architecture. The proposed neural network is proven to be global convergence. Furthermore, illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed neural network. (C) 2014 IMACS.
