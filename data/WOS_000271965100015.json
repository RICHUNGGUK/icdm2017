The FSMC employed the error of the sprung mass position and the error change to establish a sliding surface, and then introduced the sliding surface and the change of the sliding surface as input variables of a traditional fuzzy controller (TFC) in controlling the suspension system. However, no substantial improvement in the ride comfort could be obtained with the FSMC relative to the TFC because the dynamic effect of the sprung mass acceleration from the bouncing tire during tire rotation was not eliminated. We have developed an enhanced fuzzy sliding mode controller (EFSMC) that maintained not only the original FSMC property but also introduced an assisted FSMC to address and compensate for this problem, and to enhance the road-holding capability of the vehicle. The assisted FSMC differs from the original FSMC only in using the sprung mass acceleration instead of the sprung mass position as a variable of the controller design. The EFSMC exhibits better control performance than either the TFC or the FSMC, in suppressing the acceleration of the vehicle body to improve the ride quality, and in reducing the tire deflection to increase the road-holding ability of a car, as confirmed by experimental results.
