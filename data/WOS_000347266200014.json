Thereafter, backordering cost was also considered as an independent fuzzy variable. Fuzzy expected value model and fuzzy dependent chance programming model were constructed to find the optimal economic order quantity, which would minimize the fuzzy expected value of the total cost, so that the credibility of the total cost not exceeding a certain budget level was maximized. Optimization was carried out using genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization algorithm, and their performances were compared. The developed model was found to be efficient not only in one artificial case study but also in two data sets collected from the industries. Therefore, this model could solve real-world problems, too. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
