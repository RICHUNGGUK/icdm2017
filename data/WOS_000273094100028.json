In this perspective, we address the problem of merging probabilistic Gaussian mixture models in an efficient way, through the search for a suitable combination of components from mixtures to be merged. We propose a new Bayesian modelling of this combination problem, in association to a variational estimation technique, that handles efficiently the model complexity issue. A main feature of the present scheme is that it merely resorts to the parameters of the original mixture, ensuring low computational cost and possibly communication. should we operate on a distributed system. Experimental results are reported on real data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
