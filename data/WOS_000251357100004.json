However, existing multimodal biometric methods neglect interactions of different modalities during the subspace selection procedure, i.e., the underlying assumption is the independence of different modalities. In this paper, by breaking this assumption, we propose a Geometry Preserving Projections (GPP) approach for subspace selection, which is capable of discriminating different classes and preserving the intra-modal geometry of samples within an identical class. With GPP, we can project all raw biometric data from different identities and modalities onto a unified subspace, on which classification can be performed. Furthermore, the training stage is carried out once and we have a unified transformation matrix to project different modalities. Unlike existing multimodal biometric systems, the new system works well when some modalities are not available. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GPP for individual recognition tasks. (C) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
