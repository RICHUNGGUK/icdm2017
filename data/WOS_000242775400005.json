Attention is focused on the design of a stable filter guaranteeing a prescribed noise attenuation level in the H infinity sense. By using basis-dependent Lyapunov functions, sufficient conditions for the solvability of this problem are obtained. It has been shown that the H infinity filtering problem can be solved as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
