In this code, we distributed the grid between processors along radial direction, and Poisson equation is solved accordingly paralleled. We applied a couple of numerical accelerating technologies: paralleled fast Poisson solver, assembler pushing code, particle sorting and so on. Theoretical analysis and numerical benchmark showed that this parallel framework had good efficiency and scalability. The framework of the code and the optimization technologies and algorithms are discussed, benchmarks and simulation results are also shown. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
