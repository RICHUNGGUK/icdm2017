Accordingly, this paper pursues the throughput maximisation under all-to-one communication scene through cooperative communication and bandwidth allocation. As relay assignment plays an important role for cooperative communication, we first define the joint relay assignment and bandwidth allocation (JRB) problem, which is formulated into the integer program. As NP-Hardness, this paper then presents a distributed algorithm TRBA to solve the JRB problem. The analyses show that the proposed algorithm can reach the approximate performance of O(1) for the JRB problem. Moreover, another algorithm, called ITRBA, is proposed to improve the average throughput of all mesh nodes while still preserving the max-min fairness. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can almost reach the same throughput as the optimal method, and improves the network throughputs about 20.0% more than that of the traditional method.", "paper_title": "Joint relay assignment and bandwidth allocation for all-to-one communication in cooperative networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364789600005"}
