Using stability as the throughput performance metric, we outline the single-hop and multi-hop stability regions of the network. Our analysis of the stability regions is. a generalization of the BvN decomposition technique that has been so effective at expressing any stabilizable rate matrix for input-queued switches as a convex combination of service configurations. We consider generalized decompositions for physical topologies with wavelength and port constraints. For the case of a single wavelength per optical fiber, we link the decomposition problem to a corresponding Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem. We characterize the stability region of the reconfigurable network, employing both single-hop and multi-hop routing, in terms of the RWA problem applied to the same physical topology. We derive expressions for two geometric properties of the stability region: maximum stabilizable uniform arrival rate and maximum scaled doubly substochastic region. These geometric properties provide a measure of the performance,gap between a network having a single wavelength per optical fiber and its wavelength-unconstrained version. They also provide a measure of the performance gap between algorithms employing single-hop versus multi-hop electronic routing in coordination with WDM reconfiguration.", "paper_title": "Achieving 100% throughput in reconfigurable optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258775100018"}
