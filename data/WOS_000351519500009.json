Despite ease of deployment, tremendous applications and significant advantages, security has always been a challenging issue due to the nature of environments in which nodes operate. Nodes' physical capture, malicious or selfish behavior cannot be detected by traditional security schemes. Trust and reputation based approaches have gained global recognition in providing additional means of security for decision making in sensor and ad-hoc networks. This paper provides an extensive literature review of trust and reputation based models both in sensor and ad-hoc networks. Based on the mechanism of trust establishment, we categorize the state-of-the-art into two groups namely node-centric trust models and system-centric trust models. Based on trust evidence, initialization, computation, propagation and weight assignments, we evaluate the efficacy of the existing schemes. Finally, we conclude our discussion with identification of some unresolved issues in pursuit of trust and reputation management.", "paper_title": "A survey on trust based detection and isolation of malicious nodes in ad-hoc and sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351519500009"}
