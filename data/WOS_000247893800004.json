Building on the irradiance caching and radiance caching algorithms, our method leverages temporal coherence by sparse temporal sampling and interpolation of the indirect lighting. In our approach, part of the global illumination solution computed in previous frames is reused in the current frame. Our reusing scheme adapts to the change of incoming radiance by updating the indirect lighting only where there is a significant change. By reusing data in several frames, our method removes the flickering artifacts and yields a significant speedup compared to classical computation in which a new cache is computed for every frame. We also define temporal gradients for smooth temporal interpolation. A key aspect of our method is the absence of any additional complex data structure, making the implementation into any existing renderer based on irradiance and radiance caching straightforward. We describe the implementation of our method using graphics hardware for improved performance.", "paper_title": "Temporal radiance caching", "paper_id": "WOS:000247893800004"}
