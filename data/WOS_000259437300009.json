Data sources are either static or active: static data sources can be structured or semi-structured, whereas active sources are services. In order to develop data sources fusion systems in dynamic contexts, we need to study all issues raised by the matching paradigms. This challenging problem becomes crucial with the dominating role of the internet. Classical approaches of data integration, based oil schemas mediation, are not suitable to the World Wide Web (WWW) environment where data is frequently modified or deleted. Therefore, we develop a loosely integrated approach that takes into consideration both conflict management and semantic rules which must be enriched in order to integrate new data sources. Moreover, we introduce an XML-based Multi-data source Fusion Language (MFL) that aims to define and retrieve conflicting data from multiple data sources. The system, which is developed according to this approach, is called MDSManager (Multi-Data Source Manager). The benefit of the proposed framework is shown through a real world application based oil web data sources fusion which is dedicated to online markets indices tracking. Finally, we give an evaluation of our MFL language. The results Show that Our language improves significantly the XQuery language especially considering its expressiveness power and its performances.
