It is known that when the number of agents is odd, quantizing the game produces no advantage to the players, but for an even number of agents new Nash equilibria appear that have no classical analogue and have improved payoffs. We study the effect on the Nash equilibrium payoff of various forms of decoherence. As the number of players increases the multipartite GHZ state becomes increasingly fragile, as indicated by the smaller error probability required to reduce the Nash equilibrium payoff to the classical level.", "paper_title": "Multiplayer quantum minority game with decoherence", "paper_id": "WOS:000243572200007"}
