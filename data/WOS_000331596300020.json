We propose an adaptive importance photon shooting technique to accelerate the convergence rate. We analyze the scene space and build cumulative distribution functions on the surfaces to adaptively shoot photons. The rendering space is partitioned by kd-tree structure. The photons tracing through the scene are stored in the kd-tree node. An error criterion is proposed to estimate the feature error of the local light field in each node. In order to adaptively shoot photons, a novel adaptive cumulative distribution function is built in each node based on their neighbors' error values. When a photon hits a surface in the scene, the reflection direction of this photon is adaptively chosen by our cumulative distribution function. Our technique can be used in both photon mapping and progressive photon mapping. The experiments show that our adaptive importance photon shooting technique gives better results than the previous methods in both visual quality and numerical error. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
