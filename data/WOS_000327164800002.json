Unfortunately, a lack of information about users within Smart Spaces limits their usefulness. We propose a novel solution that involves integrating Smart Spaces with social networks through the IP Multimedia Subsystem. to create truly context-aware and adaptive spaces. By utilizing the wealth of user information present within social networks, smarter and more adaptive spaces can be created. We therefore propose the design and implementation of \"SocioSpace\" a Smart Spaces framework that utilizes the social context. We design and implement all components of SocioSpace, including the central server, the location management system, social network interfacing components, service delivery server and user agents. We then run various scenarios to test the reliability of the system. The results show the effectiveness of our framework in successfully creating Smart Spaces that can truly utilize social networks to deliver adaptive services that enhance the users' experiences and make the environment more beneficial to them.
