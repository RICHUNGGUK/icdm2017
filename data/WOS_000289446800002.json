This approach, essentially non conservative, is shown to be close to an upwind method and is straightforward to implement with a negligible computational extra cost. The benefit offered by the resulting discrete operator is illustrated for the direct computation of sound in aeroacoustics and in the more general context of large-eddy simulation through connections with hyperviscosity and spectral vanishing viscosity.
