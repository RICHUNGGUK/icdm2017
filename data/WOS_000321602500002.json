The implementation is platform independent and can be used on AMD or NVIDIA GPUs, as well as on classical CPUs. On the AMD Radeon HD 5870 our double precision empty set implementation performs at 60 GFLOPS over a wide range of lattice sizes. The hybrid Monte Carlo presented reaches a speedup of four over the reference code running on a server CPU. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
