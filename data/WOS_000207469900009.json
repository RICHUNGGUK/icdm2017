The flexible, adaptive environment facilitates the access and flow of atmospheric data from provider to users by enabling the creation of user-driven data processing value chains. The approach of DataFed is mediation between users and data providers. DataFed non-intrusively wraps datasets for access by standards-based web services. The mediator software, composed of web services, provides homogeneous data views (e.g., geospatial, time views) using a global multi-dimensional data model. Application software written using web services are data browsers, including Google Earth, and analysis tools for distributed AQ data. Its federated data pool consists of over 100 datasets and the tools have been applied in several air pollution projects. From the point of view of GEOSS, DataFed contributes air quality data (as services) to the shared data pool through the GEOSS Common Infrastructure. It also hosts a Decision Support System (DSS) in the societal benefit area of air quality. The developers of DataFed actively participate in the GEOSS process included work with Architecture and Data Committee (ADC) and the User Interface Committee (UIC) as well as in interoperability experiments.", "paper_title": "DataFed: An Architecture for Federating Atmospheric Data for GEOSS", "paper_id": "WOS:000207469900009"}
