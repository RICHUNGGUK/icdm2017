In order to automate the alignment task, it is important to model the semantics of educational standards statements that are imperative mood sentences. In this paper, we present the MP (Materialization Pattern) model for representing the semantics of math educational standards for the purpose of aligning math educational standards. This article first classifies math educational standards statements into 16 types and then converts them to the MP model. The MP model is based on the Reed-Kellogg sentence diagrams, and created as MP diagrams using the UML notation. The MP model explicitly represents the semantics of the sentences by capturing math concepts and the cognitive process of the math concepts from math educational standards statements. The MP model is developed for automating the alignment of math educational standards.", "paper_title": "Developing and Analyzing the MP (Materialization Pattern) Model for Math Educational Standards", "paper_id": "WOS:000289719600007"}
