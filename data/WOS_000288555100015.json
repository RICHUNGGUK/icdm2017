In this paper we propose a distributed call admission control protocol (DCAC) to do both bandwidth and delay guaranteed call admission for multihop wireless mesh backbone networks, by exploiting the multi-channel multi-radio (mc-mr) feature. We propose a novel routing metric for route setup, and present an efficient distributed algorithm for link reservation that satisfies the required bandwidth and reduces the delay by a local scheduling that minimizes one hop delay. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed protocol that embeds mc-mr feature in Time Division Medium Access (TDMA) to do QoS call admission in wireless backbone networks. Extensive simulation studies show that our protocol significantly improves network performance on supporting QoS sessions compared with some widely used protocols.", "paper_title": "Flow admission control for multi-channel multi-radio wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000288555100015"}
