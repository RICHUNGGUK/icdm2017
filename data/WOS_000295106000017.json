It has recently been shown that from the optimization point of view ELM and support vector machine (SVM) are equivalent but ELM has less stringent optimization constraints. Due to the mild optimization constraints ELM can be easy of implementation and usually obtains better generalization performance. In this paper we study the performance of the one-against-all (OAA) and one-against-one (OAO) ELM for classification in multi-label face recognition applications. The performance is verified through four benchmarking face image data sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
