First, the kinematic parameters of the AACMM are identified using a passive self-centering probe and a multipose optimization algorithm based in point and length constrains. Then, by means of a single calibration gauge object, a one-step calibration method to obtain both intrinsic - laser plane, CCD sensor and camera geometry - and extrinsic parameters related to AACMM main frame has been developed, allowing the integration of LTS and AACMM mathematical models without the need of additional optimization methods after the previous sensor calibration, usually done in a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) before the assembly of the sensor in the arm. Experimental tests for accuracy and repeatability show the suitable performance of this method. The technique presented is easily generalizable for LTSs integration in robot arms and CMMs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
