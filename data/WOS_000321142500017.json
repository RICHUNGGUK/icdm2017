Recent studies reported that retroflexion during colonoscopy helped to detect more polyps. Retroflexion is an endoscope maneuver that enables visualization of internal mucosa along the shaft of the endoscope, enabling visualization of the mucosa area that is difficult to see with typical forward viewing. This paper describes our new method that detects retroflexion during colonoscopy. We propose region shape and location (RSL) features and edgeless edge cross-section profile (ECSP) features that encapsulate important properties of endoscope appearance and edge information during retroflexion. Our experimental results on 50 colonoscopy test videos show that a simple ensemble classifier using both ECSP and RSL features can effectively identify retroflexion in terms of analysis time and detection rate.", "paper_title": "Near Real-Time Retroflexion Detection in Colonoscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000321142500017"}
