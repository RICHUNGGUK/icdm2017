The effectiveness of the proposed approach consists in converting the integral constitutive equations for creep in the upper-structure and consolidation of a fully saturated subsoil layer into a set of the first order differential equations. Subsequently, the algebraic incremental solution is obtained by applying Dirichlet-Prony's series for both the compliance function and degree of consolidation. The incremental method also comprises the building progress by taking into account the increments of individual segments consecutively added. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
