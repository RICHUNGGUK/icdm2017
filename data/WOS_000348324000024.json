The literature output on information literacy was examined using the techniques of bibliometric analysis and information visualization. The literature considered was that constituted by the articles included in the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), Scopus (Elsevier), Library and Information Science Abstracts, and Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts databases. The occurrence of descriptors was analysed using VOSViewer, a program that groups them into clusters and generates a map of their connections. The results showed exponential growth of some 30 % annually between 2005 and 2011, with a mean of 14.45 documents per year. Spain, with 119 documents, was the top producing country, followed by Brazil with 76. The distribution of the more than 500 authors fitted a Lotka-law pattern, and the distribution of the 105 journals fitted the three zones of a Bradford-law pattern. The visualization map showed the 62 descriptors to group into seven clusters. For its centrality, there stood out \"Information literacy\", strongly related with \"Information Science\". At the edge of the map were \"Digital literacy\" and \"School library\", indicative of their lack of any strong relationship with other terms. The \"Education\", \"Knowledge management\", \"Universities & colleges\", and \"University libraries\" descriptors were linked closely with the main IL theme.", "paper_title": "The scientific production of Ibero-American authors on information literacy (1985-2013)", "paper_id": "WOS:000348324000024"}
