In this paper, we make an attempt to address these two challenging issues for future depth cameras. Relying on a programmable projector, we establish a structured light system for depth sensing with focus and exposure adaptation. The basic idea is to change current illumination pattern and intensity locally according to the prior depth information. Consequently, multiple object surfaces appearing at different depths in the scene can receive proper illumination respectively. In this way, more flexible and robust depth sensing can be achieved in comparison with fixed illumination, especially at near depth. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
