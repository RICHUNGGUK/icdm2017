The proposed approach has been validated by carrying out simulation studies on two typical power system models using EMTP and MATLAB for different types of fault considering wide variations in fault location, fault inception angle, fault point resistance and load impedance.", "paper_title": "ANN based fault classifier with wavelet MRA generated inputs", "paper_id": "WOS:000262247700004"}
