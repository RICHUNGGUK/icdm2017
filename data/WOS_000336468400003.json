Such optimization techniques are core to many robotics problems, but traditional approaches are inherently impractical due to their computational complexity. This limitation usually results in a configuration space being subsampled, lower configuration space coverage, less frequent planner updates, or the use of sub-optimal graph-based road map methods. The proposed approach provides mathematically identical results to traditional grid-based motion planning solvers in at least an order of magnitude less time by leveraging the concurrent architecture found in modern graphics hardware. Although results given here are presented in a robot navigation context, they are also applicable to other dynamic programming problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
