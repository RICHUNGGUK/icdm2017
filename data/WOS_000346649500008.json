The results of careful analysis conducted of this mobile landscape indicate that there is a growing demand for smart, user-centric, situation-aware mobile software. Invariably, concomitant with this demand is the need for methodologies that can provide support the development of this type of software. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework, called the mobile situation-aware framework, which supports efficient modeling, construction, processing, management, and inference of mobile situation information. The framework comprises two phases, situation modeling and situation construction, and can serve as a guide and a template in the development of situation-aware applications for the mobile environment. A case study in which mobile situation-aware framework is utilized in the development of a semantic media player verifies the efficacy of the proposed framework.
