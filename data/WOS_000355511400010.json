For the semisupervised tensor classification, the existing transductive support tensor machine (TSTM) needs to resort to iterative technique, which is very time-consuming. In order to overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we extend the concave-convex procedure-based transductive support vector machine (CCCP-TSVM) to the tensor patterns and propose a low-rank approximation-based TSTM, in which the tensor rank-one decomposition is used to compute the inner product of the tensors. Theoretically, concave-convex procedure-based TSTM (CCCP-TSTM) is an extension of the linear CCCP-TSVM to tensor patterns. When the input patterns are vectors, CCCP-TSTM degenerates into the linear CCCP-TSVM. A set of experiments is conducted on 23 semisupervised classification tasks, which are generated from seven second-order face data sets, three third-order gait data sets, and two third-order image data sets, to illustrate the performance of the CCCP-TSTM. The results show that compared with CCCP-TSVM and TSTM, CCCP-TSTM provides significant performance gain in terms of test accuracy and training speed.", "paper_title": "A Low-Rank Approximation-Based Transductive Support Tensor Machine for Semisupervised Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000355511400010"}
