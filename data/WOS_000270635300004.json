Structural analysis is applied on the nonlinear model of the vehicle for building the residual generation module, followed by an ad-hoc residual evaluation module for detecting single and multiple sensor faults. The overall proposed diagnosis scheme has been tested in real-time on a real mobile robot in an outdoors environment and for different tasks. The obtained experimental results are satisfactory in terms of diagnosis performance and real-time implementation.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Model-Based Fault Detection and Isolation for UGVs", "paper_id": "WOS:000270635300004"}
