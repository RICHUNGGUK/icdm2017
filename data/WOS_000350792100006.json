This laparoscopic system is capable of outputting dual high-definition videos and providing vivid 3D images. A modified pinhole camera model is used for camera calibration and a new method of depth measurement to improve precision. The average error of depth measurement measured by experiment (about 1.13 mm) was small in proportion to the large range in distance of the system (10-150 mm). The new method is applicable to any calibrated binocular vision system.", "paper_title": "Design and calibration of a new high-definition three-dimensional laparoscopic system", "paper_id": "WOS:000350792100006"}
