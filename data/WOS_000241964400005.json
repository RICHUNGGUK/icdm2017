Accountability and acknowledgment can be achieved by the systematic maintenance of an irrefutable audit trail to render the interaction non-repudiable. To safeguard the interests of each party, the mechanisms used to meet this requirement should ensure fairness. That is, misbehavior should not disadvantage well-behaved parties. Despite the fact that Web services are increasingly used to enable B2B interactions, there is currently no systematic support to deliver such guarantees. This paper introduces a flexible framework to support fair non-repudiable B2B interactions based on a trusted delivery agent. A Web services implementation is presented. The role of the delivery agent can be adapted to different end user capabilities and to meet different application requirements.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of Web services middleware to support fair non-repudiable interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241964400005"}
