Intensity-based and segmentation-based registrations (SegRegs) of 2D sections and 3D mu CT datasets were applied. As the 2D sections were deformed during their preparation, affine registration for the vertebrae was used instead of rigid registration. Tibiae sections were additionally cut on the distal end, which subsequently undergone more deformation so that elastic registration was necessary. The Jaccard distance was used as registration quality measure. The quality of intensity-based registrations and SegRegs was practically equal, although precision errors of the elastic registration of segmentation masks in tibiae were lower, while those in vertebrae were lower for the intensity-based registration. Results of SegReg significantly depended on the segmentation of the mu CT datasets. Accuracy errors were reduced from approximately 64% to 42% when applying affine instead of rigid transformations for the vertebrae and from about 43% to 24% when using B-spline instead of rigid transformations for the tibiae. Accuracy errors can also be caused by the difference in spatial resolution between the thin sections (pixel size: 7.25 mu m) and the mu CT data (voxel size: 15 mu m). In the vertebrae, average deformations amounted to a 6.7% shortening along the direction of sectioning and a 4% extension along the perpendicular direction corresponding to 0.13-0.17mm. Maximum offsets in the mouse tibiae were 0.16mm on average.", "paper_title": "Registration of 2D histological sections with 3D micro-CT datasets from small animal vertebrae and tibiae", "paper_id": "WOS:000349442300005"}
