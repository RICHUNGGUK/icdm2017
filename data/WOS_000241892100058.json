And the objective functions and constraints are handled to adapt the model into the double-objective multi-constraint programming model suitable for genetic algorithm-based solution. Then encoding and decoding approaches are designed. Finally a case study is carried out to validate the proposed model and the CA-based solution.", "paper_title": "A genetic algorithm-based double-objective multi-constraint optimal cross-region cross-sector public investment model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100058"}
