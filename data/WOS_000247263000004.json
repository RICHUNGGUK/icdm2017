The MPEG-4 decoder is based on MoMuSys optimized reference software combined with new hardware VLSI architectures. New architectures for input demultiplexing, variable length decoding and inverse discrete cosine transform are developed. All software and hardware structures are evaluated in terms of visual quality, computational complexity and memory bandwidth metrics. The presented implementation is compared with an optimized reference software-based solution. Simulation results demonstrate a reduction of decoder complexity, especially speed and memory bandwidth, while maintaining an acceptable quality of decoded sequences. The proposed hardware additions provide 30% speed improvement over software solution, thereby reducing the clock rate required to process full-rate video from 300 MHz down to 213 MHz. The MPEG-4 decoder was functionally tested on a Flextronics FPGA prototyping board. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
