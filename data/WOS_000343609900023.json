In this paper, we design a retrieval system based on full texts in the PubMed Central database. We constructed two modules in the retrieval system. One is a reference retrieval module based on citation contexts. Another is a citation context retrieval module for searching the citation contexts of a specific paper. The results of comparisons show that the reference retrieval module performed better than Google Scholar and PubMed database in terms of finding proper references based on topic words extracted from citation context. It also performed very well on searching highly cited papers and classic papers. The citation context retrieval module visualizes the topics of citation contexts as tag clouds and classifies citation contexts based on cue words in citation contexts.", "paper_title": "Literature retrieval based on citation context", "paper_id": "WOS:000343609900023"}
