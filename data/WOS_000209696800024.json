The optimal policy is proved to have a piecewise linear structure that alternates flat and constant-slope pieces, resembling a staircase with tilted rises and as many steps (thresholds) as the breakpoints of the cost function. This particular structure makes it possible to express the policy in a very compact manner, particularly suitable to be stored in low-end devices. More importantly, the threshold-based form of the optimal policy can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of the iterative dynamic programming (DP) algorithm used to solve the problem. These results apply to a rather wide set of optimization problems, typically involving the management of a resource buffer such as the energy stored in a battery, or the packets queued in a wireless node.", "paper_title": "Markov Decision Processes with Threshold Based Piecewise Linear Optimal Policies", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696800024"}
