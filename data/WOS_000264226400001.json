RAVE is a distributed, collaborative Grid-enabled visualization environment that supports automated resource discovery across heterogeneous machines. RAVE runs as a background process using Web services, enabling us to share resources with other users rather than commandeering an entire machine. RAVE supports a wide range of machines, from hand-held PDAs to high-end servers with large-scale stereoscopic, tracked displays. The local display device may render all, some or none of the data set remotely, depending on Its capability and present loading, utilizing remote servers to assist where necessary. This enables scientists and engineers to collaborate from their desks, in the field, or in front of specialized immersive displays.
