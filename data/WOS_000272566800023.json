The task of sentiment classification is to construct an effective classifier with the knowledge data of vocabularies' semantic meaning and the relationships between the vocabularies to determine the sentiment orientation of a document. In. this paper, one method combining HowNet knowledge base with a robust supervised sentiment classifier is proposed. It computes semantic similarity of characteristic words and phrases by using HowNet. Sentiment features of text are divided into characteristic words and phrases, and they adopt the positive and negative terms as features of sentiment classifier. Finally in the experiment, evaluation results show the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "LEARNING TO CLASSIFY SEMANTIC ORIENTATION ON ON-LINE DOCUMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800023"}
