A single bubble growth on and departure from horizontal heated wall is investigated. The simulation results demonstrate the bubble departure diameter is proportional to g(-0346) in three-dimensional condition, where g is the gravitational acceleration. Linear relationship is found between the bubble departure diameter and Jacob number. The velocity field and temperature field are presented and the simulation results support the transient micro-convection model. In addition, the three-dimensional model is also employed to simulate the process of two bubbles growth, coalescence and departure from a horizontal heated wall. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
