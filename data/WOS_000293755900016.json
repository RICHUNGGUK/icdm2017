Electromagnetic interference from power/signal lines and to SRAM circuits was simulated and measured. In order to verify the interference, test chips were designed and fabricated using 65-nm CMOS technology. The measurement results revealed that: 1) interference from power lines depends on the shape of the power lines; 2) interference from signal lines can be canceled by increasing transmitter power by only 9%; and 3) interference with SRAM circuits is less important than other issues under ordinary conditions. Based on the measurement results, interference mitigation techniques are proposed and investigated.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Techniques for Mitigating Interference From Power/Signal Lines and to SRAM Circuits in CMOS Inductive-Coupling Link for Low-Power 3-D System Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000293755900016"}
