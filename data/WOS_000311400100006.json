In particular, the microsolvation of organic osmolyte and widely important osmoprotectant in nature as glycine betaine has been reported by using M06 method. A number of configurations (b(X) (a-z)) of the clusters for one to seven water molecules (x = 1-7) have been considered for the microsolvation. Structures of stable conformers are obtained and denoted as b1a, b2a, b3a, b4a, b5a, b6a and b7a. It is observed from the interaction energy difference (a dagger E) that only seven water molecules can be accommodated in the first solvation shell to stabilize GB. It is also observed that the calculated relative energy using M06 is in close agreement with calculations at the MP2 level of theory.", "paper_title": "Computational investigation on microsolvation of the osmolyte glycine betaine [GB (H2O)(1-7)]", "paper_id": "WOS:000311400100006"}
