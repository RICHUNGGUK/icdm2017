The TSA results in a scalar function, denominated topological derivative, that gives for each point of the domain the sensitivity of a given cost function when a small hole is created. An approximated expression for the topological derivative is obtained by numerical asymptotic analysis. Numerical results of the presented approach are considered for elastic plane problems.", "paper_title": "Topological sensitivity analysis in large deformation problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000260967300004"}
