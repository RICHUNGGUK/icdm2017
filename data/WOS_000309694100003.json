Nevertheless, ultrasound attenuation and shadowing artifacts cannot be entirely avoided and continue to challenge medical image computing algorithms. We introduce a method for estimating a per-pixel confidence in the information depicted by ultrasound images, referred to as an ultrasound confidence map, which emphasizes uncertainty in attenuated and/or shadow regions. Our main novelty is the modeling of the confidence estimation problem within a random walks framework by taking into account ultrasound specific constraints. The solution to the random walks equilibrium problem is global and takes the entire image content into account. As a result, our method is applicable to a variety of ultrasound image acquisition setups. We demonstrate the applicability of our confidence maps for ultrasound shadow detection, 3D freehand ultrasound reconstruction, and multi-modal image registration. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
