Multi-task inspection in high-speed AOI systems is becoming a significant problem in the design. In this paper, the design of an AOI system for E-shaped magnetic core elements is briefly described and several novel algorithms are proposed to realize defects detection by this system. First, this paper proposes a robust k-tSL-center clustering method to classify the interfaces of the element into normal and damaged areas. Second, a modified Active Shape Model (ASM) method is adopted to perform shape distortion detection in real-time. Performance evaluations are carried out on an E-shaped Magnetic Core Image Database, in which all images are captured by the designed AOI system. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are more efficient, robust and accurate than state-of-the-art methods in this application.", "paper_title": "Automated Inspection of E-Shaped Magnetic Core Elements Using K-tSL-Center Clustering and Active Shape Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900059"}
