A drawback of the split-screen imaging technique is that it generally requires a longer optical path than the ordinary multi-camera technique that allots each view axis to each of two (or more) synchronized cameras. This study presents an optical arrangement that minimizes the optical path for the two-directional split-screen imaging so as to allow the use of a camera lens with a short working distance. Its modification configured for the three-directional split-screen imaging of translating bubbles or drops is also presented.", "paper_title": "Multi-angle observation scheme for bubbles and droplets", "paper_id": "WOS:000302382400005"}
