Specifically, we investigate how the expected values of ( 1) backbone size, ( 2) distance between near-optimal schedules, and ( 3) makespan of random schedules vary as a function of the job to machine ratio (N/M). For the limiting cases N/M --> 0 and N/M --> infinity we provide analytical results, while for intermediate values of N/M we perform experiments. We prove that as N/M --> 0, backbone size approaches 100%, while as N/M --> infinity M the backbone vanishes. In the process we show that as N/M --> 0 (resp. N/M --> infinity), simple priority rules almost surely generate an optimal schedule, providing theoretical evidence of an \"easy-hard-easy\" pattern of typical-case instance difficulty in job shop scheduling. We also draw connections between our theoretical results and the \"big valley\" picture of JSP landscapes.", "paper_title": "How the landscape of random job shop scheduling instances depends on the ratio of jobs to machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000239437200001"}
