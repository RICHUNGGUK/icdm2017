Different from conventional data caching schemes that only cache a portion of dataset, CS caching maintains a global view of the whole dataset. Different portions of this view are cached in varied granularity based on the probabilities of being accessed in the future queries. The data objects with very high access probabilities are cached in the finest granularity, i.e., the data objects themselves. The data objects which are less likely to be accessed in the near future are abstracted and logically cached in the form of complementary regions (CRs) in a coarse granularity. CS caching naturally supports all types of location-based queries. In this paper, we explore several design and system issues of CS caching, including cache memory allocation between objects and CRs, and CR coalescence. We develop algorithms for location-based queries and a cache replacement mechanism. Through an extensive performance evaluation, we show that CS caching is superior to existing caching schemes for location-based services.", "paper_title": "Caching complementary space for location-based services", "paper_id": "WOS:000237081600059"}
