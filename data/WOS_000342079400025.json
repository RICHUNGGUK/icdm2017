Memristor-based DSP applications are mainly focusing on improving the performance of memories and in realizing synapses in neural networks. In most of the reported applications the verification of the proposed DSP circuits is made using mathematical-based memristor models. In this paper a new circuit for practical emulation of the memristor and its applications in memristor-based digital modulation is experimentally investigated.", "paper_title": "A new memristor emulator and its application in digital modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342079400025"}
