Would it in fact do so, and could it feasibly be integrated into a microprocessor so that the intended benefits might be realized? Here, we describe the European Logarithmic Microprocessor, a device designed around that unit, and compare its performance with that of a commercial superscalar pipelined floating-point processor. We conclude that the experiment has been successful, and that for 32-bit work, logarithmic arithmetic may now be the technique of choice.", "paper_title": "The European Logarithmic Microprocessor", "paper_id": "WOS:000254044800009"}
