However, palindromic representation is inapplicable for a GNB multiplier with odd type t (t >= 2). This study therefore develops a palindromic-like representation for a GNB multiplier with odd type t. The proposed systolic GNB multiplier with odd type t reduces space and time complexities by as much as 50% compared with conventional GNB multiplier with odd type t without palindromic representation.", "paper_title": "Palindromic-like representation for Gaussian normal basis multiplier over GF(2(m)) with odd type t", "paper_id": "WOS:000312962100010"}
