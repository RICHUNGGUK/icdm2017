These hybrid CFD/DSMC simulations can be performed in 5-25% of the CPU time required for a full DSMC simulation, with an accuracy better than 1-2%. A non-optimal choice of the interface location may increase the errors up to several tens of percents, when the interface is located too far downstream, or increase the CPU time by up to several tens of percents, when the interface is located too far upstream. The proper interface location does not generally coincide with the throat plane, but lies upstream or downstream from the throat, depending on the flow conditions. We provide a quantitative criterion, based on Knudsen numbers as estimated from full CFD simulations of the entire nozzle, to determine the proper interface location a priori. Due to frictional losses and rarefaction effects, the total thrust of micro-nozzles in the mu N range is found to be several tens of percents lower than the thrust predicted from one-dimensional isentropic theory.
