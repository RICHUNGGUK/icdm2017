Many nursing students report a lack of preparedness and competence with respect to their ability to perform nursing duties. Simulation-based learning has been developed as a potential solution to this problem. Moreover, the simulation scenario with an evaluation checklist offers a reliable evaluation strategy for the education and training of clinical decision-making skills among nursing students. The simulation scenario and evaluation checklist developed in this study offer a means to improve patient safety during asthma care in the emergency care unit, as well as to improve nursing students' problem-solving competencies and communication with patients with asthma.", "paper_title": "Development of a Simulation Scenario and Evaluation Checklist for Patients With Asthma in Emergency Care", "paper_id": "WOS:000369888400006"}
