Optimization Theory can provide the necessary tools to develop such mechanisms that will allocate network resources optimally and fairly among users. The aim of this paper is to provide a starting point for researchers interested in applying optimization techniques in the resource allocation problem for current communication networks. To achieve that we, first, describe the fundamental optimization theory tools necessary to design optimal resource allocation algorithms. Then, we describe the Network Utility Maximization (NUM) framework, a framework that has already found numerous applications in network optimization, along with some recent advancements of the initial NUM framework. Finally, we summarize some of our recent work in the area and discuss some of the remaining research challenges towards the development of a complete optimization-based resource allocation protocol.
