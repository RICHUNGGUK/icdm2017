First, we present a method for acquiring semantic-based reformulations automatically. The goal is to generate patterns from sentences retrieved from the Web based on syntactic and semantic constraints. Once these constraints have been defined, we present a method to evaluate and re-rank candidate answers that satisfy these constraints using redundancy. The two approaches have been evaluated independently and in combination. The evaluation on about 500 questions from TREC-11 shows that the acquired semantic patterns increase the precision by 16% and the MRR by 26%, the re-ranking using semantic redundancy as well as the combined approach increase the precision by about 30% and the MRR by 67%. This shows that no manual work is now necessary to build question reformulations; while still increasing performance.", "paper_title": "Using semantic constraints to improve question answering", "paper_id": "WOS:000238573100011"}
