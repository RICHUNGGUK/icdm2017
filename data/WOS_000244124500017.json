One of the most difficult steps in protein crystallography is model-building, which consists of constructing a backbone and then amino acid side chains into an electron density map. Interpretation of electron density maps represents a major bottleneck in protein structure determination pipelines, and thus, automated techniques to interpret maps can greatly improve the throughput. We have developed WebTex, a simple and yet powerful web interface to TEXTAL, a program that automates this process of fitting atoms into electron density maps. TEXTAL can also be downloaded for local installation.
