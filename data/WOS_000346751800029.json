This demand marks a shift from earlier emphasis in single-crop point simulations and poses a significant challenge as cropping systems models need to improve and increase their capabilities to address multiple scales in a cohesive scientific manner and using updated computing platforms. In this article we discuss how the cropping systems model CropSyst has evolved to meet these new demands and provide some concepts for the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
