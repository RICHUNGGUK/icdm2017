One approach to the construction of secret sharing schemes is based on coding theory. In principle, every linear code can be used to construct secret sharing schemes. But only well structured linear codes give secret sharing schemes with nice access structures in the sense that every pair of participants plays the same role in the secret sharing. In this paper, we construct a class of good linear codes, and use them to obtain a class of secret sharing schemes with nice access structures.", "paper_title": "Secret sharing schemes with nice access structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000240746400006"}
