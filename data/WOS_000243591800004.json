Firstly, we obtain the Bayes estimators of the reliability performances. Secondly, different from the predecessor, the empirical Bayes estimators of the reliability performances are derived where hyper-parameter is estimated using maximum likelihood method. In the end, in order to investigate the accuracy of estimations, an illustrative example is examined numerically by means of Monte-Carlo simulation. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
