To progress to the next level a more powerful approach is needed, which is capable of filtering noise effectively, designing (and defining) optimal probing strategies, and understanding fundamental limitations. We provide a probabilistic, queueing-theoretic treatment that contributes to this program in the single hop case. We provide an exact inversion method for cross traffic distributions, rigorous system identifiability results to help determine what active probing can and can't achieve, a new approach for treating queueing theoretic 'noise' based on conditioning, and cross traffic estimators with enhanced properties.", "paper_title": "Adding definition to active probing", "paper_id": "WOS:000245923800004"}
