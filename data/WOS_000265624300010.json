The edge-Wiener index is conceived in an analogous manner as the sum of distances between all pairs of edges of the underlying (connected) graph. Several possible distances between edges of a graph axe considered and; according to these, the corresponding edge-Wiener indices defined. Several of these edge-Wiener indices are mutually related, but two of them are independent novel structure descriptors. We report explicit combinatorial expressions of these two edge-Wiener indices of some familiar graphs.", "paper_title": "THE EDGE VERSIONS OF THE WIENER INDEX", "paper_id": "WOS:000265624300010"}
