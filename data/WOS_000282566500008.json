A multiphase system with the interstitial voids in the grain matrix filled with water (liquid phase), water vapour and dry air (gas phase) and with pollutant substances, is assumed. The mathematical model addressed in this work was developed in the framework of mixture theory considering the pollutant saturation suction coupling effects. The ensuing mathematical model involves equations of momentum balance, energy balance and mass balance of the whole multiphase system. Encouraging outcomes were achieved in several different examples. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
