As a generalization, we investigate the movement of one-stack FPDA and discuss the character of multistack FPDA in accepting languages. We get the concept that languages generated by fuzzy context-free K-grammars the languages accepted by one-sack or multistack FPDA are all in the family of FCFL, or say, are usually included in a family of languages generated by A(f)(K)-fuzzy context-free grammars.
