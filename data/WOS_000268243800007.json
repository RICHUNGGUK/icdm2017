This paper proposes a new approach, called CAUSE (Computer-Aided Ubiquitous System Engineering), for implementing ubiquitous manufacturing systems. This method has great potential compared with the conventional ones that rely on physical implementation and human experience through trial-and-error correction. Specifically, this paper develops a framework for the software supporting the ubiquitous system engineering based on requirement analysis, functional details, and implementation issues including enabling technology. The usefulness of the proposed method is shown by developing it prototype system For a ubiquitous manufacturing system with radio frequency identification (RFID).", "paper_title": "A conceptual framework for computer-aided ubiquitous system engineering: architecture and prototype", "paper_id": "WOS:000268243800007"}
