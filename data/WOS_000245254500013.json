In particular, we determine what conditions have to be imposed on omega for classical cycling to occur with theta = 2 pi/5, and what on theta with omega tan(theta). The first answer reveals that the sufficient condition widely spread over the literature is false, so fixing it turns this example into a correct example of classical cycling. Some progress towards necessary and sufficient conditions for cycling to occur in this example is also reported. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
