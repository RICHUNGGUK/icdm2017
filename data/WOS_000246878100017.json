We introduce new classes of fast lower bounds with improved asymptotic worst-case performance compared to well-known results for similar computational effort. Experimental results on a large set of problem instances indicate that the proposed bounds reduce both the deviation from the optimum and the computational effort. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
