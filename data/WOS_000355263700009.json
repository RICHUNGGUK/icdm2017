In this paper, we propose an algorithm for centerline extraction that is both highly accurate and computationally efficient. The main novelties of the proposed method are (1) the use of a small set of Multiscale Isotropic Laplacian filters, acting as self-steerable filters, for a quick and efficient binary segmentation of dendritic arbors and axons; (2) an automated centerline seed points detection method based on the application of a simple 3D finite-length filter. The performance of this algorithm, which is validated on data from the DIADEM set appears to be very competitive when compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Improved Automatic Centerline Tracing for Dendritic and Axonal Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000355263700009"}
