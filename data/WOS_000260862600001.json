In order to improve the watermark robustness against the generalized channel, we present an optimized watermark extraction scheme by using an adaptive receiver for quantization-based watermarking. In the proposed extraction scheme, we adaptively estimate the decision zone of the binary data bits and the quantization step size. A training sequence is embedded into the original image together with the informative watermark. The estimation of the decision zone takes advantage of the response function of the training sequence. Compared to those watermarking schemes without receiver adaptation, the main improvement is the enhanced robustness against median filtering, image intensity Direct Current (DC) change, histogram equalization, color reduction, image intensity linear scaling, image intensity nonlinear scaling such as Gamma correction etc.", "paper_title": "Improving Robustness of Quantization-Based Image Watermarking via Adaptive Receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000260862600001"}
