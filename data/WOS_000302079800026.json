First, we provide some constructions which significantly improve the general lower bounds on the minimum distance of a GAG code. GAG codes associated to specific maximal curves over finite fields are then investigated. As a result, 2895 improvements on MinT's tables are obtained. Finally, we construct asymptotically good GAG codes with better parameters with respect to those constructed by Spera in 2005. Maximal curves play a role in this context as well.", "paper_title": "Generalized Algebraic Geometric Codes From Maximal Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000302079800026"}
