The SVM approach has been implemented in the balance control of Gyrover, which is a dynamically stable, statically unstable, single-wheel mobile robot. The experimental results that compare SVM with general artificial neural network approaches clearly demonstrate the superiority of the SVM approach with regard to human control strategy learning.", "paper_title": "Support Vector Machine Based Approach for Abstracting Human Control Strategy in Controlling Dynamically Stable Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000265498700004"}
