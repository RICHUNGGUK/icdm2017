Our study is based on an enhanced test set of 778 drug molecules and pharmacologically relevant compounds extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We elaborated protocols for two common conformer generation use cases and applied them to both programs: (i) high-throughput settings for processing large databases and (ii) high-quality settings for binding site exploration or lead structure refinement. While Catalyst is faster in the first case, Omega 2.0 better reproduces the bound ligand conformations from the PDB in less time for the latter case.", "paper_title": "Comparative performance assessment of the conformational model generators omega and catalyst: A large-scale survey on the retrieval of protein-bound ligand conformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239204400032"}
