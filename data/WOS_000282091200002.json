Then, a modified version of the HiPeR latch (referred as HiPeR-CG) is proposed that is suitable to be used together with clock gating. Both proposed latches are faster than the latches most recently presented in the literature, while providing better or comparable robustness to transient faults, at comparable or lower costs in terms of area and power, respectively. Therefore, thanks to the good trade-offs in terms of performance, robustness, and cost, our proposed latches are particularly suitable to be adopted on critical paths.", "paper_title": "High-Performance Robust Latches", "paper_id": "WOS:000282091200002"}
