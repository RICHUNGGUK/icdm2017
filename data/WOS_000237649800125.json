The protocol preserves Monotonic Writes session guarantee required by clients, despite failures of servers. The costs of rollback-recovery are minimized, by exploiting semantics of operations and properties of MW guarantee. The proof of safety property of rVsMW is included.", "paper_title": "Safety of recovery protocol preserving MW session guarantee in mobile systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800125"}
