Although several papers have investigated the properties and usefulness of this data structure in the full-text indexing scenario, its impact on data compression has not been fully explored. In this paper we provide a throughout theoretical analysis of a wide class of compression algorithms based on Wavelet Trees. Also, we propose a novel framework, called Pruned Wavelet Trees, that aims for the best combination of Wavelet Trees of properly-designed shapes and compressors either binary (like, Run-Length Encoders) or non-binary (like, Huffman and Arithmetic encoders).
