When k = q, the order of these q-regular graphs is 2(q(2) - 1); and when k <= q-1, the order of these k-regular graphs is 2(qk - 2). Moreover, the incidence matrix of a k-regular balanced bipartite graph of girth 6 having 2(qk - 2) vertices, where k is an integer and q is a prime power with 3 <= k <= q - 1, is provided. These graphs improve upon the best known upper bounds for the number of vertices in regular graphs of girth 6. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
