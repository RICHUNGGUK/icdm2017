After characterizing the behavior of two-spin quantum correlations, we extend our analysis to global properties of the ring, using a figure of merit for quantum correlations that shows enough sensitivity to reveal the drastic changes in the properties of the system at criticality. This opens up the possibility to relate statistical properties of quantum many-body systems to suitably tailored measures of quantum correlations that capture features going far beyond standard quantum entanglement.", "paper_title": "GLOBAL QUANTUM CORRELATIONS IN THE ISING MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000297939700011"}
