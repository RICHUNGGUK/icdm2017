Multi-users signature schemes, like ring or group signatures, are also a useful tool to provide to such systems some properties like scalability, anonymity, (dynamic) group structure, revocation facilities... We propose in this article a simple blind ring signature scheme based on pairings on algebraic curves. We formally prove the security (anonymity, blindness and unforgeability) of our scheme in the random oracle model, under quite standard assumptions.", "paper_title": "Blind ring signatures secure under the chosen-target-CDH assumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000240592800009"}
