In particular, we restrict to codes with rate and we investigate the problem of minimal dimension for realizations of such codes by separable Roesser models. The encoders which allow to obtain such minimal realizations, called R-minimal encoders, are characterized.", "paper_title": "Realization of 2D convolutional codes of rate 1/n by separable Roesser models", "paper_id": "WOS:000329240200020"}
