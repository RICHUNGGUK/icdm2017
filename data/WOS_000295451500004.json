In addition, to determine decision tool effects on a composite outcome of colonoscopies canceled, rescheduled, aborted, or repeated sooner than recommended due to preparation (prep) quality; prep quality; colonoscopy duration; and patient satisfaction with and tolerance of the preparation. Methods: We used 4 alternating 4-week periods to compare the decision tool with usual care for outpatient colonoscopy. All decision tool decisions were reviewed in real-time by gastroenterology nurses and/or physicians. Patients completed a survey about the prep process. Endoscopists blindly rated prep quality. Colonoscopy duration and findings were recorded. Results: Of 354 persons in the decision tool group, 4 prep decisions were overridden because of patient preference or prior prep failure, but none for medical reasons. Sodium phosphate was used more frequently in the decision tool group (73% vs. 41%; P < 0.01). There was no difference between the decision tool and usual care groups in the composite outcome (26% vs. 30%, respectively; P = 0.29), acceptable prep quality (62% vs. 56%; P = 0.22), colonoscopy duration (28 vs. 30 min; P = 0.17), patient satisfaction (P = 0.38), or preparation tolerance (P = 0.37). Conclusions: An electronic medical record-based decision tool can safely and effectively tailor the prep for colonoscopy and may improve colonoscopy efficiency and patient satisfaction. Limitations: This study was performed at a single VA medical center and endoscopy unit, relies on the presence of relevant medical conditions and laboratory data in the electronic medical record, and had a higher than expected use of sodium phosphate during usual care.
