An algorithm for solving the multi-objective optimization problem is presented based on particle swarm optimization through the improvement of the selection manner for global and individual extremum. The search for the Pareto Optimal Set of fuzzy neural networks optimization problems is performed. Numerical simulations for taste identification of tea show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy neural network optimization by a particle swarm optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000110"}
