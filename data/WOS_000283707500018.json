The information transfer was monitored as a function of the forecasting time k Results: We found that during head-up tilt the information transfer at k = 0 decreased but the rate of rise of information transfer as a function of k was faster. Conclusions: We suggest that the characterization of the information transfer from systolic arterial pressure to heart period might complement the traditional characterization of the spontaneous baroreflex based on transfer function analysis.", "paper_title": "Information Transfer through the Spontaneous Baroreflex in Healthy Humans", "paper_id": "WOS:000283707500018"}
