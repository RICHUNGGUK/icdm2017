From this point of view, a noise-coupled time-based continuous-time sigma-delta modulator (TCSDM) based on the asynchronous pulse width modulator (APWM) and the time-to-digital converter (TDC) is presented. Noise-coupling is realized by extracting the time quantization error of the TDC and injecting its delayed version to the input of the APWM. By using a novel implementation of the noise-coupling technique in the proposed TCSDM, the modulator's noise-shaping order is improved by one. Unlike the conventional noise-coupled sigma-delta modulators, in the proposed structure, the need of an extra subtractor at the quantizer input is resolved through merging the excess loop delay compensation path with the proposed noise-coupling branch. Comparative analytical calculations and behavioral simulation results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed time-based modulator. To confirm the validity of the proposed structure, the effects of main circuit non-idealities in the modulator's performance are taken into consideration and the related simulation results are investigated. A digital-friendly implementation of the quantizer in the proposed modulator makes it suitable for low-voltage nanometer CMOS technologies.", "paper_title": "An NTF-enhanced time-based continuous-time sigma-delta modulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000361984600007"}
