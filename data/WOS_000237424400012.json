The models and methods developed have applications to person recognition and image indexing. An automatic hair detection algorithm is described and results reported. A multidimensional representation of hair appearance is presented and computational algorithms are described. Results on a data set of 524 subjects are reported. Identification of people using hair attributes is compared to eigenface-based recognition along with a joint, eigenface-hair-based identification.", "paper_title": "Detection and analysis of hair", "paper_id": "WOS:000237424400012"}
