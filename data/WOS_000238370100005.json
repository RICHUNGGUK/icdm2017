A network supporting multiple classes of service also requires a differentiated pricing structure. In this work, we propose a pricing algorithm in a DiffServ environment based on the cost of providing different levels of services, and on long-term average user resource demand of a service class. We integrate the proposed service-dependent pricing scheme with a dynamic pricing and service negotiation environment by considering a dynamic and congestion-sensitive pricing component. Pricing network services dynamically based on the level of service, usage, and congestion allows a more competitive price to be offered, allows the network to be used more efficiently, and provides a natural and equitable incentive for applications to adapt their service requests according to network conditions. We also develop the demand behavior of adaptive users based on a physically reasonable user utility function. Simulation results show that a congestion-sensitive pricing policy coupled With user rate adaptation is able to control congestion and allows a service class to meet its performance assurances under large or bursty offered loads, even without explicit admission control. Users are able to maintain a stable expenditure, and allowing users to migrate between service classes in response to price increases further stabilizes the individual service prices. When admission control is enforced, congestion-sensitive pricing still provides an advantage in terms of a much lower connection blocking rate at high loads.", "paper_title": "Pricing network resources for adaptive applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000238370100005"}
