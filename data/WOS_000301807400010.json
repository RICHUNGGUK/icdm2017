Employing the Entity-Relationship (ER) model to the structure design of the database provides considerable flexibility and extensibility while the open source MySQL server systematically compiles the historic data. DSLT enables quick browsing, inexpensive query, and utility of data as pile design tools or as relevant data for advanced research. Moreover, it can serve as a data platform for a centralized storage of information among interested pile data holders worldwide. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
