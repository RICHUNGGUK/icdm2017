To achieve this synchronization, there are different rendezvous schemes, among which the most energy-efficient is utilizing wake-up receivers. Current hardware technologies of wake-up receivers enable us to evaluate them as a promising solution for wireless sensor networks. In this article the benefits achieved with wake-up receivers are investigated along with the challenges observed. In addition, an overview of state-of-the-art hardware and networking protocol proposals is presented. As wake-up receivers offer new opportunities, new potential application areas are also presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "WAKE-UP RECEIVERS FOR WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS: BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000269217600015"}
