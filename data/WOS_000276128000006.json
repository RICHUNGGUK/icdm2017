Iterative decoding with hard interference cancellation is used at destination to recover user information. By using orthogonal transmission from sources to avoid their mutual interference, the multi-antenna relay offers receive space diversity that greatly enhances the decoding performance at the relay. This makes the source-relay transmission more robust, less sensitive to the source-relay link SNR, and hence increases the contribution of the relay in cooperative transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms direct transmission under the same transmit power and bandwidth efficiency.
