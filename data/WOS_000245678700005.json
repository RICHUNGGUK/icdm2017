In Part 1, we derived both microscopic and coarse-grained evolution equations for strings and schemata for a selecto-recombinative GA using generalised recombination, and we explained the hierarchical nature of the schema evolution equations. In this part, we provide a variety of fixed points for evolution in the case where recombination is used alone, thereby generalising Geiringer's theorem. In addition, we numerically integrate the infinite-population schema equations for some interesting problems, where selection and recombination are used together to illustrate how these operators interact. Finally, to assess by how much genetic drift can make a system deviate from the infinite-population-model predictions we discuss the results of real GA runs for the same model problems with generalised recombination, selection and finite populations of different sizes.", "paper_title": "Understanding the biases of generalised recombination: Part II", "paper_id": "WOS:000245678700005"}
