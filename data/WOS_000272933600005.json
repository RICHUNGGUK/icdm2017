Reliable traffic telematics applications and services require vehicle-to-vehicle wireless communications that can provide robust connectivity, typically at data rates between 1 and 10 Mb/s. The development of such VTV communications systems and standards require, in turn, accurate models for the VTV propagation channel. A key characteristic of VTV channels is their temporal variability and inherent non-stationarity, which has major impact on data packet transmission reliability and latency. This article provides an overview of existing VTV channel measurement campaigns in a variety of important environments, and the channel characteristics (such as delay spreads and Doppler spreads) therein. We also describe the most commonly used channel modeling approaches for VTV channels: statistical as well as geometry-based channel models have been developed based on measurements and intuitive insights.
