Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs additivity and variance stabilization analysis. Findings - The new product creativity is significantly related to knowledge management. Practical implications - The paper implies that if organizations fail to understand the subtle ways by which different dimensions of knowledge acquisition, dissemination, and innovation influence new product creativity, they may fail to harvest the full value of knowledge management in creativity improvement. Originality/value - It is one of the first to assess the link between knowledge management and new product creativity.", "paper_title": "Turning knowledge into new product creativity: an empirical study", "paper_id": "WOS:000272410700012"}
