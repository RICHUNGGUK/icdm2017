The main aim of the indicators used in a human machine system is to satisfy the interaction. This paper focuses on the design of indicator panel for passenger cars based on the axiomatic design principles. In this study, axiomatic design principles proposed by Suh are used under fuzzy environment. Both independence axiom and information axiom are utilized. The independence axiom is used for the following goals; (1) obtaining a design map, (2) determining design parameters and their importance, and (3) calculating the functional independency of the proposed design. In the scope of this paper, to calculate the functional independence, new formulas are presented under fuzzy environment differing from classical axiomatic design principles. Then, information axiom is used to determine the best design among the designs that satisfy independence axiom and put forward to suitable design characteristics. Furthermore the importances of functional requirements for the indicator panel design are determined by using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process in the presented study. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
