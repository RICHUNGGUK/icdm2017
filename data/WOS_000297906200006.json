TED describes texture and edge information simultaneously. TED is a local descriptor because it is defined over a neighborhood. The size of the TED, independent of the neighborhood size defined over it, is 8 bits. TED is based on intensity difference, and so it is robust against illumination changes. We demonstrate TED performance in a block-based framework for pedestrian detection. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed descriptor when applied in different outdoor and indoor environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
