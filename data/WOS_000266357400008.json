The hierarchical infrastructure logically divides the key management domain into several smaller administratively scoped areas with a key server associated with each area respectively. All the key servers located in every area participate in a Public Key infrastructure (PKI) as trusted entities known by the subgroup members. Therefore, it is efficient to minimise the re-keying overhead implemented in the mobile host tier and simplify the re-keying relationships between the distributed key servers.", "paper_title": "A novel dual-key management protocol based on a hierarchical multicast infrastructure in mobile internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000266357400008"}
