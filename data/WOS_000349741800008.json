Applications based on data-intensive services have become one of the most challenging applications in cloud computing. The service provision, and in particular service composition, will face new challenges as the services and data grow. In this paper, we will evaluate an ant colony system to resolve the multi-objective data-intensive service composition problem. The algorithm for a multi-objective context will get a set of Paretooptimal solutions considering two objectives at the same time: the total cost and the total execution time of a composite service.
