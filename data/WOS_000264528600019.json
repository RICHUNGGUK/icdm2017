Structure identification is realized by an on-line clustering method and fuzzy support vector machines, the fuzzy rules are generated automatically. Time-varying learning rates are applied for updating the membership functions of the fuzzy rules. The modeling errors are proven to be robustly stable with bounded uncertainties by a Lyapunov method and an input-to-state stability technique. Comparisons with other related works are made through an application of gas furnace process. The results demonstrate that our approach has good accuracy. and this method is suitable for online fuzzy modeling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
