We use an auto panel drawing die face design process as an example to illustrate the application and effectiveness of this proposed approach, and come to the conclusion that the proposed approach is more effective than the traditional manual FEA method and the 'trial-and-error' approach in optimizing an auto panel drawing die face design.
