Such models are said to embody design intent, in the sense that modifications to them conform to the method of creation used by their original creator. They also comply with any constraints implied by the particular constructional operations used. This paper introduces the development and standardization process of the ISO 10303-112 specification and describes the concept of procedural 2D modeling, a method of representing procedural 2D CAD models in STEP in harmony with other STEP resources. The feasibility of procedural 2D modeling commands for the exchange of procedurally represented 2D CAD model data is demonstrated through an experiment where procedural 2D CAD model data in neutral form generated with an in-house 2D modeling system are translated to and modified in a commercial 3D mechanical CAD system.
