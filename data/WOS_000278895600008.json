Structural equation modeling employs a sample of 310 companies from different industries from the USA, Europe, Canada, Brazil and China. The findings suggest the existence of a statistically significant relationship between analytical capabilities and performance. The moderation effect of information systems support is considerably stronger than the effect of business process orientation. The results provide a better understanding of the areas where the impact of business analytics may be the strongest. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
