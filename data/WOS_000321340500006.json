The lack of consistent data standards for current emergency management practice, however, hinders efficient critical information flow among incident responders. In this paper, we adopt a third-generation activity theory guided approach to develop a data model that can be used in the response to fire-related extreme events. This data model prescribes the core data standards to reduce information interoperability barriers. The model is validated through a three-step approach including a request for comment (RFC) process, case application, and prototype system test. This study contributes to the literature in the area of interoperability and data modeling; it also informs practice in emergency response system design.", "paper_title": "DATA MODEL DEVELOPMENT FOR FIRE RELATED EXTREME EVENTS: AN ACTIVITY THEORY APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000321340500006"}
