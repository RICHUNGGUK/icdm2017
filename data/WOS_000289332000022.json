GROWTH2.0 is an inversion tool which enables the user to obtain, in a nearly automatic and nonsubjective mode, a 3D model of the subsurface density anomalies based on observed gravity anomaly data. The package is composed of three parts: (a) GRID3D to generate a 3D partition of the subsurface volume into parallelepiped elements, (b) GROWTH to perform the inversion routine and to obtain a 3D anomalous density model, and (c) VIEW for visual representation of the input data, the inversion model, and modeling residuals. The current version of the tool has been developed from an earlier code (Camacho et al., 2002) and now incorporates several novelties: (1) a Graphical User Interface (GUI), (2) an optional automated routine for determination of parameter lambda, which controls the balance between model fitness and smoothness, (3) optional determination of values for minimum density contrast, (4) a robust handling of outlier data, and (5) improved automated data reduction for terrain effects based on anticorrelation with topographic data. The new capabilities and applicability of GROVVTH2.0 for 3-D gravity inversion are demonstrated by a case example using new gravity data from the volcanic island of Tenerife. In a nearly automatic approach, the software provides a 3-D model informing on the location and shape of the main structural building blocks of the island. Our model results allow us to shed light on the low-density structure of the islands dominant Pico Viejo-Pico Teide (PV-PT) volcanic complex and the identification of an intrusive structure (the east bulge volcano) embedded in Teide's east flank. A low-density body located at around 5.8 km depth beneath PT's summit may represent a current magma or hybrid reservoir. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
