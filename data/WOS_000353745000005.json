The dynamic model of three-axis GSP is developed based on traditional Newton-Euler method. The nonlinearity and coupling system is full-state-linearized using feedback linearization, and neural networks are used to compensate for the disturbances and uncertainties. The stability of the proposed scheme is analyzed by the Lyapunov criterion. Comparative simulations and experiments results show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach compared with the conventional control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
