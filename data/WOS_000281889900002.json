The perfect state transfer systems are then used as a constructive tool to design Hamiltonian implementations of other primitive protocols such as entanglement generation and signal amplification in measurements, before showing that, in fact, universal quantum computation can be implemented in this way.", "paper_title": "PERFECT, EFFICIENT, STATE TRANSFER AND ITS APPLICATION AS A CONSTRUCTIVE TOOL", "paper_id": "WOS:000281889900002"}
