In this paper, we present a new proof of these two results which is based on the Mittag-Leffler lemma for projective sequences of sets. We also show that if G is a non-periodic group and V is an infinite-dimensional vector space, then there exist a linear cellular automaton tau(1): V(G) -> V(G) which is bijective but not reversible and a linear cellular automaton tau(2): V(G) -> V(G) whose image is not closed in V(G) for the prodiscrete topology.
