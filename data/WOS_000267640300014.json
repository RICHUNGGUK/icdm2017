This scheme is based on the fact that two consecutive symbols convey the same information in the UWB-OFDM system, thus removing the need of pilot symbols. The performance of mean square error has been evaluated through simulation to verify the usefulness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Pilot-Less Sampling Frequency Synchronization Scheme for UWB-OFDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000267640300014"}
