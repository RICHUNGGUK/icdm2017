Topology control, which enables multi-hop communication between any two network nodes via a suitably constructed overlay network, is the primary target for increasing connectivity and saving energy here. In this paper, we present a fault-tolerant distributed topology control algorithm that constructs and continuously maintains a k-regular and k-node-connected overlay for energy-efficient multi-hop communication. As a by-product, it also builds a hierarchy of clusters that reflects the node density in the network, with guaranteed and localized fault-tolerant communication between any pair of cluster members. The construction algorithm automatically adapts to a dynamically changing environment, is guaranteed to converge, and exhibits good performance as well.", "paper_title": "Topology control for fault-tolerant communication in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273951000007"}
