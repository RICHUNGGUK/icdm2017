A transversal of a latin square corresponds to the case k = 1. A k-plex is said to be indivisible if it contains no c-plex for any 0 < c < k. We prove that if n = 2km for integers k >= 2 and m >= 1 then there exists a latin square of order n composed of 2m disjoint indivisible k-plexes. Also, for positive integers k and n satisfying n = 3k, n = 4k or n >= 5k, we construct a latin square of order n containing an indivisible k-plex.", "paper_title": "Indivisible plexes in latin squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000264478700006"}
