Results: We have created the AMASS database, which maps 1D sequence annotation databases to 3D protein structures with an intuitive visualization interface. Our platform also provides an analysis service that screens mass spectrometry sequence data for post- translational modifications that reside in functionally relevant locations within protein structures. The system is built on the premise that functional residues such as active sites, cancer mutations and post- translational modifications within proteins may co-localize and share common functions.", "paper_title": "AMASS: a database for investigating protein structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000337040200014"}
