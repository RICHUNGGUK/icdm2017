Simulation frameworks based on coordination models-that is, explicitly handling interaction-suit well the complex system simulation: and those based on nature-inspired coordination models, in particular, are well-suited for the simulation of complex natural systems. In this paper, we adopt an approach to self-organising coordination based on biochemical tuple spaces for self-organising coordination, and show how it can be applied to the simulation of complex interaction patterns of intracellular signalling pathways. We first present the model and a general high-level architecture, then we develop and discuss a simple case study-a single signalling pathway from the complex network of the Ras signalling pathways.", "paper_title": "A biochemically inspired coordination-based model for simulating intracellular signalling pathways", "paper_id": "WOS:000322750000007"}
