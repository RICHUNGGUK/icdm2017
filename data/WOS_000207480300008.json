However, in facing various software attacks, wireless linked networks are more vulnerable than wire linked networks. The general problem with Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) (Table I) is the long handover latency period. To reduce the security latency, we propose early security key exchange for encryption in MIPv6 handoff. In our approach, two issues are addressed in dealing with the latency within the encryption technology during the handover. First, we extend the Early Binding Update (EBU) method to deal with the long security exchange negotiation time for the MIPv6 handoff. Second, we adopt the Security Access Gateway (SAG) to solve the limited computing and memory in the Mobile Node (MN).
