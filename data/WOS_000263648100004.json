It is done via analysis of its acoustic signature against an existing database of recorded and processed acoustic signals to detect the arrival of a vehicle of arbitrary type when other noises are present. To achieve it with minimum number of false alarms, we combine a construction of a training database of acoustic signatures signals emitted by vehicles using the distribution of the energies among blocks of wavelet packet coefficients with a procedure of random search for a near-optimal footprint. The number of false alarms in the detection is minimized even under severe conditions such as: the signals emitted by vehicles of different types differ from each other, whereas the set of non-vehicle recordings (the training database) contains signals emitted by planes, helicopters, wind, speech, steps, etc. The proposed algorithm is robust even when the tested conditions are completely different from the conditions where the training signals were recorded. The proposed technique has many algorithmic variations. For example, it can be used to distinguish among different types of vehicles. The proposed algorithm is a generic solution for process control that is based on a learning phase (training) followed by an automatic real-time detection.", "paper_title": "Wavelet-based acoustic detection of moving vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000263648100004"}
