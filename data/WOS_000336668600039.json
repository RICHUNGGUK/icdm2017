The system-level control achieves the grid-tie current injection, independent maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for separate PV panels, and dc-link voltage balance for all quasi-Z-source H-bridge inverter (qZS-HBI) modules. The complete design process is disclosed. A multilevel space vector modulation (SVM) for the single-phase qZS-CMI is proposed to fulfill the synthetization of the step-like voltage waveforms. Simulation and experiment based on a seven-level prototype are carried out to validate the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "An Effective Control Method for Quasi-Z-Source Cascade Multilevel Inverter-Based Grid-Tie Single-Phase Photovoltaic Power System", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600039"}
