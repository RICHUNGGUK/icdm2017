These algorithms provide effective tools with important applications in business, engineering, economics, and science. This paper surveys state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms and their current applications in the field of large-scale global optimization. The paper mainly covers the fundamental algorithmic frameworks such as decomposition and non-decomposition methods. More than 200 papers are carefully reviewed to prepare the current comprehensive survey. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
