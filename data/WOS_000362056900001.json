In this paper, we describe four modern data mining techniques, Rough Set Theory (RST), Association Rule Mining (ARM), Emerging Pattern Mining (EP), and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), and we have attempted to give an exhaustive list of their chemoinformatics applications. One of the main strengths of these methods is their descriptive ability. When used to derive rules, for example, in structure activity relationships, the rules have clear physical meaning. This review has shown that there are close relationships between the methods. Often apparent differences lie in the way in which the problem under investigation has been formulated which can lead to the natural adoption of one or other method. For.example, the idea of a structural alert, as a structure which is present in toxic and absent in nontoxic compounds, leads to the natural formulation of an Emerging Pattern search. Despite the similarities between the methods, each has its strengths. RST is useful for dealing with uncertain and noisy data. Its main chemoinformatics applications so far have been in feature extraction and feature reduction, the latter often as input to another data mining method, such as an Support Vector Machine (SVM). ARM has mostly been used for frequent subgraph mining. EP and FCA have both been used to mine both structural and nonstructural patterns for classification of both active and inactive molecules. Since their introduction in the 1980s and 1990s, RST, ARM, EP, and FCA have found wide-ranging applications, with many thousands of citations in Web of Science, but their adoption by the chemoinformatics community has been relatively slow. Advances, both in computer power and in algorithm development, mean that there is the potential to apply these techniques to larger data sets and thus to different problems in the future.", "paper_title": "Perspectives on Knowledge Discovery Algorithms Recently Introduced in Chemoinformatics: Rough Set Theory, Association Rule Mining, Emerging Patterns, and Formal Concept Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000362056900001"}
