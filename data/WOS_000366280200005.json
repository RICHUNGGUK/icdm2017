This study sets out to (a) check whether current mobile devices are able to zoom or increase the font size of text on websites and (b) check the most efficient, effective, and satisfying usability method for the user to do so. A preparation stage with mobile devices and an experiment with real users were designed and carried out. Results suggested that current mobile devices are able to resize text in web pages. User testing returned that there is no difference in the ability to perform the task or in errors or time to complete it between text-resizing methods. However, users preferred increasing/decreasing font size links method in nontouch devices. In the light of results, it is recommended that links are provided to resize the text in web contents and that they are made readily available.", "paper_title": "Comparing Zooming Methods in Mobile Devices: Effectiveness, Efficiency, and User Satisfaction in Touch and Nontouch Smartphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000366280200005"}
