We recall that these operations together form the matrix operation of principal pivot transform (or pivot) restricted to graphs. This fact is not well known, and as a consequence various special cases of the properties of pivot have been rediscovered multiple times. In this paper we give a gentle overview of various properties of pivot for local and edge complementations on graphs. Moreover, we relate the pivot operation to perfect matchings to obtain a purely graph-theoretical characterization of the effect of sequences of pivot operations. Finally, we show that two of the three operations that make up a formal graph model of the biological process of gene assembly in ciliates together form the matrix operation of Schur complement restricted to graphs.
