In general, there are rigid demands associated with pushing fluid animations to higher resolutions given limited computational capabilities. This results in trade-offs between implementing high-order numerical methods and increasing the resolution of the simulation in space and time. For 3D problems, such challenges rapidly become cost-ineffective. The extrapolation method we present improves the flow features without using higher resolution simulation grids. In this paper, we show that simulation results from our extrapolation are comparable to those from higher resolution simulations. In addition, our method differs from high-order numerical methods because it does not depend on the equation or specific solver. We demonstrate that it is easy to implement and can significantly improve the fluid animation results.", "paper_title": "Spatio-temporal Extrapolation for Fluid Animation", "paper_id": "WOS:000326923200027"}
