The proposed scheme is equipped with a shape controlling tension parameter, is Hermitian, and reproduces circles from non-uniform samples. We prove that for any value of the free parameter the limit curve is G(1) continuous. The scheme is shape preserving and avoids undesirable oscillations by producing curves with a finite number of inflection points at the regions where the control polygon suggests a change of convexity. Several examples are presented demonstrating the properties of the scheme. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
