The aim consists of measuring not only the use of this tool, but also the external variables with a significant influence in its use for planning future improvements. The tool, designed with Shockwave (TM) and Macromedia Director (TM), is a web-based educational environment that has been applied as a teaching methodology in an undergraduate course involved with modern microprocessors architectures and applications. The proposed methodology may be extensible to similar tools and tries to fill the lack of scientific studies in the validation and acceptance of computer-based educational tools.
