The goal of the strategy is to allow the players enjoying the game in spite of their different levels. A first tennis videogame (based on the classic Pong) which implements this strategy has already been developed and evaluated through user studies. In the paper we first motivate this work and survey related work. Then we describe the general strategy and its application to the case of the tennis videogame. We also present the user studies carried out and analyze the interesting results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
