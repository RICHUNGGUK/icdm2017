Only one image of a flat surface is needed. Using the radial distances as provided by the Time-of-Flight principle, we reconstruct the pixel rows (or pixel columns) as collinear points in 3-space. Motivated by theoretical results, we claim that the correct values for , and can be found by an incremental procedure. In case of unknown aspect ratio, some (but few) iterations are needed.", "paper_title": "An Incremental Procedure for the Lateral Calibration of a Time-of-Flight Camera by One Image of a Flat Surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000354487300001"}
