However, for a comparable system, it has been shown using NOE methods that the amine does not reside inside the calix. Instead, an exo-calix complex is formed. A reevaluation suggests that the previous conclusion is an artifact due to improper NMR-data processing. DFT (RB3LYP/6-31G(d)) calculations confirm the higher stability of the exo-complex over its endo-counterpart.", "paper_title": "The formation of endo-complexes between calixarenes and amines - a reinvestigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239248300026"}
