Their chief property is that they characterise the n-torsion points of a given twisted Edwards curve. We present recursions for the division polynomials, which differ in their flavour. We prove a uniqueness form for elements of the function field of an Edwards curve. We also present results concerning the coefficients of these polynomials, which may aid computation.", "paper_title": "Two kinds of division polynomials for twisted Edwards curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000297864100001"}
