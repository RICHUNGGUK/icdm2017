However, new factors, such as the fast evolution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) or the need to set up alliances among different types of enterprises quickly in order to benefit from market opportunities, are causing new types of problems, like interoperability, to appear in the Enterprise Modelling context. This paper shows how a model-driven approach can be useful to solve interoperability problems using model transformations. In particular, the transformation of GRAI Extended Actigrams into UML Activity Diagrams is explored using three different model transformation tools. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
