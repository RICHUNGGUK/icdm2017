Many existing approaches to strategy acquisition focus on attempting to find strategies that are robust in the sense that they are good all-round performers against all-comers. We argue that, in many economic and multiagent scenarios, the robustness criterion is inappropriate; in contrast, our method focuses on searching for strategies that are likely to be adopted by participating agents, which is formalized as the size of a strategy's basins of attraction under the replicator dynamics.", "paper_title": "A Novel Method for Strategy Acquisition and Its Application to a Double-Auction Market Game", "paper_id": "WOS:000277774700011"}
