We adopt a cross-layer design standing on not only the lower (network and data link) layer's point of view but also higher (application) layer's point of view to provide quality WPAN services. In DA-QFS the service profile (SP) of a WPAN service is well-represented by the proposed characterized task graph (CTG). The proposed weighted device anycasting (WDA) process then takes connectivity, implicit distance, work degree, and mobility as the criteria to select the most quality device according to the information embedded in CTG. The simulation results on energy consumption, packet loss rate, average delay, and re-start time show that DA-QFS is an efficient approach, especially in the environment with highly mobile devices and multiple users.", "paper_title": "Service-oriented device anycasting using quality first search in wireless personal area network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300062"}
