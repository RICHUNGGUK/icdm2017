However, fewer works investigate the multiple source localization for binary sensor network. In this paper, a self-adaptive particle swarm optimization based multiple source localization method is proposed. A detection model based on Neyman-Pearson criterion is introduced. Then the maximum likelihood estimator is employed to establish the objective function which is used to estimate the location of sources. Therefore, the multiple-source localization problem is transformed into optimization problem. In order to improve the ability of global search of particle swarm optimization, the self-adaptive particle swarm optimization is used to solve this problem. Various simulations have been conducted, and the results show that the proposed method owns higher localization accuracy in comparison with other methods.", "paper_title": "A Self-Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization Based Multiple Source Localization Algorithm in Binary Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360168500001"}
