Several test statistics are proposed and one numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed hypothesis test for the shape parameter. Finally, a simulation study is performed to compare the power performances of all proposed test statistics. We concluded that the test statistic w1 is more attractive than other methods as it has better performance than other test statistics for most cases based on the criteria of maximum power.", "paper_title": "The exact hypothesis test for the shape parameter of a new two-parameter distribution with the bathtub shape or increasing failure rate function under progressive censoring with random removals", "paper_id": "WOS:000267667700005"}
