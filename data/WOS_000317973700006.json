Havet and Yu (Discrete Math 308:496-513, 2008) first introduced this problem and determined the exact value of except for even n with p+5a parts per thousand currency signna parts per thousand currency sign6p (2)-10p+4. Their proof for showing that for odd n has some mistakes. In this paper, we prove that if n is odd, then if p=2, p=3, or . And we extend some results that were given in Havet and Yu (Discrete Math 308:496-513, 2008). Beside these, we give a lower bound for under the condition that q < p < 2q.", "paper_title": "(p,q)-total labeling of complete graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000317973700006"}
