The HYTEC model has been applied to this benchmark exercise, and this paper summarizes some of the principal results. HYTEC is a general-purpose code, applied by industrials and research groups to a wide variety of domains, including soil pollution, nuclear waste storage, cement degradation, water purification systems, storage of CO(2), and valorization of stabilized wastes. The code has been applied to the benchmark test-cases without any specific modification. Apart from the benchmark imposed output, additional information is provided to highlight the behavior of HYTEC specifically and the simulation results in particular.", "paper_title": "HYTEC results of the MoMas reactive transport benchmark", "paper_id": "WOS:000278899300006"}
