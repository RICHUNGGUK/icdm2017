The cost further increases in the distributed data stream scenario where peers receive continuous sequence of transactions rapidly. In this paper, we develop an efficient local algorithm, P2P-FISM, for discovering of the network-wide recent frequent itemsets. The algorithm works in a completely asynchronous manner, imposes low communication overhead, a necessity for scalability, transparently tolerates network topology changes, and quickly adapts to changes in the data stream. The paper demonstrates experimental results to corroborate the theoretical claims. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
