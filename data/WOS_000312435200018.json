The tracking performance is measured by the energy of the error variance response between the output of the plant and the reference signal. The objective is to obtain an optimal tracking performance, attainable by all possible stabilizing compensators. It is shown that the optimal tracking performance is constrained by nonminimum phase (NMP) zeros, unstable poles of a given plant, a given reference signal and SNR of a communication channel. The result obtained in this paper explicitly shows how the optimal tracking performance is limited by the SNR of a communication channel. A typical example is given to illustrate the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH SNR CONSTRAINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312435200018"}
