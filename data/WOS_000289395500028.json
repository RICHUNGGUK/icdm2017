By learning effects, deteriorating jobs and group technology assumption, we mean that the processing time of a job is defined by the function of its starting time and position in the group, and the group setup times of a group is a positive strictly decreasing continuous function of the amount of consumed resource. We present polynomial solutions for the makespan minimization problem under the constraint that the total resource consumption does not exceed a given limit, and the total resource consumption minimization problem under the constraint that the makespan does not exceed a given limit, respectively.
