Optical Burst Switching (OBS) is not only cost-effective, but also provides high throughput, high bandwidth utilization, and low transmission latency. These benefits make OBS a viable solution for next-generation Metro Area Networks (MANs) in which the traffic models will be changed more dramatically than in today's networks. This paper employs Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology to construct a loss-free OBS metro ring architecture designated as the Collision-free Optic-burst Ring Network (CORNet). The proposed architecture ensures a collision-free transmission of data bursts, while retaining the advantage of the statistical multiplexing provided by conventional OBS networks. A novel distributed Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol to integrate the support of differentiated service and fairness access in CORNet is presented. The proposed Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning mechanism adopts a bandwidth-reservation approach which combines real-time transmission establishment and termination routines. Furthermore, a credit-based fairness control scheme is designed to guarantee the transmission fairness of best-effort traffic. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed CORNet system provides good performance for real-time traffic while simultaneously providing significant performance improvements for best-effort traffic.
