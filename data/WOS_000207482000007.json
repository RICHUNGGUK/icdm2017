For the class of transitively reduced circuits, we develop the Distinguishing Paths Algorithm, that learns such a circuit using (ns)(O(k)) value injection queries and time polynomial in the number of queries. We describe a generalization of the algorithm to the class of circuits with shortcut width bounded by b that uses (ns)(O(k+b)) value injection queries. Both algorithms use value injection queries that fix only O(kd) wires, where d is the depth of the target circuit. We give a reduction showing that without such restrictions on the topology of the circuit, the learning problem may be computationally intractable when s = n(Theta(1)), even for circuits of depth O(log n). We then apply our large-alphabet learning algorithms to the problem of approximate learning of analog circuits whose gate functions satisfy a Lipschitz condition. Finally, we consider models in which behavioral equivalence queries are also available, and extend and improve the learning algorithms of (Angluin in Proceedings of the Thirty-Eighth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 584-593, 2006) to handle general classes of gate functions that are polynomial time learnable from counterexamples.", "paper_title": "Learning large-alphabet and analog circuits with value injection queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000207482000007"}
