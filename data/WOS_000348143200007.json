Security, especially authentication, is crucial for the success of large-scale AMI deployment. Unfortunately, AMI's natural requirementsefficiency, scalability, fault diagnoses, and reliabilitycannot be fully satisfied by existing authentication schemes. To validate the delay-tolerant AMI metering data, we present a new authentication architecture that boosts the utilization of a set of efficient authentication schemes. Meanwhile, in case of authentication failures, fault diagnoses are highly demanded by AMI. Thus, we develop a few corresponding fault diagnosis algorithms that precisely pinpoint the authentication failure with lightweight computational cost. We implement our system on emulated smart meters and commodity servers. Experimental results on real-world scenarios demonstrate the feasibility of our system; it merely incurs substantially lighter overheads than those by the existing schemes, while it can effectively address the formidable authentication challenges in AMI.
