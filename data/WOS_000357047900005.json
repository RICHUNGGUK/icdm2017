We assessed the effectiveness of mobile wireless monitoring technology and IT in detecting possible emergencies during a skyscraper race. Methods: We attached specially designed wireless surveillance biopatches on 120 individuals participating to monitor their continuous ECG and location during a skyscraper run-up race at Taipei 101 building, Taiwan. The outcomes of interest were detection of abnormal heartbeats and QRS waves indicative of possible cardiac problems and the exact location of participants during the occurrence of emergencies. Results: The devices accurately sent over SO warnings to our monitoring platform when both, danger limits were reached by competitors (<60 or >195 beats per minute) or competitors stopped moving, proving very effective in quickly detecting abnormities and alerting staff of possible emergencies at exact locations. Conclusion: This efficient and inexpensive monitoring method can also prevent arrhythmias in unscreened competitors, the danger of collision among staff and competitors, and preserves oxygen by eliminating additional on-foot monitoring staff. Additionally, it could have multipurpose usage, especially during disasters and accidents occurring in difficult-to-access locations, in military exercises and personal monitoring.
