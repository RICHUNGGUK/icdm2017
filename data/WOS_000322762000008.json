They are validated using similarity coefficients from Medical Image on reconstructed volumes from computerised tomography images. In particular, the Jaccard and Hausdorff coefficients are used. Loads of 20 and 40g are applied to the livers and their deformation is simulated by means of the finite element method. The models used are a linear elastic model, a neo-Hookean model, a Mooney-Rivlin model, an Ogden model, a linear viscoelastic model and a viscohyperelastic model. The model that provided a behaviour that is closest to reality was the viscohyperelastic model, where the hyperelastic part was modelled with an Ogden model.", "paper_title": "Analysis of several biomechanical models for the simulation of lamb liver behaviour using similarity coefficients from medical image", "paper_id": "WOS:000322762000008"}
