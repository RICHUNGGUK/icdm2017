Our realization uses the matrix representation of finite fields and matrix-vector multiplications, and enables rapid operations in software implementation. The theoretical evaluation and computer simulation reveal that our realization of Karnin et al.'s scheme achieves much faster processing time than the ordinary symbol oriented realization of the scheme. Further, we show that our realization has comparable performance to the existing exclusive-OR-based fast schemes of Fujii et al. and Kurihara et al.", "paper_title": "A Novel Realization of Threshold Schemes over Binary Field Extensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480700019"}
