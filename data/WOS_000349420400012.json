A low-power 2-bit/step operation technique is proposed which uses dynamic threshold configuring comparator instead of multiple digital-to-analog converters (DACs). Power and area overhead is minimized by successively activated comparators. The comparator threshold is configured by simple V-cm biased current source, which keep the ADC free from power supply variations over 10%. Simple digital calibration is enabled by generating the reference internally. The prototype ADC fabricated in a 40 nm CMOS achieved a 44.3 dB signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) with 6.14 MS/s at a single supply voltage of 0.5 V. The ADC achieved a peak FoM of 4.8 fJ/conv-step at 0.4 V and operates down to 0.3 V.", "paper_title": "An 8 bit 0.3-0.8 V 0.2-40 MS/s 2-bit/Step SAR ADC With Successively Activated Threshold Configuring Comparators in 40 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000349420400012"}
