First, the generalized low power binding problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that happens to be an NP-complete task to solve. Then two polynomial-time heuristics are proposed that provide a speedup of up to 13.7 with an extremely low penalty for power when compared to the optimal ILP solution for our selected benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Effective techniques for the generalized low-power binding problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000236871100004"}
