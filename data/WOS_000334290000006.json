Many spectrum usage measurement reports have shown that inaccurate spectrum sensing will waste spectrum resources. A Multiple Antenna Asynchronous Cognitive MAC (MAAC-MAC) protocol is proposed through introducing a multiple antenna architecture and power control mechanism into the hardware-constrained cognitive MAC (MHC-MAC) protocol with Asynchronous-Assembly Line Mode in cognitive radio network. In the spectrum sensing stage, the protocol makes use of multiple antennas to perform spectrum sensing and positioning, aimed at improving spectrum sensing and detection performance. During the negotiation phase, the CU (Cognitive User) access power control mechanism fully utilizes the licensed band without interfering PU (Primary User) and also increases the transmission rate and system throughput. It may be used for improved positioning and location-based services both indoors and outdoors for IT convergence.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of the Multiple Antenna Asynchronous Cognitive MAC Protocol in Cognitive Radio Network for IT Convergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000334290000006"}
