Several Genetic Algorithm models have recently been presented with this aim. In this paper we present a new Binary-coded Local Genetic Algorithm based on a Steady-State Genetic Algorithm with a crowding replacement method. We have compared a Multi-Start Local Search based on the Binary-Coded Local Genetic Algorithm with other instances of this metaheuristic based on Local Search Procedures presented in the literature. The results show that, for a wide range of problems, our proposal consistently outperforms the other local search approaches.", "paper_title": "A local genetic algorithm for binary-coded problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400020"}
