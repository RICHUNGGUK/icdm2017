Fast Winograd DCTs are applied to resizing images by a factor of two to one. First, we speed up the DCT domain downsampling scheme which uses the bilinear interpolation. Then, we speed up other image resizing schemes which use DCT lowpass truncated approximations. The schemes proposed here reduce the computational complexities significantly, while there is no difference in the overall quality of the images compared to previous works.", "paper_title": "Efficient Schemes for Compressed-Domain Image Resizing", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701000027"}
