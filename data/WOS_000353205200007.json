Figure hunt games are a popular genre of visual puzzles; a timeless classic for children, artists and cognitive scientists. We argue and experimentally demonstrate that diffusion is a key to algorithmically search for a target figure in a binary line drawing. Particularly suited to the considered task, we propose a diffuse representation which diffuses the image while retaining the contour information.", "paper_title": "The Role of Diffusion in Figure Hunt Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000353205200007"}
