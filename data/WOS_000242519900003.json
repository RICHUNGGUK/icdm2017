Collaborative design deals with the sharing of various interests and resources among various actors aiming to reach a common purpose. This purpose relies on the development of products using knowledge sharing and interactions along some coordination between these varied activities. Our aim is to provide a collaborative design environment which allows inter-skill collaborations to be coordinated by defining a common repository for knowledge exchanges in a collaborative design situation. This work takes part of the IPPOP project (Integration of Product - Process - Organisation for engineering Performance improvement). This paper will focus on the most constrained collaborative design situation, related to conflicts management. From a domain analysis of conflict management processing, the first elements of a repository are given by identifying involved knowledge and formalizing protocols driven by actors to resolve conflicts. The Integration of the specified collaborative conflict resolution system in a global design environment is then discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
