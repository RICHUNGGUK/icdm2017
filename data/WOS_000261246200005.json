This preprocessing includes the automated generation of the CAD models which were used for the manufacturing of the multi-parted wing-fuselage configuration and the generation of the numerical grids for the corresponding numerical simulations. Due to the constraints of the project it was decided to employ only exact, watertight, untrimmed B-Spline representations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
