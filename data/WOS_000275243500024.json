In particular, it gives direct access to the newly improved Swiss-Prot variant pages. The key strength of this portal is that it provides a possibility to query for similar diseases, as well as the underlying protein products and the molecular details of each variant. In the context of the recently proposed molecular view on diseases, the SwissVar portal should be in a unique position to provide valuable information for researchers and to advance research in this area.", "paper_title": "Easy retrieval of single amino-acid polymorphisms and phenotype information using SwissVar", "paper_id": "WOS:000275243500024"}
