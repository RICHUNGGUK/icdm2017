While most multi-standard converters reported so far follow an ad hoc design approach, which do not guarantee either efficient silicon area occupation or power efficiency in the different operation modes, the methodology presented here formulates a systematic design flow that ensures that both factors are considered at all hierarchical levels. Expandible cascade modulators are considered as the starting point to further reconfigurability at the architectural level. From here on, and using a combination of accurate behavioral modeling, statistical optimization techniques, and device-level simulation, the proposed methodology handles the design complexity of a reconfigurable converter while ensuring adaptive power consumption and boosting hardware sharing. A case study is presented where a reconfigurable modulator is designed to operate under three communication standards, GSM, Bluetooth, and UMTS, in a 130 nm-CMOS technology.", "paper_title": "Systematic top-down design of reconfigurable I I\" pound modulators for multi-standard transceivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000262668000006"}
