This implies computational universality of least and greatest solutions of equations phi(X) = psi(X), as well as undecidability of their basic decision problems. It is sufficient to use only singleton constants in the construction. All results equally apply to language equations over a one-letter alphabet Sigma = {a}.", "paper_title": "Univariate Equations Over Sets of Natural Numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000285460000002"}
