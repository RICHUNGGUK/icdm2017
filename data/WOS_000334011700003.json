Developing a constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem is an old open problem. By proving a structural property in the problem and applying the shifting strategy and dynamic programming, we derive the first (1 + epsilon)(d)-approximation n(o)(1/epsilon(d))-time algorithm for this problem when d is a fixed constant.
