The idea is to construct models only from frontal and profile views and subsequently fuse these models with adequate weights to segment any facial view. This reduces the problem of multi-view facial segmentation to that of weight estimation, the algorithm for which is proposed as well. The evaluation is performed on a set of 280 landmarked static face images corresponding to seven different rotation angles and on several video sequences of the AV@CAR database. The evaluation demonstrates that the estimation of the weights does not have to be very accurate in the case of ASM, while in the case of AAM the influence of correct weight estimation is more critical. The segmentation with the proposed weight estimation method produced accurate segmentations in 91% of 280 testing images with the median point-to-point error varying from two to eight pixels (1.8-7.2% of average inter-eye distance).
