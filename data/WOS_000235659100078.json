The problem of throughput and scalability are still critical challenges for the success. In this paper, we propose and evaluate scalable backbone architecture which employs super nodes with asymmetric capability to reduce the hop count as well as increase the scalability, Multi-channel multi-radio approach is utilized to increase the throughput. A detailed performance evaluation shows that the deployment of about 20% super nodes can increase the network throughput by a factor of up to 5 compared with the conventional single channel multi hop architecture.", "paper_title": "Scalable backbone for wireless metropolitan grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100078"}
