The WCMAC is modified from the traditional CMAC for obtaining high approximation accuracy and convergent rate using the advantages of wavelet functions and fuzzy TSK-model. For nonlinear uncertain systems, a PD-type WCMAC controller with filter is constructed to approximate an ideal control signal. The corresponding adaptive supervisory controller is used to recover the residual of approximation error. Finally, the adaptive SWC scheme is applied to chaotic system identification and control including Mackey-Glass time-series prediction, control of inverted pendulum system, and control of Chua circuit system. These demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive SWC approach for nonlinear uncertain systems.", "paper_title": "Adaptive supervisory WCMAC neural network controller (SWC) for nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258546300001"}
