The compound crystallizes in monoclinic space group P2(1)/c with a = 7.527 (7) A, b=15.9397(15)angstrom, c=13.5106 (10)angstrom, beta = 117.649(4)degrees and Z=4. The initial coordinate geometry obtained by XRD is further used to obtain the optimized ground state geometry of the title compound using DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G (2d,2p) level of theory. Geometrical parameters, vibration frequencies, Gauge invariant atomic orbital (GIAO)H-1 and C-13 NMR chemical shifts of the title compound have been calculated theoretically using the optimized ground state geometry. Apart from this, density of states of different atoms, band gap studies and optical properties have also been studied successfully using theoretical models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
