A new Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed to provide the exact solution of the problem with station-dependent assembly times. Because of NP-hardness, a Simulated Annealing (SA) is applied and compared to the Co-evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (Co-GA) from the literature. To strengthen the search process, two main hypotheses, namely simultaneous search and feasible search, are developed contrasting Co-GA. Various parameters of SA are reviewed to calibrate the algorithm by means of Taguchi design of experiments. Numerical results statistically show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed SA in terms of both the quality of solution and the time of achieving the best solution. Finally, the contribution of each hypothesis in this superiority is analyzed. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
