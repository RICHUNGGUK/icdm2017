To perform such a computer analysis at first the axial position in patient's brain must be chosen. In next step the generation of brain perfusion maps connected with detection of asymmetries indicating selected pathological states, and allowing supporting diagnosis of the visible lesions are all done automatically. The constructed system uses the unified algorithm for detection of asymmetry in cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume perfusion maps, as well as a registration algorithm created by the authors and based on free form deformation. The tests were performed on set of dynamic perfusion computer tomography maps. Algorithms presented in this paper enable detection of pathological states like head injuries, epilepsy, brain vascular disease, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.", "paper_title": "Automatic Detection and Lesion Description in Cerebral Blood Flow and Cerebral Blood Volume Perfusion Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000282051500006"}
