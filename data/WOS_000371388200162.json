As a part of array signal processing, direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation is of vital importance to obtain directional information of sources and to enable the 3-D beamforming. In this paper, the performance of DoA estimation for massive MIMO systems is analyzed and compared using a low complexity algorithm. To be specific, 2-D unitary estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (U-ESPRIT) algorithm is studied to jointly estimate elevation and azimuth information, and uniform rectangular array is selected to represent massive MIMO systems. The simulation results indicate that the U-ESPRIT algorithm works well for the massive MIMO systems. The performance has been evaluated with various types of antenna configuration and source numbers. Finally, the array resolution is adopted to analyze the performance of elevation and azimuth estimation and how to choose the appropriate antenna array configuration.", "paper_title": "Two-Dimension Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200162"}
