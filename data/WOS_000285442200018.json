In this paper, we study the problem of providing differentiated services in passive star coupled wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. We present a medium access control (MAC) protocol based on a simple static priority based scheduling algorithm combined with channel assignment. We propose an analytical model to evaluate the performance of the differentiated services provided by the MAC protocol which prioritizes message transmissions in single-hop WDM passive star networks. We formulate the analytical model and conducted numerical study to validate the model. The study proves that the proposed analytical model is accurate enough to describe the behaviors of the differentiated service provided by the networks with the MAC protocol. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
