Researchers and engineers world-wide are looking for appropriate methods and technologies to achieve the petaflops computer system. Based on discussion on important design issues in developing the petaflops computer, this paper raises the major technological challenges including the memory wall, low power system design, interconnects, and programming support, etc. Current efforts in addressing some of these challenges and in pursuing possible solutions for developing the petaflops systems are presented. Several existing systems are briefly introduced as examples, including Roadrunner, Cray XT5 jaguar, Dawning 5000A/6000, and Lenovo DeepComp 7000. Architectures proposed by Chinese researchers for implementing the petaflops computer are also introduced. Advantages of the architecture as well as the difficulties in its implementation are discussed. Finally, future research direction in development of high productivity computing systems is discussed.", "paper_title": "Challenges and possible approaches: towards the petaflops computers", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971100001"}
