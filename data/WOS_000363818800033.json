The results show that field independent students make better learning achievement but field dependent students demonstrate higher frustration tolerance. Besides, the low-ability students significantly made more improvement than the high-ability students. The low-ability students also demonstrate higher frustration tolerance in this study. The findings can guide designers how to develop adaptive group-based videogames that match the needs of each individual. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
