It is common, therefore, to suspect that the population is composed of several homogeneous subpopulations. Such an assumption leads us to consider mixed income distributions whose components feature the distributions of the incomes of a particular homogeneous subpopulation. A model with mixing probabilities that are allowed to vary with exogenous individual variables that characterize each subpopulation is developed. This model simultaneously provides a flexible estimation of the income distribution, a breakdown into several subpopulations and an explanation of income heterogeneity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
