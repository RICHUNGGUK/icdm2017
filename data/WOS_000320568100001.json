First, we present a new fuzzy ranking method based on the a-cuts of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Then, based on the proposed fuzzy ranking method of interval type-2 fuzzy sets, we present a new method for fuzzy multiple attributes decision making. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of Liu and Su's method [45] and Wang and Luo's method [64] due to the fact that it can deal with the ranking of interval type-2 fuzzy sets to distinguish the preference order of the alternatives. The proposed fuzzy multiple attributes decision making method is more flexible and more intelligent than Chen and Lee's method [21] due to the fact that it not only uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets, but also considers the decision-maker's attitude towards risks.
