Only by demonstrating the performance and applicability of arresters can we seek the most feasible and economic low-voltage solutions. After performing repeated experiments with the same testing samples, using different testing equipment, we compare the different test results in order to select the most suitable and applicable testing equipment. In addition, the basis of a surge current parameter design theory is confirmed and verified through the test results using a simple and compact Impulse Current Generator to test a wide range of samples. By performing the actual analyzes and experiments, we can understand deeply how R, L, and C affect surge current, current wave, and current wave time. The ideal testing equipment standards have, been set as follows: (1) Test Voltage up to 20 kV; (2) Expand current range from 1.5 kA to 46.5 kA, with resolution 1.5 kA; and (3) Simple operational procedures.", "paper_title": "Development and Evaluation of a Wide Range Impulse Current Generator for Surge Arrester Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000320218000006"}
