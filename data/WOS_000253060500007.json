Reliability concept describes essentially the transmission characteristics of infrastructureless networks, such as packet loss probability, packet duplication, data misinsertion, and corruption of packets. Some other metrics nowadays, aggregate and contribute to the aggravation of end to end reliability. In this work a new scheme for end to end reliable file/resource sharing is studied, among mobile peer-to-peer users. The proposed scheme uses the Hybrid Mobile Infestation System (HyMIS) to maintain and enhance the reliability of file/resource sharing process among wireless devices. Under various storage constraints the epidemic backup node selection is adopted, merging the advantages of epidemic file dissemination through purely mobile Infestations, using the HyMIS architecture. Examination through simulation is performed, taking into account many newly introduced storage metrics, for the performance evaluation of the proposed scheme. These storage metrics are tuned into certain bounded values to enable high packet delivery ratio. Results show that this scheme under certain storage requirements offer a reliable and robust solution for sharing resources of any capacity in dynamic mobile peer-to-peer wireless environments.
