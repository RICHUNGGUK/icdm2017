In this paper, we study both the Web-Telecom based hybrid services orchestration and execution middleware for coordinating existing Telecom services and IT services. In particular, we focus on the design and implementation Web-Telecom based hybrid service bus (WTSB), event-driven Telecom service engine (EDLE) and also the integration layer for the messages dispatching and transformation between WTSB and EDLE, which can make the EDLE service engine seamlessly integrated into WTSB. More specifically, with multimedia conferencing scenarios, we demonstrate how our hybrid services orchestration and execution middleware orchestrate multimedia conferencing communication services together, and also make performance measurement and analysis. Finally, we give the conclusions and future work. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
