Under rather general conditions, we prove results on sharp asymptotics of the probabilities P {1/n Sigma(k=0) (n-1)g(xi k) < d}, n -> infinity and also of their conditional versions. The results are obtained using a new method developed in the paper, namely, the Laplace method for sojourn times of discrete-time Markov chains. We consider two examples: standard Gaussian random variables with g(x) = vertical bar x vertical bar (p), p > 0, and exponential random variables with g(x) = x for x >= 0.", "paper_title": "Large Deviations for Distributions of Sums of Random Variables: Markov Chain Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000280241600005"}
