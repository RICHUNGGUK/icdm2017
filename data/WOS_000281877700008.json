This study intends to specify and compare the mining subsidence effect in terms of building transmitted movements or induced stresses, given the soil-structure interaction phenomena produced at the interface between a \"stiff\" elastic structure and a \"flexible\" elastoplastic soil. A series of models, developed using finite element software, has enabled a parametric study of the soil-structure interaction. Briefly, the results of this study enabled visualisation and characterisation of various phenomena related to the soil-structure interaction as a function of the intensity of the free-field horizontal ground strain caused by subsidence, the building length and stiffness, and the soil mechanical properties. It was thus possible to identify and assess the relations between free-field horizontal ground movements and movements and stresses transmitted to the buildings. Differences between the traction and compression zones were investigated in order to identify the nonlinearity of the building loading. Finally, an analytical model of building loading assessment was tested and compared with the numerical results, with similar loading in the compression zone and discrepancies in the traction zone.
