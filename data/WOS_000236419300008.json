We investigate the extent to which fuzzy strategies can also be successfully applied to modeling the manner in which a musician interprets a piece of music. For Beethoven's \"Fur Elise\", we set up a fuzzy system comprising 150 interpretation rules. Its input is the information contained in the score of a piece of piano music; its output is a MIDI file that represents an interpretation of this music. The level of interpretation reached so far is still well below the standard of an experienced pianist, but well above a merely mechanical rendering of the score. We discuss possible practical uses of our system, possible further developments, and demonstrate the use of advanced fuzzy strategies.", "paper_title": "Use of fuzzy strategies for interpretation of music", "paper_id": "WOS:000236419300008"}
