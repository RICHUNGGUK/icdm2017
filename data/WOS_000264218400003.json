Using several high-dimensional benchmark functions, we illustrate that the proposed line search restart (LSRS) approach is very suitable for high-dimensional global optimization problems. Performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with two popular global optimization approaches, namely, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization method. Empirical results for up to 2000 dimensions clearly illustrate that the proposed approach performs very well for the tested high-dimensional functions.
