Plk1 is a member of Ser/Thr kinase family which also includes Plk2-4 in human. Plk1 promotes the cell division whereas Plk2 and Plk3 are reported to act as tumour suppressors. The available inhibitors of Plk1 also suppress Plk2 and Plk3 activity significantly resulting in the cell death of normal cells in addition to the cancer cells. Hence, it is imperative to explore Plk1 specific inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. In this work, a selective potential inhibitor of Plk1 has been identified by molecular docking based high throughput virtual screening. The identified compound exploits the subtle differences between the binding sites of Plk1 and other Ser/Thr kinases including Plk2-4. The predicted binding affinity of identified inhibitor is higher than available inhibitors with a 100-fold selectivity towards Plk1 over Plk2-4 and several cell cycle kinases. It also satisfies the Lipinski's criteria of drug-like molecules and passes the other ADMET filters. This triazole compound with aryl substituent belongs to a novel class of potential inhibitor for Plk1. The suggested potential lead molecule can thus be tested and developed further as a potent and selective anti-cancer drug. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
