Applying temporal purchase patterns derived from sequential pattern analysis (SPA) for recommendation services also often makes users unhappy with the inaccurate and biased results obtained by not considering individual preferences. The objective of this research is twofold. One is to derive implicit ratings so that CF can be applied to online transaction data even when no explicit rating information is available, and the other is to integrate CF and SPA for improving recommendation quality. Based on the results of several experiments that we conducted to compare the performance between ours and others, we contend that implicit rating can successfully replace explicit rating in CF and that the hybrid approach of CF and SPA is better than the individual ones.
