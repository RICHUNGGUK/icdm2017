The number of codewords in a conflict-avoiding code determines the number of potential users that can be supported in a system. Previously, upper bound on the size of conflict-avoiding code is known only for Hamming weights three, four and five. The asymptotic upper in this paper extends the known results to all Hamming weights, and is proved to be tight by exhibiting infinite sequences of conflict-avoiding codes which meet this bound asymptotically for all Hamming weights.", "paper_title": "A tight asymptotic bound on the size of constant-weight conflict-avoiding codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000279462800001"}
