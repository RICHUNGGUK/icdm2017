The algorithm is based on solving the multiple objective shortest path problem on an underlying network. Algorithms for constructing four network models, all representing the MOIKP, are also presented. Each network is composed of layers and each network algorithm, working forward layer by layer, identifies the set of all permanent nondominated labels for each layer. The effectiveness of the algorithms is supported with numerical results obtained for randomly generated problems for up to seven objectives while exact algorithms reported in the literature solve the multiple objective binary knapsack problem with up to three objectives. Extensions of the approach to other classes of problems including binary variables, bounded variables. multiple constraints, and time-dependent objective functions are possible.
