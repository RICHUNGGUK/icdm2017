Initially, the nonlinear coupled system is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy-coupled ODE-PDE model. Then, based on the fuzzy model and parallel distributed compensation scheme, a fuzzy state feedback control design is developed via Lyapunov's direct method, such that the resulting closed-loop fuzzy-coupled system is exponentially stable, and a prescribed H-infinity performance of disturbance attenuation is satisfied. The existing condition of the proposed H-infinity fuzzy controllers is given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Moreover, in order to make the attenuation level as small as possible while the input constraint is respected to avoid the high magnitude, a suboptimal H-infinity-constrained fuzzy control problem is also addressed, which is formulated as an LMI optimization problem. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the control of a hypersonic rocket car to illustrate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "H-infinity Fuzzy Control for a Class of Nonlinear Coupled ODE-PDE Systems With Input Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000355764700009"}
