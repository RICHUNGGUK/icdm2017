Regions where the electric current exceeds a critical threshold are declared to be 'dissipative' and endowed with super-Dreicer electric field E-Omega = nj. In this environment, test particles (electrons) are traced and their acceleration to relativistic energies is studied. As a main result we find that acceleration mostly takes place within the dissipation regions, and that the momentum increments have heavy (non-Gaussian) tails, while the waiting times between the dissipation regions are approximately exponentially distributed with intensity proportional to the particle velocity. No correlation between the momentum increment and the momentum itself is found. Our numerical results suggest an acceleration scenario with ballistic transport between independent 'black box' accelerators.", "paper_title": "Statistical properties of dissipative MHD accelerators", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200064"}
