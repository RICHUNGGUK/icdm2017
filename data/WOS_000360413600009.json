In this paper, as examples based on the diffusionless Lorenz system we proposed a couple of chaotic flows with signum piecewise-linearity, which experimentally resorts to digital gate circuits. The experimental chaotic circuit with logic elements was built, and the oscillation in the physical circuit agrees well with the numerical simulation.", "paper_title": "A New Class of Chaotic Circuit with Logic Elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000360413600009"}
