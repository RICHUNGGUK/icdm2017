To solve this problem, an improved soft preemptive (SP) scheme is proposed by considering dynamic resource distribution to deal with the uneven network utilization. A novel unevenly distributed traffic model in cross-time-zone networks is also presented to evaluate the efficiency of the new scheme. Compared with other schemes such as normal shortest path first (SPF) routing and wavelength conversion (WC), the new proposed scheme results demonstrate significantly better performance with respect to the network utilization and overall network blocking probability.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of an improved soft preemptive scheme for unevenly distributed traffic in optical wavelength-division multiplexing networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000259191100009"}
