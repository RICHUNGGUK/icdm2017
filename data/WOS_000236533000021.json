Unlike traditional mobile wireless networks, ad hoc networks rely on individual nodes to keep all the necessary interconnections alive. in this article we investigate the principal security issues for protecting mobile ad hoc networks at the data link and network layers. The security requirements for these two layers are identified and the design criteria for creating secure ad hoc networks using multiple lines of defence against malicious attacks are discussed.
