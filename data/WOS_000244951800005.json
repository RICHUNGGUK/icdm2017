A new web-based artificial neural network-genetic algorithm was used to optimize the synthesis process, ensuring preparation of the ZrO2 spheres with a minimum size. Using the optimized process parameters, the minimum-sized mesoporous cubic ZrO2 spherical particles (0.64 mu m) were obtained after calcination at 600 degrees C.", "paper_title": "Optimization design of novel spray reaction synthesis of mesoporous c-ZrO2 spherical particles", "paper_id": "WOS:000244951800005"}
