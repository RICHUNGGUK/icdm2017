We study the problem of determining a minimum weight connected subgraph of G that has at least one vertex in common with all paths of length two in G. It is known that this problem is NP-hard for general graphs. We first show that it remains NP-hard when restricted to unit disk graphs. Our main contribution is a polynomial time approximation scheme for this problem if we assume that the problem is c-local and the unit disk graphs have minimum degree of at least two.
