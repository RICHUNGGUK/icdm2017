Watermarking techniques are usually employed for authenticity verification and copyright protection. Here, watermarking technique is adopted to provide a new approach for RR-SIQA. Firstly, the features of image are extracted in reorganized discrete cosine transform domain, and then embedded into the stereoscopic image as invisible hidden information. In order to improve the reliability of the watermarking, some channel coding techniques are applied before the process of embedding watermark. At the receiver, the watermark can be decoded and used to measure the quality of the distorted stereoscopic image. The proposed algorithm overcomes the limitations of other existing methods that require an auxiliary channel. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm has a good consistency with subjective quality scores, and can reflect the visual perception of stereoscopic image effectively.
