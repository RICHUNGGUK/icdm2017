The problem is NP-hard in the strong sense and extremely difficult to solve in practice. We characterize relevant subclasses of packing and present an algorithm which is able to solve moderately large instances to optimality. Extensive computational experiments compare the algorithm for the three-dimensional bin packing when solving general orthogonal packings and when restricted to robot packings.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 864: General and robot-packable variants of the three-dimensional bin packing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000245796100007"}
