Though cloud computing and virtualization technology have been widely applied in supporting the information processing needs of conventional enterprise and business applications, there has been a little success to-date in enabling realtime 3D virtual appliances in the cloud. This paper aims to address this deficiency by presenting SHARC, a solution for enabling scalable support of realtime 3D virtual appliances in a cloud computing environment. The solution uses a scalable pipelined processing infrastructure which consists of three processing networks according to the principle of division-of-labor, a virtualization server network for running 3D virtual appliances, a graphics rendering network for processing graphics rendering workload with load balancing, and a media streaming network for transcoding rendered frames into H.264/MPEG-4 media streams and streaming the media streams to a cloud user. The paper describes a prototype implementation of SHARC and reports test results that demonstrate the viability of this approach.
