A novel method for Ensemble Pruning via BackTracking algorithm (EnPBT) was proposed by us in our previous work. Backtracking algorithm can systematically search for the solutions of a problem in a depth-first and jumping manner, suitable for solving all those large-scale combinatorial problems. The validity of EnPBT algorithm has been verified in our previous work. However, the relatively slow pruning speed might be a drawback of EnPBT. Aiming at this problem, an efficient and novel ensemble pruning algorithm is proposed in this paper, i.e. One-Path and Two-Trips (OPTT) ensemble pruning algorithm. It is very fast in pruning speed, while its classification performance has no significant difference with EnPBT, as demonstrated in the experimental results of this work. In short, OPTT achieves a proper trade-off between pruning effectiveness and efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
