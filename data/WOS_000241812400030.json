Teachers and students may find useful a medium to inspect information of students and student groups in an intuitive way. This paper presents DynMap+, an approach to generate and visualize Group Student Models generated from data gathered by a computer supported learning system. DynMap+ represents student models graphically by means of Concept Maps. Some graphical resources are used to highlight important data. The use of those resources allows DynMap+ to provide users (e.g. teachers) with a viewpoint that helps him/her to make decisions in order to improve the students learning process. The generated group student models record not only the last state of knowledge of the students but also their evolution during the learning sessions. As the knowledge of the students change over time, the updating of those models is also considered.", "paper_title": "DynMap+: A concept mapping approach to visualize group student models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241812400030"}
