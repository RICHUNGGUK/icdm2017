The efficiency and precision of detection are the goals of this study. In this paper, we introduce a duplicate detecting method based on semantic links among data, and propose a novel approach, named Most Possible Partition (M PP) to help detect duplicates efficiently The main principle of MPP is to partition those data into most-possible-duplicate parts, in which there is a higher probability of duplicates. MPP does not sort data into certain order as classical Sorted Neighborhood Method (SNM) did We give an effective partition method using semantic links among entities Experiments on publication datasets show that the proposed method is efficient, and performance and accuracy of MPP are better than those of SNM.", "paper_title": "Most Possible Partition: Utilizing Semantic Links for Duplicate Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000278649500006"}
