We try to expand user interests significantly by letting the user browse those topics. We first generate user-interest ontologies that allow user profiles to be constructed as a hierarchy of classes where a user interest weight is assigned to each class and instance. Next, we measure the similarity between user interests by using interest weights on their user-interest ontologies and generate user group G(U) that has high similarity to user u. The innovative topics for u are then detected by determining a suitable size of G(U) and analyzing the ontologies in G(U). (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
