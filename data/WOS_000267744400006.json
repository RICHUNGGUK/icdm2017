In this paper we show that in some sense this is not a coincidence. Our first result is that the property defined by having any given Szemeredi-partition is testable with a constant number of queries. Our second and main result is a purely combinatorial characterization of the graph properties that are testable with a constant number of queries. This characterization (roughly) says that a graph property P can be tested with a constant number of queries if and only if testing P can be reduced to testing the property of satisfying one of finitely many Szemeredi-partitions. This means that in some sense, testing for Szemeredi-partitions is as hard as testing any testable graph property. We thus resolve one of the main open problems in the area of property-testing, which was first raised by Goldreich, Goldwasser, and Ron [J. ACM, 45 (1998), pp. 653-750] in the paper that initiated the study of graph property-testing. This characterization also gives an intuitive explanation as to what makes a graph property testable.", "paper_title": "A COMBINATORIAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE TESTABLE GRAPH PROPERTIES: IT'S ALL ABOUT REGULARITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000267744400006"}
