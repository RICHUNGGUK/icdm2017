To derive decentralized solutions that do not require any cooperation among the users, we formulate this problem as noncooperative joint random access and power control game, in which each user minimizes its average transmission cost with a given rate constraint. Using supermodular game theory, the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium are established. Furthermore, we present an asynchronous distributed algorithm to compute the solution of the game based on myopic best response updates, which converges to Nash equilibrium globally. Finally, a link admission algorithm is carried out to guarantee the reliability of the active users. Performance evaluations via simulations show that the game-theoretical based cross-layer design achieves high performance in terms of energy consumption and network stability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
