It cannot be approximated with a ratio better than 2 (unless P = NP). We present in this paper the methodology that encompasses several existing results [1,2]. We detail first how to apply it for obtaining a 5/2-approximation. Then, we use it to provide a new 7/3-approximation running in O(log(nh(max))N(n log(n))), where h(max) is the processing time of the longest job. Finally, we apply it to a restriction of the problem to jobs of limited size, leading to a 2-approximation which is the best possible ratio since the restriction remains 2-inapproximable.
