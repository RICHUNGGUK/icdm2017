It is demonstrated that, by associating certain values V, W and U on standard Lukasiewicz MV-algebra with the first and second premise and the conclusion, respectively, the validity of a corresponding intermediate syllogism is determined by a simple MV-algebra (in-)equation. Possible conservative extensions of Peterson's system are discussed. Finally it is shown that Peterson's bivalued intermediate syllogisms can be viewed as fuzzy theories in Pavelka's fuzzy propositional logic, i.e. a fuzzy version of Peterson's Intermediate Syllogisms is introduced.", "paper_title": "An algebraic study of Peterson's Intermediate Syllogisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000345097100009"}
