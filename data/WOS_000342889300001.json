This hierarchical graph model combines two component graph models. The theoretical framework of the combined model is constructed using the decision makers, states, moves, and preference structures from the component models. Theorems are developed to relate stable states in the hierarchical model to stable states in local graph models. This novel approach can avoid direct calculation for four hierarchical stabilities. This methodology is applied to a water diversion conflict in China, consisting of conflicts at two locations where it is proposed to divert water from the south to the north of the country. The analytical results show how decision makers can obtain strategic resolutions for the entire conflict.", "paper_title": "A Basic Hierarchical Graph Model for Conflict Resolution with Application to Water Diversion Conflicts in China", "paper_id": "WOS:000342889300001"}
