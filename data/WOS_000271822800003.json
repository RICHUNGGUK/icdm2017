The method is able to automatically set a feasible scale according to geographic scope, the complexity of the road network, and the distance to the viewer. Moreover, the method achieves multi-scale representations of road networks on a display screen. The key steps of the method and the initial experimental studies undertaken to evaluate its feasibility are described. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
