Two mechanical models are optimized and compared for this purpose: linear solid-mechanic model and linear elastic model. Both models assume the realistic finite deformation of the brain after opening the skull. In this study, we use pre-operative and intra-operative magnetic resonance images (MRI) of five patients undergoing brain tumor surgery. Anatomical landmarks are identified by an expert radiologist on MRI and used for the method development and comparison studies. We use tetrahedral finite element meshes and optimize model parameters by minimizing the mean distance between the predicted locations of the anatomical landmarks using the pre-operative images and their actual locations on the intra-operative images. Evaluation of the objective function using a second set of landmarks not used in the optimization process suggests that accuracy of the solid mechanic model is higher than that of the elastic model for our application. Visual inspection of the results confirms this conclusion. The proposed method along with the location information of the surface landmarks measured in the operating room and marked on the pre-operative images can be used to estimate the brain deformations without needing intra-operative images. In this case, since the parameters of the brain tissue are not the same for different patients, the proposed optimization process is crucial for obtaining accurate results.", "paper_title": "Estimating Brain Deformation During Surgery Using Finite Element Method: Optimization and Comparison of Two Linear Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000264133700013"}
