In this paper a Genetic Fuzzy Rule Base System (GFRS) for modeling of viscosity in enzyme-modified cheese (EMC) is described based on experimental data. Using data obtained via measurement of viscosity in EMC prepared with different dosage of a commercial bacterial neutral proteinase, Neutrase (R) 0.5L (0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 v/w%) at 30, 40 and 50 degrees C with 100, 200 and 300 RPM in a viscometer, it is concluded that construction of an optimized fuzzy model for the evaluation of viscosity in EMC is a reliable procedure. This may help manufacturers to control the viscosity of EMS in processing units by selecting the appropriate combinations of potential manufacturing parameters. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
