It is then an important issue to be able to decide whether a given architecture falls in this class. This is the problem addressed in this paper: we establish the decidability and precise complexity of checking this property. This problem is in EXPSPACE and NP-hard in the general case, but falls into PSPACE when restricted to a natural subclass of architectures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
