In comparison with conventional gradient-based neural networks, such RNN models are elegantly designed by defining matrix-valued indefinite error functions. In this paper, we generalize, investigate and analyze ZNN models for online time-varying full-rank matrix Moore-Penrose inversion. The computer-simulation results and application to inverse kinematic control of redundant robot arms demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of ZNN models for online time-varying full-rank matrix Moore-Penrose inversion.", "paper_title": "Zhang neural network solving for time-varying full-rank matrix Moore-Penrose inverse", "paper_id": "WOS:000290324300001"}
