We analyze the worst-case performance of the algorithms and establish tightness of the derived bounds. Among other variants, we capture the cases of pick-up and delivery and multiple depots. We also introduce brand new concepts such as mobile depots, partitioning of customer nodes into groups, and potential opportunistic under-utilization of vehicle capacity by only partially loading the vehicle, among others, which arise from a printed circuit board application. The problems studied are of critical importance in many practical applications. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
