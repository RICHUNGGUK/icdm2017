Network Enabled Servers implement this model also called GridRPC. Clients submit computation requests to a scheduler whose goal is to find a server available on the grid. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of a middleware developed by the GRAAL team called DIET (for Distributed Interactive Engineering Took box). DIET is a hierarchical set of components used for the development of applications based on computational servers on the grid.", "paper_title": "DIET: A scalable toolbox to build network enabled servers on the grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000239512200003"}
