Squaric acid forms rather strong beryllium bonds with BeH2, with binding energies of the order of 60 kJ mol(-1). The preferential sites for BeH2 attachment are the carbonyl oxygen atoms, but the global minima of the potential energy surfaces of both EZ and ZZ isomers are extra-stabilized through the formation of a BeH center dot center dot center dot HO dihydrogen bond. More importantly, analysis of the electron density of these complexes shows the existence of significant cooperative effects between the beryllium bond and the dihydrogen bond, with both becoming significantly reinforced. The charge transfer involved in the formation of the beryllium bond induces a significant electron density redistribution within the squaric acid subunit, affecting not only the carbonyl group interacting with the BeH2 moiety but significantly increasing the electron delocalization within the four membered ring. Accordingly the intrinsic properties of squaric acid become perturbed, as reflected in its ability to self-associate.", "paper_title": "Modulating weak intramolecular interactions through the formation of beryllium bonds: complexes between squaric acid and BeH2", "paper_id": "WOS:000320954600008"}
