The main idea is to construct elaborate normal maps on simple surfaces for the realistic rendering of complex point-set models. Based on this observation, we developed the coarse, NBSs to approximate the original point datasets with fine surface details. In our algorithm, a genetic clustering algorithm is proposed to automatically segment the point samples into several clusters according to their statistical properties, and a network of B-spline patches with normal maps are constructed according to the clustering results. In respect to signal processing, our algorithm decouples the original data into two collections: coarse geometry information and fine surface details. The multi-level B-spline surfaces are employed to describe the coarse geometry information, and the normal maps are constructed to capture the fine surface details. Our experimental results show that this representation facilitates the modeling and rendering of complex point sets without losing the visual qualities. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
