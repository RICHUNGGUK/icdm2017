It is also very useful in coding theory, since it is related to the covering radii of Reed-Muller codes. In this paper we investigate the lower bound of the higher-order nonlinearity of Niho Boolean functions f(x) = tr (lambda x(d)) over F-2(n), where lambda is an element of F*(2n,) d= 2(n-1/2) + 2(n-1/4) -1 when n=1 mod 4 or d = 2(n-1/2) + 2(3n-1/4) -1 when n=3 mod 4", "paper_title": "Higher Order Nonlinearity of Niho Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000351841700007"}
