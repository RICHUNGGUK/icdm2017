However, their proposed scheme is still vulnerable to replay and DoS attacks. A serious problem in their scheme is that FA. cannot get the session key(MF). In order to improve these shortcomings, we propose an enhanced secure authentication scheme with anonymity for roaming in mobility networks. The security analysis of our scheme demonstrates maintaining all of the security in Mun et al.'s scheme, but also efficiently improves upon the weaknesses in Kim-Kwak scheme.", "paper_title": "Enhanced Secure Authentication Scheme with Anonymity for Roaming in Mobility Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337733200004"}
