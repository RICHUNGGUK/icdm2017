The query returns a sequence of answer-pairs, namely pairs of the form such that is a time interval and is the set of objects that are closest to during . When there is uncertainty associated with the locations of the moving objects, is the set of all the objects that are possibly the nearest neighbors. We analyze the lower bound and the upper bound on the maximum number of answer-pairs, for the certain case and the uncertain case, respectively. Then, we consider two different types of algorithms. The first is off-line algorithms that compute a priori all the answer-pairs. The second type is on-line algorithms that at any time return the current answer-pair. We present algorithms for the certain case and the uncertain case, respectively, and analyze their complexity. We experimentally compare different algorithms using a database of 1 million objects derived from real-world GPS traces.", "paper_title": "Continuous nearest-neighbor queries with location uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000348123500002"}
