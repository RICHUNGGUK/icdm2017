This paper presents an integrated health monitoring system based on mobile pervasive technologies. The system utilizes Cloud Computing for providing robust and scalable resources for sensor data acquisition, management and communication with external applications like health information systems. A prototype has been developed using both mobile and wearable sensors for demonstrating the usability of the proposed platform. Initial results regarding the performance of the system, the efficiency in data management and user acceptability have been quite promising.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Health Monitoring Based on Pervasive Technologies and Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000336744300003"}
