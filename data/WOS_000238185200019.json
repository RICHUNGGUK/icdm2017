The first one adapts the Ackermann method [1] and the second one adapts the fixpoint method of [20]. We show applications of the proposed techniques in the theory of correspondence between modal logics and elementary set theory. The proposed techniques can also be applied in an automated generation of proof rules based on the semantic-based translation of axioms of a given logic into the elementary set theory.", "paper_title": "Quantifier elimination in elementary set theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000238185200019"}
