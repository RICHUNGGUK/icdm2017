But man can deal with such tasks freely. Inspired by cognition and linguistics, a solution is advanced for reasoning dense knowledge in this paper. Objects and concepts are organized in the form of concept graph. Soaking the nodes in the graph until the result is represented in the graph the final graph can be the explanation of the scenario. With the naive algorithm, monotonic scenario reasoning problem can be solved in dense knowledge environment.", "paper_title": "Problem Solving by soaking the concept network", "paper_id": "WOS:000295127500013"}
