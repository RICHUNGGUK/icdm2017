The EM algorithm, which is another learning algorithm giving a maximum likelihood estimator, is also suffering from its slow convergence, which often appears when the component overlap is large. We analyze the dynamics of the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures around singularities and show that there exists a slow manifold caused by a singular structure, which is closely related to the slow convergence of the EM algorithm. We also conduct numerical simulations to confirm the theoretical analysis. Through the simulations, we compare the dynamics of the EM algorithm with that of the gradient descent algorithm, and show that their slow dynamics are caused by the same singular structure, and thus they have the same behaviors around singularities.", "paper_title": "Singularity and Slow Convergence of the EM algorithm for Gaussian Mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000263384200004"}
