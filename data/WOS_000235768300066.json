In model level fusion, a new audio-visual correlative model (AVCM) based on DBN is proposed, which describes both the intercorrelations and loose timing synchronicity between the audio and video streams. The experiments on the CMU database and our own homegrown database both demonstrate that the methods can improve the accuracies of audiovisual bimodal speaker identification at all levels of acoustic signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR) from 0dB to 30dB with varying acoustic conditions.", "paper_title": "Multi-level fusion of audio and visual features for speaker identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300066"}
