In this new scenario, four stability definitions (solution concepts) are proposed: 1) alpha-Nash stability; 2) (alpha, beta)-metarationality; 3) (alpha, beta)-symmetric metarationality; and 4) (alpha, beta, gamma)-sequential stability. We deal with conflicts that involve two or more DMs. Relationships between these definitions are demonstrated, as well as an analysis of how the values of the parameters alpha, beta, and. influence the set of stable states is made. Applications of the proposed model to conflicts involving two and three DMs are presented. The analysis of these applications highlights the advantages gained by allowing individuals to express their preferences probabilistically.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Preferences in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000351545900005"}
