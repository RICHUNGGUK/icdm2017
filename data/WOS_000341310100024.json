Introduce an artificial boundary and find the exact and approximate artificial boundary conditions for the given problem, which lead to a bounded computational domain. Using the exact or approximating boundary conditions on the artificial boundary, the original problem is reduced to an initial-boundary-value problem on the bounded computational domain which is respectively equivalent to or approximates the original problem. A finite difference method is used to solve the reduced problems on the bounded computational domain. The numerical results demonstrate that the method given in this paper is effective and feasible.
