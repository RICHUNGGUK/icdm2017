It is based on the analysis of disparity maps obtained from a stereo vision system which is carried by the blind user. The presented detection method consists of a fuzzy logic system that assigns a certainty to be part of a free path to each group of pixels, depending on the parameters of a planar-model fitting. We also present experimental results on different real outdoor scenarios showing that our method is the most reliable in the sense that it minimizes the false positives rate.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Free Path Detection from Disparity Maps by Using Least-Squares Fitting to a Plane", "paper_id": "WOS:000338347900009"}
