By using application-domain knowledge, as opposed to OS-level or hardware-level inferred knowledge, Chameleon can substantially reduce CPU energy consumption. By exporting the energy management to the user space, designers can design more flexible and easily portable algorithms and systems and use multiple energy management policies simultaneously. Our experiments show that, compared to the traditional systemwide CPU voltage scaling approaches, Chameleon can achieve up to 32 percent to 50 percent energy savings while delivering comparable or better performance to applications. Similarly, Chameleon extracts 9 percent to 41 percent more energy when compared to Grace OS, which uses some application knowledge but operates within the kernel.", "paper_title": "Chameleon: Application-level power management", "paper_id": "WOS:000256780400006"}
