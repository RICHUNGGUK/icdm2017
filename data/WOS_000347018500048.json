A system of algebraic constraint equations is formulated and then efficiently solved for the two/three-contact configuration between two planar B-spline curves. The result is essentially the same as the generation of configuration space obstacle for a moving curve (with translation and rotation) against a stationary curve. The two-contact motion can be characterized as the intersection curve in the boundary of the configuration space obstacle. The topology of the reconstructed solution is guaranteed to be correct up to a prescribed tolerance and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using several test examples of continuous contact motion among planar freeform smooth geometric models.
