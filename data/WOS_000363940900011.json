The circuit is based on a bandgap reference voltage that achieves the temperature compensation of resistor by the negative temperature coefficient (TC) of a high-resistance polysilicon (HR poly) resistor with the positive TC of an n-well resistor. The low line regulation current mirror is implemented by using a negative feedback connected operational amplifier. Prototypes of 1 mu A current reference from 0.35 mu m CMOS process show a maximum temperature coefficient of 139 ppm/A degrees C for a temperature range of 0-80 A degrees C. The line regulation is reduced to 0.5 %/V for supply voltage of 3.5 to 5.5 V.", "paper_title": "Adjustable CMOS Current Reference with Low Line Regulation Current Mirror", "paper_id": "WOS:000363940900011"}
