We first propose a Poisson distribution based method to determine the weight vector associated with a time-weighted averaging (TWA) operator. Furthermore, we use a hybrid weighted aggregation (HWA) operator to fuse all individual decision information into group opinions at different stages, and then utilize the TWA operator to aggregate the derived group opinions at different stages into the complex group ones so as to rank the given alternatives. After that, we further investigate MS-MAGDM problems where all decision information at different stages cannot be given in exact numerical values, but value ranges can be obtained. An approach based on the uncertain time-weighted averaging (UTWA) operator and the uncertain hybrid weighted aggregation (UHWA) operator is developed for solving MS-MAGDM problems under interval uncertainty. Finally, a practical example is provided to illustrate the developed approaches.", "paper_title": "APPROACHES TO MULTI-STAGE MULTI-ATTRIBUTE GROUP DECISION MAKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000286224800006"}
