However, GPS signal is unavailable in the application of deep space exploration and indoor robot control. In such circumstances, image-based methods are very important for self-position and orientation of moving platform. Therefore, this paper firstly introduces state of the art development of the image-based self-position and orientation method (ISPOM) for moving platform from the following aspects: 1) A comparison among major image-based methods (i.e., visual odometry, structure from motion, simultaneous localization and mapping) for position and orientation; 2) types of moving platform; 3) integration schemes of image sensor with other sensors; 4) calculation methodology and quantity of image sensors. Then, the paper proposes a new scheme of ISPOM for mobile robot - depending merely on image sensors. It takes the advantages of both monocular vision and stereo vision, and estimates the relative position and orientation of moving platform with high precision and high frequency. In a word, ISPOM will gradually speed from research to application, as well as play a vital role in deep space exploration and indoor robot control.", "paper_title": "Image-based self-position and orientation method for moving platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000317632400001"}
