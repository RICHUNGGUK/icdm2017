It is necessary to develop new mobility management schemes for the future Internet. This paper proposes an Identifiers Separating and Mapping Scheme (ISMS), which is a candidate for the future Internet mobility management, and discusses the basic principles and detailed message flow. ISMS is a network-based mobility management scheme that takes advantage of the identity and location separation. The mobility entities in the core network are responsible for the location management. ISMS is designed to satisfy the requirements of faster handover, route optimism, advanced management, location privacy and security. The average handover delay of ISMS is oil the order of milliseconds only, which is far smaller than that of Mobile IPv6. Analyses show that ISMS can reduce packet overhead on wireless channels. We build a prototype and perform some experiments. Results verify the feasibility of ISMS. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
