A new intra prediction approach is proposed based on synthesizing two neighboring predictors. These two predictors are selected from different prediction directions and then the predicted block is generated by combining the two predictors using different weights. The weights for the predictors do not need to be saved, so the bit rate can be greatly reduced. The main contributions of this paper are proposing the following: 1) a highly efficient way and high compact compression to select the proper predictors; 2) a weight estimation method for the predictors; and 3) a reversible weight restoration method for the predictors to save the bit rate in the decoding phase. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms H.264/AVC and HEVC in intra prediction by 11.79% and 3.6%, respectively, in bitrate reduction.", "paper_title": "Predictive Texture Synthesis-Based Intra Coding Scheme for Advanced Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000359583000011"}
