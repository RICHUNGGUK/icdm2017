Given four pieces of polynomial curves which enclose a simple region in the plane, the algorithm first constructs a Bezier patch which interpolates the four curves (as its four boundary curves), while the inner control points of its control grid remain unknown. In this paper, we show that. for the bijective condition to be satisfied, it is sufficient that the interior points satisfy a set of quadratic inequality equations. Exploiting this key result, we formulate the mapping algorithm as an optimization problem where the constraints are the bijective condition of the Bezier patch mapping (BPM), and the objective is to find out the best from all of the non-self-overlapping grids. Thus, commercial optimization solvers can be used to find the bijective mapping. If a solution to the optimization problems exists, then so does a solution to the mapping problem. and vice-versa. The BPM method is simple and intuitive, and some examples presented in this paper demonstrate its effectiveness. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
