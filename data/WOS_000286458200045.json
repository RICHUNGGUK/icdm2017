The objective of this study is to deal with some new properties of T-independent fuzzy variables. First of all, for any general t-norm, some criteria of T-independence are discussed for fuzzy variables under possibility, necessity and credibility measures. Subsequently, on the basis of left continuous t-norms, some formulas are derived on the \"max\" and \"min\" operations of the T-independent fuzzy variables in possibility distribution and in expectation. Finally, making use of continuous Archimedean t-norms, several convergence properties are discussed for T-independent fuzzy variables in credibility and in expectation, respectively, and some laws of large numbers are proved as well.
