Supporting QoS guarantees in the interdomain setting has been receiving more research attention recently. Most of the proposals for interdomain QoS routing has focused on a link-state protocol and/or a single QoS metric. Our proposal differs from the existing work in the literature in three major ways: (1) our approach is based on a distance-vector protocol, similar to BGP; the de facto interdomain routing protocol in the Internet, (2) we consider both bandwidth and delay simultaneously unlike the other studies which either considered one metric or made the decision on only one of metrics even when they disseminated more than one metric, and (3) we use a line segment to represent the domain level QoS information. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first proposal in the literature that models the domains by a line segment for inter-domain QoS routing purposes under a distance-vector routing protocol to find a path that satisfy both bandwidth and delay requirements.
