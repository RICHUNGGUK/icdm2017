Besides the advantage of reducing the computation time, the proposed EDM method makes it unnecessary to treat the boundary condition on the surface or the interface of the multilayered dielectric body. However, the EDM method is incapable of saving memory. In this case, the adaptive modified characteristic basis function (AMCBF) method is introduced and combined with the EDM method. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the merits of this EDM-AMCBF method. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
