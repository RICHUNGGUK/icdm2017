As a result of account sharing, service providers lose revenue, underestimate membership, and have impaired understanding of their customers. A generic framework for detecting account sharing is proposed, using keystroke dynamics. Starting with the observation that a user's keystroke patterns are consistent and distinct from those of other individuals, it is assumed that each user's keystroke patterns form a \"cluster\" in Euclidean space. The number of sharers can be estimated by the number of clusters. In this paper, the \"optimal\" number of clusters is estimated based on the Bayesian model-selection framework with Gaussian mixture models obtained using the variational Bayesian approach. In a case study involving 25 passwords and 16 users, the proposed approach performed well in \"sharing detection,\" with a 2 percent false alarm rate, a 2 percent miss rate, and a \"total user estimation\" error of 7 percent. The proposed approach is viable and merits further investigation.", "paper_title": "Account-Sharing Detection Through Keystroke Dynamics Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000273862500005"}
