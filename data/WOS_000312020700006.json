It also implements a hardware-based logging mechanism and error-correcting code (ECC) for improving dependability. The system on a chip (SOC), memory modules, and thermal and voltage sensors are integrated into the system in a package (SIP). Results demonstrate that this multifaceted approach could realize distributed real-time systems with dependability.", "paper_title": "THE DEPENDABLE RESPONSIVE MULTITHREADED PROCESSOR FOR DISTRIBUTED REAL-TIME SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312020700006"}
