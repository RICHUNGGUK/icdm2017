A pillar of such cooperative endeavor in molecular and materials science and technologies is the so-called grid empowered molecular simulator that combines the expertise of molecular science theorists (electronic structure and nuclei dynamics) and experimentalists in order to build and validate ab initio models. This line has prompted an unprecedented level of data format standardization procedures, the bridging of high throughput and high performance platforms, the assemblage of ad hoc designed virtual experiments. In addition this approach has prompted the design and development of tools allowing the evaluation of the quality of the cooperative effort produced by the members of a given research community as well as its rewards to such effort through a credit economy is reported.", "paper_title": "Cooperative modelling and design on the computing grid: data, flux and knowledge interoperability", "paper_id": "WOS:000324644000017"}
