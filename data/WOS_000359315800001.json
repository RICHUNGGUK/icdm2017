In this way, the hosts of services that are cloud-based will have access to even larger resource pools while at the same time increasing their scalability and availability by diversifying both their computing resources and the geographical locations where those resources operate from. Furthermore the increased competition between the cloud providers in conjunction with the commoditization of hardware has already led to large decreases in the cost of cloud computing and this trend is bound to continue in the future. Scientific focus in cloud computing is also headed this way with more studies on the efficient allocation of resources and effective distribution of computing tasks between those resources. This study evaluates the use of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms in the scheduling of bag-of-tasks applications in a heterogeneous cloud of clouds. The study of both local and globally arriving jobs has been considered along with the introduction of sporadically arriving critical jobs. Simulation results show that the use of these meta-heuristics can provide significant benefits in costs and performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
