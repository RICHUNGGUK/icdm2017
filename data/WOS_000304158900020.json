This problem has applications in manufacturing and mining, and also appears as a subproblem in decomposition techniques for network design and related problems. We present a new approach for determining facets of the PCKP polyhedron based on clique inequalities. A comparison with existing techniques, that lift knapsack cover inequalities for the PCKP, is also presented. It is shown that the clique-based approach generates facets that cannot be found through the existing cover-based approaches, and that the addition of clique-based inequalities for the PCKP can be computationally beneficial, for both PCKP instances arising in real applications, and applications in which PCKP appears as an embedded structure.", "paper_title": "Clique-based facets for the precedence constrained knapsack problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000304158900020"}
