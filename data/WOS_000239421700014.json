These biological findings are formalized here in a new mathematical model, called repeat-annotated phylogenetic trees (RAPT). We show that, under RAPT, the evolutionary process - including both the tree-topology as well as internal node genome orders - is uniquely determined, a property that is of major significance both in theory and in practice. Furthermore, the repeats are employed to provide linear-time algorithms for reconstructing both the genomic orders and the phylogeny, which are NP-hard problems under the classical model of sorting by reversals (SBR).", "paper_title": "On the repeat-annotated phylogenetic tree reconstruction problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000239421700014"}
