A shock causes that the system experiences one of two types of failures: type-I failure (minor failure) is rectified by a general repair, or type-II failure (catastrophic failure) is removed by an unplanned replacement. The probabilities of these two types of failures depend on the number of shocks since the last replacement. We consider a bivariate replacement policy (n,T) under which the system is replaced at planned life age T, or at the nth type-I failure, or at any type-II failure, whichever occurs first. The optimal replacement schedule which minimizes the expected cost rate model is derived analytically and discussed numerically. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
