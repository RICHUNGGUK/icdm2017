For mesh-based topology, routing algorithm appears as a set of prohibited turns. The task of designing routing algorithm is to get such a proper set of turns. However, as the network size increases it becomes very complex. Researchers have to face a huge set of 12196 candidates for 15x15 mesh network. In this paper, we present a novel methodology of designing routing algorithms based on divide-conquer approach. The contribution of this method is twofold. Firstly, system performance is significantly improved. The average packet latency of the proposed routing is decreased up to 35% over Odd-Even routing. Secondly, it has good scalability and could bring out routing algorithms for large networks within acceptable time. Researchers can carry out extensive study on routing algorithm based on them. More insight on routing algorithm could be expected in the future.", "paper_title": "A Novel NoC Routing Design Methodology Based on Divide-Conquer Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000358814100011"}
