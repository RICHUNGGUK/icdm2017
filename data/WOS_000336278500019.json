These systems consist of a dynamical system (given in the form of state space representation) and complementarity relations. We study existence, uniqueness, and nature of solutions for this system class under a passivity assumption on the dynamical part. A complete characterization of the initial states and the inputs for which a solution exists is given. These initial states are called consistent states. For the inconsistent states, we introduce a solution concept in the framework of distributions.", "paper_title": "Passivity and complementarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000336278500019"}
