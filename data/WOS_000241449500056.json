This can be achieved by using reconfigurable hardware technologies, such as high-density Field Programmable Gate Arrays, implementing an entire on-board computer on a single chip. In this paper we present a system-on-chip architecture for on-board partial run-time reconfiguration to enable system-level functional changes on-board satellites ensuring correct operation, longer life and higher quality of service.", "paper_title": "A self-reconfigurable system-on-chip architecture for satellite on-board computer maintenance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241449500056"}
