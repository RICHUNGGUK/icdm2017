Since the conventional Extended-Path-Shared Protection (EPSP) approach cannot provide 100% protection ability for this model, we propose a novel approach called Local Segment-Shared Protection (LSSP) to provide efficient survivability for this model. In our approach, LSPP first computes one inter-domain primary path for each connection request and follows to compute one intra-domain link-disjoint local segment-backup path for each primary-segment path in each single-domain, respectively, where the backup resources can be shared by different segment-backup paths if the corresponding primary-segment paths are link-disjoint. Compared with the conventional EPSP, although LSSP increases moderate backup resources consumption, it not only can provide 100% protection ability for multiple failures but also can perform much faster recovery time and easier survivable operation and management. The simulation results are shown to be promising. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
