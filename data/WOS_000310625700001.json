To know wireless interference among nodes in the network is essential to guarantee the efficiency of links scheduling protocol. This work presents a point-to-point interference measurement approach based on time division technique for large-scale low-power WSNs. We first propose an optimized time-slots assignment to reduce the time-slot requirement of interference measurement for large-scale WSNs. We then mitigate the problem of communication by using a subtree-based information distribution method. The accuracy of interference measurement is controlled by a control factor that can be specified by user based on the application requirement to achieve a tradeoff between the overhead of measuring interference and measurement accuracy. Our simulation results indicate that our approach has low-energy and-communication overhead when compared with baseline.", "paper_title": "A Point-to-Point Interference Measurement Approach for Large-Scale Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310625700001"}
