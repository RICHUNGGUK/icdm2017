In this paper, we prove that for any two distinct nodes mu, and nu, there exist m node-disjoint paths for any integer n >= 3 with 1 <= m <= 2n - 4 whose union covers all the nodes of AG(n). For any node of AG(n) has exactly 2n-4 neighbors, 2n-4 is the maximum number of node-disjoint paths can be constructed in AGn. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
