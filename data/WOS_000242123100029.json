Specifically, we derived the simple, and more accurate, approximation of the network contention level and the average size of contention window to maximize the theoretical throughput limit. In addition, we proposed the distributed fuzzy contention control (DFCC) mechanism using a fuzzy logic approach. In this paper, we propose the extension of the DFCC mechanism with a priority mechanism. To verify efficiency and robustness of our mechanism, the performance of the IEEE 802.11 standard protocol with the extension of DFCC mechanism are investigated through more realistic scenarios.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of the distributed fuzzy contention control for IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100029"}
