To achieve a high-speed and low-power operation, a reused terminating capacitor switching procedure is proposed. The proposed switching procedure halves the capacitors leading to a significant power saving over the conventional one. Moreover, the proposed architecture relaxes the settling time of DAC and subsequently improves the conversion rate. The ADC has been simulated in SMIC 65 nm 1.2 V CMOS technology. At a 1.2-V supply and 208 MS/s, the ADC consumes 2.7 mW and achieves an SNDR of 49.6 dB, an SFDR of 61.0 dB with 100 MHz inputs.", "paper_title": "An 8-bit 208 MS/s SAR ADC in 65 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000320888500013"}
