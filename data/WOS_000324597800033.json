While most SFD approaches require two or more images of the same scene captured at a fixed view point, this paper presents an efficient approach to estimate absolute depth from a single defocused image. Instead of directly measuring defocus level of each pixel, we propose to design a sequence of aperture-shape filters to segment a defocused image by defocus level. A boundary-weighted belief propagation algorithm is employed to obtain a smooth depth map. We also give an estimation of depth error. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art single-image SFD approaches both in precision of the estimated absolute depth and running time.", "paper_title": "Absolute Depth Estimation from a Single Defocused Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000324597800033"}
