Buscemi, M. Dall'Arno, M. Ozawa and V. Vedral, arXiv: 1312.4240]. Here we propose a realization scheme, that we call partial expectation values, implementing such strategy in terms of a unitary interaction with an ancillary system followed by the measurement of an observable on the ancilla. Our scheme is universal, being independent of rho, A, and B, and it is optimal in a statistical sense. Our scheme is suitable for implementation with present quantum optical technology, and provides a new way to test uncertainty relations.", "paper_title": "Universal optimal quantum correlator", "paper_id": "WOS:000351136900003"}
