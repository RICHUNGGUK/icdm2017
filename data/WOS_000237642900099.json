The storage manager used for LBS should consider the efficient and concurrent control of searching and updating operations of moving objects. Traditionally, the In-place update method with lock is used for updating records in storage manager. But, this method cannot guarantee that each transaction conflicts on the same object. Unlike this, the multi-version concurrency control is a standard technique for avoiding conflicts between reads and writes of the same object. When multi-version technique is applied to spatial database systems, search and update-transactions can access different versions individually. But, the storage will be wasted as the version of whole spatial record is needed to be stored even if only the aspatial data is updated. In multi-version based spatial record management technique, each of aspatial data versions and spatial data versions are managed separately to improve concurrency and reduce the wastage of storage.", "paper_title": "Versioning based spatial record management technique for non-blocking search operations of moving objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900099"}
