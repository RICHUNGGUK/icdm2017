The model integrates what is known about the neurobiology of human motivation and personality with knowledge about the psychometric structure of trait language and personality tests. Thus, the current model provides a principled theoretical account that is based on what is currently known about the structure and neurobiology of human personality and tightly integrates it into a computational architecture. The result is a motive-based computational model of personality that provides a psychologically principled basis for intelligent virtual agents with realistic and engaging personality.", "paper_title": "A neurobiologically inspired model of personality in an intelligent agent", "paper_id": "WOS:000240268400026"}
