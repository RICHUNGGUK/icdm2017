Industrial-quality infrared thermometers which are often used for measurement of canopy temperatures, while reliable, are not always cost effective. For this study a relatively low-cost, consumer-quality infrared thermometer was incorporated into a wireless monitoring system intended for use in plant physiological studies and in agricultural production settings. The field performance of this low-cost wireless system was compared to that of a typical research system based on an industrial-quality infrared thermometer. Performance was evaluated in terms of: reliability of data acquisition, quality of seasonal temperature measurements, seasonal stability of the consumer-quality infrared sensor, and the equivalence of temperatures measured by the consumer-quality and industrial-quality temperature sensors. Results indicate that for many common uses of plant temperature data, the two sensors provide functionally equivalent results. The cost savings and ease of use associated with the low-cost wireless temperature monitoring system present advantages over the higher-cost industrial-quality sensors which may make them a viable alternative in many agricultural settings.
