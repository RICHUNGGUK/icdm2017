Previous studies have shown that \"multihoming route control\" can improve the Internet communication performance of the multihomed stub networks significantly. In this work, we study \"multihoming route control\" among a group of multihomed stub networks that may belong to an organization and exchange large amount of data regularly. We show that greedy \"multihoming routing control\" schemes could lead to oscillations. We propose a user-optimal routing based \"multihoming routing control\" scheme that improves routing performance without causing oscillations. The proposed scheme is simpler to implement than optimal routing based approaches. We show through simulations that the proposed scheme achieves performance close to optimal routing and works well in various network conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
