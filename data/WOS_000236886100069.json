Efficiency is achieved by means of an improvement in the algorithm and data structures that applies to the whole class of motif inference algorithms based on suffix trees. An average case complexity analysis shows a gain over the best known exact algorithm for motif extraction. A full implementation was developed and made available online. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more than two times faster than the best known exact algorithm for motif extraction.", "paper_title": "RISOTTO: Fast extraction of motifs with mismatches", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100069"}
