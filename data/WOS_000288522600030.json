Rubber-line-sweep utilizes a rubber-band line to select targets by \"sweeping\" them. Line-string employs a line stroke to \"string\" targets together and select them. Coupling-with-pressure couples the two techniques with pressure as a switch mode. Experiments were conducted to compare these techniques with the standard Rubber-band box, which used a two-dimensional grid which could include varied target sizes, distances and target layouts, and which is applied by using pens as input devices. Experimental results indicate that Rubber-line-sweep, Line-string and Coupling-with-pressure show significant advantages for targets of irregular layout. Taking performance and subjective ratings together, Coupling-with-pressure outperforms the other three techniques.", "paper_title": "A STUDY OF THREE NOVEL LINE-BASED TECHNIQUES FOR MULTI-TARGET SELECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600030"}
