The proposed method uses a Kalman filter for predicting transmission rate. It used algorithm to detect shot transition information by high speed in compressed domain in order to grasp precise shot transition of video data and classified into abrupt shot transition type and gradual shot transition type. Classified information is used as factors of Kalman filter and to predict transmission rate of video data. It predicted transmission rate with 96.2 similar to 97.6% in the experiment.", "paper_title": "Transmission rate prediction of VBR motion image using the Kalman filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100012"}
