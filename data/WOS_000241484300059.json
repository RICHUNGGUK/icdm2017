We describe some improvements of CA models of pedestrian motion taking into account the real geometrical constraints induced by a specific restricted space. Also some presumable optimization problems in traffic modeling based on CA are discussed. Besides some general problems of cellular modeling are discussed which are related to the accounting of mentality of traffic participants.", "paper_title": "Some applications and prospects of cellular automata in traffic problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300059"}
