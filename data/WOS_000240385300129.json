The strategies of self-adaptive elite criterion, two-points crossover and cataclysmic mutation are employed in this algorithm to improve the performance of GA. For simplifying the computation, a complicated operating process is converted into several simple processes. A model of PEMS is also built which is conveniently applied to GA. Simulation results show that the proposed method is effective and superior to the least -mean squares (LMS) method.", "paper_title": "Parameters estimation of multi-sine signals based on genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300129"}
