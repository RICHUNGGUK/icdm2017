A laser interferometer is used to obtain the systematic error measurements of the geometrical errors, based on which an error model may be constructed and, consequently, a model-based compensation may be incorporated in the motion-control system. NNs are used to approximate the components of geometrical errors, thus dispensing with the conventional lookup table. Apart from serving as a more adequate model due to its inherent nonlinear characteristics, the use of NNs also results in less memory requirements to implement the error compensation for a specified precision compared to the use of lookup table. The adequacy and clear benefits of the proposed approach are illustrated via applications to various configurations of precision-positioning stages, including a single-axis, a gantry, and a complete XY stage.", "paper_title": "Geometrical error modeling and compensation using neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241438200008"}
