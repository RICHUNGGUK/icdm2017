Applications include in situ parameter estimation, adaptive design and control, interactive synthesis and visualization, and individuated product specification. We emphasize a new hierarchical architecture particularly well suited to the reduced basis computational paradigm: the expensive Offline stage is conducted pre-deployment on a parallel supercomputer (in our examples, the TeraGrid machine Ranger); the inexpensive Online stage is conducted \"in the field\" on ubiquitous thin/inexpensive platforms such as laptops, tablets, smartphones (in our examples, the Nexus One Android-based phone), or embedded chips. We illustrate our approach with three examples: a two-dimensional Helmholtz acoustics \"horn\" problem; a three-dimensional transient heat conduction \"Swiss Cheese\" problem; and a three-dimensional unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes low-Reynolds-number \"eddy-promoter\" problem.
