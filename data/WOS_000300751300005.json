The technique involves modeling each characteristic using response surface designs and then transforming the characteristics into a single performance measure. The traditional procedure, however, calls for estimating only the mean response: the variability among the characteristics is not considered. Furthermore, the approach typically relies on the accuracy of second-order polynomials in its estimation, which are not always suitable. This paper, in contrast. proposes a methodology that utilizes higher-order estimation techniques and incorporates the concepts of robust design to account for process variability. Several examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
