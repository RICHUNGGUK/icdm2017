Confidential data is often masked in the database or prior to release to a third party, through methods such as data perturbation. In this study, re-identification risks of three major additive data perturbation techniques were compared using two different record linkage techniques. The results suggest that re-identification risk of Kim's multivariate noise addition method is similar to that of simple noise addition method. The general additive perturbation method (GADP) has the lowest re-identification risk and therefore provides the highest level of protection. The study also suggests that Fuller's method of assessing re-identification risk may be better suited than the probabilistic record-linkage method of Winkler, for numeric data. The results of this study should be help organizations and government agencies choose an appropriate additive perturbation technique.", "paper_title": "Evaluating Re-Identification Risks of Data Protected by Additive Data Perturbation", "paper_id": "WOS:000344365300003"}
