The resulting platforms allow designers to improve the user's experience, by exploiting client-side data and computation, bidirectional client-server communication, synchronous and asynchronous events, and rich interface widgets. However, the rapid evolution of RIA technologies challenges the Model-Driven Development methodologies that have been successfully applied in the past decade to traditional Web solutions. This paper illustrates an evolutionary approach for incorporating a wealth of RIA features into an existing Web engineering methodology and notation. The experience demonstrates that it is possible to model RIA application requirements at a high-level using a platform-independent notation, and generate the client-side and server-side code automatically. The resulting approach is evaluated in terms of expressive power, ease of use, and implementability.", "paper_title": "Engineering Rich Internet Applications with a Model-Driven Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000277060300004"}
