Probabilistic models can incorporate realistic stochastic dynamics, but creating and analysing probabilistic models in a formal way is challenging. In this work, we present a stochastic model of biodiesel production that incorporates an inexpensive test of fuel quality, and we validate the model using statistical model checking, which can be used to evaluate simple or complex temporal properties efficiently. We also describe probabilistic simulation and analysis techniques for stochastic hybrid system (SHS) models to demonstrate the properties of our model. We introduce a variety of properties for various configurations of the reactor as well as results of testing our model against the properties.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic verification of a biodiesel production system using statistical model checking", "paper_id": "WOS:000337584900002"}
