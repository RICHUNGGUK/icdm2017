The mixture matrix is estimated accurately by using the relations of sensor signals in case of no noise and it is also proved in this paper, and the estimated mixture matrix is a primary column transformation of the original mixture matrix by the algorithm, through which the source signals are recovered by permutations and sign changes of their rows. In practice, they can be corrected by introducing headers in the bit-streams and differently encoding them. The algorithm is shown simple and efficient in last simulations.", "paper_title": "An efficient algorithm for blind separation of binary symmetrical signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400003"}
