Within so many different solutions, however, interoperability problems arise, which increase the interest on integrated design and management of these technologies. Pursuing these goals, this paper presents a framework which aims at promoting interoperability among DRM systems, using a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and a high-level policy modeling approach.", "paper_title": "A service-oriented framework to promote interoperability among DRM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242560000012"}
