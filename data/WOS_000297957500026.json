According to the relative theories and literature, this article builds a theoretical model of the farmer's adoption behavior of the mobile agricultural knowledge services from the angles of the adoption of mobile technology, the expectations of usefulness, communication channels, trust, the adoption intention and the adoption behavior. Based on the survey, use the exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation model to verify the above theoretical model. In conclusion, the mobile technology adoption, the expectations of usefulness effect the adoption of behavior indirectly through the adoption of intention; trust is an intermediary variable for the communication channels to impact the adoption intention then to the adoption behavior. Thereby enhancing the farmer's adoption intention, popularizing rate of mobile service in rural areas and improving the farmer's trust can enhance the intermediary role of mobile service in diffusing the knowledge of agricultural science and technology.", "paper_title": "THE STRENGTH OF TRUST: DISCUSSION ON THE INFLUENCING FACTORS OF THE CHINESE FARMERS' ADOPTION OF MOBILE AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE SERVICE", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500026"}
