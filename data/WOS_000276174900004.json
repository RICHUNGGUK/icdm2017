With a 90 deg phase shift, two mm-waves at different frequencies can be easily separated without interference. The receiver power penalty is less than 1 dB for the downlink 40 and 60 GHz mm-wave signals after transmission over 20 km of standard single-mode fiber.", "paper_title": "Multifrequency All-Optical Upconversion Without Cross Talk in a Radio-Over-Fiber System by Using an I/Q Modulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000276174900004"}
