The aim of this study is to develop and present an innovative decision-support system and cloud computing software methodology that brings together energy consultants, consumers, energy services procedures and modern web interoperable technologies. The authors propose a web-based knowledge system, using distributed cloud architecture and metering grids over ADSL broadband connections. By using some clustering algorithms and a web middleware, energy profiles over time are analysed and observed. The resulting clusters and centroids are projected and statistically analysed over time, producing a centroid-locus. Hypercube topology was used for efficient data management and software agent-based parallel analysis. The system operates efficiently on a multi-tier cloud-based middleware that generates in real-time using various service software components to the end consumers. The case study on real Greek energy measurements, for the first time in Greece, indicated a compact and efficient distributed procedure that could analyse and produce adaptive personalised information services.", "paper_title": "Web-based decision-support system methodology for smart provision of adaptive digital energy services over cloud technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000295621700004"}
