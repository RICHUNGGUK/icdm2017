These characteristics have implications for algorithms that deal with IP address aggregates, such as routing lookups and aggregate-based congestion control. Several example address structures are well modeled by multifractal Cantor-like sets with two parameters. This model may be useful for simulations; where realistic IP addresses are preferred. We also develop concise characterizations of address structures, including active aggregate counts and discriminating prefixes. Our structural characterizations are stable over short time scales at a given site, and different sites have visibly different characterizations, so that the characterizations make useful \"fingerprints\" of the traffic seen at a site. Also, changing traffic conditions, such as worm propagation, significantly alter these fingerprints.", "paper_title": "Observed structure of addresses in IP traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000243041200005"}
