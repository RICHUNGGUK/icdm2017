More specifically, the focus has been on the use of the method for the propagation of the stochastic structural responses due to the extensive amount of contributions in this context. Numerical examples presented in the literature are listed in this regard, in order to shed some light on the range of applications, especially in terms of the probabilistic dimensionality of the problem. Furthermore, the recently emerging utilization of the method within the modeling of uncertain input parameters is covered briefly. With this contribution, it is aimed to present an overview on the state-of-art of the P-C literature and the capabilities of the method.", "paper_title": "On the Capabilities of the Polynomial Chaos Expansion Method within SFE Analysis-An Overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000289682500002"}
