Typically, a lower location sampling rate contributes to a lower level of energy consumption but, in the meantime, delays the detection of boundary crossing events. Opting to enable energy-efficient boundary detection services, we propose a mobility-aware mechanism that adapts the location sampling rate to the target mobility. Results from our simulations and live experiments confirm that the proposed adaptive sampling mechanism is effective. In particular, when experimented with realistic errors measured from a live radio-frequency-based localization system, the energy consumption can be reduced significantly to 20 percent.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Boundary Detection for RF-Based Localization Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000260889600003"}
