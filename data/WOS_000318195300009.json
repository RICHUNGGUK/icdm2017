This method is based on the fuzzy bivariate Bernstein polynomials. By using fuzzy bivariate Bernstein polynomials, a 2DFFIE2 can be transformed to a dual fuzzy linear system. The error estimate of this method is presented in terms of the modulus of continuity. The proposed method is illustrated by some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Numerical Solution of Two-Dimensional Fuzzy Fredholm Integral Equations of the Second Kind Using Fuzzy Bivariate Bernstein Polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000318195300009"}
