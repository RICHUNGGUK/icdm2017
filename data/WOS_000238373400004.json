A graph G with n vertices is called a m-message broadcast graph if its broadcast time is the theoretical minimum. B-m(n) is the minimum number of edges in any m-message broadcast graph on n vertices. An m-message minimum broadcast graph is a broadcast graph G on n vertices having Bm(n) edges. This article presents several lower and upper bounds on B-m(n). In particular, it is shown that modified Knodel graphs are m-message broadcast graphs for m <= min({log n], n - 2([log n])}. From the Cartesian product of some broadcast graphs we obtain better upper bounds on B-m(n), and in some cases we can prove that B-m(n) = O(n). The exact value of B-2(2(k)) is also established.
