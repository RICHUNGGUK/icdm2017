It can operate in the grid-connected or islanded modes. In islanded mode, the voltage and frequency of the MG should be controlled by different distributed energy resources (DERs). This paper focuses on the analysis of frequency stability in an autonomous MG with renewable energy sources. In this paper, colonial competitive algorithms are used to design the DERs controllers in a cooperative manner that these controllers can keep the MG stable. Artificial neural network tool trained by Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to generate controlling signal for every controller to keep the frequency and voltage in a desired range. This paper investigates a new optimal control solution for maintaining the frequency stability in the MG, by using a combination of an ESS and load-shedding procedure. The cooperative game theory is used in this paper to model the interaction among different DERs, ESSs, and loads.", "paper_title": "Game-theoretic approach to cooperative control of distributed energy resources in islanded microgrid considering voltage and frequency stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387600010"}
