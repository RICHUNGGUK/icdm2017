The flexible plate system is first modelled and simulated via a finite difference (FD) method. Then, the validity of the obtained model is investigated by comparing the plate natural frequencies predicted by the model with the reported values obtained from literature. After validating the model, a proportional or P-type iterative learning (IL) algorithm combined with a feedback controller is applied to the plate dynamics via the FD simulation platform. The algorithms were then coded in MATLAB to evaluate the performance of the control system. An optimized value of the learning parameter and an appropriate stopping criterion for the IL algorithm were also proposed. Different types of disturbances were employed to excite the plate system at different excitation points and the controller ability to attenuate the vibration of observation point was investigated. The simulation results clearly demonstrate an effective vibration suppression capability that can be achieved using piezoelectric actuator with the incorporated self-learning feedback controller.
