The Internet-integrated wireless sensor network has recently become one of the most important service targets in IoT field. To provide secure IoT services, the IETF proposed using Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) as a de facto security protocol. In this paper, we examine problems that can happen when applying the DTLS protocol to the IoT, which comprises constrained devices and constrained networks. To solve the problems at hand, we separate the DTLS protocol into a handshake phase (i.e., establishment phase) and an encryption phase (i.e., transmission phase). Our approach enhances the performance of both device and network by using a way to delegate the DTLS handshake phase. The proposed scheme supports secure end-to-end communication despite using delegation.", "paper_title": "ESSE: Efficient Secure Session Establishment for Internet-Integrated Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360725700001"}
