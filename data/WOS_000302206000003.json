Text files can represent text documents with no loss of information, however, this information is represented in an unstructured form. Various knowledge formalisms used in different phases of Natural Language Understanding, such as lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and discourse analysis, are still unable to represent texts in structured form with no loss of information. In this paper, we define the crucial requirements for structured text representation and then, we give a brief introduction to a representation technique that fulfills all these requirements, including the basic data types and learning techniques used to create, maintain and interpret the resulting representation formalism.", "paper_title": "Representation of Texts in Structured Form", "paper_id": "WOS:000302206000003"}
