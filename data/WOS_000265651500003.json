A methodology is introduced for designing adhesive interfaces between structures using topology optimization. Structures subjected to external loads that lead to delamination are studied for situations where displacements and deformations are small. Only the effects of adhesive forces acting normal to the surfaces are considered. An interface finite element is presented that couples a penalty contact formulation and a Lennard-Jones model of van der Waals adhesive forces. Two- and three dimensional design optimization problems are presented in which adhesive force distributions are designed such that load-displacement curves of delaminating structures match target responses. The design variables describe the adhesive energy per area of the interface between the surfaces, as well as the geometry of the delaminating structure. A built-in length scale in the formulation of the adhesion forces eliminates the need for filtering to achieve comparable optimal adhesive designs over a range of mesh densities. The resulting design problem is solved by gradient based optimization algorithms evaluating the design sensitivities by the adjoint method. Results show that the delamination response can be effectively manipulated by the method presented. Varying simultaneously both adhesive and geometric parameters yields a wider range of reachable target load-displacement curves than in the case varying adhesive energy alone.", "paper_title": "Adhesive surface design using topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000265651500003"}
