We interpret classical proofs as interactive learning strategies, namely as processes going through several stages of knowledge and learning by interacting with the \"nature,\" represented by the standard interpretation of closed atomic formulas, and with each other. We obtain in this way a program extraction method by proof interpretation, which is faithful with respect to proofs, in the sense that it is compositional and that it does not need any translation.", "paper_title": "Interactive Realizers: A New Approach to Program Extraction from Nonconstructive Proofs", "paper_id": "WOS:000303047800002"}
