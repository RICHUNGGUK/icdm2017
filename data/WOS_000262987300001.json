In SCSA, multi-conformations (rather than traditional single-conformation) have received much attention, and the statistical average information on multi-conformations of side chains is determined using self-consistent mean field theory based upon side chain rotamer library. Thereby, enthalpy contributions (including electrostatic, steric, hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bond) and conformational entropy effects to the binding are investigated in terms of occurrence probability of residue rotamers. Then, SCSA was applied into the dataset of 419 HLA-A*0201 binding peptides, and nonbonding contributions of each position in peptide ligands are well determined. For the peptides, the hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions of the two ends are essential to the binding specificity, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions of all the positions ensure strong binding affinity, and the loss of conformational entropy at anchor positions partially counteracts other favorable nonbonding effects.", "paper_title": "Side-chain conformational space analysis (SCSA): A multi conformation-based QSAR approach for modeling and prediction of protein-peptide binding affinities", "paper_id": "WOS:000262987300001"}
