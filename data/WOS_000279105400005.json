Fortunately, FPGAs have the ability to reconfigure in the field and at runtime, thus providing opportunities to overcome such degradation-induced faults. This study provides a comprehensive survey of fault detection methods and fault-tolerance schemes specifically for FPGAs and in the context of device degradation, with the goal of laying a strong foundation for future research in this field. All methods and schemes are quantitatively compared and some particularly promising approaches are highlighted.", "paper_title": "Fault tolerance and reliability in field-programmable gate arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000279105400005"}
