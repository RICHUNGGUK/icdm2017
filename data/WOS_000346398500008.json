For analysis of nonlinear and outlier-contaminated data, nonlinear and robust OCPLS algorithms are required. This paper describes a free MATLAB toolbox for class modeling using OCPLS classifiers. The toolbox includes ordinary, nonlinear and robust OCPLS methods. The nonlinear algorithm is based on the Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF), and the robust algorithm is based on the partial robust M-regression (PRM). The usage of the toolbox is demonstrated by analysis of a real data set. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
