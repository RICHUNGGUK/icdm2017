We find that the traditional definition of relative localization is inappropriate for evaluating its actual overhead in localization time. To address this issue, we define a novel problem called essential localization and present the first rigorous study on the essential localizability of a wireless sensor network within a given time bound. Additionally, we propose an efficient distributed algorithm for time-bounded essential localization over a sensor network and evaluate the performance of the algorithm with analysis and extensive simulation studies.", "paper_title": "Time-Bounded Essential Localization for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317925300005"}
