This paper considers generalized optimal solution to interval linear programming problems. The new concepts of optimal solution are introduced in a more general and unified framework. Most existing optimal solution concepts of interval linear program in the literature are special cases in this framework. Necessary and sufficient conditions for checking three kinds of these newly defined optimal solutions are developed.", "paper_title": "Generalized solutions to interval linear programmes and related necessary and sufficient optimality conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000356936400006"}
