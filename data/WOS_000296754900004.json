This paper studied MAC protocols with star topology. After studying the MAC protocol based on scheduling and competition, and considering that the energy of the sink node is unlimited, we improved the traditional MAC protocol, get a new protocol-STAR MAC protocol. The new protocol uses frames to realize synchronization, in non-handshake. It can reduce the energy consumption of sensor nodes, extend network life cycle. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that STAR-MAC protocol has higher energy efficiency than the traditional MAC protocol. Experiments also show that the data packet loss rate under STAR-MAC protocol is less than 1%, which can meet the requirements of applications.", "paper_title": "A MAC PROTOCOL OF SINGLE COVERED - MULTIPLE SENSORS MONITORING SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000296754900004"}
