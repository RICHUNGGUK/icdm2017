Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) offer promising technology for safety communications. Thus, researchers try to integrate certain applications into existing research. The current survey critically examines the use of vehicular communication networks to provide green solutions. We discuss the current implementations of technology and provide a comparison from the communication perspective. This paper is meant to motivate researchers to investigate a new direction in which a network of vehicles is used to enhance total fuel and power consumption, gas emissions, and-as a result-budgets. Moreover, open issues and research directions that have only been slightly addressed, if at all, are discussed.", "paper_title": "Vehicular Networks for a Greener Environment: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000322728300021"}
