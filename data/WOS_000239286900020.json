In order to remove/reduce artifacts arising in image interpolation, such as image blur and the checkerboard effect, an edge-forming method is suggested to be applied as a postprocess of standard interpolation methods. The method is based on nonconvex nonlinear partial differential equations. The equations are carefully discretized, incorporating numerical schemes of anisotropic diffusion, to be able to form reliable edges satisfactorily. The alternating direction implicit (ADI) method is employed for an efficient simulation of the model. It has been numerically verified that the resulting algorithm can form clear edges in 2 to 3 ADI iterations. Various results are given to show the effectiveness and reliability of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Edge-forming methods for color image zooming", "paper_id": "WOS:000239286900020"}
