We address these problems via four resultants with separated variables; two of them are specializations of general multivariate resultants and the two others are specializations of determinantal resultants. We give a rigorous study in these four cases and provide new formulas in terms of Bezoutian matrix. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
