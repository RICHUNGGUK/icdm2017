This paper aims at introducing a new approach to stable feature selection algorithms. The innovation of this paper centers on a class of stable feature selection algorithms called feature weighting as regularized energy-based learning (FREL). Stability properties of FREL using L1 or L2 regularization are investigated. In addition, as a commonly adopted implementation strategy for enhanced stability, an ensemble FREL is proposed. A stability bound for the ensemble FREL is also presented. Our experiments using open source real microarray data, which are challenging high dimensionality small sample size problems demonstrate that our proposed ensemble FREL is not only stable but also achieves better or comparable accuracy than some other popular stable feature weighting methods.", "paper_title": "FREL: A Stable Feature Selection Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000356506700004"}
