This paper proposes to use a user-centered design approach to build a user level infrastructure for running Grid-enabled simulations, and reviews associated technologies. In a case study, a user infrastructure formulated by encompassing the user-centered design approach for running quantum mechanical simulation of material properties in a Grid environment is discussed.", "paper_title": "User-centered Design Practice for Grid-enabled Simulation in e-Science", "paper_id": "WOS:000277927800006"}
