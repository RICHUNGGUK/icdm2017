A host that exploits this new simple, but practical, vulnerability could cause devastating effects on the proper operation of the network protocols and hence severely degrade the performance. In this work, a misbehaving node fully cooperates by forwarding packets for other nodes and completely adheres to the proper selection of backoff intervals; however, it maliciously forces the forwarding operation to fail in order to either disrupt the route discovery process or to cause damage to existing flows routed though that node. As a result, the medium around the misbehaving node will be less congested and hence the node will obtain an increased unfair access to the channel. We use network simulations to show that such malicious misbehaviors have devastating effect on demoting the network performance and disrupting the protocol functioning. Hence, necessary extensions for existing detection systems are required to mitigate the effects of these new vulnerabilities.
