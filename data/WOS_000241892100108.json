This chip has been fabricated in 0.6-mu m mixed-signal CMOS technology. Experiment and HSPICE simulation results show that because the compact structures and high-precision of the blocks the system not only consumes little power but also can be directly tuned by the weights calculated through the software such as Matlab.", "paper_title": "A low-power CMOS analog neuro-fuzzy chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100108"}
