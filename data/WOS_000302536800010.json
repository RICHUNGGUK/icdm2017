A novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is defined to capture the characteristic of sampled-data systems, and an improved input delay approach is proposed. By the use of an appropriate enlargement scheme, new stability and stabilization criteria are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Compared with the existing results, the newly obtained ones contain less conservatism. Some illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and the significant improvement on the existing results.", "paper_title": "An Improved Input Delay Approach to Stabilization of Fuzzy Systems Under Variable Sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000302536800010"}
