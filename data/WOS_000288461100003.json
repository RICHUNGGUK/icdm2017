NLOS UV-C transmitters have a limited effective coverage and, hence, a dense node distribution is required in order to efficiently cover a large geographical area. Under this assumption, the concept of connectivity is more than important since it provides a strong indication of the network reliability and robustness. In the present study, we consider transmission with on-off keying and pulse position modulation schemes assuming both Gaussian and Poisson noise and adopt an effective experimental path loss model. Then, we evaluate the k-connectivity properties in terms of several network parameters. More precisely, we present and analyze the trade-off between node density and the degree of k-connectivity against other parameters (i.e., transmitted power, supported data rate, and error probability). The derived results are depicted using appropriate figures and tables and constitute the theoretical basis for the design and implementation of a reliable UV-C network in practice.", "paper_title": "Connectivity Issues for Ultraviolet UV-C Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000288461100003"}
