We find ourselves writing assertions involving meta-variables and capture avoidance constraints on where object-variables can and cannot occur free. Formalizing such assertions is problematic because the standard logical frameworks cannot express capture-avoidance constraints directly. In this article, we make the case for extending the logic of equality with meta-variables and capture-avoidance constraints. to obtain 'nominal algebra'. We use nominal techniques that allow for a direct formalization of meta-level assertions. while remaining close to informal practice. We investigate proof-theoretical properties. we provide a sound and complete semantics in nominal sets and we compare and contrast our design decisions with other possibilities leading to similar systems.", "paper_title": "Nominal (Universal) Algebra: Equational Logic with Names and Binding", "paper_id": "WOS:000273177000023"}
