In this paper, several combinatorial constructions for optimal variable-weight OOCs are presented explicitly. A useful recursive construction for optimal variable-weight OOCs is proposed as well. Based on these results, two new infinite classes of optimal variable-weight OOCs with Hamming weights 3 and 4 are obtained.", "paper_title": "New Classes of Optimal Variable-Weight Optical Orthogonal Codes with Hamming Weights 3 and 4", "paper_id": "WOS:000311011900006"}
