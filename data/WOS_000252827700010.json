The pricing model is specified by the three important components of the term structure of default probability, the distribution of recovery rate at default, and the default risk premium that each bank can select independently. After discussion on adjustment of the assets on B/S, we compute the parameter named the B/S-adjusted asset-debt coverage ratio to specify the distribution of recovery rate. Moreover we present some numerical illustrations based on. our model with real accounting data of Japanese non-listed companies.", "paper_title": "A bank loan pricing model based on recovery rate distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000252827700010"}
