A subset S of vertices is a dominating set if S dominates every vertex of G. A paired-dominating set is a dominating set whose induced subgraph contains a perfect matching. The paired-domination number of a graph G, denoted by gamma (pr)(G), is the minimum cardinality of a paired-dominating set in G. A subset SaS dagger V(G) is a double dominating set of G if S dominates every vertex of G at least twice. The minimum cardinality of a double dominating set of G is the double domination number gamma (x2)(G). A claw-free graph is a graph that does not contain K (1,3) as an induced subgraph. Chellali and Haynes (Util. Math. 67:161-171, 2005) showed that for every claw-free graph G, we have gamma (pr)(G)a parts per thousand currency sign gamma (x2)(G). In this paper we extend this result by showing that for ra parts per thousand yen2, if G is a connected graph that does not contain K (1,r) as an induced subgraph, then .", "paper_title": "Paired versus double domination in K (1,r) -free graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000333387600005"}
