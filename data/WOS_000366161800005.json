The widely used cross-sectional regression analysis based on expert knowledge has obvious limitations in handling problems that involve concept drift and high-dimensional data. To discover causal relations between portfolio selection factors and stock returns, and identify concept drifts of these relations, we apply a novel causal discovery technique called modified Additive Noise Model with Conditional Probability Table (ANMCPT). In evaluation experiments, we compares ANMCPT to the conventional cross-sectional analysis approach (i.e., Fama-French framework) in mining relationships between portfolio selection factors and stock returns. Results indicate that the factors selected by ANMCPT outperform the factors adopted in most previous cross-sectional researches that followed the Fama-French framework. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to compare causal inference technique with Fama-French framework in concept drift mining of stock portfolio selection factors. Our causal inference-based concept drift mining method provides a new approach to accurate knowledge discovery in stock market. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
