However, for non-homogeneous criteria, e. g., the Tsai-Wu criterion, this objective function will not maximize the failure load, when it is carried at a load which is different from the failure load. We suggest that the use of a safety factor for the objective function is more appropriate for maximizing for the faiure load. In fact we show losses of more than 40% in the load carrying capacity even when the load carrying capacity of the optimal laminate is 75% of the applied load.", "paper_title": "Optimization with non-homogeneous failure criteria like Tsai-Wu for composite laminates", "paper_id": "WOS:000248944600002"}
