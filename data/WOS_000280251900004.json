These quantities govern the rate of approximation by adaptive finite elements, when no constraint is imposed on the aspect ratio of the triangles, the simplest example being A(p)(f) = parallel to root vertical bar det(d(2) f)vertical bar parallel to Lt which appears when approximating in the L(p) norm by piecewise linear elements when 1/tau = 1/p + 1 The quantities A( f) are not semi-norms, and therefore cannot be used to define linear function spaces. We show that these quantities can be well defined by mollification when f has jump discontinuities along piecewise smooth curves. This motivates for using them in image processing as an alternative to the frequently used total variation semi-norm which does not account for the smoothness of the edges.", "paper_title": "Anisotropic Smoothness Classes: From Finite Element Approximation to Image Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000280251900004"}
