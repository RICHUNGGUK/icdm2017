A dynamic overlapped grids approach was applied to deal with the problems of a high-speed moving base bleed projectile. A high-resolution upwind scheme (AUS-MPW+) and detailed reaction kinetics model were employed to solve the chemical non-equilibrium Euler equations for dynamic grids. A typical case was calculated for the verification of the dynamic overlapped grids approach and numerical methods solving the chemical non-equilibrium flows. After good agreement was achieved, the development process of muzzle flows with high-speed moving base bleed projectile and the rapid depressurization process in the combustion chamber of base bleed unit are discussed in detail. This present numerical study confirms that complicated transient phenomena exist in the early launch stages after the base bleed projectile moves from the muzzle of cannon to the free-flight stage. The base bleed unit of projectile undergoes a strong non-steady-state rapid depressurization. This paper is a significant investigation for understanding muzzle flows with base bleed projectile and rapid depressurization in the combustion chamber of base breed unit, which can provide valuable reference data for research on combustion stability of the propellant in the combustion chamber.
