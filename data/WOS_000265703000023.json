In this paper, an adaptive scanning scheme is proposed to achieve the entropy coding gain in intra coding, where scanning patterns are updated based on the probabilistic distribution of quantized coefficients of previous macroblocks so that the consecutive zeros are located at the rear part of the scanned data stream. Simulation results show that the average bit-rate reduction is about 2.15% in common test conditions.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Scan Pattern for Quantized Coefficients in Intra Coding of H.264", "paper_id": "WOS:000265703000023"}
