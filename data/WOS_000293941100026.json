A structured and an unstructured dense-gas solver are used to ensure the reliability of the computed results for dense gas flows through a turbine cascade. The physical analysis is focused on the effect of the working fluid and its operating thermodynamic conditions on turbine performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
