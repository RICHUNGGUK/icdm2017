In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive iterative fuzzy filter for denoising images corrupted by impulse noise. It operates in two stages-detection of noisy pixels with an adaptive fuzzy detector followed by denoising using a weighted mean filter on the \"good\" pixels in the filter window. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm to be superior to state-of-the-art filters. The filter is also shown to be robust to very high levels of noise, retrieving meaningful detail at noise levels as high as 97%.", "paper_title": "Removal of High-Density Salt-and-Pepper Noise in Images With an Iterative Adaptive Fuzzy Filter Using Alpha-Trimmed Mean", "paper_id": "WOS:000344751200025"}
