While nested word automata retain many of the desirable properties of ordinary finite automata, there is no known efficient minimization algorithm for deterministic nested word automata and, interestingly, state complexity bounds for nested word automata turn out to differ significantly from the corresponding bounds for ordinary finite automata. Consequently lower bounds for the state complexity of nested word languages need to rely on fooling set type techniques. We discuss limitations of the techniques and show that, even in the deterministic case, the bounds given by the lower bound methods may be arbitrarily far away from the actual state complexity of the nested word language.
