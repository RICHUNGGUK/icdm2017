Our crowd framework systematically summarizes these improvements, extracts them into reusable strategies and categorizes them into modules by their optimization mechanisms. We introduce a number of new techniques within the modules. Strategies are compared first theoretically and then practically through amended ZDT series. We propose a sequence for module application based on the correlation between the modules. The resulting algorithms give incredible performance. Thus our crowd framework forms a new baseline for MOPSO.", "paper_title": "The crowd framework for multiobjective particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000345089400027"}
