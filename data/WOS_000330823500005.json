A*, we study infinite words with language closed under the group G. We focus on the notion of G-richness which describes words rich in generalized palindromic factors, i.e., in factors w satisfying Theta(w) = w for some antimorphism Theta is an element of G. We give several equivalent descriptions which are generalizations of known characterizations of rich words (in the terms of classical palindromes) and show two examples of G-rich words.
