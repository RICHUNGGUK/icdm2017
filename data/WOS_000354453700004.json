New sequencing technologies produce huge amounts of sequence data, which continuously increase the size of sequence databases. As a result, homology searches require large amounts of computational time, especially for metagenomic analysis. Results: We developed a fast homology search method based on database subsequence clustering, and implemented it as GHOSTZ. This method clusters similar subsequences from a database to perform an efficient seed search and ungapped extension by reducing alignment candidates based on triangle inequality. The database subsequence clustering technique achieved an similar to 2-fold increase in speed without a large decrease in search sensitivity. When we measured with metagenomic data, GHOSTZ is similar to 2.2-2.8 times faster than RAPSearch and is similar to 185-261 times faster than BLASTX.", "paper_title": "Faster sequence homology searches by clustering subsequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000354453700004"}
