Unfortunately, garment inspection still relies oil manual operation while studies oil garment automatic inspection are limited. In this paper, a novel hybrid model through integration of genetic algorithm (GA) and neural network is proposed to classify the type of garment defects. To process the garment sample images, a morphological filter. a method based oil GA to find out ail optimal structuring element, was presented. A segmented window technique is developed to segment images into several classes using monochrome single-loop rib-work of knitted garment. Four characteristic variables were collected and input into a back-propagation (BP) neural network to classify the sample images. According to the experimental results, the proposed method achieves very high accuracy rate of recognition and thus provides decision support in defect classification. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
