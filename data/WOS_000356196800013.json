The aim is to obtain a collaborative role of the different dissimilarity matrices in order to obtain a final consensus fuzzy partition. These matrices could have been obtained using different sets of variables and dissimilarity functions. This algorithm is designed to give a fuzzy partition and a vector of medoids for each fuzzy cluster as well as to learn a relevance weight for each dissimilarity matrix by optimizing an objective function. These relevance weights change at each iteration of the algorithm and are different from one cluster to another. Moreover, various tools for interpreting the fuzzy partition and fuzzy clusters provided by this algorithm are also presented. Several examples illustrate the performance and usefulness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
