Recently, rotaxanes of four different structural types, as well as donor/acceptor catenanes, have been prepared using CuAAC, attesting to its tolerance to supramolecular interactions as well. In one instance of a rotaxane synthesis, the catalytic role of copper has been combined successfully with its previously documented ability to preorganize rotaxane precursors, i.e., form pseudorotaxanes. The crystal structure of a donor/acceptor catenane formed using the CuAAC reaction indicates that any secondary [pi center dot center dot center dot pi] interactions between the 1,2,3-triazole ring and the bipyridinium pi-acceptor are certainly not destabilizing. Finally, the preparation of robust rotaxane and catenane molecular monolayers onto metal and semiconductor surfaces is premeditated based upon recent advances in the use of the Huisgen reaction for surface functionalization.", "paper_title": "Rotaxanes and catenanes by click chemistry", "paper_id": "WOS:000251832000007"}
