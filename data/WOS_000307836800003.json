The proposed model is based on two adjustment parameters used to account for the interactions between the pumps. The obtained results show a good agreement between experimental measurements and detailed numerical simulations, for different combinations of pump wavelengths and pump powers, with a processing time several times lower than the time taken by a detailed numerical model.", "paper_title": "Weighted Undepleted Pump Model for Broadband Counter-Pumped Raman Fiber Amplifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000307836800003"}
