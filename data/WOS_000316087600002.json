These games arise when players want to secure themselves from areas of potential infection. For the game-theoretic version of Multiway Cut, we prove that the price of stability is 1, i.e., there exists a Nash equilibrium as good as the centralized optimum. For the game-theoretic version of Multicut, we show that there exists a 2-approximate equilibrium as good as the centralized optimum. We also give poly-time algorithms for finding exact and approximate equilibria in these games.", "paper_title": "Strategic Multiway Cut and Multicut Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000316087600002"}
