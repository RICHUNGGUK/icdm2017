We first produce samples that concisely capture the overall expansion properties of an entire network, which we collectively refer to as the expansion signature. Using these signatures, we find a correspondence between the magnitude of maximum expansion and the extent to which a network can be efficiently searched. We further find evidence that standard graph-theoretic measures, such as average path length, fail to fully explain the level of \"searchability\" or ease of information diffusion and dissemination in a network. Finally, we demonstrate that this high expansion can be leveraged to facilitate decentralized search in networks and show that an expansion-based search strategy outperforms typical search methods.", "paper_title": "Expansion and decentralized search in complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000331973500009"}
