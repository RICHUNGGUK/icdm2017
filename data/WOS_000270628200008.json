The IDSs using the hybrid neural network can detect temporally dispersed and collaborative attacks effectively because of its memory of past events. The RBF network is employed as a real-time pattern classification and the Elman network is employed to restore the memory of past events. The IDSs using the hybrid neural network are evaluated against the intrusion detection evaluation data sponsored by U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Experimental results are presented in ROC curves. Experiments show that the IDSs using this hybrid neural network improve the detection rate and decrease the false positive rate effectively.
