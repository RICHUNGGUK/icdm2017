A lemma has been given based on Riemann-Liouville operator, which plays an important role in the stability analysis. Some sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the existence, uniqueness and the asymptotic stability of the fractional-order neural networks. An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results by using a new numerical method of fractional-order differential equations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
