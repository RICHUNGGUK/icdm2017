Form a random subgraph G(p) of G by taking each edge of G into G(p) independently and with probability p. We prove that for any constant c > 0, if p = 1+epsilon/r, then G(p) is non-planar with probability approaching 1 as r grows. This generalizes classical results on planarity of binomial random graphs.", "paper_title": "On the Non-Planarity of a Random Subgraph", "paper_id": "WOS:000322953200004"}
