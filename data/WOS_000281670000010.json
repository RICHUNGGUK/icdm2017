The notions of L-tautology and L-contradiction are introduced, and several theorems about the relations among different kinds of L-tautologies are given. From the viewpoint of uncertainty reasoning, the notion of satisfiability with certain level for a set of formulas is also defined. On this basis, the semantic consequence operation concerning a set of formulas is proposed, and the properties of semantic consequence operation and the consistency of fuzzy information are discussed.", "paper_title": "Semantic theory of finite lattice-valued propositional logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000281670000010"}
