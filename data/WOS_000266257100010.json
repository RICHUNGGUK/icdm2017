The goal of this study was to examine how software development concept thinking changes as individuals shift their mind-set to the object-oriented software development approach. The results indicate that the transition may not be as simple as a single \"aha!\" moment, but rather a series of cognitive shifts as constructs from the old mind-set are replaced by constructs in the new mind-set. In addition, this study identifies problems that may be encountered during the transition due to a lack of cognitive fit, confusion, and reverting to an inappropriate mind-set. The findings from this study may be used to decrease the learning curve and minimize the number of cognitive shifts experienced during the transition.", "paper_title": "Patterns of Transition: The Shift from Traditional to Object-Oriented Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000266257100010"}
