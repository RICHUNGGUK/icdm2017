The violation of an operational deadline leads to a failure of an RTC system. In this context, the problem arises of ensuring the required accuracy of estimating the execution time of application programs. An approach is developed for the design of iterative scheduling algorithms in which the execution times of application programs are estimated using simulation models with a different degree of detail, which ensures the required accuracy of estimating the execution time of programs. The approach can be used to design iterative algorithms of the following classes: genetic, evolutionary, simulated annealing, random-search, and locally optimal algorithms.", "paper_title": "Scheduling algorithms for real-time computing systems admitting simulation models", "paper_id": "WOS:000324396300004"}
