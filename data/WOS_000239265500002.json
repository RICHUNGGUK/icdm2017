Unlike the existing models, an appropriate term was added in the evolutionary equation. Through the Chapman-Enskog (C-E) procedure the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations with a force term can be recovered with the kinetic viscosity. Three discrete methods of the added term have been. discussed in detail. It can be proved that some existing models are the special cases of the model in this paper. We have taken the numerical simulation of the generalized Poiseuille flow driven by a constant force in a channel filled with a porous medium of porosity flow in 2D with different values of the parameters and compared the three models of different discrete schemes in the aspect of the numerical accuracy and stability.", "paper_title": "A novel scheme for force term in the lattice BGK model", "paper_id": "WOS:000239265500002"}
