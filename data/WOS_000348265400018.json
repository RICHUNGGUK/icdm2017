However, stent struts can induce stent thrombosis due to altered hemodynamics and endothelial dysfunction, and the microscopic process is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the microscale processes during the initiation of stent thrombosis. Methods: We utilized a discrete element computational model to simulate the transport, collision, adhesion, and activation of thousands of individual platelets and red blood cells in thrombus formation around struts and dysfunctional endothelium. Results: As strut height increased, the area of endothelium activated by low shear stress increased, which increased the number of platelets in mural thrombi. These thrombi were generally outside regions of recirculation for shorter struts. For the tallest strut, wall shear stress was sufficiently low to activate the entire endothelium. With the entire endothelium activated by injury or denudation, the number of platelets in mural thrombi was largest for the shortest strut. The type of platelet activation (by high shear stress or contact with activated endothelium) did not greatly affect results. Conclusions: During the initiation of stent thrombosis, platelets do not necessarily enter recirculation regions or deposit on endothelium near struts, as suggested by previous computational fluid dynamics simulations. Rather, platelets are more likely to deposit on activated endothelium outside recirculation regions and deposit directly on struts. Our study elucidated the effects of different mechanical factors on the roles of platelets and endothelium in stent thrombosis. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
