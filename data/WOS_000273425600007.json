We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of edges in an order-k Delaunay graph. We study the combinatorial structure of the set of triangulations that can be constructed with edges of this graph. Furthermore, we show that the order-k Delaunay graph is connected under the flip operation when k <= 1 but not necessarily connected for other values of k. If P is in convex position then the order-k Delaunay graph is connected for all k >= 0. We show that the order-k Gabriel graph, a subgraph of the order-k Delaunay graph, is Hamiltonian for k >= 15. Finally, the order-k Delaunay graph can be used to efficiently solve a coloring problem with applications to frequency assignments in cellular networks.", "paper_title": "ON STRUCTURAL AND GRAPH THEORETIC PROPERTIES OF HIGHER ORDER DELAUNAY GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273425600007"}
