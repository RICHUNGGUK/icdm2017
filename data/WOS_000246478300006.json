Abstractions are represented by Modal Labelled Transition Systems, which are mixed transition systems with may and must modalities. The approach permits to infer the satisfaction or refutation of safety and liveness properties expressed in the (action-based) mu-calculus. The tool supports the abstraction of states and action labels, which allows to deal with infinitely branching systems.", "paper_title": "An abstract interpretation toolkit for mu CRL", "paper_id": "WOS:000246478300006"}
