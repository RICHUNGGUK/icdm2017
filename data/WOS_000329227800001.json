These agents model their functionality as services in order to allow heterogeneous agents or other entities to interact with each other in a standardized way. Furthermore, due to the large-scale and adaptative needs of the system, traditional directory facilitators or middle-agents are not suitable for the management of agent services. This article proposes the introduction of homophily in service-oriented multi-agent systems to create efficient decentralized and self-organized structures where agents have a greater probability of establishing links with similar agents than with dissimilar ones. This similarity is based on two social dimensions: the set of services that an agent provides and the organizational roles that it plays. A second contribution is an algorithm for service discovery that it is carried out taking into account the local information that is related to the homophily between agents. The experiments compare our proposal with other proposals in distributed environments. The results show that the proposed structure and algorithm offer desirable features for service discovery in decentralized environments. Specifically, these features provide short paths and a high success rate in the service discovery process and resilience under deliberate failures.", "paper_title": "Enhancing decentralized service discovery in open service-oriented multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329227800001"}
