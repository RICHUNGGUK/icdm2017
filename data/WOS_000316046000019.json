The research shows that, for high-yield scientists, the time interval of knowledge creation activities obeys heavy-tailed distribution and embodies bursting features, with both long-time silence and intensive burst of creation activities. The time interval distribution of low-yield scientists is approximate to exponential distribution, and is often randomly and occasionally distributed. For ASFP, the spatial distribution of creation activities also embodies heavy-tailed features, where their activities are intensively confined to a certain knowledge field, and where long-distance exploration across the knowledge fields has also been made in knowledge creation activities.", "paper_title": "Transfer and distribution of knowledge creation activities of bio-scientists in knowledge space", "paper_id": "WOS:000316046000019"}
