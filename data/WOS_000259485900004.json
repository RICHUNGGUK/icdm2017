Test cases of sequential programs are generated based on condition calculation, and can be combined together to form SYN-sequences for concurrent program testing. Semantics of the language provides an infrastructure for the test case generation, and thus our method may be considered as a rigorous and systematic approach to the program testing. Compared with some formal testing methods, our method can avoid hitting state explosion problem in the test formation. Besides, the complexity analysis reveals that our method is time saving. Our method has been applied to generate test cases for PPP over ATM, a subsystem of IAD that runs data and voice over DSL. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
