Tracing an individual attack packet to its origin is an important step in defending against these attacks. For this reason, researchers have proposed several approaches for single-packet IP traceback. Packet logging is a generic technique in these methods, which results in the high overhead at routers and low traceback accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel path-based approach for single-packet IP traceback. Our approach makes use of the routing paths to set up traceback paths, instead of packet logging, so as to improve single-packet IP traceback in several dimensions: (i) our storage overhead is only related to the number of routing paths, no matter how many packets traverse on them; (ii) the number of queried routers during the traceback process is only related to the number of hops in the attack path; (iii) the false positives in attack-path construction can be negligible. We perform extensive mathematical analysis and simulations to evaluate our approach. The results show that our approach represents a step forward in preciseness and efficiency compared with the previous work.
