In this paper, we address the rebalancing problem for a MAL with seasonal demands. The rebalancing problem concerns how to reassign assembly tasks and operators to candidate stations under the constraint of a given cycle time. The objectives are to minimize the number of stations, workload variation at each station for different models, and rebalancing cost. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (moGA) is proposed to solve this problem. The genetic algorithm (GA) uses a partial representation technique, where only a part of the decision information about a candidate solution is expressed in the chromosome and the rest is computed optimally. A non-dominated ranking method is used to evaluate the fitness of each chromosome. A local search procedure is developed to enhance the search ability of moGA. The performance of moGA is tested on 23 reprehensive problems and the obtained results are compared with those by other authors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
