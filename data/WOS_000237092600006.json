With a Bandwidth Broker (BB) support in each administrative domain Differentiated Services (DiffServ) is seen as a key technology for achieving QoS guarantees in a scalable, efficient, and deployable manner in the Internet. This paper presents the design and implementation of a new Bandwidth Broker (BB) model to achieve QoS across a DiffServ domain. Our BB uses centralized network state maintenance and pipe-based intra-domain resource management schemes. The proposed model significantly reduces admission control time and minimizes scalability problems present in prior research while optimizing network resource utilization. The experimental results verify the achievements of our model.", "paper_title": "A scalable intra-domain resource management architecture for DiffServ networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237092600006"}
