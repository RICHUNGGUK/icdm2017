Method: Reports on HIS, eHealth and process support were analyzed, core problems and challenges were identified. Results and Conclusion: Health information systems are extending their scope towards regional networks and health IT infrastructures. Integration, interoperability and interaction design are still today's core problems. Additional problems arise through the integration of genetic information into the health core process. There are noticeable trends towards solutions for these problems.", "paper_title": "Expanding the scope of health information systems - Challenges and developments", "paper_id": "WOS:000242775200010"}
