In this work, we apply an inverse modelling approach to a model accounting for an aneurysm and the distal part of the circulation which can be modified using two independent stiffness parameters. For given values of these parameters, the position of the arterial wall as a function of time is calculated using a forward simulation which takes the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) into account. Using this forward simulation, the correct values of the stiffness parameters are obtained by minimizing a cost function, which is defined as the difference between the forward simulation and a measurement. The minimization is performed by means of surrogate-based optimization using a Kriging model combined with the expected improvement infill criterion. The results show that the stiffness parameters converge to the correct values, both for a zero-dimensional and for a three-dimensional model of the aneurysm.", "paper_title": "Inverse modelling of an aneurysm's stiffness using surrogate-based optimization and fluid-structure interaction simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000307721100011"}
