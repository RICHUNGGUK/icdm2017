The proposed kernels are in general nonlinear. They provide a better polarization exponent than the previously known kernels of the same dimensions. In particular, nonlinear kernels of dimensions 14, 15, and 16 are constructed and are shown to have optimal asymptotic error-correction performance. The optimality is proved by showing that the exponents of these kernels achieve a new upper bound that is developed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Binary Polarization Kernels From Code Decompositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000353515700002"}
