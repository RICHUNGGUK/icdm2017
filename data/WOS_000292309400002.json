In our method we emulate the visual abstraction of these cartoon effects by the use of Voronoi diagrams and the motion abstraction by designing relevant controlling mechanisms corresponding to each effect. Our system enables the creation of cartoon effects with minimal intervention from the animator. Through high-level initial specification, the effects are animated procedurally in the style of hand-drawn cartoons.", "paper_title": "Procedural modeling of water caustics and foamy water for cartoon animation", "paper_id": "WOS:000292309400002"}
