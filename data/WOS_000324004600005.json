For an ensemble consisting of two states, with probabilities of p and 1 - p, we prove that the mixing rate is bounded above by 4 root p(1 - p) for any Hamiltonian of norm 1. For a general ensemble of states with probabilities distributed according to a random variable X and individually evolving according to any set of bounded Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the mixing rate is bounded above by a Shannon entropy of a random variable X. For this general case we prove an upper bound that is independent of the dimension of the Hilbert space on which states in the ensemble act.", "paper_title": "UPPER BOUNDS ON MIXING RATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000324004600005"}
