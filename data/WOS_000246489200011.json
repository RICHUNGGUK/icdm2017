In the flow with cavitations, incompressible liquid and compressible vapor coexist. The phase transition in the flow results in complex thermophysical processes. In this paper, based on the primitive variables pressure, velocity and enthalpy, a preconditioned dual-time procedures is established, which can deal with unsteady flow field with cavitations. The energy equation is adopted to replace the traditional cavitational model. Roe's scheme is used to capture the disconnected surface. The examples indicate that this method can be used to capture the unsteady cavity in the flow field. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
