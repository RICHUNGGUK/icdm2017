We consider the case that the secrete behavior of the system is specified by multiple secret languages, and synthesize a maximally permissive supervisor that enforces opacity for all secret languages. We prove that, under a certain assumption on observable and uncontrollable events, a maximally permissive opacity-enforcing supervisor can be synthesized in a modular fashion.", "paper_title": "Modular Synthesis of Maximally Permissive Opacity-Enforcing Supervisors for Discrete Event Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125700023"}
