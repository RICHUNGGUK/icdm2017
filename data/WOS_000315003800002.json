First the notion of L-multialgebras is introduced and the notion of P-fuzzy relation on multialgebras is given, where P is any down directed ordered set. These notions will be applied to introduce the notions of P-fuzzy congruences and P-fuzzy strong congruences of multialgebras. Finally, the lattices of P-fuzzy and strong P-fuzzy congruence of multialgebras are constructed and basic properties of these lattices are investigated.", "paper_title": "L-Multialgebras and P-Fuzzy Congruences of Multialgebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000315003800002"}
