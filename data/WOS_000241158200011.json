Founding on very efficient data compression solutions for two-dimensional data domains, the proposed technique relies on the amenity of generating \"semantics-aware\" compressed representation of two-dimensional OLAP views extracted from multidimensional data cubes via the so-called OLAP dimension flattening process. A wide set of experimental results conducted on several kind of synthetic two-dimensional OLAP views clearly confirm the effectiveness and the efficiency of our technique, also in comparison with state-of-the-art proposals.", "paper_title": "A hierarchy-driven compression technique for advanced OLAP visualization of multidimensional data cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241158200011"}
