AmI integrates technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, implicit Human Computer Interaction, and Ubiquitous Services. Each capability of AmI systems is oriented towards assistance of humans at work, in the classroom, or even at home. In consequence, the Awl development process usually incorporates the final user since the first stages. However, having users available during all this long process is not always possible. Agent-based social simulations where the users role is played by simulated entities can be used to make the Awl development process faster and more effective. In this scenario, the modelling of CMHBs (Computational Models of Human Behaviour) is a major challenge. To address this issue, this paper proposes a methodology whose main contributions are: (1) the use of domain experts' knowledge to create CMHBs; (2) a common methodological framework to develop CMHBs by combining information obtained from sensors' perceptions and experts' experiences; and, (3) open source tools to support this development paradigm. The paper also presents a full case of study in a hospital which illustrates: the number of recommendations made by the methodology; the techniques proposed (mainly the use of ontologies and temporal reasoning); and, the potential of the methodology to model the personnel in a hospital.
