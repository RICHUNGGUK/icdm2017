Each vehicle is equipped with a standard inertial navigation system and an on-board camera only. In contrast to the traditional approach for cooperative localization, which is based on relative pose measurements, the proposed method formulates a measurement whenever the same scene is observed by different vehicles. Each such measurement is comprising of three images, which are not necessarily captured at the same time. The captured images, to which some navigation parameters are attached, are stored in repositories by some of the vehicles in the group. A graph-based approach is applied for calculating the correlation terms between the navigation parameters associated to images participating in the same measurement. The proposed method is examined using a statistical simulation and is further validated in an experiment that involved two vehicles in a holding pattern scenario. The experiments show that the cooperative three-view-based vision-aided navigation may considerably improve the performance of an inferior INS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
