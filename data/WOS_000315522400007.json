The measurement results show that the maximum frequency is 100 MHz at 0.35 V with 19 mu W power dissipation, 62 ps peak-to-peak jitter, and 3 locking cycles. When operated at 0.5 V, the measured maximal operating clock frequency is 450 MHz with 12 ps peak-to-peak jitter, 6 locking cycles and 119 mu W power dissipation. The ADDLL is fabricated with 55 nm CMOS technology, and the active area is only 0.019 mm(2).", "paper_title": "AN ULTRA LOW-VOLTAGE/POWER-EFFICIENT ALL-DIGITAL DELAY LOCKED LOOP IN 55 nm CMOS TECHNOLOGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000315522400007"}
