An important class of support measures relies on overlap graphs. A major advantage of overlap-graph based approaches is that they combine anti-monotonicity with counting the occurrences of a subgraph pattern which are independent according to certain criteria. However, existing overlap-graph based support measures are expensive to compute. In this paper, we propose a new support measure which is based on a new notion of independence. We show that our measure is the solution to a sparse linear program, which can be computed efficiently using interior point methods. We study the anti-monotonicity and other properties of this new measure, and relate it to the statistical power of a sample of embeddings in a network. We show experimentally that, in contrast to earlier overlap-graph based proposals, our support measure makes it feasible to mine subgraph patterns in large networks.", "paper_title": "An efficiently computable subgraph pattern support measure: counting independent observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000322454200009"}
