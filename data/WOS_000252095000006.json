As OXC malfunction leads to data loss or misrouting. Surveillance of OXCs is critical to network reliability. A recent OXC supervisory scheme, based on different time-delay recognition, identifies the state of the input output connection through the OXC, including any possible effect of link failure or misrouting. However, for a large-scale OXC or OXCs in cascade, this approach requires excessively long delay fibers, raising feasibility issues such as power amplification and length of surveillance period. We propose modified schemes for reducing the length of delay fibers without downgrading the performance.
