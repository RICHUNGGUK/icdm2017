In this work, we study the parameterized version of the NP-hard BICLUSTER GRAPH EDITING problem, which consists of obtaining a bicluster graph by making the minimum number of modifications in the edge set of an input bipartite graph. When at most k modifications are allowed in the edge set of any input graph (BICLUSTER(k) GRAPH EDITING problem), this problem is FPT, solvable in O(4(k) m) time by applying a search tree algorithm. It is shown an algorithm with O(4(k) + n + m) time, which uses a new strategy based on modular decomposition techniques. Furthermore, the same techniques lead to a new form of obtaining a problem kernel with O(k(2)) vertices for the CLUSTER(k) GRAPH EDITING problem, in O(n+m) time. This problem consists of obtaining a cluster graph by modifying at most k edges in an input graph. A previous FPT algorithm for this problem was presented by Gramm et al. [11]. In their solution, a problem kernel with O(k(2)) vertices and O(k(3)) edges is built in O(n(3)) time.", "paper_title": "Applying modular decomposition to parameterized bicluster editing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241482800001"}
