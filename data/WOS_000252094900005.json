The basic procedure is first to enumerate a set of candidate cycles, then to create one or several disjoint route sets for each cycle by the difficult share first method or full protection method, and finally to iteratively place FIPP p-cycles. Multiple route options are provided for each demand and standard protection efficiency is considered to choose the best FIPP p-cycle. A pseudothreshold effect of the number of candidate routes per demand to standard spare capacity cost is observed. Compared to the optimal designs, the FIPP-IJD method greatly improves solving speed without drastically reducing solution quality.
