Sequential cluster extraction means that the algorithm extracts cluster one by one. The assignment prototype algorithmis a typical clustering method for relational data. The membership degree of each object to each cluster is calculated directly from dissimilarities between objects. An entropy-based L-1-regularized possibilistic assignment prototype algorithm is proposed first to induce belongingness for a membership grade. An algorithm of sequential cluster extraction based on the proposed method is constructed and the effectiveness of the proposed methods is shown through numerical examples.", "paper_title": "On Cluster Extraction from Relational Data Using L-1-Regularized Possibilistic Assignment Prototype Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000370188200003"}
