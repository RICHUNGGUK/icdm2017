We syntactically define sub-classes of NPSDSs by restricting the occurrences of pops, pushes and deep-pushes and capture the complexity classes NP and PSPACE. Furthermore, we show that all problems accepted by program schemes of NPSDSs are in EXPTIME.", "paper_title": "On the power of deep pushdown stacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270738700002"}
