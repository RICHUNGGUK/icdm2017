This article presents the production cycle of these new interactive learning objects and the preliminary study conducted to measure the students' perception of the objects' effectiveness for learning. Three applications are described in detail in this article, namely: Panoramic Radiography: Principles and Interpretation, Gross Human Anatomy 3D Atlas and Restorative Dentistry: Virtual and Interactive Cavity Preparation. Each of these applications introduces unique elements of interactivity with the learning content, specifically designed to address hard-to-grasp concepts in their respective dental disciplines. The results of a student survey conducted post-deployment suggest that the visual and interactive features embedded in the three applications have the potential to induce positive outcomes in mediating the students' conceptualization of difficult theoretical notions.
