In this paper, we present extensions of our recently proposed marginal Fisher analysis (MFA) to address these problems. For human gait recognition, we first present a direct application of NIFA, then inspired by recent advances in matrix and tensor-based dimensionality reduction algorithms, we present matrix-based NIFA for directly handling 2-D input in the form of gray-level averaged images. For CBIR, we deal with the relevance feedback problem by extending NIFA to marginal biased analysis, in which within-class compactness is characterized only by the distances between each positive sample and its neighboring positive samples. In addition, we present a new technique to acquire a direct optimal solution for NIFA without resorting to objective function modification as done in many previous algorithms. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the USF HumanID gait database and the Corel image retrieval database. Experimental results demonstrate that NIFA and its extensions outperform related algorithms in both applications.", "paper_title": "Marginal Fisher analysis and its variants for human gait recognition and content-based image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000250241500017"}
