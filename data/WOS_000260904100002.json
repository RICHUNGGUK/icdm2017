The stability relation between ordinary and delay-integro-differential equations is given. It is shown under some suitable conditions that a delay-integro-differential equation will remain exponential stability of the corresponding ordinary differential equation. Finally, some examples with numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical result. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
