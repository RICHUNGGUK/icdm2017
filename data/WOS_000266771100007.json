The fuzzy-neural fluctuation smoothing rule is modified from the well-known fluctuation smoothing rule by improving the accuracy of estimating the remaining cycle time of a job, which is done by applying Chen's fuzzy-neural approach with multiple buckets. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, production simulation is also applied in this study. According to experimental results, incorporating a more accurate remaining cycle time estimation mechanism did improve the scheduling performance especially in reducing the average cycle times. Besides, the fuzzy-neural fluctuation smoothing rule was also shown to be a Pareto optimal solution for scheduling jobs with various priorities in a semiconductor manufacturing factory.", "paper_title": "A FUZZY-NEURAL FLUCTUATION SMOOTHING RULE FOR SCHEDULING JOBS WITH VARIOUS PRIORITIES IN A SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING FACTORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000266771100007"}
