In this work we explore a way of saving this gap for the case of the attentional processes, consisting in (1) proposing in first place a conceptual model of the attention double bottom-up/top-down organization, (2) proposing afterwards a neurophysiological model of the cortical and subcortical involved structures, (3) establishing the correspondences between the entities of (1) and (2), (4) operationalizing the model by using biologically inspired calculation mechanisms (algorithmic lateral inhibition and accumulative computation) formulated at symbolic level, and, (5) assessing the validity of the proposal by accommodating the works of the research team on diverse aspects of attention associated to visual surveillance tasks. The results obtained support in a reasonable way the validity of the proposal and enable its application in surveillance tasks different from the ones considered in this work. In particular, this is the case when linking the geometric descriptions of a scene with the corresponding activity level. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
