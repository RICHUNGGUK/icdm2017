The nonlinearities are assumed to satisfy the global Lipschitz conditions. By solving a set of certain linear matrix inequalities, an H-infinity filter is designed, which ensures both the robust stochastic stability and a prescribed H-infinity performance of the filtering error system for all admissible uncertainties. A numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the design method proposed in this article.", "paper_title": "Design of robust H-infinity filters for a class of uncertain nonlinear neutral stochastic systems with time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000286810300009"}
