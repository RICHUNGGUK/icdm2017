By time dependent processing times and group technology assumption, we mean that the group setup times and job processing times are both increasing functions of their starting times, i.e., group setup times and job processing times are both described by function which is proportional to a linear function of time. We attempt to minimize the makespan with ready times of the jobs. We show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time when start time dependent processing times and group technology are considered simultaneously. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
