However, diversity should not be measured as a static number. To better understand the fast-changing terrain, the paper aims to strongly propose using the tracking signal method to dynamically monitor the efficiency performance in regard to the future of diversity and best practices. This will allow diversity to play a more strategic role in cultivating sustainable business growth. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs the tracking signal, widely used to monitor the performance of a forecasting model, with some extension to dynamically monitor the technical efficiency due to its ability in alarming out-of-control signals. Findings - The approach is considered as a quantitative, objective and reasonable evaluation system because it can quickly alert employees with inferior performance and promote those with persistently outstanding performance. It also provides managers the right timing to find assignable causes affecting their workers' performance. Most importantly, it can be unsophisticatedly implemented in many aspects of efficiency evaluation for assisting organizations to improve their competitive power through efficiency gains and well expedite their broadly managerial decisions. Originality/value - The majority of previous researches aggregate multi-dimensional efficiencies by different weighting strategies into a single index before making their judgments. These approaches mainly focus on the first phase of the decision-making procedure by considering the efficiency in a static-state. As efficiency is time-sensitive, it should be evaluated dynamically. Thus, serving as the second phase of the procedure, the method is a complement of previous researches.", "paper_title": "Dynamically monitoring the service efficiency with tracking signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000326359500006"}
