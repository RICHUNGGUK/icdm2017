Some forms of crossover operators are more suitable to tackle certain problems than others, even at the different stages of the genetic process in the same problem. For this reason, techniques that combine multiple crossovers, called hybrid crossover operators, have been suggested as alternative schemes to the common practice of applying only one crossover model to all the elements in the Population. On the other hand, there are operators with multiple offsprings, more than two descendants from two parents, which present a better behavior than the operators with only two descendants. and achieve a good balance between exploration and exploitation.
