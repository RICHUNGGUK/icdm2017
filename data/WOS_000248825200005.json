The Web Services Choreography Description Language (WS-CDL) is a Web service specification developed by W3C, in order to provide peer-to-peer collaborations for participants from different parties. Despite the great research interests it has received during recent years, no practical or even prototype execution engine has been built for WS-CDL, which is, however, essential to test and evaluate the properties of WS-CDL when doing research on it, and also a crucial component to put WS-CDL into the application field. This paper implements an execution engine for WS-CDL, which has never been built before, and enhance its functionalities and usability by introducing six extended features into the execution engine, namely WS-CDL+. Several experiments are then done to test the functionalities and performance of the execution engine, making sure that it works properly according to the WS-CDL+ specification and its performance is acceptable. Finally, the whole paper is concluded, as well as the discussion of the application perspectives of WS-CDL/WS-CDL+.", "paper_title": "WS-CDL+ for web service collaboration", "paper_id": "WOS:000248825200005"}
