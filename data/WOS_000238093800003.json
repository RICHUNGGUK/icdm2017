It has been suggested that it would perhaps be possible to co-opt this genetic process and use it to perform arbitrary computations in vivo. Motivated by this idea, we study here some basic properties and the computational power of a formalization inspired by the template-guided recombination model of gene descrambling proposed by Ehrenfeucht, Prescott and Rozenberg. We demonstrate that the computational power of a system based on template-guided recombination is quite limited. We then extend template-guided recombination systems with the addition of \"deletion contexts\" and show that such systems have strictly greater computational power than splicing systems [1, 2].", "paper_title": "On computational properties of template-guided DNA recombination", "paper_id": "WOS:000238093800003"}
