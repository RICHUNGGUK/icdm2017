A Lagrangian-based method is then proposed for tackling this problem. We present an extension to the subgradient algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation coupled with the column generation method in order to improve the dual multipliers and accelerate its convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and it shows significant improvement compared to the greedy algorithm.", "paper_title": "Search-Based Advertising Auctions With Choice-Based Budget Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000358246900006"}
