The VLSI implementation results show a significant delay reduction and area x time(2) improvements, all this at the cost of higher power consumption, which is the main reason preventing the use of parallel-prefix adders to achieve high-speed reverse converters in nowadays systems. Hence, to solve the high power consumption problem, novel specific hybrid parallel-prefix-based adder components that provide better tradeoff between delay and power consumption are herein presented to design reverse converters. A methodology is also described to design reverse converters based on different kinds of prefix adders. This methodology helps the designer to adjust the performance of the reverse converter based on the target application and existing constraints.", "paper_title": "Reverse Converter Design via Parallel-Prefix Adders: Novel Components, Methodology, and Implementations", "paper_id": "WOS:000349420400014"}
