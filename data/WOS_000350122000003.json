The three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a finite-volume approach with a fixed Cartesian mesh. The piecewise-linear interface calculation-based volume-of-fluid method is employed to track and reconstruct the ink-air interface. A geometrical computation based on Lagrangian advection is used to compute the mass flux and advance the interface. A simple and efficient model for the bubble dynamics is employed to model the effect of ink vapor on the adjacent ink liquid. To solve the surface tension-dominated flow accurately, a hierarchical curvature-estimation method is proposed to adapt to the local grid resolution. The numerical methods mentioned earlier have been implemented in an internal simulation code, CFD3. The numerical examples presented in the study show good performance of CFD3 in prediction of surface tension-dominated free-surface flows, for example, droplet ejection in thermal inkjet printing. Currently, CFD3 is used extensively for printhead development within Hewlett-Packard.
