The core of the system is our novel joint image-noise filter which operates in both image and noise domain, and can effectively separate noise from both high and low frequency image structures. A novel user interface is introduced, which allows the user to interact with both the image and the noise layer, and apply the filter adaptively and locally to achieve optimal results. A comprehensive and quantitative evaluation shows that our interactive system can significantly improve the initial image-noise separation results. Our system can also be deployed in various noise-consistent image editing tasks, where preserving the noise characteristics inherent in the input image is a desired feature.", "paper_title": "Noise Brush: Interactive High Quality Image-Noise Separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000273315300041"}
