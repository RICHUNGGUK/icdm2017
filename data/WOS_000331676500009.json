The novelty is that the warping deformations and the eccentricity of the shear center are fully taken into account. Therefore, additional terms are introduced in the expressions of the inertia force vector and the tangent dynamic matrix. Their contribution is then investigated considering several numerical examples. Besides, the element has seven degrees of freedom at each node and cubic shape functions are used to interpolate local transverse displacements and axial rotations. The formulation's accuracy is assessed considering five examples with comparisons against 3D-solid solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
