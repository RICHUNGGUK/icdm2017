The proposed algorithms are based on a two-step procedure. First, a kernel or similarity matrix, providing a meaningful similarity measure between any couple of nodes, is computed from the adjacency matrix of the graph. Then, the nodes of the graph are clustered by performing a kernel clustering on this similarity matrix. Besides the introduction of a prototype-based kernel version of the gaussian mixtures model and Ward's hierarchical clustering, in addition to the already known kernel k-means and fuzzy k-means, a new kernel, called the sigrnoid commute-time kernel (K-CT(s)) is presented. The joint use of the K-CT(S) kernel matrix and kernel clustering appears to be quite effective. indeed, this methodology provides the best results on a systematic comparison with a selection of graph clustering and communities detection algorithms on three real-world databases. Finally, some links between the proposed hierarchical kernel clustering and spectral clustering are examined. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
