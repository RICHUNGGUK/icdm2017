It is shown that any of these systems can be transformed to a generically equivalent first order DAE system consisting of a single purely algebraic (polynomial) equation plus an under-determined ODE (a differential Kronecker representation) in as many variables as the order of the input system. This can be done by means of a Kronecker-type algorithm with bounded complexity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
