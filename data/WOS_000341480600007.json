These semi-copulas are called ortholinear (resp. paralinear) semi-copulas and their construction is based on linear interpolation on segments that are perpendicular (resp. parallel) to the diagonal of the unit square. The classes of ortholinear and paralinear (quasi-)copulas are characterized as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
