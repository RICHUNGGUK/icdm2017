Most of them can achieve high average search throughput for IPv4, but they are slow in the updating speed and cannot suit to 128 bits IPv6 address even in hardware architecture. This paper proposed a routing lookup system which contains an ASIC of routing lookup table and off-chip memory sets. In the performance analysis, 91.89% routing entries of the routing table can be searched in one memory access, and the worst case about 10% needs two memory accesses. The routing lookup system approaches 213.4 Mlps (109.26 Gb/s). It is enough to satisfy the high speed link OC-768 (40 Gb/s) with 150000 routing entries.", "paper_title": "IC design of IPv6 routing lookup for high speed networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500028"}
