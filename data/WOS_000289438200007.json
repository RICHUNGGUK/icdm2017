Double modes fuzzy control is one of multimode controls, which has two independent and different mode controllers to satisfy different control demands. The smooth switching of different controllers is the key technology in industrial application of multimode modes control. Double modes fuzzy control is used to improve the dynamic and steady-state performances of control systems. This paper focuses on the unsteady problem at switching point of controllers in double modes control system. Three structures of double modes fuzzy control systems are proposed and discussed. The design principles of multimode control are analyzed. Three different switching methods are analyzed and their feasibility is studied. The concept of smooth switching from one controller to another controller is proposed. Especially the smooth switching of fuzzy/PI double modes control is analyzed, and the corresponding fuzzy controller is designed. The simulation of smooth switching at natural switching point of fuzzy/PI double modes control system is carried out in order to prove the superiority of smooth switching at natural switching point. The results of this paper can offer effective reference for other multimode control design.", "paper_title": "The smooth switching of double modes fuzzy control", "paper_id": "WOS:000289438200007"}
