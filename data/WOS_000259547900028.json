Compared with original CFA that works in the two dimensional (2D) image space, 1D-CFA encodes the image data as vectors. In 1D-CFA, a new correlation filter called optimal extra-class origin output tradeoff filter (OEOTF), which is designed in the low-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) subspace, is proposed for effective feature extraction. Experimental results on benchmark face databases, such as FERET, AR, and FRGC, show that OEOTF based 1D-CFA consistently Outperforms other state-of-the-art face recognition methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the novel method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
