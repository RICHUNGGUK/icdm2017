This may be due to limitations in the stability of the cursor controlled by EGT devices and in the potential for unintended selections (\"clicks\"). To address these EGT limitations, we have developed a cursor control system that integrates electromyogram-based control with EGT-based control. This integrated system allows a user to perform small cursor displacements and selection operations (\"left click\") by detecting distinct changes in electromyogram (EMG) signals generated during specific facial movements. Specifically, the system monitors and processes, in real time, EMG signals from four electrodes attached to the head of the subject. We compared the performance of this EMG/EGT integrated system, with the performance of a stand-alone EGT system and a hand-held mouse, in point-and-click trials. Statistical analysis of the results indicates that the EMG/EGT system is slower than the EGT system and the mouse, but it also revealed that it is significantly less error-prone than the EGT-only system. The analysis also revealed that the performance of the EMG/EGT system does not seem to be well matched to Fitts' model.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATION OF EMG AND EGT MODALITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENHANCED CURSOR CONTROL SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000269776100004"}
