The LDA+U scheme, which accounts for electronic correlation effects, enables the accurate prediction of the magnetic superexchange constant of this strongly correlated material and its band gap at the Fermi level. The character of the band gap places the compound on the borderline between a Mott insulator and a charge transfer insulator. The size of the band gap (0.82 eV) indicates that AgSO4 is a ferrimagnetic semiconductor, and possibly an attractive material for spintronics. A bulk modulus of 27.0 GPa and a compressibility of 0.037 GPa(-1) were determined for AgSO4 from the third-order Birch-Murnaghan isothermal equation of state up to 20 GPa. Several polymorphic types compete with the ambient pressure P-1 phase as the external pressure is increased. The P-1 phase is predicted to resist pressure-induced metallization up to at least 20 GPa.", "paper_title": "Crystal and electronic structures and high-pressure behavior of AgSO4, a unique narrow band gap antiferromagnetic semiconductor: LDA(+U) picture", "paper_id": "WOS:000294735900016"}
