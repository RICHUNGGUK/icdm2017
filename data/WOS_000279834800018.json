Two unified deformable templates are introduced for single eye tracking and double eyes tracking, respectively. Each deformable template can describe both open and closed eye states. Based on the templates the particle filtering framework is applied. A dynamic model considering both the geometrical transformations and state transitions of eye/eyes is given. Furthermore, a measurement model for contour tracking is also modified to adapt for eye/eyes tracking. The experimental results show that our approach can not only track the locations of eye/eyes accurately, but also obtain the eye contour parameters simultaneously. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
