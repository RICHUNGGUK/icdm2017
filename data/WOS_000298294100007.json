In dynamic networks with bursty traffic, where long periods of silence are expected between the bursts of data, this multicast state maintenance adds a large amount of communication, processing, and memory overhead for no benefit to the application. Thus, we have developed a stateless receiver-based multicast (RBMulticast) protocol that simply uses a list of the multicast members' (e.g., sinks') addresses, embedded in packet headers, to enable receivers to decide the best way to forward the multicast traffic. This protocol, called Receiver-Based Multicast, exploits the knowledge of the geographic locations of the nodes to remove the need for costly state maintenance (e.g., tree/mesh/neighbor table maintenance), making it ideally suited for multicasting in dynamic networks. RBMulticast was implemented in the OPNET simulator and tested using a sensor network implementation. Both simulation and experimental results confirm that RBMulticast provides high success rates and low delay without the burden of state maintenance.", "paper_title": "Stateless Multicast Protocol for Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000298294100007"}
