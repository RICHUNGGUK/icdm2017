Correct localization and characterization of these structures are crucial for accurate cancer diagnosis and grading. In this paper, we introduce an effective hybrid model that employs both structural and statistical pattern recognition techniques to locate and characterize the biological structures in a tissue image for tissue quantification. To this end, this hybrid model defines an attributed graph for a tissue image and a set of query graphs as a reference to the normal biological structure. It then locates key regions that are most similar to a normal biological structure by searching the query graphs over the entire tissue graph. Unlike conventional approaches, this hybrid model quantifies the located key regions with two different types of features extracted using structural and statistical techniques. The first type includes embedding of graph edit distances to the query graphs whereas the second one comprises textural features of the key regions. Working with colon tissue images, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model leads to higher classification accuracies, compared against the conventional approaches that use only statistical techniques for tissue quantification.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Classification Model for Digital Pathology Using Structural and Statistical Pattern Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000314367100030"}
