To make full use of the capabilities of network processors, it is imperative to provide the ability to dynamically adopt to changing traffics patterns in the form of a network processor runtime system. The differences from existing operating systems and the main challenges lie in the multiprocessor nature of NPs, their on-chip resource constraints, and real-time processing requirements. In this article we explore the key design trade-offs that need to be considered when designing a network processor operating system. In particular, we explore the performance impact of application analysis on partitioning, traffic characterization, workload mapping, and runtime adaptation. We present and discuss qualitative and quantitative results in the context of a particular application analysis and mapping framework. The observations and conclusions are generally applicable to any runtime environment for network processors.", "paper_title": "Runtime support for multicore pocket processing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000248235200005"}
