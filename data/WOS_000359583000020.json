Inspired by these, this paper investigates how to realize the OpenFlow-controlled (OF-controlled) network orchestration that can facilitate efficient scalable video coding (SVC) streaming to heterogeneous clients. Specifically, we consider real-time SVC streaming and address the situation in which video sources reside in geographically-distributed servers and clients can join and leave the streaming services dynamically. We formulate this as a multi-source multi-destination manycast problem and realize the networking system with an OF-controlled SDN architecture. We first design the OF controller to enable efficient network operations. Then, we focus on solving the multi-source multi-destination SVC video manycast problem and design several algorithms. Initially, an integer linear programming (ILP) model is formulated to obtain the optimal solutions for small-scale problems. Next, we try to make the manycast algorithm suitable for practical implementation, and design two time-efficient heuristics. Simulation results indicate that the heuristics can provide close-to-optimal solutions. Finally, we build an OF network testbed that consists of OF switches, SVC video servers and clients, and perform SVC streaming experiments to demonstrate our design. Experimental results verify that the proposed scheme can allocate bandwidth intelligently and ensure high-quality video streaming. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that accomplishes experimental demonstration of OF-controlled network orchestration for adaptive SVC video manycast.", "paper_title": "Demonstration of OpenFlow-Controlled Network Orchestration for Adaptive SVC Video Manycast", "paper_id": "WOS:000359583000020"}
