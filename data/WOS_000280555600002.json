It is shown that the two points with maximum distance provide an optimal solution for the 2-maxian problem of block graphs except for K (3). It can easily be extended to the p-maxian problem of block graphs. So we solve the p-maxian problem on block graphs in linear time.", "paper_title": "The p-maxian problem on block graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000280555600002"}
