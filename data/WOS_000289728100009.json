This year, we attended again. Our contest contribution was implemented by a student during a university course using the current version of our agent framework. Unlike the gold mining scenario of MAPC 2007, this year's cow herding scenario had higher complexity and was a very good testbed to evaluate our new agent framework.", "paper_title": "MOO-MicroJIAC agents operating oxen", "paper_id": "WOS:000289728100009"}
