The approach presented was used to simulate a specific soft matter system. We found the performed simulations to be in excellent accordance with previous theoretical and simulation studies. By taking advantage of the shortened processing time, we were also able to find new micro- and macroscopic properties of this system. Furthermore we analyzed analytically the effects of the spatial discretization introduced by the Lattice Monte Carlo algorithm. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
