For these codes and with a particular choice of an interleaver, we give an upper bound on the decoding error probability of a linear-programming based decoder which is an inverse polynomial in the block length. Our bound is valid for any memoryless, binary-input, output-symmetric (MBIOS) channel. This result generalizes the bound derived by Feldman et al., which was for regular RA(2) codes.", "paper_title": "ERROR BOUNDS FOR REPEAT-ACCUMULATE CODES DECODED VIA LINEAR PROGRAMMING", "paper_id": "WOS:000296590400001"}
