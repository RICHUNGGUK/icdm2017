The characteristics of (1) user's publishing and downloading behaviors, (2) the life span of the torrent and (3) user's downloaded, uploaded amount are addressed in the paper. Our main contributions are: (1) the distribution of users publishing characteristics has a flat head which is similar to that of user's information fetch behaviors, but cannot be explained by the well-known fetch-at-most-once principle. An indirect selection model is proposed to explain the phenomenon. (2) The lifetime y of a torrent file is tightly correlated with user's interests x (the number of fetches) (3) Distributions of user's downloaded amount and uploaded amount are essentially different. Approximately the former is exponential but the latter is power-law. The Cobb-Douglas like utility (CDLU) function is applied to study the relationship between them and a simple bound is found in user's CDLU.", "paper_title": "Modeling information-sharing behaviors in BitTorrent system based on real measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200102"}
