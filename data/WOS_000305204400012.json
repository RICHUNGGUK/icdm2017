To enhance the performance of the power analysis attack, we propose a preprocessing method based on extracting encryption-related parts from the measured power signals. Experimental results show that the attacks with the preprocessed signals detect correct keys with much fewer signals, compared to the conventional power analysis attacks.", "paper_title": "Performance Improvement of Power Analysis Attacks on AES with Encryption-Related Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000305204400012"}
