Later, Yang enhanced Tallini-Bose code by using quasi 2-OSN codes. Both 2-OSN codes encode the information word into a balanced word and then append extra bits to make the length of this balanced word equal to 0 (or 2) modulo 4. The main innovation is to eliminate the need for appended bits, thereby increasing the code rate.", "paper_title": "Reducing Code Length of Second-Order Spectral-Null Code", "paper_id": "WOS:000348053400015"}
