Empirical testing of loci developed from two reptile taxa confirmed that our methodology yields markers with comparable amplification rates and nucleotide diversities to ANLs developed using other methodologies. Our approach capitalizes on next-generation sequencing technologies to enable the development of phylogenetic, phylogeographic and population markers for taxa lacking suitable genomic resources.", "paper_title": "Anonymous nuclear loci in non-model organisms: making the most of high-throughput genome surveys", "paper_id": "WOS:000306136100001"}
