User modeling is a practical means of enabling personalization; one important method to construct user models is that of Bayesian networks. To identify the Bayesian network structure variables and the prior probabilities, empirical experimentation is adopted and context, content, and user preferences are the salient variables. User data collected from the survey are used to set the prior probabilities for the Bayesian network. Experimental evaluation of the system shows it is effective in improving user attitude toward mobile advertising.
