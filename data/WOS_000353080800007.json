The alternative is to deploy rechargeable mesh routers using renewable energy sources. In this paper, we study the rechargeable router placement problem for a green mesh network. The problem is formulated as an optimization with the objective of minimizing the number of deployed routers, while fulfilling QoS requirements on wireless coverage, traffic demand, energy efficiency and user fairness. Specifically, we introduce the network failure rate to evaluate the network performance and adopt the proportional fairness-based approach to do the cell association between users and routers. We first propose two cell association algorithms from two perspectives: the Nearest Cell Association Algorithm (NCA) for energy efficiency consideration and the Proportional Fairness Cell Association Algorithm (PFCA) to achieve a balance between the network performance and the user fairness. We then design two heuristic placement algorithms embedded with the proposed cell association methods to find approximate solutions for the rechargeable router placement problem. Simulation results verify that the proposed PFCA algorithm can guarantee the user fairness with a slight increase of deployment cost. Furthermore, compared with the optimal placement achieved by exhaustive search, ours can achieve good performance with greatly reduced computation complexity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
