This integrated simulation software will be able to perform multiphase simulations from the wellbore to the surface facilities. The purpose of this paper is to define, in a CAPE-OPEN compliant environment. a numerical and computational strategy for solving pressure-driven steady-state simulation problems, i.e. pure simulation and design problems, in the specific context of hydrocarbon production and transport from the wellbore to the surface facilities.
