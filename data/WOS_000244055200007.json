Our protocol costs almost zero classical communication and less qubits than that in the standard protocols. Since the bit value of the expanded key is deterministic, this protocol can also be used for direct communication. Our protocol includes the authentication steps, therefore, we do not worry about the case that Alice and Bob are completely isolated.", "paper_title": "An efficient protocol for secure and deterministic quantum key expansion", "paper_id": "WOS:000244055200007"}
