At each time step, one has to solve a Helmholtz equation in a domain which consists in some hundreds of millions of cells. To solve this huge linear system, we use an iterative Krylov method preconditioned by a separable matrix. The corresponding linear system is solved with a block cyclic reduction method. Some enlightenments on the parallel implementation are also given. Lastly, numerical results are presented including some features concerning the scalability of the numerical method on a parallel architecture. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
