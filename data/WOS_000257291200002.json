In particular, an approach based on the generalized linear mixed model setting is presented for formulating ordered categorical counts in stratified contingency tables. Deletion diagnostics and their first-order approximations are developed for assessing the stratum-specific influence on parameter estimates in the models. To illustrate the proposed model diagnostic technique, the method is applied to analyze two sets of data: a clinical trial and a survey study. The two examples demonstrate that the presence of influential strata may substantially change the results in ordinal contingency table analysis.", "paper_title": "Influence diagnostics for stratified ordinal contingency tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000257291200002"}
