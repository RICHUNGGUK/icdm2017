Existing research results have been focusing on the single-hop model which is not suitable for wireless multi-hop networks. In addition, the conditions of related system model are too idealistic. To address these limitations, we herein investigate the performance of a wireless multi-hop network, focusing on the one-to-many flows. Firstly, a system model with multi-hop delay was constructed; secondly, the transmission schemes of system model were gradually improved in terms of practical conditions such as limited queue length and asynchronous forwarding way; thirdly, the mean delay and the mean throughput were quantified in terms of coding window size K and number of destination nodes N for the wireless multi-hop transmission. Our findings show a clear relationship between the multi-hop transmission performance and the network coding parameters. This study results will contribute significantly to the evaluation and the optimization of network coding method.", "paper_title": "Throughput-Delay Analysis of One-to-Many Wireless Multi-Hop Flows based on Random Linear Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000325220300011"}
