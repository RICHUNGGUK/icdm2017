The quadrotor system is divided into four subsystems; that is, the longitudinal, lateral, yaw, and height subsystems. Then, a linear and decoupled nominal model is obtained for each subsystem, whereas coupling and nonlinear dynamics, parametric perturbations, and external disturbances are considered as uncertainties. For each subsystem, a decoupled robust controller is then proposed. Although there exist coupling between each channel, the output tracking errors of the four subsystems are proven to ultimately converge into a-priori set neighborhood of the origin. Finally, real-time implementation results of the decoupled controller are given to demonstrate its viability and applicability.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Implementation of Decoupled Controllers for Multirotor Aircrafts", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400014"}
