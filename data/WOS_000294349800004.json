This is the case for applications such as the processing of financial documents in which errors can be very costly and therefore far less tolerable than rejections. This paper presents a new approach based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reject less reliable classifier outputs. To implement the rejection, which can be considered a two-class problem of accepting the classification result or otherwise, an LDA-based measurement is used to determine a new rejection threshold. This measurement (LDAM) is designed to take into consideration the confidence values of the classifier outputs and the relations between them, and it represents a more comprehensive measurement than traditional rejection measurements such as First Rank Measurement and First Two Ranks Measurement. Experiments are conducted on the CENPARMI database of numerals, the CENPARMI Arabic Isolated Numerals Database, and the numerals in the NIST Special Database 19. The results show that LDAM is more effective, and it can achieve a higher reliability while maintaining a high recognition rate on these databases of very different origins and sizes.", "paper_title": "Rejection measurement based on linear discriminant analysis for document recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000294349800004"}
