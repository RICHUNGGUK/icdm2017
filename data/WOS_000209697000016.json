By utilizing data samples as well as pilots, the proposed algorithm provides substantially higher estimation accuracy than the conventional training-based least squares (LS) estimator without incurring a significant computational cost. Simulation results also show that it performs very close to the corresponding semi-blind Cramer-Rao bound.", "paper_title": "EM-Based Semi-Blind Channel Estimation in Amplify-and-Forward Two-Way Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697000016"}
