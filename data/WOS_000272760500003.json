Simplicity of the equation and of its numerical scheme allows us to discuss in detail as the development of the adjoint model and assimilation results. It is shown what kind of errors can be corrected by this control and how these errors are corrected. This study is carried out in view of using this control to identify optimal numerical schemes in coastal regions of ocean models. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
