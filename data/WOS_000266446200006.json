We prove that, except the 8 linear rules, there is no correlation-immune rule among the 256 rules. Thus, elementary cellular automata cannot be used as a cryptographic pseudo-random generator since the generated pseudo-random sequences are susceptible of correlation attacks. We conclude with some remarks on cryptography with cellular automata.", "paper_title": "A Walsh Exploration of Elementary CA Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000266446200006"}
