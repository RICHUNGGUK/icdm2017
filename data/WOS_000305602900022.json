It was found that the groups -N-3 and -N=N- are effective structural units for improving the HOF values of the di-1,3,5-triazine derivatives. The effects of the substituents on the HOMO-LUMO gap combine with those of the bridge groups. The calculated detonation velocities and detonation pressures indicate that substituting the -ONO2, -NF2, or -N=N- group is very useful for enhancing the detonation performance of these derivatives. Analysis of the bond dissociation energies for several relatively weak bonds suggests that most of the derivatives have good thermal stability. On the whole, the -NH2, -N-3, -NH-, and -CH=CH- groups are effective structural units for increasing the thermal stabilities of the derivatives. Based on detonation performance and thermal stability, nine of the compounds can be considered potential candidates for high energy density materials with reduced sensitivity.", "paper_title": "Design and selection of nitrogen-rich bridged di-1,3,5-triazine derivatives with high energy and reduced sensitivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000305602900022"}
