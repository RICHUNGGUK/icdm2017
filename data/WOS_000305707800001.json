This system involves complex nonlinear dynamic equations that have not been completely worked out yet. In conventional modeling procedures, a large number of the involved parameters are crossed out and an approximation model is presented instead. Therefore, the performance of the obtained model is very important and an inaccurate model may cause many problems in the design of a controller. This study presents a Takagi-Sugeno (TS)-type fuzzy system called a wavelet projection fuzzy inference system (WPFIS) in which a dimension reduction section is used at the input stage of the fuzzy system. In order to clarify the structure of the extracted features, structural learning with forgetting (SLF) based on Minkowski norms is proposed. In addition, gradient descent (GD) was used as a training algorithm. The results show that the proposed method has higher performance in comparison with conventional models. The data collected from Saveh White Cement Company were used in our simulations.", "paper_title": "Design of a Prediction Model for Cement Rotary Kiln Using Wavelet Projection Fuzzy Inference System", "paper_id": "WOS:000305707800001"}
