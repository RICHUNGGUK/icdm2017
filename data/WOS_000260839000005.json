However, their applications are only limited to noise-free mixtures, which is not realistic. Therefore, this paper addresses the extraction of the noisy model based on these temporal characteristics of sources. An objective function, which combines Gaussian moments and generalized autocorrelations, is proposed. Maximizing this objective function, we present a blind source extraction algorithm for noisy mixtures. Simulations on synthesized signals, images, artificial electrocardiogram (ECG) data and the real-world ECG data show the better performance of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, comparisons with the existing algorithms further indicate its validity and also show its robustness to the estimated error of time delay.", "paper_title": "Blind Source Extraction for Noisy Mixtures by Combining Gaussian Moments and Generalized Autocorrelations", "paper_id": "WOS:000260839000005"}
