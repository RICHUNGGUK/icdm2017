In the context of molecular simulation, such networks are handled through the Coulombic interactions. Therefore, a good set of partial atom charges (PACs) for simulations involving PVA is highly desirable. In this work, we calculated the PACs for PVA using a few commonly used population analysis schemes with a hope to identify an accurate set of PACs for PVA monomers. To evaluate the quality of the calculated parameters, we have benchmarked their predictions for free energy of solvation (FES) in selected solvents by molecular dynamics simulations against the ab initio calculated values. Selected solvents were water, ethanol and benzene as they covered a range of size and polarity. Also, PVA with different tacticities were used to capture their effect on the calculated FESs. Based on our results, neither PACs nor FESs are affected by the chain tacticity. While PACs predicted by the Merz-Singh-Kollman scheme were close to original values in the OPLS-AA force field in way that no significant difference in properties of pure PVA was observed, free energy of solvation calculated using such PACs showed greater agreement with ab initio calculated values than those calculated by OPLS-AA (and all other schemes used in this work) in all three solvents considered.", "paper_title": "Effect of partial atomic charges on the calculated free energy of solvation of poly(vinyl alcohol) in selected solvents", "paper_id": "WOS:000349970900022"}
