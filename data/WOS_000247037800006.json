In this paper, we propose another, more physical, viewpoint on this topic in order to understand the possible failure of discretisation procedures and the way to fix it. Three basic examples, the logistic equation, the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and Newton's law for planetary motion, are worked out. They illustrate the deep difference between continuous-time evolutions and discrete-time mappings, hence shedding some light on the more general duality between continuous descriptions of natural phenomena and discrete numerical computations.", "paper_title": "Discrete-time and continuous-time modelling: some bridges and gaps", "paper_id": "WOS:000247037800006"}
