In the discussed case, four stress-classes were identified using cascade forward neural network (CASFNN) which performed consistently with minimal intra- and inter-subject variability. Task-induced stress-trends were tracked using Triggs' Tracking Variable-based regression model with CASFNN configuration. The proposed framework will enable proactive initiation of rescue and relaxation procedures during accidents and emergencies.", "paper_title": "Assessment of Driver Stress from Physiological Signals collected under Real-Time Semi-Urban Driving Scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000343408700008"}
