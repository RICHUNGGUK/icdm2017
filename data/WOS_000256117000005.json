Our codes for n users that are epsilon-secure against c pirates have length O(c(2) log(n/epsilon)). This improves the codes proposed by Boneh and Shaw [1998] whose length is approximately the square of this length. The improvement carries over to works using the Boneh-Shaw code as a primitive, for example, to the dynamic traitor tracing scheme of Tassa [2005]. By proving matching lower bounds we establish that the length of our codes is best within a constant factor for reasonable error probabilities. This lower bound generalizes the bound found independently by Peikert et al. [2003] that applies to a limited class of codes. Our results also imply that randomized fingerprint codes over a binary alphabet are as powerful as over an arbitrary alphabet and the equal strength of two distinct models for fingerprinting.", "paper_title": "Optimal probabilistic fingerprint codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000256117000005"}
