The approach makes use of non-homogeneous high-order sliding-mode controllers and differentiators. A criterion of the differentiator convergence is developed for the detection of a proper time of turning on the controller. A gain adaptation strategy is proposed for both controller and differentiator. The performance with noisy discrete sampling is studied.", "paper_title": "Robust exact finite-time output based control using high-order sliding modes", "paper_id": "WOS:000295462000002"}
