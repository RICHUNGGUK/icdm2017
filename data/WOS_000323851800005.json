Most topic models are either unsupervised or fully supervised. In this paper, to take advantage of both limited labeled training images and rich unlabeled images, we propose a novel regularized Semi-Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (r-SSLDA) for learning visual concept classifiers. Instead of introducing a new complex topic model, we attempt to find an efficient way to learn topic models in a semi-supervised way. Our r-SSLDA considers both semi-supervised properties and supervised topic model simultaneously in a regularization framework. Furthermore, to improve the performance of r-SSLDA, we introduce the low rank graph to the framework. Experiments on Caltech 101 and Caltech 256 have shown that r-SSLDA outperforms both unsupervised LDA and achieves competitive performance against fully supervised LDA with much fewer labeled images.
