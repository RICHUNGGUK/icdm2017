This paper shows how the meme-media architecture is applied to the Web to provide such support for us. This makes the Web work as a shared repository not only for publishing intellectual resources, but also for their collaborative reediting. We will propose a general framework for clipping arbitrary Web contents as live objects, for defining 10 ports on such a clip, and for the recombination and linkage of such clips based on both the original and some user-defined relationships among them. In our previous works, we proposed two separate frameworks for these three purposes; one works for the first two, and the other for the last. Here we will propose a unified framework for these three purposes, as well as its detailed internal mechanisms. Then we show how it can be easily applied to various legacy Web applications to develop innovative services.", "paper_title": "Meme media for clipping and combining Web Resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000238261700002"}
