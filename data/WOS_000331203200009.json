However, pure l(infinity)-optimized image coding, colloquially known as near-lossless image coding, is prone to structured errors such as contours and speckles if the bit rate is not sufficiently high; moreover, most of the previous l(infinity)-based image coding methods suffer from poor rate control. In contrast, the l(2) error metric aims for average fidelity and hence preserves the subtlety of smooth waveforms better than the l(infinity) error metric and it offers fine granularity in rate control, but pure l(2)-based image coding methods (e.g., JPEG 2000) cannot bound individual errors as the l(infinity)-based methods can. This paper presents a new compression approach to retain the benefits and circumvent the pitfalls of the two error metrics. A common approach of near-lossless image coding is to embed into a DPCM prediction loop a uniform scalar quantizer of residual errors. The said uniform scalar quantizer is replaced, in the proposed new approach, by a set of context-based l(2)-optimized quantizers. The optimization criterion is to minimize a weighted sum of the l(2) distortion and the entropy while maintaining a strict l(infinity) error bound. The resulting method obtains good rate-distortion performance in both l(2) and l(infinity) metrics and also increases the rate granularity. Compared with JPEG 2000, the new method not only guarantees lower l(infinity) error for all bit rates, but also it achieves higher PSNR for relatively high bit rates.", "paper_title": "l(2) Optimized Predictive Image Coding With l infinity Bound", "paper_id": "WOS:000331203200009"}
