However, the existing schemes for evaluating the Gaussian Copula PDF are all computationally-demanding and generally the most time-consuming part in the corresponding applications. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based design to accelerate the computation of the Gaussian Copula PDF. Specifically, the evaluation of the Gaussian Copula PDF is mapped into a fully-pipelined FPGA dataflow engine by using three optimization steps: transforming the calculation pattern, eliminating constant computations from hardware logic, and extending calculations to multiple pipelines. In the experiments on 10 typical large-scale data sets, our FPGA-based solution shows a maximum of 1870 times speedup over a well-tuned single-core CPU-based solution, and 610 times speedup over a well-optimized parallel quad-core CPU-based solution when processing two-dimensional data.", "paper_title": "A Fully Pipelined Probability Density Function Engine for Gaussian Copula Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000364486500010"}
