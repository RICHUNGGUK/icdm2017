Since the cache subsystem is typically the most power/energy-consuming subsystem, caches are good candidates for power/energy optimizations, and therefore, cache tuning techniques are widely researched. This survey focuses on state-of-the-art offline static and online dynamic cache tuning techniques and summarizes the techniques' attributes, major challenges, and potential research trends to inspire novel ideas and future research avenues.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Cache Tuning from a Power/Energy Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000321212300008"}
