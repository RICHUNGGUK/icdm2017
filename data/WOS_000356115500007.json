The present paper suggests that in many contexts, the three characteristics of trustworthiness are non-linearly related to trusting behaviors and tests this idea via a multi-method approach (two laboratory experiments and a qualitative organizational study). The results of the three studies strongly support the validity and usefulness of the non-linear relationship hypothesized between ability, benevolence, and integrity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
