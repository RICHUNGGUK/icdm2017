This study analyzes chemical features common to P450 19 inhibitors to develop ligand-based, selective pharmacophore models for this enzyme. The HipHop and HypoRefine algorithms implemented in the Catalyst software package were employed to create both common feature and quantitative models. The common feature model for P450 19 includes two ring aromatic features in its core and two hydrogen bond acceptors at the ends. The models were used as database search queries to identify active compounds from the NCI database.", "paper_title": "Pharmacophore modeling and in silico screening for new P450 19 (aromatase) inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000237658400040"}
