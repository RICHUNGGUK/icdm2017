Unfortunately, it also introduced unusual complexity which results in many serious issues that cannot be resolved without new more adequate development methods and electronic design automation tools for the system-level design. This paper discusses the problem of an efficient model-based multi-objective optimal architecture synthesis for complex hard real-time embedded systems, when using as an example a system-level architecture exploration and synthesis method that we developed.
