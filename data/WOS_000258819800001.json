A general continuous-time formulation and time-domain numerical methods are described. The applications of the oscillator sensitivity analysis in design optimization, macromodeling, as well as in analyzing the impact of process variations are demonstrated through examples.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity analysis for oscillators", "paper_id": "WOS:000258819800001"}
