However, the mechanisms and social contexts through which network effects induce technology adoption are unclear. In this paper, we investigate the adoption of household computers using the dataset from the 1989-2003 Computer and Internet Supplement to the Current Population Surveys (CPS). We argue that social influence and learning play a dominant role in inducing the adoption of home computers, and workplaces and schools are important channels through which network effects take place. We find that recent adopters have a stronger impact than distant adopters on future computer adoptions. When the adoption rate is low, channels play a more important role, but their effects diminish as the adoption rate grows. We also find that diffusion channels are more effective for first-time adoption than for repeat purchases. Overall, our study provides important theoretical, policy, and managerial implications.
