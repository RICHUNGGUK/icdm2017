Here, the requirements on a(t) and b(t) are more relaxed than those in previous works. For example, a(t), b(t), and a(t) - b(t) are not necessarily nonnegative. We prove that when <(tau) over bar> is small, the asymptotic stability of x(t) can be obtained if the time average of a(t) - b(t) on some fixed length T is lower bounded by some positive delta. And we explicitly give the upper bound of (tau) over bar .We also give two applications of the theoretical results. First, we consider self synchronization in Hopfield networks with time varying connections. Then we investigate consensus in networks with time varying topologies and arbitrary coupling weights. In both applications, we extend some of our previous works where time delays are not considered. At last, two numerical examples with simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
