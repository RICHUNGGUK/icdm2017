An example on approximation by fat arcs, provided by Qun and Rokne, is corrected. The third derivative of the given curve segment under the polar coordinate system is increasing only at the beginning of the curve segment, and then decreasing, rather than monotonically increasing for the whole curve segment. Some numerical data are corrected as well. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "An example on approximation by fat arcs and fat biarcs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237998000009"}
