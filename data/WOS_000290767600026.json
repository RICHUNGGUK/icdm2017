However, MIP also has its inherent limitation, the loss of spatial context and shape information. This paper proposes a novel technique, shape-enhanced maximum intensity projection (SEMIP), to resolve this limitation. Inspired by lighting in DVR to emphasize surface structures, SEMIP searches a valid gradient for the maximum intensity of each viewing ray, and applies gradient-based shading to improve shape and depth perception of structures. As SEMIP may result in the pixel values over the maximum intensity of the display device, a tone reduction technique is introduced to compress the intensity range of the rendered image while preserving the original local contrast. In addition, depth-based color cues are employed to enhance the visual perception of internal structures, and a focus and context interaction is used to highlight structures of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SEMIP with several volume data sets, especially from the medical field.", "paper_title": "Shape-enhanced maximum intensity projection", "paper_id": "WOS:000290767600026"}
