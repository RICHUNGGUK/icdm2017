In comparison with fuzzy preference relations, the use of intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations in decision making is limited, which is mainly due to the computational complexity associated to using membership degree, non-membership degree and hesitation degree to model experts' subjective preferences. In this paper, the set of reciprocal intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations and the set of asymmetric fuzzy preference relations are proved to be mathematically isomorphic. This result can be exploited to use methodologies developed for fuzzy preference relations to the case of intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations and, ultimately, to overcome the computation complexity mentioned above and to extend the use of reciprocal intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations in decision making. In particular, in this paper, this isomorphic equivalence is used to address the presence of incomplete reciprocal intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations in decision making by developing a consistency driven estimation procedure via the corresponding equivalent incomplete asymmetric fuzzy preference relation procedure. Additionally, the hesitancy degree of the reciprocal intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation is used to introduce the concept of expert's confidence from which a group decision making procedure, based on a new aggregation operator that takes into account not only the experts' consistency but also their confidence degree towards the opinion provided, is proposed.
