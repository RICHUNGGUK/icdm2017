In this paper, we significantly extend the applicability of this approach towards much larger systems by effectively solving the computational bottleneck of these methods, the diagonalization step and associated large-scale eigenproblem, on a small cluster of nodes equipped with multicore technology. Our experiments show the superior performance of iterative Krylov-subspace methods for the solution of the dense generalized eigenproblems arising in these biological applications over more traditional direct solvers implemented on top of state-of-the-art libraries. The presented approach expedites the study of the collective conformational changes of large macromolecules opening a new window for exploring the functional motions of such relevant systems.
