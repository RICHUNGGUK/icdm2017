It provides a performance overhead evaluation using current workloads, along with an analysis of AccB's scalability with the number of threads and workload input set size. It demonstrates that AccB is in the range of 2x to 11x faster than these two tools. Finally, it shows the complete proof that AccB is complete in that, for every static data race present in a program, there exists an instruction interleaving that would expose this data race such that AccB can detect it.", "paper_title": "Data Race Detection with Minimal Hardware Support", "paper_id": "WOS:000336044400002"}
