Most of the earlier investigations focus on the dimension and shape optimization or on the topology optimization along the axial direction. An important problem in beam section design is to find the location and direction of stiffeners, for the introduction of a stiffener in a closed beam section may result in a topologically different configuration from the original; the existing section shape optimization theory cannot be used. The purpose of this paper is to formulate a section topology optimization technique based on an anisotropic beam theory considering warping of sections and coupling among deformations. The formulation and corresponding solving method for the topology optimization of beam cross-sections are proposed. In formulating the topology optimization problem, the minimum averaged compliance of the beam is taken as objective, and the material density of every element is used as design variable. The schemes to determine the rigidity matrix of the cross-sections and the sensitivity analysis are presented. Several kinds of topologies of the cross-section under different load conditions are given, and the effect of load condition on the optimum topology is analyzed.", "paper_title": "Topology optimization of beam cross-section considering warping deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000254206600002"}
