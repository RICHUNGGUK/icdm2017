The purpose of this paper is describing the necessary extensions which will allow MPQF to manage metadata modelled with Semantic Web languages like RDF and OWL, and query constructs based on SPARQL. The suggested modifications include the definition of a new MPQF query type, and a generalization of the MPQF metadata processing model. As far as we know, this is the first work to apply the MPEG Query Format to semantic-driven search and retrieval of multimedia contents.", "paper_title": "Semantic-driven multimedia retrieval with the MPEG Query Format", "paper_id": "WOS:000277643600011"}
