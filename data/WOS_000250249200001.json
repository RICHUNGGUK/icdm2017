The fault-tolerant processor tested is characterized by per-cycle voting of microarchitectural and the flop-based architectural states, redundancy at the pipeline level, and a distributed voting scheme. Its fault-tolerant behavior is characterized for three different workloads from the automotive application domain. The study proposes statistical methods for both the single and dual fault injection campaigns and demonstrates the fault-tolerant capability of both processors in terms of fault latencies, the probability of fault manifestation, and the behavior of latent faults.", "paper_title": "Study of the effects of SEU-induced faults on a pipeline-protected microprocessor", "paper_id": "WOS:000250249200001"}
