During the initial stage of the nonlinear system operation, adaptive approximation is used for online learning of the modeling uncertainty. Then, local sensor fault detection and isolation (SFDI) modules are designed using a dedicated nonlinear observer scheme. The multiple sensor fault isolation process is enhanced by deriving a combinatorial decision logic that integrates information from local SFDI modules. The performance of the proposed diagnostic scheme is analyzed in terms of conditions for ensuring fault detectability and isolability. A simulation example of a single-link robotic arm is used to illustrate the application of the adaptive approximation-based SFDI methodology and its effectiveness in detecting and isolating multiple sensor faults.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Approximation for Multiple Sensor Fault Detection and Isolation of Nonlinear Uncertain Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000328946500012"}
