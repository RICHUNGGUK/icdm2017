One method used in location management is to designate sonic of the cells in the network as \"reporting cells\". The other cells in the network are \"non-reporting cells\". Finding an optimal set of reporting cells (or reporting cell configuration) for a given network. is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. In fact this is shown to be an NP-complete problem. in an earlier study. In this paper, we use the selective paging strategy and use an ant colony optimization method to obtain the best/optimal set of reporting cells for a given a network.", "paper_title": "ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION FOR REPORTING CELL PLANNING IN MOBILE COMPUTING USING SELECTIVE PAGING STRATEGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000269685400012"}
