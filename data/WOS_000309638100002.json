This paper presents simulation models using only commonplace spreadsheet software to analyze and compare strategies in such pairings based on actual or estimated performance of individual players. The approach can be a useful decision support tool for captains and coaches of competing teams in collegiate conferences, club leagues, or international sport tournaments.", "paper_title": "Spreadsheet-Based Simulation Models for Decision Support: Case of Strategic Pairings in Sport Tournaments with Match Play for Team Competition", "paper_id": "WOS:000309638100002"}
