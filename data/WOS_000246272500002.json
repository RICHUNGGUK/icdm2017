We model movement of qubits with noisy SWAP operations. For this architecture we design a fault-tolerant coding scheme using the concatenated [[7,1, 3]] Steane code. Our scheme is potentially applicable to ion-trap and solid-state quantum technologies. We calculate a lower bound oil the noise threshold for our local model using a detailed failure probability analysis. We obtain a threshold of 1.85 x 10(-5) for the local setting, where memory error rates are one-tenth of the failure rates of gates, measurement, and preparation steps. For the analogous nonlocal setting, we obtain a noise threshold of 3.61 x 10(-5). Our results thus show that the additional SWAP operations required to move qubits in the local model affect the noise threshold only moderately.", "paper_title": "Noise threshold for a fault-tolerant two-dimensional lattice architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000246272500002"}
