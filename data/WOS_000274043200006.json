However, it seems there is not much investigation on identification of coexistent load and damage, although in practice they usually exist together. This paper presents a methodology to solve this problem based on the Virtual Distortion Method. A damaged structure is modeled by an equivalent intact structure subjected to the same loads and to virtual distortions which model the damages. The measured structural response is used to identify the loads, the distortions and to recover the stress-strain relationship of the damaged elements. This way both the damage type and extent are identified. The approach can be used off-line and online by repetitive applications in a moving time window. A numerical experiment of a truss with 5% measurement error validates that the two tested damage types (constant stiffness reduction and breathing crack) can be identified along with the loads.", "paper_title": "Identification of coexistent load and damage", "paper_id": "WOS:000274043200006"}
