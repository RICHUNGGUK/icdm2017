To face this problem, learning algorithms must conciliate essential, but difficult to gather, attributes like good classification performance, stability and low associated costs, like processing time and memory. This paper presents an extension of the K-associated optimal graph learning algorithm to cope with classification over non-stationary domains. The algorithm relies on a graph structure consisting of many disconnected components (subgraphs). Such graph enhances data representation by fitting locally groups of data according to a purity measure, which, in turn, quantifies the overlapping between vertices of different classes. As a result, the graph can be used to accurately estimate the probability of unlabeled data to belong to a given class. The proposed algorithm is benefited from the dynamical evolution of the graph by updating its set of components when new data is presented along time, by removing old components as new components arise. Experimental results on artificial and real domains and further statistical analysis show that the proposed algorithm is an effective solution to non-stationary classification problems.
