The system utilizes data mining, clustering analysis, and statistical tools for clustering students according to their online learning behaviors, learning achievements, and thinking styles. It also provides graphical time stamps for teachers to observe the online activities of students at each learning phase. By using this system, teachers can apply different remedial strategies according to the different online learning behaviors of students. The students in this study received adaptive warning messages and remedial treatments according to their individual learning situations. The results revealed that the proposed strategy can encourage students whose online learning performances are initially evaluated as good or medium and improve their online learning performances. In the case of students with poor online learning performances, this system improves not only their performances but also their learning achievements. This is achieved by continuously dispatching adaptive warning messages to the students in question. The relationship between thinking styles and online learning achievements is also considered in this study. It is indicated that a strategy of sending adaptive warning messages also works well on students with different thinking styles. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
