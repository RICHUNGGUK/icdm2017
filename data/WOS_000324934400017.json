Unfortunately, when users register their personal interests to the brokers, the privacy pertaining to filters defined by honest subscribers could be easily exposed by untrusted brokers, and this situation is further aggravated by the collusion attack between untrusted brokers and compromised subscribers. To protect the filter privacy, we introduce an anonymizer engine to separate the roles of brokers into two parts, and adapt the k-anonymity and l-diversity models to the content-based pub/sub. When the anonymization model is applied to protect the filter privacy, there is an inherent tradeoff between the anonymization level and the publication redundancy. By leveraging partial-order-based generalization of filters to track filters satisfying k-anonymity and l-diversity, we design algorithms to minimize the publication redundancy. Our experiments show the proposed scheme, when compared with studied counterparts, has smaller forwarding cost while achieving comparable attack resilience.", "paper_title": "Toward Efficient Filter Privacy-Aware Content-Based Pub/Sub Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000324934400017"}
