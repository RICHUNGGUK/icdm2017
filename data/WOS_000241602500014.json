The method is based on classical results of F. Gehring and Y. Vaisala regarding the existence of quasi-conformal and quasi-isometric mappings between Riemannian manifolds. A random starting triangle version of the algorithm is presented. A curvature based version is also applicable. In addition the algorithm enables the user to compute the maximal distortion and dilatation errors. Moreover, the algorithm makes no use to derivatives, hence it is robust and suitable for analysis of noisy data. The algorithm is tested on data obtained from real CT images of the human brain cortex and colon, as well as on a synthetic model of the human skull.", "paper_title": "Quasi-conformal flat representation of triangulated surfaces for computerized tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000241602500014"}
