A stream of general arrivals observe the current state of the system on arrival and choose which queue to join to minimize their own expected transit time. We show that for each set of parameter values there exists a unique user equilibrium policy and that it possesses various monotonicity properties. User equilibrium policies for probabilistic routing are also discussed and compared with the state-dependent setting.", "paper_title": "Monotonicity properties of user equilibrium policies for parallel batch systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298880800005"}
