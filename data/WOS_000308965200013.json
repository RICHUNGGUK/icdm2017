The inverse optimal controller is based on passivity theory. The applicability of the proposed approach is illustrated via simulations for an unstable nonlinear system and a planar robot.", "paper_title": "Discrete-Time Neural Inverse Optimal Control for Nonlinear Systems via Passivation", "paper_id": "WOS:000308965200013"}
