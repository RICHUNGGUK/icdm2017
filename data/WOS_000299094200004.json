We show that the state complexity of the former combined operation is considerably less than the mathematical composition of the state complexities of catenation and union, while the state complexity of the latter one is equal to the mathematical composition of the state complexities of catenation and intersection.", "paper_title": "STATE COMPLEXITY OF TWO COMBINED OPERATIONS: CATENATION-UNION AND CATENATION-INTERSECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000299094200004"}
