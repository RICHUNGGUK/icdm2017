This paper combines the two methods for face recognition. We first project the face images into a PCA subspace, then project the results into a much lower-dimensional LDA subspace, and then use an NNSRM classifier to recognize them in the LDA subspace. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined method can achieve a better performance than NN by selecting different distances and a comparable performance with SVM but costing less computational time.", "paper_title": "Face recognition using an NNSRM classifier in LDA subspace", "paper_id": "WOS:000250121300009"}
