We show that probabilistically connected five-qubit quantum registers suffice for deterministic, fault-tolerant quantum computation even when state preparation, measurement, and entanglement generation all have substantial errors. We discuss requirements for achieving fault-tolerant operation for two specific implementations of our approach.", "paper_title": "SCALABLE QUANTUM NETWORKS BASED ON FEW-QUBIT REGISTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194600003"}
