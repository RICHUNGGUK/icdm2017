In this paper, an enhanced approach of remote sensing image based on orthogonal wavelet analysis and pseudo-color image processing is presented. Enhanced remote sensing image has been greatly improved in both visual effects and noise characteristics. The method is simple yet flexible with less calculation. Moreover, the proposed method also has the advantages of faster computing speed and operating feasibly and so on. It has great potential in research and application of remote sensing image enhancement.", "paper_title": "Remote Sensing Image Enhancement Based on Orthogonal Wavelet Transformation Analysis and Pseudo-color Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000285930800005"}
