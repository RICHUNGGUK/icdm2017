At first, we recall a classification of dynamic increase of information with respect to three different factors: objects, attributes, values. Then, the corresponding changes in rough sets are discussed. Results about approximations, positive region and generalized decision are given and algorithms to update reducts and rules provided.", "paper_title": "Temporal Dynamics in Information Tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000302777200005"}
