Least-squares problems are well studied and widely used but exhibit immanent drawbacks such as high sensitivity to outliers. For this reason, we consider techniques for the registration of point clouds and surface fitting to point sets based on the l(1)-norm. We develop algorithms to solve l(1)-registration and l(1)-fitting problems and explore the emerging non-smooth minimization problems. We describe efficient ways to solve the optimization programs and present results for various applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
