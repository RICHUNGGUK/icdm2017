A new kind of wireless sensors equipped with a camera and a microphone has been emerging recently. This kind of sensor is called wireless multimedia sensor (WMS) because it can capture and process multimedia data such as image, sound, and video. The visual monitoring network is a typical scenario of WMS application. Massive data would be produced in a short time because of the intensive WMS deployment. Many data aggregation and compression technologies have been proposed for addressing how to transfer data efficiently. However, data aggregation technologies need highly efficient router algorithm, and compression algorithms might consume more computation time and memory because of the high complexity. This paper applies data deduplication technology to this scenario. It can eliminate the redundant data from raw data to exploit the network bandwidth efficiently. Moreover, a chunking algorithm with low computation complexity is presented in this paper, and its efficiency has been proved through the experiments.", "paper_title": "Data Deduplication in Wireless Multimedia Monitoring Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000328396900001"}
