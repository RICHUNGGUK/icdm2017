There is an increasing need of using methods with solid mathematical and statistical foundation in astronomical image processing. Where the computational methods are serving in all disciplines of science, they are becoming popular in the field of astronomy as well. Currently different computational systems are required to be numerically optimized before to get applied on astronomical images. So at present there is no single system which solves the problems of astronomers using computational methods based on modern approaches. The system \"Finding Satellite Tracks\" is based on geometric matching method \"Recognition by Adaptive Subdivision of Transformation Space (RAST)\".", "paper_title": "Satellite tracks removal in astronomical images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400092"}
