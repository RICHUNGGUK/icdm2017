This study employed a two-phase design based methodology. The first phase was a cognitive task analysis of a convenience sample (n = 10) of preservice and in-service science teachers in which they described their key issues and concerns regarding chemical laboratory safety planning, response, management plan, and assessment. Phase 2 examined the usability and effectiveness of STIMULATE's initial build on 31 preservice teachers. The t-test for equality of means demonstrates that there is a statistically significant difference between pretest and post-test scores, t(30) = 14.79, p<.001, d = 2.56 (large) Overall, results suggest positive learning gains from the preservice science teachers who engaged in STIMULATE program.
