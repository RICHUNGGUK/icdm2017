Our research is motivated, for example, by the emerging needs of elderly care, health care, safety, and logistics. We have developed a distributed system for affective human-robot interaction which combines all the basic sensory elements and can collaborate with a smart environment and obtain further knowledge from the Internet. The realized HRI robot, Minotaurus, runs in real time and is capable of interacting with human beings. Minotaurus forms a rather generic platform for experimenting with human-robot collaboration in different applications and environments.", "paper_title": "Minotaurus: A System for Affective Human-Robot Interaction in Smart Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000345994900024"}
