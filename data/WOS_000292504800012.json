Such transportation systems should have characteristics such as mobility, convenience and being accident-free. Ubiquitous-intelligent transportation systems (U-ITS) are next generation of intelligent transportation system (ITS). The key issue of U-ITS is providing better and more efficient services by providing vehicle to vehicle (V2V) or vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) interconnection. The emergence of cyber physical systems (CPS), which focus on information awareness technologies, provides technical assurance for the rapid development of U-ITS. This paper introduces the ongoing Beijing U-ITS project, which utilizes mobile sensors. Realization of universal interconnection between real-time information systems and large-scale detectors allows the system to maximize equipment efficiency and improve transportation efficiency through information services.", "paper_title": "Applied research of data sensing and service to ubiquitous intelligent transportation system", "paper_id": "WOS:000292504800012"}
