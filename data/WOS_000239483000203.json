This paper first discusses the feasibility of application unsupervised neural networks to the BIT system and the representative Generalized LVQ (GLVQ) neural network is selected due to its good performance in clustering analysis. Next, we adopt a new form of loss factor to modify the original GLVQ algorithm in order to make it more suitable for our application. Since unsupervised networks cannot distinguish the similar classes, we add a LVQ layer to the GLVQ network to construct a hybrid neural network model. Finally, the proposed method has been applied to the intelligent BIT system of the MEAEPS, and the results show that the proposed method is promising to improve the performance of the BIT system.", "paper_title": "Intelligent built-in test (BIT) for more-electric aircraft power system based on hybrid generalized LVQ neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000203"}
