This hybrid technique incorporates concepts from chemical reaction optimization and particle swarm optimization, it creates new molecules (particles) either operations as found in chemical reaction optimization or mechanisms of particle swarm optimization. Moreover, some technical bound constraint handling has combined when the particle update in particle swarm optimization. The effects of model parameters like InterRate, gamma, Inertia weight and others parameters on performance are investigated in this paper. The experimental results tested on a set of twenty-three benchmark functions show that a hybrid algorithm based on particle swarm and chemical reaction optimization can outperform chemical reaction optimization algorithm in most of the experiments. Experimental results also indicate average improvement and deviate over chemical reaction optimization in the most of experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
