Results: A freely available package, MTide, was developed by combining modified miRDeep2 and CleaveLand4 with some other useful scripts to explore MTI in a comprehensive way. By searching for targets of a complete miRNAs, we can facilitate large-scale identification of miRNA targets, allowing us to discover regulatory interaction networks.", "paper_title": "MTide: an integrated tool for the identification of miRNA-target interaction in plants", "paper_id": "WOS:000347832300028"}
