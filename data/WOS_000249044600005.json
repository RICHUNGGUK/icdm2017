With this technique an optical signal can be set in either of the optical input wavelengths by appropriate choice of the powers of the input signals. Switching of a signal beam by another control beam at different wavelength is reported experimentally with a 1550 nm distributed feedback semiconductor optical amplifier. Also, a theoretical model has been generated to analyze the wavelength switching operation with a novel amplifier type - the 1550 nm vertical cavity semiconductor optical amplifier (VCSOA). Using a 1550 nm VCSOA, wavelength switching operation is reported with a calculated input power below 1 mu W. This low input power requirement for switching added to the high-frequency response of the VCSOA, and the ease of fabricating 2D arrays of these devices due to the vertical structure, makes the VCSOA a very interesting device for use in optical switching applications in the optical telecommunication networks.
