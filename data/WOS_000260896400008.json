The ever-growing need for data is already pushing the current infrastructure to the limit, and we believe that mechanisms developed for a totally different kind and size of traffic will not be able to cope with upcoming requests. Data grids seem to provide a sustainable architecture for the data-hungry application needs, allowing the development of high-performance solutions, although no current solution seems to have found the silver bullet yet. We would like to present our ideas about how to solve this problem, argumenting why we need a copernican revolution to the way we look at network and storage. The approach we will be presenting is layered, going from a new generation of network devices to a standard interface to applications and services, passing through a novel middleware based on peer-to-peer concepts and a stack of data transfer protocols.
