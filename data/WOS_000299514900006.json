AutoMed elicits the negotiators preferences and analyzes them. It monitors the negotiations and proposes possible solutions for resolving the conflict. We conducted experiments in a simulated environment. The results show that negotiations mediated by AutoMed are concluded significantly faster than non-mediated ones and without any of the negotiators opting out. Furthermore, the subjects in the mediated negotiations are more satisfied with the resolutions than the subjects in the non-mediated negotiations.", "paper_title": "AutoMed: an automated mediator for multi-issue bilateral negotiations", "paper_id": "WOS:000299514900006"}
