Among other benefits, it is expected that VANETs will support applications and services targeting the increase of safety on the road, and assist in improving the efficiency of the road transportation network. However, several serious challenges remain to be solved before efficient and secure VANET technology becomes available, one of them been efficient authentication of messages in a VANET. There is a significant body of research work addressing this issue, however, while progress has been made, the challenge is still far from having been resolved and reliable and secure systems ready for deployment becoming available. In this paper, we propose the Privacy Preserving Broadcast Message Authentication (PPBMA) scheme, which, instead of performing asymmetric verification, uses Message Authentication Code (MAC) functionality and HASH operations to authenticate messages. Moreover, we use two-level key hash chain, which assists avoiding message losses. Simulation results demonstrate that PPBMA has superior performances in terms of packet loss rate and message delivery latency when compared to existing solutions. Due to this advantage, it can support emergency and routine messages alike, while existing solutions can only support routine messages. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
