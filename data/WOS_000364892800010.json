The VEM mesh generation strategy employs ray crossings and ray triangle intersection algorithms developed in previous studies, and constructs sufficiently accurate geometric representations of the whole ship within permissible time frame using hexahedral meshes. In addition, this work demonstrates the strategy's practicality in thermal analysis of a notional all-electric ship, which is characterized by intricate structures and multiple internal components, i.e., thermal loads. Ship thermal solutions obtained in this assessment verify the proposed mesh generation strategy's ability to improve the overall computational efficiency of the VEM, by allowing it to obtain plausible thermal solutions with respect to time and space using a coarse independent mesh.
