Of essential concern in such frameworks is data privacy. Potential clients are reluctant to outsource sensitive data to a foreign party without strong privacy assurances beyond policy \"fine prints.\" In this paper, we introduce a mechanism for executing general binary JOIN operations (for predicates that satisfy certain properties) in an outsourced relational database framework with computational privacy and low overhead-the first, to the best of our knowledge. We illustrate via a set of relevant instances of JOIN predicates, including: range and equality (e. g., for geographical data), Hamming distance (e. g., for DNA matching), and semantics (i.e., in healthcare scenarios-mapping antibiotics to bacteria). We experimentally evaluate the main overhead components and show they are reasonable. The initial client computation overhead for 100,000 data items is around 5 minutes and our privacy mechanisms can sustain theoretical throughputs of several million predicate evaluations per second, even for an unoptimized OpenSSL-based implementation.", "paper_title": "Toward Private Joins on Outsourced Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000306557800012"}
