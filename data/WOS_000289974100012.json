So far, these two notorious NP-hard graph problems have resisted all attempts to prove inapproximability results. We show that they have no polynomial time approximation scheme, unless NP-complete problems can be solved in randomized subexponential time. Furthermore, we show that the same techniques can be used for the Maximum Edge Biclique problem, for which we obtain a hardness factor similar to previous results but under a more standard assumption.", "paper_title": "INAPPROXIMABILITY RESULTS FOR MAXIMUM EDGE BICLIQUE, MINIMUM LINEAR ARRANGEMENT, AND SPARSEST CUT", "paper_id": "WOS:000289974100012"}
