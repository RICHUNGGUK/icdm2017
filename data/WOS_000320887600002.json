The volume of the resulting configuration space of connected branched polymers associated to the hyperplane arrangement is expressed through the value of the characteristic polynomial of at 0. We give a more general definition of the space of branched polymers, where we do not require connectivity, and introduce the notion of q-volume for it, which is expressed through the value of the characteristic polynomial of at . Finally, we relate the volume of the space of branched polymers to broken circuits and show that the cohomology ring of the space of branched polymers is isomorphic to the Orlik-Solomon algebra.", "paper_title": "Branched Polymers and Hyperplane Arrangements", "paper_id": "WOS:000320887600002"}
