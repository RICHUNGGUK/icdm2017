The motivation behind considering this theory is that second-order quantifier elimination techniques based on a theorem given in [16], when successful, often result in such formulas. This opens many applications, including automated theorem. proving, static verification of integrity constraints in databases as well as reasoning with weakest sufficient and strongest necessary conditions.", "paper_title": "On the axpoint theory of equality and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000240591000026"}
