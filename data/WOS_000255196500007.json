With the help of the Dini derivative of the expectation of V(t, X(t)) \"along\" the solution X(t) of the model and the technique of Halanay-type inequality, some novel sufficient conditions on pth moment exponential stability of the trivial solution has been established. Conclusions of the development as presented in this paper have gone beyond some published results and are helpful to design stability of networks when stochastic noise is taken into consideration. An example is also given to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.", "paper_title": "Dynamic analysis of stochastic recurrent neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000255196500007"}
