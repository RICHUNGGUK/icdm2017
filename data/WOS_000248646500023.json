Each peptide was represented by a large pool of descriptors including constitutional, topological descriptors and physical-chemical properties. The heuristic method (HM) was then used to search the descriptor space for selecting the proper ones responsible for binding affinity. The four descriptors were obtained to build linear models based on HM and nonlinear models based on SVM method. The best results are found using SVM: root mean-square (RMS) errors for training, test and whole data set were 0.383, 0.385 and 0.384, respectively. This paper allow the prediction of the binding affinity of new, untested peptides and, through the analysis of contribution of each parameter of different residue at specific position of peptidic ligands, to understand nature of the forces governing binding behavior and suggest new ideas for further synthesis of high-affinity peptides.
