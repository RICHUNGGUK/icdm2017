The interest of this paper is to improve the performance of single neural network (SNN) by dividing the fault pattern space into a few smaller sub-spaces using Expectation-Maximization (EM) clustering technique and triggering the right local classifier by designing a supervisor agent. To detect both known and new faults of the system, two ICA models are integrated with the proposed classifier. The performances of this method are evaluated on the data of Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, a benchmark chemical engineering problem. The results from the experiments show the superiority of the proposed method compared to other well-known published works. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
