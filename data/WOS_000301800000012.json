Efficiency of this operation can be significantly improved in hardware implementations by using Frobenius endomorphisms which require integer to tau-adic nonadjacent form conversion. Because conversion is one of the limiting factors in some of Koblitz curve-based cryptosystems, it has become an interesting problem. In this paper, we propose two algorithms and a novel hardware architecture to double the speed of integer to tau-adic nonadjacent form conversion.", "paper_title": "A Fast Hardware Architecture for Integer to tau NAF Conversion for Koblitz Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000301800000012"}
