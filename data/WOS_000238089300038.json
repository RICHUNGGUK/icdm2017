This paper describes design and implementation of wireless LAN based virtual laboratory (WLANVL) used as an e-learning environment. Users of WLANVL can develop and remotely execute a variety of laboratory experiments over internet. The WLANVL mainly includes end user's workbench, management server and lab resources which are based on a set of controlled instruments. Wireless LAN based lab resources make this virtual laboratory scalable and redundancy management server makes it robust.", "paper_title": "A wireless LAN-based robust and scalable virtual laboratory for e-learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300038"}
