The soft memory repair strategy proposed in this paper employs existing forward error correction at the system level and mitigates the impact of memory faults through permutation of high-sensitivity regions. The effectiveness of the proposed repair technique is evaluated on a multi-megabit de-interleaver static random access memory of an ISDB-T digital baseband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing receiver in 65-nm CMOS. The proposed technique introduces a single multiplexer delay overhead and a configurable area overhead of inverted right perpendicularM/iinverted left perpendicular bits, where M is the number of memory rows and i is an integer from 1 to M, inclusive. The repair strategy achieves a measured 0.15 dB gain improvement at 2x10(-4) quasi-error-free bit error rate in the presence of stuck-at memory faults for an additive white Gaussian noise channel.", "paper_title": "Fault-Tolerant Embedded-Memory Strategy for Baseband Signal Processing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000320946200011"}
