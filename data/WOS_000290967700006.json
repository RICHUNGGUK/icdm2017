We reduce symmetry detection to a graph automorphism problem which allows us to extract symmetries of a logic program from the symmetries of the constructed coloured graph. The correctness of our reduction is proven. We also propose an encoding of symmetry-breaking constraints in terms of permutation cycles and use only generators in this process to implicitly represent symmetries with exponential compression. These ideas are formulated as preprocessing and implemented in a completely automated flow that first detects symmetries from a given answer set program, adds symmetry-breaking constraints, and can be applied to any existing answer set solver. We demonstrate computational impact on benchmarks versus direct application of the solver.", "paper_title": "Symmetry-breaking answer set solving", "paper_id": "WOS:000290967700006"}
