In this paper, we present a unified framework for the security of a design against these attacks based on the properties of the LFSR(s) and the Boolean function used. It is explained why building nonlinear filters seems more practical than building nonlinear combiners. We also investigate concrete building blocks that offer a good trade-off in their resistance against these various attacks, and can at the same time be used to build a low-cost synchronous stream cipher for hardware applications.", "paper_title": "On the (im)possibility of practical and secure nonlinear filters and combiners", "paper_id": "WOS:000236988900011"}
