Many researchers are currently using an Apriori algorithm on spatial databases but this algorithm does not utilize the strengths of positive and negative association rules and of time series analysis, hence it misses the discovery of very interesting and useful associations present in the data. In dense spatial databases, the number of negative association rules is much higher compared to the positive rules which need exploitation. Using positive and negative association rule discovery and then pruning out the uninteresting rules consumes resources without much improvement in the overall accuracy of the knowledge discovery process. The associations among different objects and lattices are strongly dependent upon the context, particularly where context is the state of entity, environment or action. We propose an approach to spatial association rule mining from datasets projected at a temporal bar in which the contextual situation is considered while generating positive and negative frequent itemsets. An extended algorithm based on the Apriori approach is developed and compared with existing spatial association rule algorithms. The algorithm for positive and negative association rule mining is based on Apriori algorithm which is further extended to include context variable and simulate temporal series spatial inputs. The numerical evaluation shows that our algorithm is more efficient at generating specific, reliable and robust information than traditional algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
