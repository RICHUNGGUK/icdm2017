Its attractive advantages are that outliers reduction is attained while discontinuities are well preserved, and occlusions are partially handled. Major contributions are the following: First, the structure tensor (ST) based edge detection is introduced to extract flow edges. Moreover, we improve the detection performance by extending the traditional 2D spatial edge detector into spatial-scale 3D space, and also using a gradient bilateral filter (GBF) to replace the linear Gaussian filter to construct a multi-scale nonlinear ST. GBF is useful to preserve discontinuity but it is computationally expensive. A hybrid GBF and Gaussian filter (HGBGF) approach is proposed by means of a spatial-scale gradient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measure to solve the low efficiency issue. Additionally, a piecewise occlusion detection method is used to extract occlusions. Second, we apply a CPF method, which uses a weighted median filter (WMF), a bilateral filter (BF) and a fast median filter (MF), to post-smooth the detected edges and occlusions, and the other flat regions of the flow field, respectively. Benchmark tests on both synthetic and real sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
