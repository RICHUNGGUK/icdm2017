FCPMiner, a new powerful pattern mining method, is then introduced to mine such data efficiently. The uniqueness of the proposed method is its extendibility to non-binary data. The mining method is coupled with a novel visualization technique and a pattern aggregation method to detect the most meaningful, non-overlapping patterns. The proposed methods are rigorously tested on both synthetic and real data sets. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
