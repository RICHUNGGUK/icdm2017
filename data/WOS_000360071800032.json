In this paper, a color slow-motion video segmentation method is proposed. The main strategy is based on region growing and pixel color difference. A rapid color similarity computing method is improved and applied for classifying different pixels. An algorithm based on four directions corrosion is proposed to automatically extract the seed points for the serialized video frames. Utilizing this method, the color frames of the slow-motion videos can be segmented in series automatically. Also, the multithreading mode of parallel computing is introduced in the entire segmentation process. This method is not complicated but automatic. The regions of interest in the slow-motion video frames can be segmented clearly. This novel method can provide support to the video related applications.", "paper_title": "An object segmentation method for the color slow-motion videos based on adjacent frames gradual change", "paper_id": "WOS:000360071800032"}
