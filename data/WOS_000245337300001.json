For this queue, we derive a. system of equations for the transform of the queue-length and obtain the moments of the queue-length as a solution of linear equations. We also obtain a system of equations for the joint transforms of the sojourn time and the queue-length and find the moments of the sojourn time as a solution of linear equations. Numerical examples show that the smaller the variation of the required service times becomes, the larger the mean and variance of the sojourn times become. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
