Assume that the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the interference link between the cognitive base station (CBS) and the primary user (PU) is available at the CBS, we derive the outage capacity in Rayleigh fading environments under the interference power and the transmit power constraints. Under the condition that the interference power limit is sufficiently larger or smaller than the transmit power limit, the asymptotic outage capacity is obtained in closed-form. Assume that only the channel distribution information (CDI) of the interference link is available at the CBS, the outage capacity under the interference outage and the transmit power constraints is derived in closed-form. The theoretical results are confirmed by simulations. It is shown that the outage capacity is not degraded due to partial knowledge of the interference link when the interference power limit is sufficiently larger than the transmit power limit. It is also shown that the capacity gain due to increasing the number of the secondary users (SUs) is negligible if the number of the SUs is already large. Additionally, the case of CDI with estimation error is also investigated. Interestingly, we show that the estimation error of CDI may be a positive factor for improving the outage capacity of the CMC.", "paper_title": "On the Outage Capacity of Fading Cognitive Multicast Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567000027"}
