We show that the class of discrete classical categorial grammars is identifiable from positive structured examples. For this, we provide an original algorithm, which runs in quadratic time in the size of the examples. This work extends the previous results of Kanazawa. Indeed, in our work, several types can be associated to a word and the class is still identifiable in polynomial time. We illustrate the relevance of the class of discrete classical categorial grammars with linguistic examples.", "paper_title": "Learning discrete categorial grammars from structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000252463900012"}
