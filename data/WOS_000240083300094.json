A feature parameter vector is extracted from the text pair under consideration. This vector contains text features such as length, punctuation score, cognate score and a bilingual lexicon extracted from the parallel corpus under consideration. A set of manually prepared training data has been assigned to train the Gaussian mixture model. Another set of data was used for testing. Using the Gaussian mixture model approach, we could achieve error reduction of 160% over length based approach when applied on English-Arabic parallel documents. In addition, the results of (GMM) outperform the results of the combined model which exploits length, punctuation, cognate and bilingual lexicon in a dynamic framework.", "paper_title": "Text-based English-Arabic sentence alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300094"}
