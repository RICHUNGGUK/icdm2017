The attack uses a 2-dimensional lattice and is therefore (in the area of the keyspace where it applies) more efficient than known attacks using Coppersmith techniques. Moreover, we show that the attacks of Wiener and Verheul/Van Tilborg, using continued fractions techniques, are special deterministic cases of our attack, which in general is heuristic.", "paper_title": "A partial key exposure attack on RSA using a 2-dimensional lattice", "paper_id": "WOS:000240592800015"}
