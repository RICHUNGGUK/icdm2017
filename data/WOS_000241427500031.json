In this paper we present a reference framework to support the execution of Web services based e-business applications in autonomic grid environments. Specifically, we tackle the problem of selection of Web services that assure the optimum mapping between each abstract Web service of a business process and a Web service which implements the abstract description, such that the overall quality of service perceived by the user is maximized. The proposed solution guarantees the fulfillment of global constraints, considers variable quality of service profile of component Web services and the long term process execution.", "paper_title": "Web services composition in autonomic grid environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241427500031"}
