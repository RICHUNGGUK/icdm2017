This method is regarded as an improved version of Graph-Based Induction (GBI) which employs stepwise pair expansion (pairwise chunking) to extract typical patterns from graph-structured data, and can find overlapping patterns that cannot not be found by GBI. In this pap er, we propose an algorithm for constructing decision trees for graph-structured data using Cl-GBI. This decision tree construction algorithm, called Decision Tree Chunkingless GraphBased Induction (DT-CIGBI), can construct decision trees from graphstructured datasets while simultaneously constructing attributes useful for classification using Cl-GBI internally. Since patterns extracted by CI-GBI are considered as attributes of a graph, and their existence/nonexistence are used as attribute values, DT-CIGBI can be conceived as a tree generator equipped with feature construction capability. Experiments were conducted on synthetic and real-world graph-structured datasets showing the effectiveness of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Constructing decision trees for graph-structured data by Chunkingless Graph-Based Induction", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600045"}
