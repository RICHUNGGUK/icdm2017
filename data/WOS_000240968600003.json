A prototype was built for testing the feasibility of the model. The testing data are from a company's human resource management department. The results indicated that the generated rules (knowledge) are useful in supporting the company to predict its employees' future performance and then assign proper persons for appropriate positions and projects. Furthermore, the convergence of ANFIS in the model was proven to be more efficient than a generic fuzzy artificial neural network. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
