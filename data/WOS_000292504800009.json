Applying digital watermarking techniques, a framework for visual data security and management for smart cities is presented. In the framework, a reversible fragile or semi-fragile watermark embedded into the visual data is used to ensure trusted acquisition. Moreover, reversible metadata watermarks carrying information such as identification and other properties data is used to assist visual data management. A solution for tracing users on a large scale is presented using reversible watermarking.", "paper_title": "Visual data security and management for smart cities", "paper_id": "WOS:000292504800009"}
