If it is possible to provide a reusable technique, we can efficiently produce new animations that have similar motion styles but different cartoon characters. In this paper, we provide a novel method which can extract motions from existing animation sequences and retarget them to other cartoon characters. Specifically, we implement a skeleton correspondence construction method to extract the motion information from the existing animation sequence, and apply inverse kinematics (IK) to transform the motion onto the target skeleton. The proposed cartoon reusing method can efficiently reduce the workload on the animator and accelerate the development of animation industry. The experimental results conducted on our cartoon dataset suggest the effectiveness of the proposed methods for cartoon animation reusing. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
