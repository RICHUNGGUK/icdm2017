Given a complete graph G = (V, E) with a metric cost function c : E -> O->= and two proper subsets R subset of V and R' subset of R, a partialterminal Steiner tree is a Steiner tree which contains all vertices in R such that all vertices in R must be leaves. The partial-terminal Steiner tree problem is to find a partial-terminal Steiner tree of the minimum cost in G. The previously best-known approximation ratio of the problem is 2 rho, where is rho the approximation ratio of the Steiner tree problem. In this paper, we improve the ratio from 2 rho to 2 rho -rho/3 rho-2- f, where f is a non-negative function whose value is between 0 and rho-rho/3 rho-2.", "paper_title": "An Improved Approximation Ratio to the Partial-Terminal Steiner Tree Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000346572100023"}
