For example, 2DPCA can be seen as the row-based PCA and only reflects the information in each row, and some structure information cannot be uncovered by it. In this paper, we propose the directional 2DPCA that can extract features from the matrixes in any direction. To effectively use all the features extracted by the D2DPCA, we combine a bank of D2DPCA performed in different directions to develop a matching score level fusion method named multi-directional 2DPCA for face recognition. The results of experiments on AR and FERET datasets show that the proposed method can obtain a higher accuracy than the previous matrix-based feature extraction methods.", "paper_title": "Multi-directional two-dimensional PCA with matching score level fusion for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000320865100017"}
