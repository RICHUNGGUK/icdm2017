Recently, the explosive growth in the use of real-time applications on mobile devices has resulted in new challenges to the design of protocols for MANETs. Chief among these challenges to enable real-time applications for MANETs is incorporating support for quality of service (QoS), such as bandwidth constraints. However, MANETs having a high ratio of topology change make routing especially unstable; making stability is an important challenge, especially for routing having a quality of service provision. In this paper, we propose a reliable multi-path QoS routing (RMQR) protocol with a slot assignment scheme. In this scheme, we examine the QoS routing problem associated with searching for a reliable multi-path (or uni-path) QoS route from a source node to a destination node in a MANET. This route must also satisfy certain bandwidth requirements. We determine the route expiration time between two connected mobile nodes using global positioning system (GPS). Then, two parameters, the route expiration time and the number of hops, are used to select a routing path with low latency and high stability. Simulation results show that the proposed RMQR protocol have some outstanding properties when compared with Lin's [Lin C-R. On-demand QoS routing in multihop mobile networks.
