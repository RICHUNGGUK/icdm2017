That is, we can obtain the useful information about the clustering of biological organisms by means of analyzing the coding structure of nucleotide sequences. The primary contribution of such analysis can be regarded as the understanding for the origin of living organisms from the viewpoint of bioinformatics. In this article, we proposed a systematic procedure to address such issue by combining the data transformation, dimension reduction and clustering technique to DNA sequence. The biologists can apply the proposed procedure to get the initial sense for the classification of biological organisms, and it will speed up their analytic action. Besides, an illustrative example will be applied to demonstrate the feasibility and rationality of the proposed procedure in this article. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
