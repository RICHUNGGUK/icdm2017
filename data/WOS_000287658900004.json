The proposed algorithm uses time-frequency decompositions to extract multiple propagation delays of a distributed network and the associated attenuation losses in a piecewise manner, and implements inverse fast Fourier transform to efficiently convert the frequency response into a sum of delayed time domain responses. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed algorithm shows significantly more accurate results for networks with multiple long delays when compared to existing numerical convolution techniques.", "paper_title": "Transient Simulation of Distributed Networks Using Delay Extraction Based Numerical Convolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000287658900004"}
