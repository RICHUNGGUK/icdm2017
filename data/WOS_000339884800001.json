The simulation is performed using quantum molecular dynamics in conjunction with multi-scale shock technique (MSST). A self-consistent charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) method is adapted. The results show that the N-N-C angle has a drastic change under shock wave compression along lattice vector b at shock velocity 11 km/s, which is the main reason that leads to an insulator-to-metal transition for the HMX system. The metallization pressure (about 130 GPa) of condensed-phase HMX is predicted firstly. We also detect the formation of several key products of condensed-phase HMX decomposition, such as NO2, NO, N-2, N2O, H2O, CO, and CO2, and all of them have been observed in previous experimental studies. Moreover, the initial decomposition products include H-2 due to the C-H bond breaking as a primary reaction pathway at extreme condition, which presents a new insight into the initial decomposition mechanism of HMX under shock loading at the atomistic level.", "paper_title": "Pressure-induced metallization of condensed phase beta-HMX under shock loadings via molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with multi-scale shock technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000339884800001"}
