The basic single-grid SG algorithm combines upwind-biased discretization with a subiterative local-dual-time-stepping time-integration procedure. MG acceleration, using characteristic MG restriction and prolongation operators, is applied on meanflow variables only (MF-MG), turbulence variables being simply injected onto coarser grids. A previously developed non-time-consistent (for steady flows) full-approximation-multigrid (s-MG) is assessed for 3-D anisotropy-driven and/or separated flows, which are dominated by the convergence of turbulence variables. Even for these difficult test cases CPU-speed-ups r(CPUSUP) is an element of[3, 5] are obtained. Alternative, potentially time-consistent approaches (unsteady u-MG), where MG acceleration is applied at each subiteration, are also examined, using different subiterative strategies, MG cycles, and turbulence models. For 2-D shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction, the fastest s-MG approach, with a V(2, 0) sawtooth cycle, systematically yields CPU-speed-ups of 5 +/- 1/2, quasi-independent of the particular turbulence closure used.
