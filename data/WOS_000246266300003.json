HR exhibits various characteristics during different physical activities attributed to the altered autonomic mediation, where it is also beneficial to reveal the autonomic shift in response to physical-activity change. In this paper, the physical-activity-related HR behaviors were delineated using a portable ECG and body acceleration recorder based on a personal digital assistant and the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution. The results based upon eighteen subjects performing four sequential 5-min physical activities (supine, sitting, standing and spontaneous walking) showed that the high-frequency heartbeat fluctuations during supine and sitting were significantly larger than during standing, and that the ratio of low- to high-frequency fluctuation during standing was significantly higher than during supine and sitting. This could be linked with the parasympathetic predominance during supine and sitting, and a shift to sympathetic dominance while standing. During spontaneous walking, the high-frequency fluctuation was significant lower than during supine. The low- to high-frequency ratio decreased significantly from standing to spontaneous walking, which may imply an increased vagal predominance (autonomic effect) or an increased respiratory activity (mechanical effect).", "paper_title": "Correlates of the shift in heart rate variability with postures and walking by time-frequency analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000246266300003"}
