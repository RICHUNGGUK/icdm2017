In this paper we examine twelve years of research on electronic marketplaces in leading information systems journals. The research articles are classified according to five conceptual high level groupings: electronic markets theory: system perspective with a focus on the technology or functionality with the system: adoption and implementation issues; organisational implications; and broader e-commerce issues. The findings show an increase in electronic marketplace (e-marketplace) research over the twelve years. The analysis of the literature highlights two distinct issues that researchers in the information systems discipline need to address. The first is the lack of research on the fundamental questions on the nature of electronic markets and their efficiency. If information systems research does not address this question then it will not be seen as tackling critical issues by those outside of the discipline. The second is the relative lack of articles on the organisational implications of adopting and managing electronic marketplaces. These include, the organisational benefits, costs and risks of trading through e-marketplaces and strategies and methodologies for managing organisational participation. Both issues can be addressed by increasing the number of macro studies examining efficiencies in electronic markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
