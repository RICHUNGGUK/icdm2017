We utilize computer vision technologies to measure performance of this critical step including duration, size, centrality, circularity, as well as motion stability during the capsulorhexis procedure. Consequently, a grading mechanism is established based on either linear regression or non-linear classification via Support Vector Machine of those computed measures. Comparisons of expert graders to the computer vision-based approach have demonstrated the accuracy and consistency of the computerized technique.", "paper_title": "A computer vision-based approach to grade simulated cataract surgeries", "paper_id": "WOS:000347776600009"}
