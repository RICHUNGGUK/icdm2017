For MP3 audio, some efforts have been made to solve the copyright pirating and malicious modifications by the way of watermarking. To our best knowledge, similar work on the AVS audio has not been explored. In this paper, we present a novel robust watermarking algorithm for AVS audio. We find that the frame type in the AVS coded process can be used as a robust feature for watermarking. Then we design a novel watermarking algorithm which is integrated into the AVS audio coding process. The watermark bits are embedded into the compressed bit stream. At the extracting end, the watermark bits can be extracted from the compressed bit stream directly. This algorithm achieves robustness to decoding/re-coding attacks, and has low computation complexity for both embedding and extracting while preserving the quality of the audio signals.", "paper_title": "Robust AVS audio watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000276599800016"}
