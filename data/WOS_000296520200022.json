Each job has a processing requirement and each machine has a characteristic value. In our case, we assume that the time a job occupies a machine is equal to the processing requirement of the job plus a setup time that is equal to the characteristic value of that machine. In this paper, we consider permutation schedules and show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time when the number of machines is fixed.", "paper_title": "Minimizing makespan in an ordered flow shop with machine-dependent processing times", "paper_id": "WOS:000296520200022"}
