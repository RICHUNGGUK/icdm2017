It enables to predict the appearance of events in advance that are relevant for an organization. An example is to predict the appearance of a new and relevant technology for a research organization. Existing approaches detect weak signals based on an environmental scanning procedure that considers textual information from the internet. This is because about 80% of all data in the internet are textual information. The texts are processed by a specific clustering approach where clusters that represent weak signals are identified. In contrast to these related approaches, we propose a new methodology that investigates a sequence of clusters measured at successive points in time. This enables to trace the development of weak signals over time and thus, it enables to identify relevant weak signal developments for organization's decision making in strategic early warning environment.
