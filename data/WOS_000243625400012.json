Many previous methods on this problem utilize the extension technique of SVD factorization based on rank constraint to the tracking matrix, where the 3D shape of nonrigid object is expressed as a weighted combination of a set of shape bases. All these solutions are based on the assumption of Affine camera model. This assumption will become invalid and cause large reconstruction errors when the object is close to the camera. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, namely the linear recursive estimation and the nonlinear optimization, to extend these methods to general perspective camera model. Both algorithms are based on the shape and motion of weak perspective projection. The former one updates the solutions from weak perspective to perspective projection by refining the scalars corresponding to the projective depths recursively. The latter one is based on nonlinear optimization by minimizing the perspective reprojection residuals. Extensive experiments on simulated data and real image sequences are performed to validate the effectiveness of our new algorithms and noticeable improvements over the previous solutions are observed.
