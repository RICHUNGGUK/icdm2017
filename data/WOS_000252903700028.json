The COMPARE interface provides access to a wide array of information including genomic structure, expression data, annotations, pathways and literature links for human and three widely studied animal models (zebrafish, Drosophila and mouse). A consensus ortholog-finding pipeline combining several ortholog prediction methods allows accurate comparisons of data across species and has been utilized to transfer information from well studied organisms to more poorly annotated ones.", "paper_title": "COMPARE, a multi-organism system for cross-species data comparison and transfer of information", "paper_id": "WOS:000252903700028"}
