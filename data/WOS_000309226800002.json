In a multi-agent system, action selection of the learning agent is unavoidably impacted by other agents' actions. Therefore, joint-state and joint-action are involved in the multi-agent reinforcement learning system. A novel agent action prediction method based on the probabilistic neural network (PNN) is proposed. PNN is used to predict the actions of other agents. Furthermore, the sharing policy mechanism is used to exchange the learning policy of multiple agents, the aim of which is to speed up the learning. Finally, the application of presented method to robot soccer is studied. Through learning, robot players can master the mapping policy from the state information to the action space. Moreover, multiple robots coordination and cooperation are well realized.", "paper_title": "A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to robot soccer", "paper_id": "WOS:000309226800002"}
