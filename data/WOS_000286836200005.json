This kind of problem can be modelled as a dynamic optimization problem, which involves dynamic variables whose values change in time. Most applied research on optimization methods have focused on static optimization problems but these static methods often lack explicit adaptive methodologies. Heuristics are specific methods for solving problems in the absence of an algorithm for formal proof. Metaheuristics are approximate optimization methods which have been applied to more general problems with significant success. However, particle filters are Monte Carlo algorithms which solve the sequential estimation problem by approximating the theoretical distributions in the state space by simulated random measures called particles. However, particle filters lack efficient search strategies. In this paper, we propose a general framework to hybridize heuristics/metaheuristics with particle filters properly. The aim of this framework is to devise effective hybrid visual tracking algorithms naturally, guided by the use of abstraction techniques. Resulting algorithms exploit the benefits of both complementary approaches. As a particular example, a memetic algorithm particle filter is derived from the proposed hybridization framework. Finally, we show the performance of the memetic algorithm particle filter when it is applied to a multiple object tracking problem.", "paper_title": "Heuristic particle filter: applying abstraction techniques to the design of visual tracking algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000286836200005"}
