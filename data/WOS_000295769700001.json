In order to fully exploit the computational power of the CPU, we choose a method of solution which combines a finite difference discretization of the free-streaming term with a Monte Carlo evaluation of the collision integral. The efficiency of the code is demonstrated by solving the two-dimensional driven cavity flow. Computational results show that it is possible to cut down the computing time of the sequential code of two order of magnitude. This makes the proposed method of solution a viable alternative to particle simulations for studying unsteady low Mach number flows. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
