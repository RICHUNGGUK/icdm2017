We employ the latest technology in scalable video compression (3-D wavelet video coding) and in channel coding (punctured turbo codes); for the physical layer, we resort to the multicarrier chip-interleaved system with two-layer interleaving, which achieves high spectral efficiency and is very suitable for downlink applications. We develop fast algorithms for a cross-layer resource allocation that minimize the expected distortion of the reconstructed video averaged over all clients. The algorithms find a near-optimal power, bandwidth, and subcarrier allocation at the physical layer and a source-channel symbol allocation at the application layer. Our experimental results demonstrate that such a cross-layer optimization framework leads to higher quality performance of the overall system.
