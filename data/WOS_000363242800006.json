A distributed impulsive protocol is proposed to achieve multiconsensus of second-order multiagent networks in terms of three categories: 1) stationary multiconsensus; 2) the first dynamic multiconsensus; and 3) the second dynamic multiconsensus. This impulsive protocol utilizes only sampled position data and is implemented at sampling instants. For those three categories of multiconsensus, the control parameters in the impulsive protocol are designed, respectively. Moreover, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived, under which each multiconsensus can be reached asymptotically. Several simulations are finally provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Impulsive Multiconsensus of Second-Order Multiagent Networks Using Sampled Position Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000363242800006"}
