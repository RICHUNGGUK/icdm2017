The model effectively solves problems like the one that grade of every single index is incompatible with one another so as to improve the accuracy of disaster evaluation results. Besides, generality of the model is improved by adopting different grade standard for disaster situation index in the relative regions. The results show that the model based on optimization support vector machine has a strong generalization and evaluation results is reasonable so that the model is considered to have a good application prospect in multi-index comprehensively evaluation.
