To deal with this, many algorithms whose performance depends on an appropriate choice of their parameters have been proposed. In this work, it is investigated the application of a racing procedure based on a statistical approach, named I/F-Race, to suggest the parameters for two binarization algorithms reasoned (i) on the perception of objects by distance (POD) and (ii) on the POD combined with a Laplacian energy-based technique. Our experiments show that both algorithms had their performance statistically improved outperforming other recent binarization techniques.
