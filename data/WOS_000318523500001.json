It exploits three layers of cortical columns that generate a theta/gamma rhythm. The first layer implements an auto-associative memory working in the theta range; the second segments objects in the gamma range; finally, the feedback interactions between the third and the second layers realize a hetero-associative memory for learning a sequence. After training with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian rules, the network recovers sequences and accounts for the phase-precession phenomenon.", "paper_title": "A MULTI-LAYER NEURAL-MASS MODEL FOR LEARNING SEQUENCES USING THETA/GAMMA OSCILLATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000318523500001"}
