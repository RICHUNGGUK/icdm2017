An initial literature review was followed by a web-based survey to solicit expert opinions in each civil engineering subdiscipline to select challenges that can be addressed by civil engineering DSA research. A total of 10 challenges were identified and evidence of economic, environmental, and societal impacts of these challenges is presented through a review of the literature. The challenges presented in this paper are high building energy consumption, crude estimation of sea level, increased soil and coastal erosion, inadequate water quality, untapped and depleting groundwater, increasing traffic congestion, poor infrastructure resilience to disasters, poor and degrading infrastructure, need for better mining and coal ash waste disposal, and low construction site safety. The paper aims to assist the civil engineering research community in setting an agenda for data sensing and analysis research to address these challenges.
