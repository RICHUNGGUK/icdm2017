We propose an integrated framework for handling all the problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the problems unavoidable in surface-independent DirectAR can be successfully resolved.", "paper_title": "Surface-independent direct-projected augmented reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200089"}
