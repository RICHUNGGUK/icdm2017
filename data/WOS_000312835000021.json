The proposed network employs a pipelined circuit-switching approach combined with a dynamic path-setup scheme under a multistage network topology. The dynamic path-setup scheme enables runtime path arrangement for arbitrary traffic permutations. The circuit-switching approach offers a guarantee of permuted data and its compact overhead enables the benefit of stacking multiple networks. A 0.13-mu m CMOS test-chip validates the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed design. Experimental results show that the proposed on-chip network achieves 1.9x to 8.2x reduction of silicon overhead compared to other design approaches.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of an On-Chip Permutation Network for Multiprocessor System-On-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000312835000021"}
