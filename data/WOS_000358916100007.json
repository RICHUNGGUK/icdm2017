Its core is a novel dissimilarity-preserving projection technique that characterizes not only the relationships among the mean values of the ensemble data objects but also the relationships among the distributions of ensemble members. This uncertainty-aware projection scheme leads to an improved understanding of the intrinsic structure in an ensemble dataset. The analysis of the ensemble dataset is further augmented by a suite of visual encoding and exploration tools. Experimental results on both artificial and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Uncertainty-Aware Multidimensional Ensemble Data Visualization and Exploration", "paper_id": "WOS:000358916100007"}
