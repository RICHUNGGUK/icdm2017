In this paper, we present the overall GpENI framework and our implementation experience for the programmable routing environment and the dynamic circuit network (DCN). GpENI is built to provide a collaborative research infrastructure enabling the research community to conduct experiments in Future Internet architecture. We present illustrative examples of our experimentation in the GpENI platform. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
