However, this capacity increase can not directly translate to the useful throughput at the medium access control (MAC) layer due to overheads. In this letter, we propose an enhanced full-duplex MAC (FD+) for improving the performance of wireless networks. We also present a simple analytic model for investigating what gains can be achieved at the MAC layer. The simple model for FD transmissions can accurately capture the new sub-scenarios of two-node simultaneous transmissions that are traditionally handled as collisions by IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF). The performance of FD+ is compared with DCF, a plain FD (FD-Plain) scheme and an FD MAC (FD-MAC) scheme from the literature. The analytic and simulation results show that FD+ is able to provide an average factor of 2.3 and 1.3 throughput increase against FD-Plain and FD-MAC, respectively.", "paper_title": "Modelling and Enhancing Full-Duplex MAC for Single-Hop 802.11 Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377307900002"}
