A fast and efficient blind preprocessing algorithm in frequency domain is proposed to reduce the computational complexity even that the reference sensors are located far from the noise sources. The permutation problem at different frequency bin is also addressed and solved by an independent vector analysis algorithm. The basic principle and performance comparison are given to verify our conclusion.", "paper_title": "Blind Preprocessing of Multichannel Feedforward ANC in Frequency Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000309043100022"}
