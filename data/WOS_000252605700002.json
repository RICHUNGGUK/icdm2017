The paper outlines the results known fur the (general) Randic index of (chemical) graphs. Some very new results are released. We classify the results into the following categories: extremal values and extremal graphs of Randic index, general Randic index, zeroth-order general Randic index, higher-order Randic index. A few conjectures and open problems are mentioned.", "paper_title": "A survey on the Randic index", "paper_id": "WOS:000252605700002"}
