It requires only qualitative judgements about differences of attractiveness to help a decision maker, or a decision-advisory group, quantify the relative value of options. The approach, based on the additive value model, aims to support interactive learning about evaluation problems and the elaboration of recommendations to prioritize and select options in individual or group decision making processes. A case study based on a real-world application of MACBETH for multicriteria value measurement of IT solutions is presented. It shows how the M-MACBETH decision support system can be used in practice to construct an additive evaluation model. The paper addresses key issues related to structuring the model, building value scales, weighting criteria and sensitivity and robustness analyzes. Reference is also made to applications of MACBETH reported in the scientific literature.", "paper_title": "MACBETH", "paper_id": "WOS:000304102700006"}
