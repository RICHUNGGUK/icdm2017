This feature contains both the space and color information, and is characterized by fuzzy quantization. We can optionally integrate our feature with Fuzzy Foreground when accurate segmentation is unavailable. Intensive experiments on three typical datasets have demonstrated that our method achieves promising results in real time.", "paper_title": "Person re-identification by fuzzy space color histogram", "paper_id": "WOS:000342418700005"}
