Plotting points are usually determined by using nonparametric methods which produce, for example, the mean- and median-ranks. Here, we use a distribution-based approach which selects plotting points (quantiles) based on the simultaneous-closeness of order statistics to population quantiles. We show that the plotting points so determined are robust over a multitude of symmetric distributions and then demonstrate their usefulness by examining the power properties of a correlation goodness-of-fit test for normality.
