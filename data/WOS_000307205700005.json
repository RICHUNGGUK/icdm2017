But Make-To-Order (MTO) companies, which produce high-variety and bespoke products, have particularly challenging decision support requirements and it remains unclear whether ERP systems can meet their needs. This paper takes a contingency-based perspective of ERP adoption, assessing the fit or alignment between ERP functionality and a MTO production strategy. MTO features considered include: decision support requirements at critical Production Planning and Control (PPC) stages, idiosyncratic market-related features, typical company size and supply chain positioning, and shop floor configuration. It finds a substantial gap or misalignment between ERP functionality and MTO requirements; for example, between decision support provided by ERP systems and the decision support required by MTO companies at the customer enquiry and design & engineering stages. A research agenda for improving alignment is outlined, with implications for academics, MTO managers and ERP software developers. This includes: developing decision support tools that reflect the customer enquiry management activities of MTO companies; embedding MTO-relevant PPC concepts within ERP systems; and, conducting an in-depth empirical study into applications of ERP systems in MTO companies, assessing their performance impact.
