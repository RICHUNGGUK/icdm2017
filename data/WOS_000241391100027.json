To solve this problem, an adaptive segmentation algorithm based on the coupled Markov random field (CMRF) model is proposed in this paper. The CMRF model has two mutually dependent components: one models the observed image to estimate features, and the other models the labeling to achieve segmentation. When calculating the feature of each pixel, the homogeneity of the subimage is ensured by using only the pixels currently labeled as the same pattern. With the acquired features, the labeling is obtained through solving a maximum a posteriori problem. In our adaptive approach, the feature set and the labeling are mutually dependent on each other, and therefore are alternately optimized by using a simulated annealing scheme. With the gradual improvement of features' accuracy, the labeling is able to locate the exact boundary of each texture pattern adaptively. The proposed algorithm is compared with a simple MRF model based method in segmentation of Brodatz texture mosaics and real scene images. The satisfying experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can differentiate textured images more accurately.", "paper_title": "Adaptive segmentation of textured images by using the coupled Markov random field model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241391100027"}
