In this paper, a multi-resolution image fusion metric using visual information fidelity (VIF) is presented to assess fusion performance objectively. This method has four stages: (1) Source and fused images are filtered and divided into blocks. (2) Visual information is evaluated with and without distortion information in each block. (3) The visual information fidelity for fusion (VIFF) of each sub-band is calculated. (4) The overall quality measure is determined by weighting the VIFF of each sub-band. In our experiment, the proposed fusion assessment method is compared with several existing fusion metrics using the subjective test dataset provided by Petrovic. We found that VIFF performs better in terms of both human perception matching and computational complexity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
