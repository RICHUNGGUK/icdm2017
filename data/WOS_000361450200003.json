Still, design of such algorithms poses newer challenges in various emerging areas of image analysis and computer vision. This mandates further investigation of application-specific shortest-path problems in the framework of digital geometry. We present here an efficient combinatorial algorithm for finding a shortest isothetic path (SIP) between two grid points in a digital object without any hole, such that the SIP lies entirely inside the object. Our algorithm first determines a maximum-area isothetic polygon that is inscribed within the object. Certain combinatorial rules are then used to construct the SIP on the basis of its constituent monotone sub-paths, the number of which is invariant regardless of the choice of SIP between two given grid points. For a given grid size, the proposed algorithm runs in time, where n is the number of grid points appearing on the boundary of the inscribed polygon. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the algorithm and its further prospects in shape analysis.", "paper_title": "On finding a shortest isothetic path and its monotonicity inside a digital object", "paper_id": "WOS:000361450200003"}
