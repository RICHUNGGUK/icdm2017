A long standing model of success in the Information Systems literature is the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model. Addressing the call for research of existing theoretical models in different contexts, this research proposes an investigation of an adapted version of the IS Success Model in website contexts beyond e-commerce. The model is tested using Partial Least Squares with data from 2007 actual users of two categories of websites. Consistent with our predictions that website success cannot be measured with a \"one size fits all\" model. we find that success factors vary across website types. Implications of these results for practice and research are discussed.", "paper_title": "EXAMINING THE SUCCESS OF WEBSITES BEYOND E-COMMERCE: AN EXTENSION OF THE IS SUCCESS MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000268352800005"}
