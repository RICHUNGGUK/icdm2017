A synthetic database of B-mode image sequences modeling healthy, ischemic and dyssynchrony cases was generated for that purpose. This database is made publicly available to the community. It combines recent advances in electromechanical and ultrasound modeling. For modeling heart mechanics, the Bestel-Clement-Sorine electromechanical model was applied to a realistic geometry. For ultrasound modeling, we applied a fast simulation technique to produce realistic images on a set of scatterers moving according to the electromechanical simulation result. Tracking and strain accuracies were computed and compared for all evaluated algorithms. For tracking, all methods were estimating myocardial displacements with an error below 1 mm on the ischemic sequences. The introduction of a dilated geometry was found to have a significant impact on accuracy. Regarding strain, all methods were able to recover timing differences between segments, as well as low strain values. On all cases, radial strain was found to have a low accuracy in comparison to longitudinal and circumferential components.", "paper_title": "3D Strain Assessment in Ultrasound (Straus): A Synthetic Comparison of Five Tracking Methodologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000324251000007"}
