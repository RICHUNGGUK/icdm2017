We introduce a new algorithm for identifying noisy cryo-EM images of nearby viewing angles. This identification is an important first step in three-dimensional structure determination of macromolecules from cryo-EM, because once identified, these images can be rotationally aligned and averaged to produce \"class averages\" of better quality. The main advantage of our algorithm is its extreme robustness to noise. The algorithm is also very efficient in terms of running time and memory requirements, because it is based on the computation of the top few eigenvectors of a specially designed sparse Hermitian matrix. These advantages are demonstrated in numerous numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Viewing Angle Classification of Cryo-Electron Microscopy Images Using Eigenvectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000292131200008"}
