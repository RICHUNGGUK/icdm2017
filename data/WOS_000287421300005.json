The function p is called a numerical event or multidimensional probability. When appropriately structured, sets P of numerical events form so-called algebras of S-probabilities. Their main feature is that they are orthomodular partially ordered sets of functions p with an inherent full set of states. A classical physical system can be characterized by the fact that the corresponding algebra P of S-probabilities is a Boolean lattice. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for systems of numerical events to be a lattice and characterize those systems which are Boolean. Assuming that only a finite number of measurements is available our focus is on finite algebras of S-probabilties.", "paper_title": "ON THE STRUCTURE OF NUMERICAL EVENT SPACES", "paper_id": "WOS:000287421300005"}
