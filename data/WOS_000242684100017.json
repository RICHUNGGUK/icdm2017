Unfortunately, SVM is currently considerably slower in test phase caused by number of the support vectors, which has been a serious limitation for some applications. To overcome this problem, we proposed an adaptive algorithm named feature vectors selection (FVS) to select the feature vectors from the support vector solutions, which is based on the vector correlation principle and greedy algorithm. Through the adaptive algorithm, the sparsity of solution is improved and the time cost in testing is reduced. To select the number of the feature vectors adaptively by the requirements, the generalization and complexity trade-off can be directly controlled. The computer simulations on regression estimation and pattern recognition show that FVS is a promising algorithm to simplify the solution for support vector machine.
