In this scheme, TCP connections at the server side are actively and fully replicated to remain consistency so as to be transplanted over healthy parts during failure. A log mechanism is designed to cooperate with the replication to achieve small sacrifice on the performance of communication and makes the scheme scales beyond a few nodes, even when they have different processing capacities. We built a prototype system at a four-node cluster with ER-TCP, and conducted a series of experiments on that. The experimental result told us that ER-TCP has relatively small penalty on the communication performance, especially when it is used to synchronize multiple replicas. The results of real applications show that ER-TCP will incur small sacrifice on performance of web server at light load, and it can be used to distribute files very efficiently and reliably.", "paper_title": "ER-TCP: An efficient TCP fault-tolerance scheme for cluster computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000252224700003"}
