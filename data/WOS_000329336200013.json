Integrity between local storages and the clouds is a critical issue which often messes up the SMBs' digital assets in a hybrid cloud environment. The downside makes SMBs reluctant to embrace cloud technology, though they may benefit from it in the long-term. The drawback comes from two aspects: \"the information chaos\" and \"the management crisis.\" The chaos originates from the possibility of information inconsistency among replicas in different places. The managerial crisis lies in the non-trustable access to the digital assets. This research aims to solve the Hybrid Cloud security control issues such as Identity Authentication as well as Access Right Authorization and consequent Synchronization of the file contents. The research refers to the de facto open standards, viz. OpenID and O'Auth to facilitate Account Authentication and Access Right Authorization etc for the Hybrid Cloud environment. The mechanisms are implemented for a cross-platform which encompasses Linux-based local hosts as well as MSWindows-based computers, the private cloud based on Hadoop, and the Google Apps as the public cloud scenario. Users can launch the login from whatever a local host and then Google Apps, Facebook, etc., can deal with Access Right Permissions on the respective clouds. At last, we validate, according to CMMI, the functionality, reliability and integrity of the solutions to show the superiority and applicability of our approach.", "paper_title": "Authentication, Authorization and File Synchronization for Hybrid Cloud -- The Development Centric to Google Apps, Hadoop and Linux Local Hosts", "paper_id": "WOS:000329336200013"}
