The relationship between Lambda(t)(Lambda) and the intersection type assignment system is the standard isomorphism between typed and type assignment system, and so the typed language inherits from the untyped system all the good properties, like subject reduction and strong normalization. Moreover, both type checking and type reconstruction are decidable. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Intersection-types a la church", "paper_id": "WOS:000249570500005"}
