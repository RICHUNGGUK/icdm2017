We solved CO(2) transport equations in the hydrocarbon and aqueous phases along streamlines and in the direction of gravity. To capture the physics of CO(2) transport, in the hydrocarbon phase, we used the Todd-Longstaff model (Todd and Longstaff, J Pet Technol 24(7):874-882, 1972) to represent subgrid-block viscous fingering. We implemented a thermodynamic model of mutual dissolution between CO(2) and water with salt precipitation (Spycher et al., Geochim Cosmochim Acta 67(16):3015-3031, 2003; Spycher and Pruess, Geochim Cosmochim Acta 69(13):3309-3320, 2005). The resultant changes in porosity and permeability due to chemical reaction and salt precipitation were also considered. We accounted for two cycles of relative permeability hysteresis (primary and secondary drainage and imbibition) by applying two different trapping models: Land (SPE J 8:149-156, 1968) and Spiteri et al. (SPE J 13(3):277-288, 2008). Relative permeability changes and variations in the trapped nonwetting phase saturations due to hysteresis were updated on a block-by-block basis. We verified our simulator by comparing one-dimensional simulation results with analytical solutions. We then performed simulations on three-dimensional reservoir models. We first simulated dry CO(2) injection in an aquifer to investigate the effect of salt precipitation. After 2 years of CO(2) injection, the permeability reduced by approximately 20%. We then used the simulator to design CO(2) injection strategies in aquifers to maximize CO(2) storage and in oil reservoirs to optimize both CO(2) storage and oil recovery. Simulations were conducted on a North Sea reservoir description. We propose to inject CO(2) and water simultaneously, followed by chase brine injection, which could render the majority of CO(2) injected immobile while giving a much higher storage efficiency than injecting CO(2) alone.", "paper_title": "A three-phase four-component streamline-based simulator to study carbon dioxide storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000272180000007"}
