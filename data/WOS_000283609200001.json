The proposed method does not use the analytical method to derive the general relation between the backward- and forward-scattering dominant mode coefficients and slot voltage. In the proposed method, general relation connecting the backward- and forward-scattering dominant mode coefficients to the slot electric field distribution is derived using available electromagnetic field simulator and by fitting some proper polynomials to the derived data. Then, the well known Elliott's design procedure for arrays of longitudinal slot in the broad wall of air filled rectangular waveguide is developed for the slot array feed by single ridge waveguide. A four-by-five array is designed and simulated which verify the design specifications and the proposed design procedure. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals.
