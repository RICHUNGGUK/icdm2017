This paper establishes some limitations of such systems. A class of sets of numbers that cannot be represented by unique, least or greatest solutions of systems of this form is defined, and a particular set in this class is constructed. The argument is then extended to equations over sets of integers.", "paper_title": "ON EQUATIONS OVER SETS OF NUMBERS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287762800008"}
