When these basis functions are chosen as the power functions, we recover classical algebraic collocation methods. This paper shows that functionally-fitted methods can be derived with less restrictive conditions than previously stated in the literature, and that other related results can be derived in a much more elegant way. The novelty in our approach is to fully retain the collocation framework without reverting back into derivations based on cumbersome Taylor series expansions.", "paper_title": "On functionally-fitted Runge-Kutta methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000242498500009"}
