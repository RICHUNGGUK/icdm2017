The 40th SRC was held in Blacksburg, Virginia, on 6-9 June 2004. The conference was originally the brainchild of the Southern Regional Education Board's Committee on Statistics (SREB-COS), created to fulfill a unique need for a small gathering of statisticians and other scientists in the Southern region of the United States, at which research topics in statistics and statistical training could be addressed in a relaxed and unhurried way amid pleasant surroundings. Young statisticians were included along with well-known senior researchers to be able to interact, get to know each other, and enhance their research and training efforts. A brief history of the SREB-COS and its successor, the SRCOS, is also presented to convey its role in the development of the discipline in the region.", "paper_title": "The summer research conferences and the SRCOS: a historical perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000234635400002"}
