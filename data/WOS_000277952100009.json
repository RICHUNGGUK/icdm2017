We encode each video into multiple low bit-rate layers and distribute copies of the layers from the participating peers. Each client receives the constituent multiple layers from different serving peers, and combines them into the original video stream. When a server peer disconnects, the system attempts to find a replacement peer that has a copy of the missing layer and has sufficient available uplink bandwidth. We show how to efficiently distribute a video from its origin server to a set of viewing peers. We also derive an optimal replication strategy for layered videos. We examine the system performance via simulation and show that peer-to-peer video streaming with layered coding can provide excellent performance even if peers disconnect from the network frequently.", "paper_title": "On the design of P2P video streaming with layered coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000277952100009"}
