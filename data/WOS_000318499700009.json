Generally delays are generated by lengthening the transition times of the input signal which is subsequently restored. Slow transition times however, results in prolonged short-circuit current duration at the signal restoration stage, not only increasing the overall power consumption of the system but also limiting the usable output delay range. This paper presents a novel CMOS semi-static threshold-triggered delay element architecture that minimizes the short-circuit current over a wide output delay range. The architecture can also incorporate conventional delay elements to improve their performance. The presented delay element is fabricated in a commercial 0.35 mu m CMOS technology and the measurement results show significant improvements in output delay range and average power consumption over other conventional delay elements.", "paper_title": "Semi-static threshold-triggered delay elements for low power operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000318499700009"}
