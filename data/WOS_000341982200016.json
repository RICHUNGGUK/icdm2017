In this paper, let F-r be a finite field with r = q(m). Suppose that g(1), g(2) is an element of F*(r) are not conjugates over F-q, ord(g(1)) = n(1), ord(g(2)) = n(2), d = gcd(n(1), n(2)), and n = n(1)n(2)/d. Let F-q (g(1)) = F(q)(m)1, F-q(g(2)) = F(q)(m)2, and T-i denote the trace function from F(q)(m)i to F-q for i = 1, 2. We define a cyclic code C-(q,C-m,C-n1,C-n2) = {c(a, b) : a is an element of F(q)(m)1, b is an element of F(q)(m)2}, where c(a,b) = (T-1(ag(1)(0)) + T-2(bg(2)(0)), T-1(ag(1)(1)) + T-2(bg(2)(1)),..., T-1(ag(1)(n-1)) + T-2(bg(2)(n-1))). We mainly use Gauss periods to present the weight distribution of the cyclic code C-(q,C-m,C-n1,C-n2). As applications, we determine the weight distribution of cyclic code C-(q,C- m,C- qm1-1,C- qm2-1) with gcd(m(1), m(2)) = 1; in particular, it is a three-weight cyclic code if gcd(q - 1, m(1) - m(2)) = 1. We also explicitly determine the weight distributions of some classes of cyclic codes including several classes of four-weight cyclic codes.", "paper_title": "Hamming Weights of the Duals of Cyclic Codes With Two Zeros", "paper_id": "WOS:000341982200016"}
