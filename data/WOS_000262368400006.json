However such solutions usually exploit many powerful features, such as electrical charges (polarizations) associated to membranes, evolution rules, communication rules, and strong or weak forms of division rules. In this paper we contribute to the study of the computational power of polarizationless recognizer P systems with active membranes. Precisely, we show that such systems are able to solve in polynomial time the NP-complete decision problem 3-SAT by using only dissolution rules and a form of strong division for non-elementary membranes, working in the maximallly parallel way.", "paper_title": "On the Computational Efficiency of Polarizationless Recognizer P Systems with Strong Division and Dissolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000262368400006"}
