Issues related to the controllability and observability of these systems are well-studied in systems theory. However, there are not many results on reachability, even for general linear systems. In this study, we present a large class of linear systems with decidable reachable state spaces. This is approached by reducing the reachability analysis to real root isolation of exponential polynomials. Furthermore, we have implemented this method in a Maple package based on symbolic computation and applied to several examples successfully.", "paper_title": "Reachability analysis of rational eigenvalue linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283314600001"}
