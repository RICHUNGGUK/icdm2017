They are very limited in terms of surface topography investigations to validate machining strategies as well as machining parameters such as chordal deviation, scallop height and tool feed. Z-buffer or N-buffer machining simulations provide more precise simulations but require long computation time, especially when using realistic cutting tools models including cutting edges geometry. Thus, the aim of this paper is to evaluate Nvidia CUDA architecture to speed-up Z-buffer or N-buffer machining simulations. Several strategies for parallel computing are investigated and compared to single-threaded and multi-threaded CPU, relatively to the complexity of the simulation. Simulations are conducted with two different configurations including Nvidia Quadro 4000 and Geforce GTX 560 graphic cards. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
