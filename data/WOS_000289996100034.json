Such new editing goals typically require a pre-processing shape analysis step to enable subsequent shape editing. Observing that most editing of shapes involves manipulating their constituent components, we introduce component-wise controllers that are adapted to the component characteristics inferred from shape analysis. The controllers capture the natural degrees of freedom of individual components and thus provide an intuitive user interface for editing. A typical model usually results in a moderate number of controllers, allowing easy establishment of semantic relations among them by automatic shape analysis supplemented with user interaction. We propose a component-wise propagation algorithm to automatically preserve the established inter-relations while maintaining the defining characteristics of individual controllers and respecting the user-specified modeling constraints. We extend these ideas to a hierarchical setup, allowing the user to adjust the tool complexity with respect to the desired modeling complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on a wide range of man-made models with structural features, often containing multiple connected pieces.", "paper_title": "Component-wise Controllers for Structure-Preserving Shape Manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000289996100034"}
