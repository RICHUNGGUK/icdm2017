First, we demonstrate that the interference between the localized and propagating SPs plays an important role in the optical transmission through arrays of sub-wavelength holes. The observed phenomena belong to the category of plasmonic Fano effects. Second, we show that the transmission enhancement originates not only from the coupling between the incident light and the excited SPs but also from the coupling among these SPs in multiple nano-aperture stacks. Finally, we demonstrate that metallic plates with narrow slit arrays can become transparent within extremely broad spectral bandwidths, and high transmission efficiency is insensitive to the thickness of the metal. This phenomenon explicitly demonstrates the conversion between light and SPs. These investigations provide guidelines to develop many novel materials and devices, such as transparent conducting panels, antireflective solar cells, and other broadband metamaterials.", "paper_title": "Making structured metals transparent for broadband electromagnetic waves", "paper_id": "WOS:000328295500004"}
