Experimental and numerical tools have been used to predict the behavior of pollutant species dispersion in the atmosphere. A software has been developed based on the control-volume based on the finite element method in order to obtain two-dimensional simulations of Navier-Stokes equations and heat or mass transportation in regions with obstacles, varying position of the pollutant source. Numeric results of some applications were obtained and, whenever possible, compared with literature results showing satisfactory accordance.
