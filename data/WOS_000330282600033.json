The key assumption that we make is that the nodes do not know their relative or absolute locations and that they do not have an identity. For the Aloha MAC protocol, we first describe a protocol in which the MAX value becomes available at the origin in O(root n/ log n) slots (bit-periods) with high probability. This is within a constant factor of that required by the best coordinated protocol. A minimal structure (knowledge of hop-distance from the sink) is imposed on the network and with this structure, we describe a protocol for pipelined computation of MAX that achieves a rate of Omega(1/(log n)(2)). Finally, we show how the protocol for computation of MAX can be modified to achieve approximate computation of the histogram. The approximate histogram can be computed in O(n(7/2)(log n)(1/2)) bit-periods with high probability.", "paper_title": "On Distributed Function Computation in Structure-Free Random Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600033"}
