According to the M2M service characteristics, it proposes the utility function, which forms a convex optimization problem that maximizes the utility of M2M service and can be solved by the Lagrange multiplier. The simulation results show the proposed method convergence, and it can achieve load balance with maximized throughput and minimized cost.", "paper_title": "A Utility-Based Rate Allocation of M2M Service in Heterogeneous Wireless Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000325321500001"}
