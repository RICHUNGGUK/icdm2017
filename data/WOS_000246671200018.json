A prior probability is formulated based on the energy lying outside the span of principal components identified in a higher-dimensional feature space. This is used to regularize the reconstruction of the high-resolution image. We demonstrate with experiments that including higher-order correlations results in significant improvements.", "paper_title": "Super-resolution of face images using kernel PCA-based prior", "paper_id": "WOS:000246671200018"}
