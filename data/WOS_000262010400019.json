To reduce duplicated memory accesses to P and B pictures, we employ a four-way set-associative cache in which its index bits are composed of horizontal and vertical address bits of the Frame buffer and each line stores in 8 x 2 pixel data in the reference frames. Moreover, we alleviate the data fragmentation problem by selecting its line size that equals the minimum access size of the DDR SDRAM. The bandwidth of the optimized cache averaged over five QCIF IBBP image sequences requires only 129% of the essential bandwidth of an H.264/AVC MC.", "paper_title": "Cache Optimization for H.264/AVC Motion Compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000262010400019"}
