We call such a sensor network-a wireless sensor network with a limited infrastructural support-a hybrid sensor network. The wires act as short cuts to bring down the average hop count of the network, resulting in a reduced energy dissipation per node. Our results indicate that adding a few wires to a wireless sensor network can not only reduce the average energy expenditure per sensor node, but also the non-uniformity in the energy expenditure across the sensor nodes.", "paper_title": "A Case for Hybrid Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000260463100010"}
