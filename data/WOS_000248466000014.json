Nonetheless, these studies tend to confine to a simple scheduling scheme and study the traffic in a single-class environment or the highest priority traffic in a multi-class environment. This is rather restrictive. In this paper, we propose a new general service scheme to service flows. This scheme is represented by a Latency-Rate Max-Min service curve (LRMMSC). Subsequently, for a network of LRMMSC, we prove the existence of tight bounds on end-to-end queuing delay and buffer size needed for loss-free packet delivery, provided that all flows obey a given source rate condition in the form of their route interference. Our approach has two salient features: (1) the general nature of the concept of service curve enables the service scheme to be implemented by many well-known scheduling disciplines, (2) the general network model adopted with no constraints on the manner of packet queuing makes the results applicable to many complex networks. In addition, we have also derived a concise expression of end-to-end delay bound that depends only on the service offered to the buffers containing the considered flow. This is very useful in practice as the expression is simple and requires minimum amount of information input. Simulation experiments are conducted to verify the LRMMSC model. The analytical and simulation results exhibit close resemblance. In addition, the advantage of LRMMSC scheme in providing maximum end-to-end delay is also demonstrated. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
