The yeast needs to switch from glucose to galactose metabolism as required, by transcriptional regulation of the respective metabolic enzymes. This regulation is achieved mainly through the GAL genetic switch, in addition to glucose repression mechanism. This study integrates the two metabolic pathways with the genetic regulatory circuit using the GEPASI 3.30 simulation environment, and investigates the model behavior under various nutrient conditions. Our system is successful in achieving transcriptional upregulation of the galactose metabolizing enzymes as required. Under high glucose and high galactose concentrations, the in silico yeast chooses to metabolize glucose first, after which it resorts to using the galactose available. We also show what the preferred storage macromolecules are in different metabolic pathways. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
