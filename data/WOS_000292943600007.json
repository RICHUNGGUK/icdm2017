By enabling remote collaboration between media professionals, networked computing increases efficiency and reduces costs. This practice creates a virtual organization in which media and media editing devices are tightly synchronized between remote locations. An experimental system meeting these needs is described. Two successful demonstrations of this system have taken place, in which media assets and control information were streamed between several locations using a secure managed network. The practicality and decreasing expense of this system have led many to predict its widespread adoption in the near future.
