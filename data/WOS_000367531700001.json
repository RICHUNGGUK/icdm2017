To find the a priori non-dominated paths in this type of network, three comparison criteria based on the uncertain measure, namely, deterministic dominance rule, first-order uncertain dominance rule and uncertain expected value dominance rule, are proposed to generate non-dominated paths in a single time interval and a time period, as more than one path may exist between an origin and destination for a given departure time. The proposed comparison methods are then applied to solving a simple uncertain time-varying network. The computational results verify the efficiency of three dominance rules for finding non-dominated paths.", "paper_title": "Criteria for the a Priori Shortest Path Generation in Uncertain Time-Varying Transportation Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000367531700001"}
