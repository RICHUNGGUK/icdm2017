On the other hand, the global network structure, including \"indirect\" links between researchers, has not yet been sufficiently studied. This study analyzes researchers' activities from the viewpoints considering their roles in the global structures of co-authorship networks, and compares the co-authorship networks between the theoretical and application areas in computer science. The modified HITS algorithm is used to calculate the two types of importance of researchers in co-authorship networks, i.e., the importance as the leader and that as the follower.", "paper_title": "Comparative analysis of co-authorship networks considering authors' roles in collaboration: Differences between the theoretical and application areas", "paper_id": "WOS:000239300600021"}
