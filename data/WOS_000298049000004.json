One of the more sensitive phases of this process is the agreement of the actors in the network regarding the performance evaluation model whose design is considered of great importance in the research literature. This paper proposes a method for the design of performance evaluation systems in collaborative networks through an innovative combination of performance information classification and multi-criteria decision model. The method is implemented in a web-based collaborative platform that enables the members of a collaborative network to efficiently achieve specific performance models that result from a collective and negotiated construction.", "paper_title": "Performance Management in Collaborative Networks: a Methodological Proposal", "paper_id": "WOS:000298049000004"}
