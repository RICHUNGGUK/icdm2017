Our framework allows the exact evaluation of the convolution integral with a linear function defined on the polytopes. The filter is a spherically symmetric polynomial of any order, supporting approximations to refined variants such as the Mitchell-Netravali filter family. This enables high-quality rasterization of triangles and tetrahedra with linearly interpolated vertex values to regular and non-regular grids. A closed form solution of the convolution is presented and an efficient implementation on the GPU using DirectX and CUDA C is described.", "paper_title": "Analytic Anti-Aliasing of Linear Functions on Polytopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000304901400013"}
