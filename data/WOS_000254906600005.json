Two kinds of novel optical fast link release mechanisms (Ahead and Timeout Release) are presented for an optical-link establishment. They can dramatically reduce the blocking probability. For dynamic routing detection, a new kind of dynamic weighted Dijkstra algorithm (DW-DA) along with dynamic optical link load balancing is described. A variable mutation and crossover rates of a genetic algorithm (VMCR-GA) is used for fast wavelength assignment with two-novel-wavelength assignment rules in a wavelength relationship graph, which can reduce the necessary wavelengths and link establishment time. Through simulation giving the blocking probability and the time for link establishment on several well-known networks, the effectiveness of this method has been verified. The blocking probability of the network can be reduced significantly below that of normal routing and wavelength assignment (RWA). Furthermore, the calculating time for reaching the minimum blocking probability can be reduced dramatically.", "paper_title": "An efficient dynamic distributed optical link establish method in intelligent all-optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254906600005"}
