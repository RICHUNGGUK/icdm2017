Fuzzy simulations are used for performing arithmetic operations on interactive fuzzy numbers. The process of selecting investment projects takes into account statistical and economic dependencies of projects. The paper contains comparison of results obtained in selection of efficient portfolios of investment projects in a situation where parameters in calculation of effectiveness were expressed in form of interactive fuzzy numbers or probability distributions.
