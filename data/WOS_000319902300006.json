The prudent harnessing of such agents can offer software engineers additional tools in their efforts to construct and deploy innovative mobile services or to realize practical smart environments. However, documented results of comprehensive evaluations of mobile services conducted in real world environments are rare; evaluations of systems that harness the agent paradigm are almost non-existent. This paper seeks to remedy this deficiency. It is hoped that the results of this study will encourage researchers to reflect further on the potential and implications of harnessing the intelligent agent paradigm in the broad Ambient Intelligence domain, from a software engineering perspective, and as an enabler of intelligent interaction.", "paper_title": "Smart environment interaction: A user assessment of embedded agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000319902300006"}
