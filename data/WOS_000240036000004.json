These signatures are formulated in terms of geometric and structural constraints between segments, as parallelisms, straight angles, etc. After representing vectorized line drawings with attributed graphs, our approach works with a multi-scale representation of these graphs, retrieving the features that are expressive enough to create the signature. Since the proposed method integrates a distortion model, it can be used either with scanned and then vectorized drawings or with hand-drawn sketches.", "paper_title": "Symbol spotting in technical drawings using vectorial signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000004"}
