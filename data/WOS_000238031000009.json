Three different circuit conditions are considered and design relationships are provided and discussed. Finally, the proposed approach, which uses the circle method, is successfully employed to design a Ka-band (26-32 GHz) linear amplifier with gain equal to 8 dB and return loss greater than 10 dB for the considered band.
