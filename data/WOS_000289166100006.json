Unfortunately, an important piece of cognitive radio, namely, signal separation, is missing. The goal of this paper is to stimulate the research interests of incorporating signal separation into cognitive radio. This paper will argue that the signal separation component is not only critical but also feasible. We starts with an integrated view of cognitive radio and software radio architecture, and then a physical layer architecture based on blind signal separation is examined. It will be shown that the signal separation component can serve for many purposes, including separating different kinds of signals and performing multiuser detection. The performance is evaluated by computer simulations and the feasibility is discussed through complexity analysis.", "paper_title": "Blind Signal Separation for Cognitive Radio", "paper_id": "WOS:000289166100006"}
