It consists of decentralized receding horizon planners that reside on each vehicle to navigate to individual target positions. A routing algorithm which modify the network topology based on the position of the robots and the limited range of transmitters and receivers, enables to reduce the communication link failures. A comparative study between the proposed algorithm and other existing algorithms is provided in order to show the advantages especially in terms of traveling time and communication link failure.", "paper_title": "A Motion Planning Framework with Connectivity Management for Multiple Cooperative Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000338347900011"}
