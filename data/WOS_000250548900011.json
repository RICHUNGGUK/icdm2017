While curriculum coherence can be jeopardized by poor curriculum design, misalignment between module content and/or misalignment between module or course aims can cause serious coherence issues over time. Misalignment of this type is exacerbated by the traditional processes of curriculum (re)design, which rely heavily on the (singular) interpretation of highly abstract documents, such as module syllabi and course specifications - often produced by curriculum designers in isolation. To improve curriculum coherence, this paper examines the use of a programme management framework as a means of (a) 'humanizing' the abstract aims and goals of curricula schemes and (b) managing the delivery and evolution of curricula in relation to the stakeholders in the process of delivery. The practical use of the framework is examined in the context of a Masters-level course in 'Information Systems Management'. An action research approach is used to demonstrate the practical utility of the framework in terms of (a) improving communication of curricula, (b) improving the coherence between modules and between modules and course and (c) removing content redundancy. Analysis of outcomes demonstrates a significant positive impact of the use of the framework in relation to the above points from the perspective of all stakeholders. Guidelines are presented that generalize the findings in order that key practices may be adopted by others.", "paper_title": "A programme management approach for ensuring curriculum coherence in IS (higher) education", "paper_id": "WOS:000250548900011"}
