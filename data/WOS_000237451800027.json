Firstly, using the techniques of Region Growing, we divide the image in blocks. The compression-decompression method is based on bivariate interpolation. Error estimates in terms of the modulus of continuity of the original image are obtained. Experimental results illustrate the performances of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Image file compression using region growing and interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451800027"}
