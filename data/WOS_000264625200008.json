In 2004, Jiang et al. proposed a key exchange protocol for STBs and smart cards based upon Schnorr's digital signature protocol and a one-way hash function. This paper, however, demonstrates that Jiang et al.'s protocol is vulnerable to an impersonation attack and does not provide perfect forward secrecy. In addition, in order to isolate such problems, vie present a new secure key exchange protocol based on a one-way hash function and Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.", "paper_title": "Robust Key Exchange Protocol between Set-Top Box and Smart Card in DTV Broadcasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000264625200008"}
