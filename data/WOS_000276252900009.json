The proposed compensation method ensures the stability of the feedback loop and the sufficient phase margin of the LDO regulator. Besides, the transient response become faster. The analysis of the stability is derived to solidify the proposed design. The proposed design is implemented using TSMC 0.35 mu m 2P4M CMOS process. The results verify the performance and the stability on silicon. The power supply rejection ratio is 25 dB @ [200 Hz, 3 MHz], [50 Omega, 500 Omega] provided that the input voltage varies from 4 to 5 V.", "paper_title": "A linear LDO regulator with modified NMCF frequency compensation independent of off-chip capacitor and ESR", "paper_id": "WOS:000276252900009"}
