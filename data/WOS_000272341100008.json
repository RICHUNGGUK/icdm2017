The proposed SRM spectrum architecture uses more efficient resource allocation techniques where flexible spectrum access and usage leads to more capable and faster services with high quality-of-service (QoS) giving more user satisfaction than conventional networks. In this context., short-term (ST) spectrum assignment is proposed where spectral resources are exchanged between WINNER radio access networks (RANs) on a fast basis, leading to a better utilization of the spectrum. Moreover, multi-band scheduler (MBS) and base station (BS) to BS communications are presented as key enablers for efficient dynamic spectrum management. Performance gains of ST spectrum assignment are analyzed in a multi-network, multi-cell environment based on realistic traffic patterns while taking inter-cell interference into account. The results confirm that spectrum availability and utilization can be considerably enhanced.
