This paper proposes a classifier combination based source identification strategy for cell phone images. To identify the outlier cell phone models of the training sets in multi-class classifier, a one-class classifier is orderly used in the framework. Feature vectors including color filter array (CFA) interpolation coefficients estimation and multi-feature fusion is employed to verify the effectiveness of the classifier combination strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that for different feature sets, our method presents high accuracy of source identification both for the cell phone in the training sets and the outliers.", "paper_title": "Classifier Combination Based Source Identification for Cell Phone Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000370180200019"}
