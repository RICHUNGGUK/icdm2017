The use of view dependency is not effective for multi-view video because each view has different intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. In this paper, a modified distributed multi-view coding method is presented that applies illumination compensation when generating side information. The proposed encoder codes DC values of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients separately by entropy coding. The proposed decoder can generate more accurate side information by using the transmitted DC coefficients to compensate for illumination changes. Furthermore, AC coefficients are coded with conventional entropy or channel coders depending on the frequency band. We found that the proposed algorithm is about 0.1 similar to 0.5 dB better than conventional algorithms.", "paper_title": "Distributed Video Coding for Illumination Compensation of Multi-view Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000285646500014"}
