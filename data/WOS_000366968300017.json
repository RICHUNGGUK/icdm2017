This paper proposes a Double-layer Heartbeat Detection Model and a Double-layer Heartbeat Detection Algorithm (DLHB) orienting to embedded heterogeneous clusters to obtain high availability of embedded heterogeneous clusters. This algorithm divides the nodes in the embedded heterogeneous cluster into different areas by their physical positions. In each node area, a node is selected as the master control node. The inter-area detection uses heartbeat ring mechanism. The intra-area detection can only be made among master control nodes. The experiment results show that, DLHB is more accurate in prediction compared with DHB, and can detect faults concurrently occurring on multiple nodes with less time compared with the heartbeat ring algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Double-Layer Heartbeat Detection Algorithm Orienting to Embedded Heterogeneous Cluster", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968300017"}
