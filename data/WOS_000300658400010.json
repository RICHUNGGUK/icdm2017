Typically, a WECS is composed by a variable speed wind turbine coupled with a direct driven permanent magnet (DDPM) synchronous generator. This configuration offers a considerable flexibility in design and operation of the power unit, as its output is delivered to the grid through a fully controlled frequency converter. Here, a new control scheme to regulate electrical and mechanical quantities of such generation unit is proposed, aimed both at reaching optimal performances in terms of power delivered to the grid and at providing the voltage support ancillary service at the point of common coupling. The control scheme is derived resorting to the feedback linearization (FBL) technique, which allows both decoupling and linearization of a non linear multiple input multiple output system. Several numerical simulations are then performed in order to show how the flexibility of the DDPM wind generator can be fully exploited, thanks to the use of the FBL approach, which assures independent control of each variable and significant simplifications in controller synthesis and system operation, thus making it easier to integrate WECS into modern day smart grids.", "paper_title": "A Feedback Linearization Control Scheme for the Integration of Wind Energy Conversion Systems into Distribution Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000300658400010"}
