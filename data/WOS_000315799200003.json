If applied to a state vertical bar psi) whose maximum overlap with a product state is 1 - epsilon, the test passes with probability 1 - Theta(epsilon), regardless of n or the local dimensions of the individual systems. The test uses two copies of |psi). We prove correctness of this test as a special case of a more general result regarding stability of maximum output purity of the depolarizing channel. A key application of the test is to quantum Merlin-Arthur games with multiple Merlins, where we obtain several structural results that had been previously conjectured, including the fact that efficient soundness amplification is possible and that two Merlins can simulate many Merlins: QMA(k) = QMA(2) for k >= 2. Building on a previous result of Aaronson et al., this implies that there is an efficient quantum algorithm to verify 3-SAT with constant soundness, given two unentangled proofs of (O) over tilde(root n) qubits. We also show how QMA(2) with log -sized proofs is equivalent to a large number of problems, some related to quantum information (such as testing separability of mixed states) as well as problems without any apparent connection to quantum mechanics (such as computing injective tensor norms of 3-index tensors). As a consequence, we obtain many hardness-of-approximation results, as well as potential algorithmic applications of methods for approximating QMA(2) acceptance probabilities. Finally, our test can also be used to construct an efficient test for determining whether a unitary operator is a tensor product, which is a generalization of classical linearity testing.", "paper_title": "Testing Product States, Quantum Merlin-Arthur Games and Tensor Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000315799200003"}
