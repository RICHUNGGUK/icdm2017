In this paper, extended Kalman filter is applied to train state-space recurrent neural networks for nonlinear system identification. In order to improve robustness of Kalman filter algorithm dead-zone robust modification is applied to Kalman filter. Lyapunov method is used to prove that the Kalman filter training is stable.
