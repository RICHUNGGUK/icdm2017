The explicit formulation of the least committed basic belief density (bbd) of the multivariate Gaussian pdf is provided in the transferable belief model (TBM) framework. Beliefs are then assigned to hyperspheres and the bbd follows a chi(2) distribution. Two applications are also presented. The first one deals with model based classification in the joint speed-acceleration feature space. The second is devoted to joint target tracking and classification: the tracking part is performed using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, while the classification is carried out within the developed TBM scheme.
