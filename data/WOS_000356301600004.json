When the mutual information rate of the channel is concave with respect to the chosen parameterization, the proposed algorithm proves to be convergent to the capacity of the channel almost surely with the derived convergence rate. We also discuss the convergence behavior of the algorithm without the concavity assumption.", "paper_title": "A Randomized Algorithm for the Capacity of Finite-State Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000356301600004"}
