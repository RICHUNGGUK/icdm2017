To generate more session keys at one time for different applications, Li et al. proposed a password-based three-party authenticated multiple key exchange (3PAMKE) protocol for wireless mobile networks. They claimed that their protocol could withstand various attacks. In this paper, we will show Li et al.'s protocol is not secure off-line password guessing. Furthermore, we proposed an improved 3PAMKE protocol to overcome weakness in Li et al.'s protocol. Security analysis and performance analysis shows our protocol not only overcomes security weakness, but also has better performance. Therefore, our protocol is more suitable for wireless mobile networks.", "paper_title": "An efficient password-based three-party authenticated multiple key exchange protocol for wireless mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342468200015"}
