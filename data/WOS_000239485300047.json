Its security can be further improved if the number of images to be simultaneously encrypted increases. However, the BSS decryption speed will correspondingly decrease since the computational load of the BSS algorithms usually has nonlinear relation with the number of the source signals. To solve the problem, this paper presents a fast decryption algorithm based on adaptive noise cancellation by using the knowledge of the key images, which are used in the BSS-based method and available at the receiving side. As a result, the number of the source signals for the fast BSS decryption is decreased in half, and the decryption time is considerably reduced. Both computer simulations and performance analyses demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A fast decryption algorithm for BSS-based image encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300047"}
