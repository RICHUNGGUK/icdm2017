We divide the bandwidth management problem into two subproblems: ( 1) grant sizing and ( 2) grant scheduling. We then apply a scheduling theoretical approach to find a best scheduler for WDM EPONs. We show by means of extensive simulations that a multidimensional scheduling approach using results from scheduling theory can provide much better bandwidth management by means of better wavelength utilization than a static wavelength assignment. We also show that an online scheduling approach can provide lower queueing delays than a cyclical offline scheduling approach. We conclude with some specific guidance on future research on bandwidth management for WDM EPONs.
