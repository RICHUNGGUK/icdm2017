This paper considers electronic funds transfer (EFT) systems, where computing resources must be used efficiently in order to achieve high availability and reliability for a high quality of the offered service. The design of fault-tolerant computer systems requires their model-based performability evaluation. A stochastic Petri net model of EFT architecture and behavior is presented to evaluate the impact of availability and reliability issues on computational resources. An industrial case study shows the practical usability of the proposed models and techniques.", "paper_title": "Performability modeling of electronic funds transfer systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000289289300001"}
