In this paper, we present a novel bio-inspired trusted routing protocol (B-iTRP) based on artificial immune system (AIS), ant colony optimization (ACO) and Physarum optimization (PO). For trust mechanism, B-iTRP monitors neighbors' behavior in real time and then assesses neighbors' trusts based on AIS. For routing strategy, each node proactively finds routes to the Sink based on ACO. When a backward ant is on the way to return source, it senses the energy residual and trust value of each node on the discovered route, and calculates the link trust and link energy of the route. Moreover, B-iTRP also assesses the availability of route based on PO to maintain the route table. Simulation results show how B-iTRP can achieve the effective performance compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Novel Bio-inspired Trusted Routing Protocol for Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333159800005"}
