We used molecular dynamics and molecular docking methods to predict such interactions and to compare with experimentally measured metabolisms. Insight II and Discover Studio 2.5 were used to carry out the docking of these substrates into CYP2B6 to explore the critical residues and interaction energies of the complexes. Phe297, Glu301, Thr302 and Val367 were identified as major drug-binding residues, which is consistent with previous data on site-directed mutagenesis, crystallography structure, and from modeling and docking studies. In addition, our docking results suggest that nonpolar amino acid clusters and heme also participate in binding to mediate drug oxidative metabolism. The binding modes of the five clinically relevant substrates mentioned above for metabolism on CYP2B6 are presented.", "paper_title": "Analysis of clinically relevant substrates of CYP2B6 enzyme by computational methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000296301700013"}
