The SKLPCA is a non-linear and supervised subspace learning method, which maps the data into a potentially much higher dimension feature space by kernel trick and preserves the geometric structure of data according to prior class-label information. SKLPCA can discover the nonlinear structure of face images and enhance local within-class relations. Experimental results on ORL, Yale, CAS-PEAL and CMU PIE databases demonstrate that SKLPCA outperforms EigenFaces, LPCA and KPCA.", "paper_title": "SUPERVISED KERNEL LOCALLY PRINCIPLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS FOR FACE RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000316032800006"}
