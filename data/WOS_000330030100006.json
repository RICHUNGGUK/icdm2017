It is available for nonlinear dynamic system with uncertainties. The TFNN system can construct and learn its knowledge base from the input-output training data firstly. Thus, a nonlinear system can be represented by several if-then rules with Gaussian membership functions and TSK-type consequent parts. Based on the learned TFNN system, a robust fuzzy controller is proposed, which combines linear matrix inequality-based fuzzy controller and fuzzy sliding model controller. Rigorous proof of asymptotic stability for the closed-loop system is presented via Lyapunov stability theorem. Several examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear control of benchmark problems using TSK-type fuzzy neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000330030100006"}
