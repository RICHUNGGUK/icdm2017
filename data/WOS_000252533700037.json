The FFHMIPv6 uses the flow state information to redirect the traffic flow to a new location. This makes it possible that the reception of packets simultaneously with the BU registration process, thus minimizing the delay experienced in the handover. But it does not consider the route optimization. In this paper, a new flow-based fast handover method is proposed which enhanced the existing flow-based fast handover method to support route optimization. The analysis shows that this scheme has a better performance than the existing FFHMIPv6 scheme. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
