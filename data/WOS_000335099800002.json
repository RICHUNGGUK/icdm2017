We find that the memristive connection weights have a certain relationship with the stability of the system. Some criteria are obtained to guarantee that memristive neural networks have strong noise tolerance capability. Two kinds of controllers are designed so that the memristive neural networks with perturbations can converge to the equilibrium points, which evoke human's memory patterns. The analysis in this paper employs the differential inclusions theory and the Lyapunov functional method. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of our results.
