Here, each SPH particle is considered as a computational point that represents a specific part of the fluid. To overcome non-physical oscillations that usually arise in standard WCSPH, we modified the mass conservation equation by using a numerical filter. This modification is based on the difference between two discretization schemes used for the term del center dot(del P/rho). Furthermore, a new implementation of wall boundary condition in SPH is introduced. This condition is imposed on the pressure of wall boundary particles to ensure that the acceleration of each boundary particle in normal direction to the wall is zero. Thus, no penetration through walls will occur. To examine the performance of the modified method, we solved a series of two-dimensional incompressible internal flow benchmark problems. By comparing the result with analytical solutions and the results of the standard WCSPH, we show that the use of consistent schemes in conjunction with the proposed numerical filter improves both accuracy and speed of the numerical method.
