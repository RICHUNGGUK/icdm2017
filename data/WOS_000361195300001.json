Asymmetric model is a type of bilinear model which models a system in the most concise way. But seldom there are works exploring the applications of asymmetric bilinear model on face recognition problem with illumination changes. In this work, we propose enhanced asymmetric model for illumination-robust face recognition. Instead of initializing the factor probabilities randomly, we initialize them with nearest neighbor method and optimize them for the test data. Above that, we update the factor model to be identified. We validate the proposed method on a designed data sample and extended Yale B dataset. The experiment results show that the enhanced asymmetric models give promising results and good recognition accuracies.", "paper_title": "Enhanced Asymmetric Bilinear Model for Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000361195300001"}
