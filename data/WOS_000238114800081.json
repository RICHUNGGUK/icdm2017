In this paper, we present a novel multiple access scheme, referred to as CDM-FH-OFDMA, which is the extension of FH-OFDMA with code division multiplexing (CDM). This scheme can exploit the frequency diversity gain without the aid of channel coding. And it also can be employed in the multi-cell environment with one frequency reuse factor. Computer simulation demonstrates effectiveness of CDM-FH-OFDMA and the conclusion is followed.", "paper_title": "Performance and analysis of CDM-FH-OFDMA for Broadband Wireless Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800081"}
