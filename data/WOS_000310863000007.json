The system under consideration is subject to stochastic uncertainties or multiplicative noises. The process noise is assumed to be one-step autocorrelated. For each subsystem, the measurement noise is one-step autocorrelated, and the process noise and the measurement noise are two-step cross-correlated. An optimal robust Kalman-type recursive filter is first designed for each subsystem. Then, based on the newly obtained optimal robust Kalman-type recursive filter, a distributed weighted robust Kalman filter fusion algorithm is derived for uncertain systems with multiple sensors. The distributed fusion algorithm involves a recursive computation of the filtering error cross-covariance matrix between any two subsystems. Compared with the centralized Kalman filter, the distributed weighted robust Kalman filter developed in this paper has stronger fault-tolerance ability. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
