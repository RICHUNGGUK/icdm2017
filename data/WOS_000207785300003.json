To achieve this objective in the context of continuing parallel development of multiple data centres, in 2003 several actors in the realm of space plasmas created the international consortium Space Physics Archive Search and Extract (SPASE). Since 2005 US participation in SPASE has been supported by NASA, and early in 2006 NASA funded five new Virtual Observatories to cater for different aspects of solar system plasma science. This paper outlines the current status of the SPASE effort, the opportunities it offers, its specificities with respect to other parts of the astronomical virtual observatory, and the possibilities it offers for space weather.", "paper_title": "Virtual observatories for space and solar physics research", "paper_id": "WOS:000207785300003"}
