It is first detailed and analysed for the 2D linear advection equation and then applied to the 2D shallow water equations. The dimensional splitting technique allows us to extend the ideas developed in the 1D case related to source terms, boundary conditions and the reduction of the time step in the presence of large discontinuities. The boundary conditions treatment as well as the wet/dry fronts in the case of the 2D shallow water equations require extra effort. The proposed scheme is tested on linear and non-linear equations and systems, with and without source terms. The numerical results are compared with those of the conventional scheme as well as with analytical solutions and experimental data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
