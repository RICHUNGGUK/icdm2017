One approach is to model the set of possible sequencings with a graph, but the process of designing and maintaining the graph may be tedious and error-prone. This paper presents some ideas to overcome this, inpired by swarm intelligence techniques. Problems that may arise, as well as possible solutions, are presented.", "paper_title": "Some ideas for a collaborative search of the optimal learning path", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300064"}
