In this investigation, seven levels of workload were induced using an arithmetic task, and the entropy of wavelet coefficients extracted from EEG signals is shown to distinguish all seven levels. For a subject-independent multi-channel classification scheme, the entropy features achieved high accuracy, up to 98% for channels from the frontal lobes, in the delta frequency band. This suggests that a smaller number of EEG channels in only one frequency band can be deployed for an effective EEG-based workload classification system. Together with analysis based on phase locking between channels, these results consistently suggest increased synchronization of neural responses for higher load levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
