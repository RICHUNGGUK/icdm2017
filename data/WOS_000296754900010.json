In this paper, we study the problem of reliable multi-path routing with bandwidth and delay constraints. Considering the link loss rate, which affects the actual bandwidth, we search a set of source-destination paths such that the valid aggregated bandwidth satisfies the requirements and meanwhile the maximum delay is minimized. Since this multi-path routing problem is NP-hard, we first propose a heuristic algorithm as the benchmark, and then present a polynomial time approximation algorithm to obtain a (1+epsilon)-approximation solution. Simulations on well-known Internet topologies and random architectures verify the performance of our algorithms.", "paper_title": "RELIABLE MULTI-PATH ROUTING WITH BANDWIDTH AND DELAY CONSTRAINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296754900010"}
