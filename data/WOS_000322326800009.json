A description of the special architecture and programming required by the Cell processor motivates the methodology to develop optimized implementations for this platform. This process involves parallelization, data structure reorganization, explicit transfers of data and computation vectorization. Our implementation, tested using a realistic problem, achieves very good speedups with respect to the sequential execution on a standard CPU.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of pollutant transport in a shallow-water system on the Cell heterogeneous processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000322326800009"}
