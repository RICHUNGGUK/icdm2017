Hubs are facilities that work as consolidation, connecting, and switching points for flows between stipulated origins and destinations. While there are few review papers on hub location problems, the most recent one (Alumur and Kara, 2008. Network hub location problems: The state of the art. European Journal of Operational Research, 190, 1-21) considers solely studies on network-type hub location models prior to early 2007. Therefore, this paper focuses on reviewing the most recent advances in HLP from 2007 up to now. In this paper, a review of all variants of HLPs (i.e., network, continuous, and discrete HLPs) is provided. In particular, mathematical models, solution methods, main specifications, and applications of HLPs are discussed. Furthermore, some case studies illustrating real-world applications of HLPs are briefly introduced. At the end, future research directions and trends will be presented.
