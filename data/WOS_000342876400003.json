The theoretical basis of the method is given and its performance is illustrated by means of its application to different control problems showing that our proposal is able to overcome the problems generated by dynamic nature of the process or by physical changes of the system which originate important modifications in the process. A comparative experimental study is presented in order to show the more stable behavior of the proposed method in several working ranks.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Inverse Control Using an Online Learning Algorithm for Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342876400003"}
