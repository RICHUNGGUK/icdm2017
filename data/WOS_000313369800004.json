Fuzzy inference system has been adapted to avoid uncertainly, imprecision and vagueness in experimentation as well as in data analysis by traditional Taguchi based optimization approach. Detailed methodology and unique features of the proposed method has been highlighted through a case study. The said approach can efficiently be used in off-line quality control of any production process as well as automation of the process.", "paper_title": "Optimization of bead geometry of submerged arc weld using fuzzy based desirability function approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000313369800004"}
