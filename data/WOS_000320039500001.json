The proposed method aims at improving the accuracy of recommendation prediction by considering the social aspect of experts' behaviors. For this purpose, content-based profiles of experts are first constructed by crawling online resources. A semantic kernel is built by using the background knowledge derived from Wikipedia repository. The semantic kernel is employed to enrich the experts' profiles. Experts' social communities are detected by applying the social network analysis and using factors such as experience, background, knowledge level, and personal preferences. By this way, hidden social relationships can be discovered among individuals. Identifying communities is used for determining a particular member's value according to the general pattern behavior of the community that the individual belongs to. Representative members of a community are then identified using the eigenvector centrality measure. Finally, a recommendation is made to relate an information item, for which a user is seeking an expert, to the representatives of the most relevant community. Such a semantic social network-based expert recommendation system can provide benefits to both experts and users if one looks at the recommendation from two perspectives. From the user's perspective, she/he is provided with a group of experts who can help the user with her/his information needs. From the expert's perspective she/he has been assigned to work on relevant information items that fall under her/his expertise and interests.", "paper_title": "A semantic social network-based expert recommender system", "paper_id": "WOS:000320039500001"}
