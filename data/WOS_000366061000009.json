A 3D monitoring system based on a measuring robot and Geomos is utilized to collect data. The monitoring data of 44 cycles of Dagushan and Yanqianshan open-pit iron mines in Anshan City are employed as the data source. Large amounts of data are calculated and compared, and a quantitative analysis of various factors that influence the accuracy of measuring robot is performed. Data calculation shows that the proposed mathematical meteorological correction model and directional deviation correction method can effectively improve the accuracy of measuring robot. The corrected data can accurately represent the displacement of monitoring points, which provides important real-time warning of open-pit slope landslides. Methods to improve the accuracy of measuring robot are studied to increase data reliability. The nature of the data and the factors that affect the quality of data are analyzed.", "paper_title": "Method to Improve the Accuracy of Slope Monitoring Data Based on a Measuring Robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000366061000009"}
