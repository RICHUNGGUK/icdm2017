The web mail used in various industries has two facets: convenience for information transfer, and vulnerability to leakage of confidential information. Monitoring blocking and logging of web mail are a few of the major security methods that have been employed for prevention of such leakage. However, application of HTTP over SSL (HTTPs) to web mail systems such as Gmail has revealed the limitations of existing web mail security methods in controlling web mail. Most importantly, the existing method cannot control encrypted contents of web mail. In this paper, we propose a method that controls HTTPs web mail contents by using a proxy server and distributing the secure socket layer (SSL) certificate to user' s PC. The proxy server plays the Certificate Authority role between the users' PCs and the web mail server, distributing its own SSL certificates to the users' PCs. The SSL certificate is the key to encryption and decryption of HTTPs web mail contents. Using the protocol derived in the present study, HTTPs web mail contents can be controlled as an effect of content-awareness. Network DLP is effected by monitoring, blocking and logging suspicious mail contents using HTTPs.", "paper_title": "Content-based control of HTTPs mail for implementation of IT-convergence security environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000332668100003"}
