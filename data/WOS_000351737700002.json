WiFi Mesh is indicated as the superior technology for smart grid applications at feeder level based upon availability and cost considerations. In this context, we provide a model for evaluating the transmission delay and energy consumption in the WiFi network, and relate these quantities to the reliability of message transmission of the network. The Energy Consumption Aware Shortest Path (ECASP) algorithm is developed to search the shortest delay routing for each message and keep updating the available energy capacity of each communication device. Simulation procedures are presented to get estimates of the delay of different types of messages and compute the communication network lifetime and message transmission reliability. The proposed approach is exemplified with reference to a realistic distribution system of a smart grid, with three types of messages exchanged at the feeder level.", "paper_title": "Reliability analysis of smart grid communication network by simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351737700002"}
