Images are protected and any modification to an image is detected using a novel hybrid scheme combining a two-pass logistic map with Hamming code. For security purposes, the two-pass logistic map scheme contains a private key to resist the vector quantization (VQ) attacks even though the embedding scheme is block independent. To ensure image integrity, watermarks are embedded into the to-be-protected images which are generated using Hamming code technique. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has satisfactory protection ability and can detect and locate various malicious tampering via image insertion, erasing, burring, sharpening, contrast modification, and even though burst bits. Additionally, experiments prove that the proposed scheme successfully resists VQ attacks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
