The proposed system is implemented to provide more subscribers with an enhanced mobile IPTV service considering their wireless link states. In the proposed system, the base layer of the IPTV stream is transmitted with the sparsest modulation scheme and the lowest coding rate to provide IPTV service of minimum quality to as many subscribers as possible. And some parts of the enhancement layer are transmitted with the modulation scheme and the coding rate adaptive to wireless link states of subscribers. Basically, we pursue an efficient tradeoff between the number of subscribers that receive the enhancement layer stream and their IPTV service quality. Finally, experimental results are provided to show the performance of the proposed system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
