It implements improved calculations of the Higgs-boson pole masses, notably a full treatment of the 4 x 4 neutral Higgs propagator matrix including the Goldstone boson and a more complete treatment of threshold effects in self-energies and Yukawa couplings, improved treatments of two-body Higgs decays, some important three-body decays, and two-loop Higgs-mediated contributions to electric dipole moments. CPsuperH2.0 also implements an integrated treatment of several B-meson observables, including the branching ratios of B-s -> mu(+)mu(-), B-d -> tau(+)tau(-), B-u -> tau(v), B -> X-s gamma and the latter's CP-violating asymmetry Acp. and the supersymmetric contributions to the B-s.d(0) - (B) over bar (0)(s.d) mass differences. These additions make CPsuperH2.0 an attractive integrated tool for analyzing supersymmetric CP and flavour physics as well as searches for new physics at high-energy colliders such as the Tevatron, LHC and linear colliders.", "paper_title": "CPsuperH2.0: An improved computational tool for Higgs phenomenology in the MSSM with explicit CP violation", "paper_id": "WOS:000263448600018"}
