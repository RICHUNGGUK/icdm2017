In this article, position estimation is studied for UWB systems. After a brief introduction to UWB signals and their positioning applications, two-step positioning systems are investigated from a UWB perspective. It is observed that time-based positioning is well suited for UWB systems. Then time-based UWB ranging is studied in detail, and the main challenges, theoretical limits, and range estimation algorithms are presented. Performance of some practical time-based ranging algorithms is investigated and compared against the maximum likelihood estimator and the theoretical limits. The trade-off between complexity and accuracy is observed.", "paper_title": "ACCURATE POSITIONING IN ULTRA-WIDEBAND SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289791500006"}
