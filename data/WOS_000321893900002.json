We are investigating how to efficiently model embedded software and its environment to verify the requirements for the system controlled by the software. The software environment consists of mechanical, electrical and other parts; modelling it involves learning how these parts work, deciding what is relevant to model and how to model it. It is not possible to fully automate these steps. There are general guidelines, but given that every modelling problem differs, much is left to the modeller's own preference, background and experience. Still, when the next generation of a system is designed, the new system will have common elements with its previous version. Therefore, lessons learned from the current model could inform future models. We propose a framework for identifying the non-formal elements of knowledge, insights and a model itself, which can support modelling of the next system generation. We will present the application of our framework on an action research case - modelling mechanical parts of a paper-inserting machine.", "paper_title": "Reusing knowledge in embedded systems modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000321893900002"}
