We propose a novel approach that uses the hierarchy of possible moods to achieve better results than a standard machine learning approach. We also show that using sentiment orientation features improves the performance of classification. We used the Livejournal blog corpus as a data set to train and evaluate our method. We present extensive error analysis and discuss the difficulty of the task.", "paper_title": "A hierarchical approach to mood classification in blogs", "paper_id": "WOS:000307465900004"}
