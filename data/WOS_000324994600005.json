However, similar to most other neural network models it is non-transparent, which makes its predictions difficult to interpret. In this paper we show how a one-variable-at-a-time and an all-subsets explanation method can be modified for an equivalent and more efficient use with PRBF network classifiers. We use several artificial and real-life data sets to demonstrate the usefulness of the visualizations and explanations of the PRBF network classifier.", "paper_title": "Efficiently explaining the predictions of a probabilistic radial basis function classification network", "paper_id": "WOS:000324994600005"}
