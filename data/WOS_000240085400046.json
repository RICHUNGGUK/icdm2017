Due to the ultra high dimension of gene expression data, efficient feature selection methods are in great needs for selecting a small number of informative genes. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection method MIRS based on mutual information and rough set. First, we select some top-ranked features which have higher mutual information with the target class to predict. Then rough set theory is applied to remove the redundancy among these selected genes. Binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is first proposed for attribute reduction in rough set. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by the classification accuracy of SVM classifier. Experiment results show that MIRS is superior to some other classical feature selection methods and can get higher prediction accuracy with small number of features. Generally, the results are highly promising.", "paper_title": "Feature selection for microarray data analysis using mutual information and rough set theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400046"}
