Depending on the efficacy of the bound ligand, the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the ionotropic glutamate receptor iGluR2 adopts markedly different degrees of domain closure due to large-scale domain movements. With the purpose of predicting the induced domain closure of five known iGluR2 partial to full agonists we performed a validation study in which normal mode analysis (NMA) was employed to generate a 25-membered ensemble of iGluR2 LBD structures with gradually changing domain closures, followed by accurate QM/MM docking to the ensemble. Based on the docking scores we were able to predict the correct optimal degree of closure for each ligand within 1-3 degrees deviation from the experimental structures. We demonstrate that NMA is a useful tool for reliable ensemble generation and that we are able to predict the ligand induced conformational change of the receptor through docking to such an ensemble. The described protocol expands and improves the information that can be obtained from computational docking when dealing with a flexible receptor. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
