The proposed designs are based on the polynomial parameterization of feasible trajectories by explicitly taking into account boundary conditions, kinematic constraints, and collision-avoidance criteria. The problems of finding optimal solutions to the parameterized feasible trajectories are then formulated with respect to a near-minimal control-energy performance index and a near-shortest distance performance index, respectively. The obtained optimal solutions are analytical and suitable for practical applications which may require real-time trajectory planning and replanning. Computer simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed near-optimal trajectory-planning methods.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Optimal Solutions to Real-Time Path Planning for a Mobile Vehicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000278814100007"}
