Given an approximation parameter epsilon < 1, we present an O(n/epsilon(d-1)) expected time algorithm that determines a ball of radius 1 + epsilon enclosing a weight at least as large as the weight of the optimal unit ball. This is the first approximate algorithm for the weighted version of the problem in d-dimensional space. We also present a matching lower bound for a certain class of algorithms for the problem.
