The conventional approach for coping with this problem consists of trying to select the best classification algorithm for the target application domain. We propose a refreshing departure from this approach, consisting of automatically creating a rule induction algorithm tailored to the target application domain. This work proposes a grammar-based genetic programming (GGP) system to perform \"algorithm construction\". The GGP is used to build a complete rule induction algorithm tailored to 5 well-known UCI data sets and a protein data set, where the goal is to predict whether or not a protein presents postsynaptic activity. The results show that the rule induction algorithms automatically constructed by the GGP are competitive with well-known human-designed rule induction algorithms. Moreover, in the postsynaptic case study, the GGP was more successful than the human-designed algorithms in discovering accurate rules predicting the minority class - whose prediction is more difficult and tends to be more important to the user than the prediction of the majority class.", "paper_title": "Automatically evolving rule induction algorithms tailored to the prediction of postsynaptic activity in proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000266016300005"}
