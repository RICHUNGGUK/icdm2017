To capture this mobility diversity we introduce a new network parameter, the direction-aware mobility level, which measures how fast and close each mobile node is expected to get to the data destination (the Sink). We then provide local, distributed data dissemination protocols that adaptively exploit the node mobility to improve performance. In particular, \"high\" mobility is used as a low cost replacement for data dissemination (due to the ferrying of data), while in the case of \"low\" mobility either (a) data propagation redundancy is increased (when highly mobile neighbors exist) or (b) long-distance data transmissions are used (when the entire neighborhood is of low mobility) to accelerate data dissemination toward the sink. An extensive performance comparison to relevant methods from the state of the art demonstrates significant improvements, i.e. latency is reduced by even four times while keeping energy dissipation and delivery success at very satisfactory levels.
