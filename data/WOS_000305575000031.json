The array gain gives information on the power offset that results from exploiting channel state information at the transmitter or as a consequence of the channel model. Hence, the diversity, multiplexing, and array gain (DMA) analysis is able to cope with the limitations of the original DMT and provide an operational meaning in the sense that the DMA gains of a particular system can be directly translated into a parameterized characterization of its associated outage probability performance. In this paper, we derive the best DMA gains achievable by any scheme employing isotropic signaling in uncorrelated Rayleigh, semicorrelated Rayleigh, and uncorrelated Rician block-fading MIMO channels. We use these results to analyze the effect of important channel parameters on the outage performance at different points of the DMT curve.", "paper_title": "Array Gain in the DMT Framework for MIMO Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000305575000031"}
