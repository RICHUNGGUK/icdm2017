For general graphs, max-coloring is as hard as the classical vertex coloring problem, a special case of the former where vertices have unit weight. In fact, in some cases it can even be harder: for example, no polynomial time algorithm is known for max-coloring trees. In this paper we consider the problem of max-coloring paths and its generalization, max-coloring skinny trees, a broad class of trees that includes paths and spiders. For these graphs, we show that max-coloring can be solved in time O(|V|+time for sorting the vertex weights). When vertex weights are real numbers, we show a matching lower bound of Omega(|V|log |V|) in the algebraic computation tree model.", "paper_title": "Max-coloring paths: tight bounds and extensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000304400600001"}
