A number of on-line optimization approaches for output-feedback NMPC based on various black-box models can be found in the literature. However. NMPC involving on-line optimization is computationally very demanding. On the other hand, an explicit solution to the NMPC problem would allow efficient online computations as well as verifiability of the implementation. This paper applies an approximate multi-parametric nonlinear programming approach to explicitly solve output-feedback NMPC problems for constrained nonlinear systems described by black-box models. In particular, neural network models are used and the optimal regulation problem is considered. A dual-mode control strategy is employed in order to achieve an offset-free closed-loop response in the presence of bounded disturbances and/or model errors. The approach is applied to design an explicit NMPC for regulation of a pH maintaining system. The verification of the NMPC controller performance is based on simulation experiments.
