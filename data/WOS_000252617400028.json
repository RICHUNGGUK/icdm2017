In this paper, we study the relationship between the standard model PA-ness and the property about message hiding, that is, IND-CPA. Although these two notions seem to be independent at first glance, we show that PA-ness in the standard model implies the IND-CPA security if the encryption function is oneway. By using this result, we also showed that \"PA + Oneway double right arrow IND-CCA2.\" We also show that the computational PA-ness notion is strictly stronger than the statistical one.", "paper_title": "Relationship between standard model plaintext awareness and message hiding", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617400028"}
