This paper investigates the fault-tolerant edge-pancyclicity of LTQ(n), and shows that if LTQ(n) (n >= 3) contains at most n - 3 faulty vertices and/or edges then, for any fault-free edge e and any integer l with 6 <= l <= 2(n) - f(v), there is a fault-free cycle of length l containing the edge e, where f(v) is the number of faulty vertices. The result is optimal in some senses. The proof is based on the recursive structure of LTQ(n). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
