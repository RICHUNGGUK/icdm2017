The method is second-order accurate on non-uniform grids in space and time, has a very small dispersion error and computational stencil defined within one space-time cell. For shock-capturing, the scheme is equipped with a conservative nonlinear correction procedure which is directly based on the maximum principle. Plentiful numerical examples are provided for linear advection, quasi-linear scalar hyperbolic conservation laws and gas dynamics and comparisons with other computational methods in the literature are discussed.
