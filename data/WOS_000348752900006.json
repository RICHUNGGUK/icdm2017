To prevent unnecessary packet losses on the path towards the user's old location, PCNDN ingeniously adds a HO (HandOff) field to each relevant PIT (Pending Interest Table) entry, and set the HO indication bit to stop the AR (Access Router) from transmitting received Data packets towards the mobile user. Besides, PCNDN proactively fetches and caches the content items that the user does not receive but were requested before a handoff process. Then, whenever detecting the new link is connected, the user can quickly retrieve the content items that were transmitted during its disconnection period. Compared with the original NDN, our analytical and simulations results indicate that the proposed PCNDN has lower handoff cost and higher packet delivery ratio, as well as shorter handoff latency.", "paper_title": "PCNDN: Proactive caching for efficient mobility support in NDN", "paper_id": "WOS:000348752900006"}
