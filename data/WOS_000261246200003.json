It is shown that such an interpolatory curve exists provided that the data polygon, formed by the interpolation points, is convex, and satisfies an additional restriction on its angles. The approximation order is 4. This gives rise to a conjecture that a PH Curve of degree n can, under some natural restrictions on data points, interpolate up to n + 1 points. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
