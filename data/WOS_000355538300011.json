The central distribution for the circular case is von Mises distribution which has two parameters (mean and concentration) akin to the univariate normal distribution. However, there has been a challenge to sample efficiently from the posterior distribution of the concentration parameter. We describe a novel, highly efficient algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution and fill this long-standing gap.", "paper_title": "A fast algorithm for sampling from the posterior of a von Mises distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000355538300011"}
