This index is a weighted Euclidean distance where weightings are based on the \"importance\" of each MCA axis, and variable categories were considered to be associated when their distances were below the tolerance distance. This approach was applied to a renal transplantation data. The analysed variables were allograft survival and 13 of its putative predictors. A bootstrap-based stability analysis was employed for assessing result reliability. The method identified previously detected associations within the database, such as that between race of donors and recipients, and that between HLA match and Cyclosporine use. A hierarchical clustering algorithm was also applied to the same data, allowing for interpretations similar to those based on MCA. The defined tolerance distance could thus be used as an index of \"closeness\" in MCA, hence decreasing the subjectivity of interpreting MCA results.
