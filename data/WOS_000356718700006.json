We first present models for power consumption, response time and energy consumption of heterogeneous mobile platforms. Then, we use these models to optimize the energy consumption of baseline platforms under response time and temperature constraints with and without introducing new resources. We show that the optimal design choices depend on dynamic power management algorithm, and adding new resources is more energy efficient than scaling existing resources alone.", "paper_title": "Constrained Energy Optimization in Heterogeneous Platforms Using Generalized Scaling Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000356718700006"}
