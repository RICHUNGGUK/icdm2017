In this paper, we focus on multi-criteria human resource allocation for solving multistage combinatorial optimization problem. Hence we tackle this problem via a multistage decision-making model. A multistage decision-making model is similar to a complex problem solving, in which a suitable sequence of decisions is to be found. The task can be interpreted as a series of interactions between a decision maker and an outside world, at each stage of which some decisions are available and their immediate effect can be easily computed. Eventually, goals would be reached due to the found of optimized variables. In order to obtain a set of Pareto solutions efficiently, we propose a multiobjective hybrid genetic algorithm (mohGA) approach based on the multistage decision-making model for solving combinatorial optimization problems. According to the proposed method, we apply the mohGA to seek feasible solutions for all stages. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was validated by its application to an illustrative example dealing with multiobjective resource allocation problem. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
