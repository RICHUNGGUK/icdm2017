The SPE estimates how much system-wide performance is enhanced by using a faster solid state disk (SSD). By suspending a CPU for a certain time during direct memory access (DMA) transfer and subtracting this suspended time from the total DMA time, the SPE estimates the improvement in system performance expected from an enhanced SSD prior to its manufacture. We also examine the relation between storage performance and system performance using the SPE.", "paper_title": "A fast and simple system performance emulator for enhanced solid state disks: a case study of long read operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000278156200002"}
