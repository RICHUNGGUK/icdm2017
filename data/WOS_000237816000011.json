The first involves a reduction method known as LQG balanced truncation followed by MinMax control design and relies on the theory and properties of the distributed parameter system. The second is a neural network based adaptive output feedback synthesis approach, designed for the large scale discretized system and depends upon the relative degree of the regulated outputs. Both methods are applied to a problem concerning control of vibrations in a nonlinear structure with a bounded disturbance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
