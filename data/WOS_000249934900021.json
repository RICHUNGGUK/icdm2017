In this paper, Morse code is selected as a communication adaptive device for persons with various neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy. Maintaining a stable typing rate presents a major obstacle to being effective as a communication tool. Therefore, an adaptive automatic recognition method with a high recognition rate is needed. The proposed system uses both fuzzy support vector machines and the variable-degree variable-step-size least-mean-square algorithm. Statistical analyses demonstrated that the proposed method elicited a higher recognition rate than other algorithms in the literature.", "paper_title": "Adaptive mandarin morse code recognition using fuzzy support vector machines and a variable degree variable step size least-mean-square algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000249934900021"}
