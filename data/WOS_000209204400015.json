Up to now, there have existed several types of rules (e.g., the decision rules and the granular rules) in decision formal contexts. This study firstly proposes a new algorithm with less time complexity for deriving the non-redundant decision rules from a decision formal context. Then, we invesigate decision rules and the granular rules in the consistent decision formal contexts and make a contrast between the decision rule oriented knowledge reduction and the granular rule oriented knowledge reduction. Finally, some experiments are conducted to assess the efficiency of the proposed rule acquisition algorithm.", "paper_title": "On rule acquisition in decision formal contexts", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204400015"}
