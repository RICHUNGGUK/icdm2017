The iterated greedy metaheuristic generates a sequence of solutions by iterating over a constructive heuristic using destruction and construction phases. In the last few years, iterated greedy has been employed to solve a considerable number of problems. This is because it is based on a very simple principle, it is easy to implement, and it often exhibits an excellent performance. Moreover, scalability for high-dimensional problems becomes an essential requirement for modern optimisation algorithms. This paper proposes an iterated greedy model for the above-mentioned scheduling problem to tackle large-size instances. The benefits of our proposal in comparison to existing metaheuristics proposed in the literature are experimentally shown. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
