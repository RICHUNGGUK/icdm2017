There are situations where both the deterioration and learning effects might exist at the same time. However, the research with the consideration of both the effects is relatively limited. Furthermore, the forms of the effects are specific functions in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a general scheduling model in the sense that the form of the function is unspecified. Under the proposed model, the actual job processing time is a general function on the processing times of the jobs already processed and its scheduled position. The optimal solutions for some single-machine problems are provided. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
