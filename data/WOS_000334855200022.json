Usually, the CA is created from the fermentation of Streptomycen Clavuligerus (SC) bacteria. Analysis of visual and morphological features of SC bacteria is an appropriate measure to estimate the growth of CA. In this paper, an automatic and fast CA production level estimation algorithm based on visual and structural features of SC bacteria instead of statistical methods and experimental evaluation by microbiologist is proposed. In this algorithm, structural features such as the number of newborn branches, thickness of hyphal and bacterial density and also color features such as acceptance color levels are extracted from the SC bacteria. Moreover, PH and biomass of the medium provided by microbiologists are considered as specified features. The level of CA production is estimated by using a new application of Self-Organizing Map (SOM), and a hybrid model of genetic algorithm with back propagation network (GA-BPN). The proposed algorithm is evaluated on four carbonic resources including malt, starch, wheat flour and glycerol that had used as different mediums of bacterial growth. Then, the obtained results are compared and evaluated with observation of specialist. Finally, the Relative Error (RE) for the SOM and GA-BPN are achieved 14.97% and 16.63%, respectively.
