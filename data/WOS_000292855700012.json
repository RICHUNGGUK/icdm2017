Balaban index has been used in various QSAR and QSPR studies. In this paper, we characterize the trees with the maximum Balaban index among all the trees with a vertices and either the maximum degree A, or a given degree sequence, or k pendent vertices. In addition, the tree with the minimum Balaban index and a vertices and the maximum degree A, and the tree with the maximum Balaban index and a vertices and the maxinjuin degree A and k pendent vertices are also determined. On the other hand, we find that a lemma without proof in our paper [MATCH Commu. Math. Commit. Chem. 63 (2010) 799-812] is incorrect, and so are several related theorems. In the appendix of this paper, we rework the lemma and theorems, and give a new character for the graph with maximum Balaban index among graphs with n vertices. Several open problems on graphs with extreme Balaban indices are proposed.", "paper_title": "Character of Trees with Extreme Balaban Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000292855700012"}
