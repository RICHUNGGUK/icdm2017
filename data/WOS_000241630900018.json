In order to shorten the delay of detection, short-term traffic prediction was introduced, and prediction values were used in the detecting process. Though we use real-time traffic data to calculate the mean and variance, few periods of data need to be stored because the algorithm is a recurring process, therefore the occupied storage space is less. Moreover, the complex and cost of the recurring process is less than calculating the whole sequence, so the load of the server would not increase much. Although we focus our research on detecting flooding-based DoS/DDoS attacks, the simulation shows that the approach also can deal with DDoS attacks that zombies start without simultaneousness.", "paper_title": "A flooding-based DoS/DDoS detecting algorithm based on traffic measurement and prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630900018"}
