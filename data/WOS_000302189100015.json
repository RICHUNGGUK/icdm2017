We propose an original algorithm to segment depth images of plant from a single top-view. Various applications of biological interest involving for illustration rosebush, yucca and apple tree are then presented to demonstrate the practical interest of such imaging systems. In addition, the depth camera used here is very low cost and low weight. The present results therefore open interesting perspectives in the direction of high-throughput phenotyping in controlled environment or in field conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
