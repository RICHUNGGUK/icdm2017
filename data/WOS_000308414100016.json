Although there are many research efforts in this field, most existing design tools consider only character body structure, rather than its interaction with the environment. This paper presents an intuitive sketching interface that allows the user to interactively place a 3D human character in a sitting position on a chair. Within our framework, the user sketches the target pose as a 2D stick figure and attaches the selected joints to the environment (e. g., the feet on the ground) with a pin tool. As reconstructing the 3D pose from a 2D stick figure is an ill-posed problem due to many possible solutions, the key idea in our paper is to reduce solution space by considering the interaction between the character and environment and adding physics constraints, such as balance and collision. Further, we formulated this reconstruction into a nonlinear optimization problem and solved it via the genetic algorithm (GA) and the quasi-Newton solver. With the GPU implementation, our system is able to generate the physically correct and visually pleasing pose at an interactive speed. The promising experimental results and user study demonstrates the efficacy of our method.", "paper_title": "A Sketching Interface for Sitting Pose Design in the Virtual Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000308414100016"}
