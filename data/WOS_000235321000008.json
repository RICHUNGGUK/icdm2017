When the projection images are only available from a limited angle of view, the reconstruction problem is a severely ill-posed inverse problem. Statistical inversion allows stable solution of the limited-angle tomography problem by complementing the measurement data by a priori information. In this work, the unknown attenuation distribution inside the body is represented as a wavelet expansion, and a Besov space prior distribution together with positivity constraint is used. The wavelet expansion is thresholded before reconstruction to reduce the dimension of the computational problem. Feasibility of the method is demonstrated by numerical examples using in vitro data from mammography and dental radiology.", "paper_title": "Wavelet-based reconstruction for limited-angle X-ray tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000235321000008"}
