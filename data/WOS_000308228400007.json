Given faF[x] of degree d over a field F, and a desired sparsity t, our goal is to determine if there exists a multiple haF[x] of f such that h has at most t non-zero terms, and if so, to find such an h. When F=a\"e and t is constant, we give an algorithm which requires polynomial-time in d and the size of coefficients in h. When F is a finite field, we show that the problem is at least as hard as determining the multiplicative order of elements in an extension field of F (a problem thought to have complexity similar to that of factoring integers), and this lower bound is tight when t=2.", "paper_title": "Computing Sparse Multiples of Polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000308228400007"}
