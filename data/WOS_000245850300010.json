After analyzing the properties of the HSV color space, suitable weight functions have been suggested for estimating relative contribution of color and gray levels of an image pixel. The suggested weight values for a pixel and its neighbor are used to construct an Integrated Color and Intensity Co-occurrence Matrix (ICICM). We have shown that if the ICICM matrix is used as a feature in an image retrieval application, it is possible to have higher recall and precision compared to other existing methods.
