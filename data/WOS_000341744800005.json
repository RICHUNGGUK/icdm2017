Existing clock synchronization techniques such as the Network Time Protocol (NIP) and the IEEE 1588 standard can be difficult to apply to such systems because of the highly precise hardware clocks required, due to network congestion caused by a high frequency of synchronization message transmissions, and high overheads. In response, we present a Time Stamp Counter based precise Relative Clock Synchronization Protocol (TSC-RCSP) for distributed control applications operating over local-area networks (LANs). In our protocol a software clock based on the TSC register, counting CPU cycles, is adopted in the time clients and server. TSC-based clocks offer clients a precise, stable and low-cost clock synchronization solution. Experimental results show that clock precision in the order of 10 microseconds can be achieved in small-scale LAN systems. Such clock precision is much higher than that of a processor's Time-Of-Day clock and is easily sufficient for most distributed real-time control applications over LANs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
