For instance, to show the expression pattern of a gene in different tissues of a fly, an intuitive approach is to draw the fly with the corresponding tissues and color the expression of the gene in each of them. However, the creation of these visual representations may be a burdensome task. Here we present SVGMap, a java application that automatizes the generation of high-quality graphics for singular data items ( e. g. genes) and biological conditions. SVGMap contains a browser that allows the user to navigate the different images created and can be used as a web-based results publishing tool.", "paper_title": "SVGMap: configurable image browser for experimental data", "paper_id": "WOS:000298383800018"}
