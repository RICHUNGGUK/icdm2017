The ANN model showed better performance with a 6-6-1 architecture than MLR. The results obtained from this study indicate that three descriptors, hydration energy (EH), n-octanol/water partition (LOGP), and energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), play an important role on the activity of AT1 receptor antagonists with biphenyltetrazole structures. This information is pertinent to the further design of new AT1 receptor antagonists.", "paper_title": "QSAR modeling of AT1 receptor antagonists using ANN", "paper_id": "WOS:000240900700015"}
