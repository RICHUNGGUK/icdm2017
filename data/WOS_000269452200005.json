Selective Rake (SRake) receiver is employed in this paper in order to deal with the multipath effects. Theoretical bit error probability of the MIMO DS-BPAM UWB system with SRake receiver is derived. Simulation results of the MIMO DS-BPAM UWB system with SRake receiver and conventional coherent receiver over multipath fading channels are provided. The results show the efficiency of the MIMO DS-BPAM UWB system with SRake receiver.", "paper_title": "MIMO DS-BPAM UWB SYSTEM WITH SRAKE RECEIVER OVER MULTIPATH FADING CHANNELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269452200005"}
