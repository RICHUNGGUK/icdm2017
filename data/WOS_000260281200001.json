Deterioration of the lining support with time leads to the transfer of the loading from the exterior ground to the interior backfill, both of which are of poro-elastic behaviour and saturated with water. This loading transfer is accompanied by an inward cavity convergence and an outward water flow, leading to a complex space-time evolution of pore pressures, displacements and stresses. An entirely explicit solution to this problem is developed, using Laplace transform. A few numerical examples are given to illustrate the hydro-mechanical behaviour of the cavity and highlight the influence of key parameters such as backfill stiffness and rate of lining support deterioration.
