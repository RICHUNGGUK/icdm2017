Based on the free-knot spline techniques, we develop a fully Bayesian method to analyze the proposed models. To make the models spatially adaptive, we further treat the number and positions of spline knots as random variables. As random residual effects are introduced, many of the completely conditional posteriors become standard distributions, which greatly facilitates sampling. We illustrate the proposed models and estimation method with a simulation study and an analysis of a recreational trip data set. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
