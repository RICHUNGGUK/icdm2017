However, the selection of a suitable partner for strategic alliance is not an easy decision, involving a host of complex considerations. This paper proposes an integrated approach of analytic network process (ANP) to consider both tangible and intangible factors and to optimize the paid off earn by company from strategic alliance. The data was collected from top management teams (TMT) of LCD industry to evaluate criteria and sub-criteria for strategic alliance process. Based on ANP results, this study used a hypothetical problem in selecting strategic partners to demonstrate the results. The main contribution of this paper is that the complex business problems for strategic alliance are conceptualizing to help business practitioners. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
