The solution we propose is based on the Nash solution for a bargaining problem and the maxmin principle of Wald. We also give some properties of this solution and sufficient conditions for its existence. Finally, we propose an adequate procedure for its determination and an illustrative example.", "paper_title": "SOLUTION CONCEPT FOR A TWO PERSON BARGAINING PROBLEM WITH UNKNOWN PARAMETERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289201400004"}
