The proposed embedder hides data into a block of input data by modifying some coefficients in the block in order to null the syndrome. The proposed embedder can hide data with less computational time and less storage capacity compared to the existing methods. The complexity of the proposed method is linear while that of other methods are exponential for any block size n. Thus, it is easy to extend this method to a large n. The BCH syndrome coding for steganography is now viable as-cribed to the reduced complexity and its simplicity of the proposed embedder.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Embedder for BCH Coding for Steganography", "paper_id": "WOS:000311359600020"}
