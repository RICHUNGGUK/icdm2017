Experts' experiences from different product life-cycle stages play a key role in problem solving during design decision making by linking up knowledge to find better solutions for a specific design problem. Different approaches have been used to support Collaborative and Concurrent Product Design, such as Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) modelling. Additionally, due to the need of capitalizing these experiences, the Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) is used to store and manage experiences of decision making process. However it was necessary to adapt the structure to property manage the constraints approach used in Engineering Design. This article presents a proposed adaptation to SOEKS structure in order to be able to store and reuse CSP design experiences for further re-use and analysis of multiple experiences. Finally, a case study is presented in order to show how the proposed approach can be used in the industrial applications.", "paper_title": "Smart experience engineering to support collaborative design problems based on constraints modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000341191800008"}
