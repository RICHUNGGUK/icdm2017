An electromagnetic simulator is used to simulate several different-size inductors for tip to 20 GHz. Additionally, artificial neural network models are developed for different inductor topologies to speed tip inductors optimization process. Finally, it is demonstrated that the solenoidal inductor exhibits a better overall performance in comparison to the conventional multilayer spiral inductors demonstrating its potential for RF ICs.
