In this paper, according on ANN-based (Artificial Neural Network) service selection model, we extend the definition and formal description of service, and propose the architecture of service migration system, evaluation method, judgment theorems of triggering and a serviceoriented seamless migration (SOSM) algorithm in pervasive computing systems. We also propose the flexible communication protocol for service seamless migration activity based on mobile agent computing network. We have implemented the SOSM mechanism and flexible communication protocol in an intelligent service selection prototype (ISSPS) system, which provide the pervasive web services for users in pervasive computing environment. The results show that the proposed service migration mechanism is not only reliable but also efficient.", "paper_title": "A Component-based Intelligent Seamless Service Migration Mechanism and Flexible Communication Protocol in Pervasive Computing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000336216400007"}
