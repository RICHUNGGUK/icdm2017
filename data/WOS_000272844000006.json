Our novel method uses bootstrap resampling. It is very general, applicable to almost any registration method based on minimizing a pixel-based similarity criterion; we demonstrate it using the SSD, SAD, correlation, and mutual information criteria. We show experimentally that the bootstrap method provides better estimates of the registration accuracy than the state-of-the-art Cramer-Rao bound method. Additionally, we evaluate also a fast registration accuracy estimation (FRAE) method which is based on quadratic sensitivity analysis ideas and has a negligible computational overhead. FRAE mostly works better than the Cramer-Rao bound method but is outperformed by the bootstrap method.", "paper_title": "Bootstrap Resampling for Image Registration Uncertainty Estimation Without Ground Truth", "paper_id": "WOS:000272844000006"}
