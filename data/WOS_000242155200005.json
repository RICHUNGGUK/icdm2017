It presents a structured view on environment-centric MAS applications. This comprises three base configurations, which MAS applications may apply directly or combine into a composite configuration. For each configuration, the paper presents key issues, requirements and opportunities (e.g. time management issues, real-world augmentation opportunities and state snapshot requirements). Thus, the paper delineates what environment technology may implement to serve MAS applications. Sample applications illustrate the configurations. Next, electronic institutions provide an example of an environment technology, addressing norms and laws in an agent society, already achieving some maturity. In comparison, application-domain specific environment technologies still are in embryonic stages.", "paper_title": "Applications and environments for multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242155200005"}
