It is known that there are exactly left perpendiculart-1/2right perpendicular and left perpendiculart/2right perpendicular nonequivalent Z(2)Z(4)-linear Hadamard codes of length 2(t), with alpha = 0 and alpha not equal 0, respectively, for all t >= 3. In this paper, it is shown that each Z(2)Z(4)-linear Hadamard code with alpha = 0 is equivalent to a Z(2)Z(4)-linear Hadamard code with alpha not equal 0, so there are only left perpendiculart/2right perpendicular nonequivalent Z(2)Z(4)-linear Hadamard codes of length 2(t). Moreover, the order of the monomial automorphism group for the Z(2)Z(4)-additive Hadamard codes and the permutation automorphism group of the corresponding Z(2)Z(4)-linear Hadamard codes are given.", "paper_title": "Classification of the Z(2)Z(4)-Linear Hadamard Codes and Their Automorphism Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000348298400015"}
