The first goal of the research is to develop a mathematical model in which customers and service providers are considered as perspectives. The objectives of the developed model are minimization of the total cost of server provider and minimization of the total time of customers. This model has different real world applications, including locating bank automated teller machines (ATMs), different types of vendor machines, etc. For solving the model, two popular multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) of the literature are implemented. The first algorithm is non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and the second one is non-dominated ranked genetic algorithm (NRGA). Moreover, to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, some numerical examples are presented and analyzed statistically. The results indicate that the proposed algorithms provide an effective means to solve the problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
