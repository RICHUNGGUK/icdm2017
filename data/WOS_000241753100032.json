In the proposed method, Bayesian regularization is applied to improve the generalization capability of the FNN. The features extracted from the image sets by kernel independent component analysis (KICA) technique are input vectors of regularized FNN. The outputs of the neural network are those translation, rotation and scaling parameters with respect to reference and observed image sets. Comparative experiments are performed between FNN with regularization and without regularization under various conditions. The results show that the proposed method is much improved not only at accuracy but also remarkably at robust to noise.", "paper_title": "Image registration with regularized neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100032"}
