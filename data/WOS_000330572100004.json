In this paper, we propose a design for a dense pressure-sensitive bedsheet along with an algorithmic framework to recognize and monitor sleeping posture. The bedsheet system uses comfortable textile sensors that produces high-resolution pressure maps. We develop a novel framework for pressure image analysis to monitor sleep postures, including a set of geometrical features for sleep posture characterization and three sparse classifiers for posture recognition. In demonstrating this system, we run 2 pilot studies: one evaluates the performance of our methods with 14 subjects to analyze 6 common postures; the other is a series of overnight studies to verify continuous performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method enables reliable sleep posture recognition and offers better overall performance than traditional methods, achieving up to 83.0% precision and 83.2% recall on average.
