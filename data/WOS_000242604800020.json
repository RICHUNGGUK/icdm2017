This method is robust compared to the conventional single-probe method and readily converges for a wide range of single-ended and differential ring oscillators. Furthermore, it is computationally more efficient for ring oscillators in which the conventional single-probe method converges.", "paper_title": "Frequency-domain simulation of ring oscillators with a multiple-probe method", "paper_id": "WOS:000242604800020"}
