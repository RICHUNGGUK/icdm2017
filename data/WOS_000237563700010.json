For this scheme, we prove general local convergence results. However, the main contribution of the paper is related to global worst-case complexity bounds for different problem classes including some nonconvex cases. It is shown that the search direction can be computed by standard linear algebra technique.", "paper_title": "Cubic regularization of Newton method and its global performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000237563700010"}
