Despite being well known and often cited, Rosen's central proof has so far not been evaluated by the scientific community In this article we review the essence of Rosen's ideas leading up to his rejection of the possibility of real artificial fife in silico. We also evaluate his arguments and point out that some of Rosens central notions are ill defined. The conclusion of this article is that Rosen's central proof is wrong.", "paper_title": "A category theoretical argument against the possibility of artificial life: Robert Rosen's central proof revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000234484200006"}
