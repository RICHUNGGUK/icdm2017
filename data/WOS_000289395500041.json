Aiming to solve the quality tracing problem in supply chain, a methodology of designing information systems for traceability is proposed in this paper. Based on the former theories, the structures and models of quality tracing in supply chain are firstly introduced, also with a deep discussion on failure diagnosis technology and tracing system design, then a product quality tracing system in supply chain is established, which can provide an easier way and a new sight for the quality control in SCM (Supply Chain Management). Finally, a sample system is showed to illustrate the methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
