This set determines an imprecise polygon. We show that it is NP-hard to decide whether it is possible to place the points inside their regions in such a way that the resulting polygon is simple. Furthermore, it is NP-hard to minimize the length of a simple tour visiting the regions in order, when the connections between consecutive regions are not needed to be straight line segments. We also present two linear-time algorithms to compute the shortest and longest possible tour for the case where the polygon is not required to be simple and the regions are squares.", "paper_title": "EXISTENCE AND COMPUTATION OF TOURS THROUGH IMPRECISE POINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288221000001"}
