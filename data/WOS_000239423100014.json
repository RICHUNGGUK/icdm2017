In this paper I describe a framework for quantification of anonymity and linkability of a user's actions for use within a privacy-enhancing identity management system. Therefore, I define a model of user's PII and actions as well as an attacker model. Based thereon, I describe an approach to quantify anonymity and linkability of actions. Regarding practical applicability, a third party service for linkability quantification is discussed.", "paper_title": "A framework for quantification of linkability within a privacy-enhancing identity management system", "paper_id": "WOS:000239423100014"}
