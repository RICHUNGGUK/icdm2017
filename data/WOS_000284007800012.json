To help prevent adolescents accessing this content, a novel detection method for adult images is proposed. The proposed method involves three steps. First, the Image Of Interest (IOI) is extracted from the image background. Second, the IOI is distinguished from the segmented image using a novel weighting mask, and it is determined to be acceptable or unacceptable. Finally, the features (color and texture) of the IOI or original image are compared to a critical value; if they exceed that value then the image is deemed to be an adult image. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to define this optimal critical value. And, the textural features are identified using a gray level co-occurrence matrix. The proposed method increased the precision level of detection by applying a novel weighting mask and a receiver operating characteristic curve. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 2850 adult and non-adult images were used for experimentation.", "paper_title": "A Novel System for Detecting Adult Images on the Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000284007800012"}
