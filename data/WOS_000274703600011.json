However, the existing Muting protocols are always implemented to establish routes by sacrificing network resources with control packets. In this paper, a node-based routing protocol only considering the feature of datagram (DBNP) was proposed, which avoids extra computation, communication loads and the bandwidth consumption. Significantly, the unique characteristic of DBNP is that the route selection was implemented during the transmitting of datagram without any control packets.", "paper_title": "A Node Decision Routing Protocol Based on Datagram Features in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274703600011"}
