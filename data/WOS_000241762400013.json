Handoff probability is calculated to evaluate handoff algorithms analytically. The proposed handoff algorithm is compared with an algorithm with fixed hysteresis, an algorithm using both threshold and hysteresis, and a handoff algorithm based on distance and hysteresis. Performance is evaluated in terms of the average number of handoffs, average handoff delay, standard deviation of handoff location, average signal strength during handoff, and probability of link degradation. Numerical results and simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other handoff algorithms. The effect of distance error is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Improving handoff performance by using distance-based dynamic hysteresis value", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762400013"}
