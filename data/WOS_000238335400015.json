BPEL builds on the layers of flexibility provided by the Web Services stack, and especially by XML. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to BPEL with emphasis on architectural drivers and basic concepts. Then we survey ongoing BPEL work in several application areas: adding quality of service to BPEL, extending BPEL to activities involving humans, BPEL for grid computing, and BPEL for autonomic computing.", "paper_title": "Business processes for web services: Principles and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000238335400015"}
