A B-rep oriented method for reconstructing curved objects from three orthographic views is presented by employing a hybrid wire-frame in place of an intermediate wire-frame. The Link-Relation Graph (LRG) is introduced as a multi-graph representation of orthographic views, and quadric surface features (QSFs) are defined by special basic patterns of LRG as well as aggregation rules. By hint-based pattern matching in the LRGs of three orthographic views in an order of priority, the corresponding QSFs are recognized, and the geometry and topology of quadric surfaces are recovered simultaneously. This method can handle objects with interacting quadric surfaces and avoids the combinatorial search for tracing all the quadric surfaces in an intermediate wire-frame by the existing methods. Several examples are provided.
