MSS can model complex behaviors such as shared loads, performance degradation, imperfect fault coverage, standby redundancy, and limited repair resources. The non-binary state property of MSS, and their components makes the analysis of MSS challenging. In this paper, we propose efficient logarithmically-encoded binary decision diagram (LBDD)-based methods for analysing MSS. The application and advantages of the proposed LBDD-based approaches, as compared to the existing binary decision diagram-based approaches, are demonstrated through the analyses of practical MSS examples, and a set of benchmark examples.", "paper_title": "A Logarithmic Binary Decision Diagram-Based Method for Multistate System Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000261544800007"}
