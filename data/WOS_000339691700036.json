This method is based on an ADER approach in time to solve the generalized Riemann problem at the junction. Additionally to the high order accuracy, this approach maintains an exact conservation of quantities if stated by the coupling conditions. Several numerical examples confirm the benefits of a high order coupling procedure for high order accuracy and stable shock capturing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
