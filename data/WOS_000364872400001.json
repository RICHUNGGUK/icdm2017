In construction of IoT network, the RFID technologies play the role of the front-end data collection via tag identification, as the basis of IoT. Hence, the adoption of RFID technologies is spurring innovation and the development of the IoT. However, in RFID system, one of the most important challenges is the collision resolution between the tags when these tags transmit their data to the reader simultaneously. Hence, in this paper I develop an efficient scheme to estimate the number of unidentified tags for Dynamic Framed Slotted Aloha (DFSA) based RFID system, with the view of increasing system performance. In addition to theoretical analysis, simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed scheme. The simulation results reveal the proposed scheme works very well in providing a substantial performance improvement in RFID system. The proposed algorithm promotes business effectiveness and efficiency while applying the RFID technologies to IoT.", "paper_title": "Efficient DFSA Algorithm in RFID Systems for the Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000364872400001"}
