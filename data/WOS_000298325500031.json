Parallax and object motion present challenges to image registration, leading to artifacts in the result. To reduce the impact of these artifacts, traditional image mosaicing approaches often impose planar scene constraints or rely on purely rotational camera motion or dense sampling. However, these requirements are often impractical or fail to address the needs of all applications. Instead, taking advantage of depth cues and a smooth transition criterion, we achieve significantly improved mosaicing results for static scenes, coping effectively with nontrivial parallax in the input. We extend this approach to the synthesis of dynamic video mosaics, incorporating foreground/background segmentation and a consistent motion perception criterion. Although further additions are required to cope with unconstrained object motion, our algorithm can synthesize a perceptually convincing output, conveying the same appearance of motion as seen in the input sequences.", "paper_title": "Toward Dynamic Image Mosaic Generation With Robustness to Parallax", "paper_id": "WOS:000298325500031"}
