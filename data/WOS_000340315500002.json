A kind of multi-node coarse element is proposed to describe the more complex deformations compared with the original four-node coarse element and the mode base functions are added into the original multiscale base functions to consider the effects of inertial forces for the dynamic problems. The constructions of the displacement and mode base functions are introduced in detail. In addition, the orthogonality of the displacement and mode base functions are also proved, which indicates that the macroscopic displacement DOF and modal DOF are irrelevant and independent of each other. Finally, some numerical experiments are carried out to verify the validity and efficiency of the proposed method by comparison with the reference solution obtained by the standard finite element method on the fine mesh.
