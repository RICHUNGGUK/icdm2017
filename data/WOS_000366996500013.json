Organization standard-complex can ensure the realization of organization functions by normalizing the mission of its members. This paper analyzes the control effect of the organization standard-complex to the achievements of organization functions. On this basis, this paper establishes a mathematic model of the planning process of organization standard-complex, and thus puts forward the structured planning method and steps.", "paper_title": "Modelling Method of Organization Internal Standard-complex", "paper_id": "WOS:000366996500013"}
