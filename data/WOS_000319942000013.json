It allows computing services provided as utilities. The traditional cloud services include Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, Hardware/Infrastructure as a Service, and Database as a Service. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Ontology as a Service (OaaS), whereby the ontology tailoring process is a service in the cloud. This is particularly relevant as we are moving toward Cloud 2.0-multi-cloud providers to provide an interoperable service to customers. To illustrate OaaS, in this paper we propose sub-ontology extraction and merging, whereby multiple sub-ontologies are extracted from various source ontologies, and then these extracted sub-ontologies are merged to form a complete ontology to be used by the user. We use the Minimum extraction method to facilitate this. A walkthrough case study using the UMLS meta-thesaurus ontology is elaborated, and its performance in the cloud is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Ontology as a Service (OaaS): a case for sub-ontology merging on the cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000319942000013"}
