Their advantage is that they can be easily understood by stakeholders and domain experts. However, since use-cases typically rely on natural language, they cannot be directly subject to a formal verification. In this article, we present a method (called Formal Verification of Annotated Use-Case Models, FOAM) for formal verification of use-cases. This method features simple user-definable annotations, which are inserted into a use-case to make its semantics more suitable for verification. Subsequently, a model-checking tool is employed to verify temporal invariants associated with the annotations. This way, FOAM allows harnessing the benefits of model checking while still keeping the use-cases understandable for non-experts.", "paper_title": "Formal Verification of Annotated Textual Use-Cases", "paper_id": "WOS:000359141100001"}
