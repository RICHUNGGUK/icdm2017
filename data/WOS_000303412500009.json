In reality, individuals tend to carry out trips with much variation and complexity, with multipurpose trips being a prominent and pervasive phenomenon. There is limited research to date on multipurpose trips in time-geographic analysis by geographic information system (GIS) scientists, or more specifically, multiple flexible activities between two fixed stations. To fill this gap, this article proposes four models for identifying the choice set with multiple flexible activities under space-time constraints. The models are derived through set-theoretic formalism based on the concept of trip chaining. The structure of the four models establishes a theoretical framework for conceptualizing trip-chaining behaviour with respect to the fixity of activities and the number of fixed stations as destinations or origins. They provide fundamental and rigorous apparatus for studying complex individual activity-travel patterns in many applied contexts when multipurpose trips are involved. This article also describes implementation of the models with a real transportation network as a way of validation.", "paper_title": "Choice set formation with multiple flexible activities under space-time constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000303412500009"}
