For a phrase in the source language the tool identifies a range of possible expressions used in similar contexts in target language corpora and presents them to the translator as a list of suggestions. In the paper we discuss the method and present results of human evaluation of the performance of the tool, which highlight its usefulness when dictionary solutions are lacking.", "paper_title": "'Irrefragable answers' using comparable corpora to retrieve translation equivalents", "paper_id": "WOS:000263798100002"}
