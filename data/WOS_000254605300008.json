The feature vector is obtained by taking DCT and 1-bit quantization for the square matrix of the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients that is derived from the frame based cepstral analysis. The classifier is a feed-forward neural network having one hidden layer and one output layer, and a back propagation algorithm is used to update the weighting-vector of each layer. Experimental results with underwater transient signals demonstrate that the proposed method is very promising for classification of underwater transient signals.", "paper_title": "Underwater transient signal classification using binary pattern image of MFCC and neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000254605300008"}
