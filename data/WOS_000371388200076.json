It summarizes recent advantages in algorithmic performance; gives a fresh view on the ELM solution in relation to the traditional linear algebraic performance; and reaps the latest software and hardware performance achievements. The results are applicable to a wide range of machine learning problems and thus provide a solid ground for tackling numerous Big Data challenges. The included toolbox is targeted at enabling the full potential of ELMs to the widest range of users.", "paper_title": "High-Performance Extreme Learning Machines: A Complete Toolbox for Big Data Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200076"}
