In this paper, a novel relevance feedback mechanism is presented, which effectively makes use of strengths of different feature vectors and perfectly solves the problem of small sample and asymmetry. During the retrieval process, the proposed method takes the user's feedback details as the relevant information of query model, and then dynamically updates two important parameters of each feature vector, narrowing the gap between high-level semantic knowledge and low-level object representation. The experiments, based on the publicly available 3D model database Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB), show that the proposed approach not only precisely captures the user's semantic knowledge, but also significantly improves the retrieval performance of 3D model retrieval. Compared with three state-of-the-art query refinement schemes for 3D model retrieval, it provides superior retrieval effectiveness only with a few rounds of relevance feedback based on several standard measures.", "paper_title": "A powerful relevance feedback mechanism for content-based 3D model retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000258576700007"}
