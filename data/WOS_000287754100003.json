Centralized p-Percent Coverage Algorithm (CPCA) we proposed is a centralized algorithm which selects the least number of nodes to monitor p-percent of the monitored area. Distributed p-Percent Coverage Protocol (DPCP) we represented is a distributed algorithm which can determine a set of nodes in a distributed manner to cover p-percent of the monitored area. Both of the algorithms can guarantee network connectivity. The simulation results show that our algorithms can remarkably prolong network lifetime, have less than 5% un-required coverage for large networks, and employ nodes fairly for most cases.", "paper_title": "Sensor scheduling for p-percent coverage in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287754100003"}
