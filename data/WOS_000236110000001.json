A myriad of free bioinformatics applications and services have been posted on the web. This mini-review mentions web sites that are useful in structure-based drug design. The information is given in a logical manner, following the drug design process i.e. characterization of a protein target, modelling the protein using sequence homology, optimization of the protein structure and finally docking of small ligands into the active site.", "paper_title": "Structural e-bioinformatics and drug design", "paper_id": "WOS:000236110000001"}
