The most creditable concept to this critical issue of scientific and technological development seems to be \"System Life\" that is an innovative competence to be embodied into any artifact system for creating harmony in the world of natural entities and artifact systems interacting with each other. System life is defined as a seamless system of sensing, processing, activating and expressing mechanisms governed by system life information. This paper introduces a design approach of robots possessing system life. First, this paper presents the concept of system life comparing it with the conventional design methodology of intelligent systems. Second, the paper introduces an intelligent control methodology using the cubic neural network that the author developed in order to cope with unpredicted failures. Finally, the paper presents various intelligent robots, a skiing robot, autonomous soccer robots, a game playing robot, as new concrete artifact systems designed using the system life concept.
