It is concluded that the spatial structure enables the emergence of clusters of coincident choices, leading to the mean payoff per encounter to values that are accessible only in the cooperative two-person game scenario, which constitutes a notable case of self-organization.", "paper_title": "SELF-ORGANIZATION IN THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612500001"}
