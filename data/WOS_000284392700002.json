However, because of the non-uniform cluster-head selection in the classical clustering algorithm, some nodes maybe exhaust energy prematurely. In this paper, a distributed, energy-efficient routing protocol based on multiple objective decision-making and ant colony (EERMA) is proposed for large scale cluster-based wireless sensor networks. A multiple objective decision-making based clustering algorithm is adopted to select the best nodes as the cluster-heads according to their energy efficiency. Meanwhile, the Density Method is adopted to avoid collisions and to ensure the symmetrical distribution of the cluster-heads. In inter-cluster, an improved AntNet algorithm, which is a biologically inspired paradigm specified for WSNs, is adopted across all cluster-heads to forward aggregate data to the sink node by means of multi-hop. As only cluster-heads participate in the inter-cluster routing operation, the algorithm can provide a smooth operation more effectively. Simulation results denote that EERMA algorithm has longer lifetime and more eximious expansibility than LEACH-like algorithms.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Hierarchical Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000284392700002"}
