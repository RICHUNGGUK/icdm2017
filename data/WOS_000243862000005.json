We show that a simplicial cycle is either a sequence of facets connected in the shape of a circle, or is a cone over such a structure. We show that a simplicial tree is a connected cycle-free simplicial complex, and use this characterization to produce an algorithm that checks in polynomial time whether a simplicial complex is a tree. We also present an efficient algorithm for checking whether a simplicial complex is grafted, and therefore Cohen-Macaulay. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
