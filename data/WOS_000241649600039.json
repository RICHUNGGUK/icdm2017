In this paper, we present a new continuous multiresolution model that maintains its geometry, based on triangle strips, in high-performance memory in the GPU. This model manages the level of detail by performing fast strip updating operations. We show how this approach takes advantage of the new capabilities of GPUs in an efficient manner.", "paper_title": "Continuous level of detail on graphics hardware", "paper_id": "WOS:000241649600039"}
