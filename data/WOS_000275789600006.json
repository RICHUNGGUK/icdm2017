By defining an object as a combination of a symbol-structure and its associated operations, it shows how the representation of problems can become related to control, which conducts the search in finding a solution. Different types of representation of problems in the machine are classified into four categories, and in a similar way four distinct models are distinguished for the representation of problems in the mind. The concept of layered hierarchies, as the main theme of the object-oriented paradigm, is used to examine the implications of problem representation in the mind for improving the representation of problems in the machine.", "paper_title": "An Object-Oriented View on Problem Representation as a Search-Efficiency Facet: Minds vs. Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000275789600006"}
