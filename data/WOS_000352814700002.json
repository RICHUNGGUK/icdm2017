Our main tool is an 'almost Lipschitz' condition that we show for the cumulative distribution function associated to martingales with the savings property. Based on a result of Schnorr, we prove that for any base r, n.log(2) n-randomness in base r implies normality in base r, and that n (4)-randomness in base r implies absolute normality. Our methods yield a construction of an absolutely normal real number which is computable in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Feasible Analysis, Randomness, and Base Invariance", "paper_id": "WOS:000352814700002"}
