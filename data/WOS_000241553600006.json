Our idea is to formulate relaxation labelling as a diffusion process on the vector of object-label probabilities. According to this picture, the label probabilities are given by the state-vector of a continuous time random walk on a support graph. The state-vector is the solution of the heat equation on the support-graph. The nodes of the support graph are the Cartesian product of the object-set and label-set of the relaxation process. The compatibility functions are combined in the weight matrix of the support graph. The solution of the heat-equation is found by exponentiating the eigensystern of the Laplacian matrix for the weighted support graph with time. We demonstrate the new relaxation process on a toy labeling example which has been studied extensively in the early literature, and a feature correspondence matching problem abstracted in terms of relational graphs. The experiments show encouraging labeling and matching results.", "paper_title": "Graph spectral approach to consistent labelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600006"}
