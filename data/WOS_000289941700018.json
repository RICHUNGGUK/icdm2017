In contrast to most current methods which handle this problem based on trying to learn a reliable predictor from the observations, we consider it from the perspective of sparse representation and propose a novel method which is named l1-sparse representation of missing markers prediction (L1-SRMMP). We assume that the incomplete pose can be represented by a linear combination of a few poses from the training set and the representation is sparse. Therefore, we cast the predicting missing markers as finding a sparse representation of the observable data of the incomplete pose, and then we use it to predict the missing data. In order to get a sparse representation, we employ l1-norm in our objective function. Moreover, we propose presentation coefficient weighted update (PCWU) algorithm to mitigate the limited capacity problem of the training set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method to predict the missing markers in human motion capture.
