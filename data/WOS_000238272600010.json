Both the switching instants and the control function are to be chosen such that the cost functional is minimized. Through the discretization of the control space, each control component is approximated by a piecewise constant function. The partition points and the heights of each of these piecewise constant functions are taken as decision varibles. Using the control parameterization enhancing transform, we map both types of switching instants into preassigned knot points via the introduction of an additional control, known as the enhancing control. In this way, we construct a sequence of approximate optimal parameter selection problems with fixed switching time points. We then show that these approximate optimal parameter selection problems are solvable as mathematical programming problems. The convergence analysis of this approximation is investigated. Two examples are solved using the proposed method so as to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method proposed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
