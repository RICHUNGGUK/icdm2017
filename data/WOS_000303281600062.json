The results prove highly sensitive to both the choice of modelling methodology used to handle negative numbers (i.e., Silva Portela et al., 2004 or Emrouznejad et al., 2010), and to the choice of risk control variable, namely loan loss provisions or equity capital. The most efficient bank grouping is generally found to be the 'state-owned' banks with the least efficient the 'regional government-owned' banks. The results of the impact of scale on the efficiency scores are ambiguous. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
