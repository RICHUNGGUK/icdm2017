In this paper, a baseband demodulator based on a matched filter (MF) is proposed to enhance the reliability of signal processing for the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 (Gen2) RFID reader systems. The proposed demodulator is very robust against strong signal distortions and large frequency deviations happening on the received backscattered signal from a passive RFID tag. The validity and usefulness is demonstrated by both computer simulations and implementation experiments.", "paper_title": "A Robust Baseband Demodulator for ISO 18000-6C RFID Reader Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308793100001"}
