Genetic algorithm crossover and mutation operators are completed with insertion or deletion operators adapted for side branches. A new substitution operator is devised for cyclic molecules. The mixture fitness is evaluated by a weighted sum of property performances. Molecules are represented by molecular graphs. They are split into molecular fragments which are built from polyatomic groups. Molecules or molecular fragments can be fixed, constrained or left free for building a new molecule. Building blocks are chemical functional groups or bio-sourced synthons. A specific coding of hydrogen-suppressed atoms is devised that can be used with various property estimation models where atom connectivity information is required. Illustration is provided through three case studies to find levulinic, glycerol and bio-based derivatives as substitute for chlorinated paraffin, methyl p-coumarate ester solvent and blanket wash solvent, respectively.
