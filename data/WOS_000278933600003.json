Unlike existing models, the optimization frameworks can determine the optimal designs automatically without trial-and-error once the objective(s) is/are clearly defined. Moreover, these frameworks allow the evaluation of the impacts of the optimal designs on the related parties including landowners, toll road operators, transit operators, and road users, and help network planners and profit-makers with decision making by eliminating many alternative designs. A numerical study is set up to examine road network design's effects on these related parties under three road construction schemes: exact cost recovery, build-operate-transfer, and cross-subsidization. The results show that the changes in landowner profits are not the same after implementing any scheme. These unequal changes raise the issue of the landowner equity. This implies that the government has to consider trade-offs between parties' objectives carefully.", "paper_title": "Time-Dependent Discrete Network Design Frameworks Considering Land Use", "paper_id": "WOS:000278933600003"}
