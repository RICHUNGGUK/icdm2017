For this configuration, the visibility counting problem (VCP) is to preprocess S such that the number of visible segments in S from any query point p can be computed quickly. In this paper, we solve VTP in expected logarithmic query time using quadratic preprocessing time and space. Moreover, we propose a (1 + delta)-approximation algorithm for VCP using at most quadratic preprocessing time and space. The query time of this method is O-epsilon (1/delta(2) root n) where O-epsilon (f (n)) = O (f (n)n(epsilon)) and epsilon > 0 is an arbitrary constant number. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
