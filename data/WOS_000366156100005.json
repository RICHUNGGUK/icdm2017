The placement policy used to map applications onto physical servers has important effects in terms of application performance and resource efficiency. We propose enhancing placement policies with network-aware optimizations, trying to simultaneously improve application performance, resource efficiency and power efficiency. The per-application placement decision is formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem (minimizing communication cost and the number of physical servers on which an application runs) whose solution is searched using evolutionary techniques. We have tested three multi-objective optimization algorithms with problem-specific crossover and mutation operators. Simulation-based experiments demonstrate how, in comparison with classic placement techniques, a low-cost optimization results in improved assignments of resources, making applications run faster and reducing the energy consumed by the data center. This is beneficial for both cloud clients and cloud providers.", "paper_title": "Towards a Greener Cloud Infrastructure Management using Optimized Placement Policies", "paper_id": "WOS:000366156100005"}
