In this paper, we propose a novel coding-based saliency measure by exploring both global and local cues for saliency computation. Firstly, we construct a bottom-up saliency map by considering global contrast information via low level features. Secondly, by using a locality-constrained linear coding algorithm, a top-down saliency map is formulated based on the reconstruction error. To better exploit the local and global information, we integrate the bottom-up and top-down maps as the final saliency map. Extensive experimental results on three large benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms 22 state-of-the-art methods in terms of three popular evaluation measures, i.e., the Precision and Recall curve, Area Under ROC Curve and F-measure value. Furthermore, the proposed coding-based method can be easily applied in other methods for significant improvement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
