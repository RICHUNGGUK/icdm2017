Here we show that accurate estimation of the background motion from an image velocity field can be accomplished through an iterative cooperation between two modules: one that specializes in calculating a weighted average velocity and another one calculating a velocity contrast map. We build on our analysis to provide a model for the tectum-pretectum loop in the nonmammalian midbrain. Our model accounts for some of the known properties of the tectal neurons (sensitivity to relative motion) and pretectal neurons (sensitivity to whole-field motion). It also agrees with our knowledge of the pretectotectal projection (divergent and inhibitory), and with the results of lesion studies in which the pretectal input to the tectum was removed, leading to hyperactivity of the tectal neurons and the animal. Our model also makes a testable prediction regarding the tectopretectal projection, i.e., that the presence of a larger object and a bigger discrepancy between the directions of motion for the object and the background lead to a larger error by the pretectum in estimating the background motion when the tectal input is abolished.", "paper_title": "Iterative cooperation between parallel pathways for object and background motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000240896600007"}
