In this paper, we extend the applications of POD method, i.e., combine the classical finite volume element (FVE) method with the POD method to obtain a reduced-order FVE formulation with lower dimensions and sufficiently high accuracy for two-dimensional solute transport problems, which have real life practical applications. We then provide error estimates between the reduced-order POD FVE solutions and classical FVE solutions and we provide implementation of an extrapolation algorithm for solving the reduced-order FVE formulation. Thus, we provide the theoretical basis for practical applications. A numerical example is then used to ascertain that the results of numerical computation are consistent with the theoretical derivations. Moreover, it is shown that the reduced-order FVE formulation based on POD method is both feasible and efficient for solving two-dimensional solute transport problems. (C) 2013 IMACS.
