The approach builds on the formalization of an atomic interaction and defines composition rules to describe complex choreographies. The logic permits to reason on the choreography formalization and to derive the properties of interest. A pleasant characteristics of the proposed approach is that the composition of formulae, corresponding to a choreography, results in a formula shaping as an atomic interaction formula. Therefore, the properties of complex choreographies can be uniformly described as interactions. We demonstrate the approach using a business scenario already tackled in the literature.", "paper_title": "A logical view of choreography", "paper_id": "WOS:000239479100012"}
