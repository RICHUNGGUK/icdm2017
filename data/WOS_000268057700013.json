In contract net protocol. an agent may play the role of a manager or a bidder. Without a coordination mechanism, a manager may acquire excessive resources from the bidders in forming a collaborative network to execute the assigned task and thus hinder the progress of the tasks assigned to other managers due to resource contention. As a result, application of contract net protocol may not always lead to feasible solutions to accomplish tasks effectively. As a general framework for exchanging messages, the original contract net protocol does not prescribe how agents should cooperate. How to develop a collaborative mechanism to effectively perform the tasks is an important issue. This paper aims to improve the insufficiency of the contract net by developing a mechanism to facilitate cooperation of agents to accomplish their tasks while avoiding undesirable states and enhance the overall system performance in manufacturing systems. To achieve these objectives, detail process models about how agents accomplish their tasks are required. Due to the advantages in modeling concurrent, synchronous and/or asynchronous activities, Petri nets are adopted in this paper. Based on Petri net models, we study the information needed for agents to make cooperative decisions, mechanism to make agents cooperate, and how to enhance the performance in the system level by taking advantage of the agents' cooperation capabilities. To characterize the condition for cooperation, we represent the collaborative networks formed based on the contract net protocol with Petri nets and then find the condition for a collaborative network to be feasible. The feasible condition also serves as a condition for the development of cooperation mechanism for managers. We propose a cooperation mechanism based on the idea of resource donation, including unilateral resource donation and reciprocal resource donation. Implementation architecture has also been proposed to realize our methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
