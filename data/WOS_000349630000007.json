The composite service that provides the best utility while meeting the QoS requirements has to be found. This paper proposes a network model where many complementary candidates could be selected for each service class to improve the benefits, while the conventional model limits the selection to a single service candidate or service level per service class. The selection of services step is NP-hard because it can be reduced to a multi-constraint knapsack problem. Yet, the decision has to be reached rapidly so that it does not increase the overall workflow time. Large-size networks and problems with high restriction levels (strong QoS requirements) are the most problematic. Traditional multiple-constrained-shortest-path (MCSP) heuristics are improved in this paper using the novel concept \"potential feasibility\". When our modified MCSP heuristic algorithms are compared to the CPLEX solver, one of them demonstrates a significantly smaller average runtime. Further, it provides solutions within a 2.6 percent optimality gap on average for small networks, and a 10 percent optimality gap on average for large networks, regardless of the restriction level. Our algorithm uses a general utility function, not derived from the QoS parameters.", "paper_title": "Network and QoS-Based Selection of Complementary Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000349630000007"}
