The kernel of the algorithm is to solve the all nearest smaller values problem. Provided n/p = Omega(p), we present an algorithm that achieves optimal sequential computation time and uses only a constant number of communication phases, with the message volume in each phase bounded above by (n/p + p) in the worst case and p in the average case. Experiments have been performed on two clusters: an SGI Intel Linux Cluster and a Sun cluster of work-stations, both showing low communication overhead and good speedups. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
