Human detection and tracking play a major role in such scenarios. One of the main challenges is to track them with long term occlusions due to agile nature of human navigation. However, in general humans do not make random movements. They tend to follow common motion patterns depending on their intentions and environmental/physical constraints. Therefore, knowledge of such common motion patterns could allow a robotic device to robustly track people even with long term occlusions. On the other hand, once a robust tracking is achieved, they can be used to enhance common motion pattern models allowing robots to adapt to new motion patterns that could appear in the environment. Therefore, this paper proposes to learn human motion patterns based on Sampled Hidden Markov Model (SHMM) and simultaneously track people using a particle filter tracker. The proposed simultaneous people tracking and human motion pattern learning has not only improved the tracking robustness compared to more conservative approaches, it has also proven robustness to prolonged occlusions and maintaining identity. Furthermore, the integration of people tracking and on-line SHMM learning have led to improved learning performance. These claims are supported by real world experiments carried out on a robot with suite of sensors including a laser range finder. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
