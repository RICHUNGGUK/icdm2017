In this paper, we address this challenge by building on computer vision tools to automate the collection and distribution of audiovisual content. Especially, we proposed a complete production process of personalized video summaries in a typical application scenario, where the sensor network for media acquisition is composed of multiple cameras, which, for example, cover a basketball field. Distributed analysis and interpretation of the scene are exploited to decide what to show or not to show about the event, so as to produce a video composed of a valuable subset of the streams provided by each individual camera. Interestingly, the selection of the streams subsets to forward to each user depends on his/her individual preferences, making the process adaptive and personalized. The process involves numerous integrated technologies and methodologies, including but not limited to automatic scene analysis, camera viewpoint selection, adaptive streaming, and generation of summaries through automatic organization of stories. The proposed technology provides practical solutions to a wide range of applications, such as personalized access to local sport events through a web portal, cost-effective and fully automated production of content dedicated to small-audience, or even automatic log in of annotations.", "paper_title": "An Autonomous Framework to Produce and Distribute Personalized Team-Sport Video Summaries: A Basketball Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000297343400017"}
