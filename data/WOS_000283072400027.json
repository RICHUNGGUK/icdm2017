Even when suitable error-control coding is applied, an adversary can, in many interesting practical situations, overwhelm the error-correcting capability of the code. To limit the power of potential adversaries, a broadcast transformation is introduced, in which nodes are limited to just a single (broadcast) transmission per generation. Under this broadcast transformation, the multicast capacity of a network is changed (in general reduced) from the number of edge-disjoint paths between source and sink to the number of internally disjoint paths. Exploiting this fact, a family of networks is proposed whose capacity is largely unaffected by a broadcast transformation. This results in a significant achievable transmission rate for such networks, even in the presence of adversaries.", "paper_title": "Robust Network Coding in the Presence of Untrusted Nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000283072400027"}
