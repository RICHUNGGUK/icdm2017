Although most phases of data warehouse design have received considerable attention in the literature, not much research has been conducted concerning data warehouse testing. In this paper, the authors introduce a number of data mart-specific testing activities, classify them in terms of what is tested and how it is tested, and show how they can be framed within a reference design method to devise a comprehensive and scalable approach. Finally, the authors discuss some practical evidences emerging from a real case study.", "paper_title": "Data Warehouse Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000307049800002"}
