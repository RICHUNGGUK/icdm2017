In this paper, to mitigate access time failures and excessive leakage in caches, we propose a novel selective wordline boosting mechanism combined with SRAM cell arrays voltage lowering. Based on our evaluation, the proposed approach recovers up to 83.1% of the yield losses.", "paper_title": "Fine-Grain Voltage Tuned Cache Architecture for Yield Management Under Process Variations", "paper_id": "WOS:000305605800018"}
