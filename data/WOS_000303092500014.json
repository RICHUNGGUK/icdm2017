The np control chart is an attribute chart used to monitor the fraction nonconforming p of a process. This chart is effective for detecting large process shifts in p. The attribute synthetic chart is also proposed to detect p shifts. It utilizes the information about the time interval or the Conforming Run Length (CRL) between two nonconforming samples. During the implementation of a synthetic chart, a sample is classified as nonconforming if the number d of nonconforming units falls beyond a warning limit. Unlike the np chart, the synthetic chart is more powerful to detect small and moderate p shifts. This article proposes a new scheme, the Syn-np chart, which comprises a synthetic chart and an np chart. Since the Syn-np chart has both the strength of the synthetic chart for quickly detecting small p shifts and the advantage of the np chart of being sensitive to large p shifts, it has a better and more uniform overall performance. Specifically, it is more effective than the np chart and synthetic chart by 73% and 31%, respectively, in terms of Weighted Average of Average Time to Signal (WAATS) over a wide range of p shifts under different conditions.
