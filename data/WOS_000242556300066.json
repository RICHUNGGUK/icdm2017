The premature convergence problem is a deficiency of PSOs. First, we analyze the causes of premature convergence for conventional PSO. Second, the principles of information diffusion and clonal selection are incorporated into the proposed PSO algorithm to achieve a better diversity and break away from local optima. Finally, when compared with several other PSO variants, it yields better performance on optimization of unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions.", "paper_title": "Particle swarm optimization based on information diffusion and clonal selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300066"}
