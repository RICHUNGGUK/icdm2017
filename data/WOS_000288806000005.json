Our system maintains a probabilistic representation of a group activity, describing how individual activities of its group members must be organized temporally, spatially, and logically. In order to recognize each of the represented group activities, our system searches for a set of group members that has the maximum posterior probability of satisfying its representation. A hierarchical recognition algorithm utilizing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based probability distribution sampling has been designed, detecting group activities and finding the acting groups simultaneously. The system has been tested to recognize complex activities such as 'a group of thieves stealing an object from another group' and 'a group assaulting a person'. Videos downloaded from YouTube as well as videos that we have taken are tested. Experimental results show that our system recognizes a wide range of group activities more reliably and accurately, as compared to previous approaches.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Representation and Recognition of High-Level Group Activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000288806000005"}
