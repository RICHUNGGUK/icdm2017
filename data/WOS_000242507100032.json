The MAP detector error performance is evaluated and compared with that of a hard-decision detector and MLSD over an intersymbol interference channel. It is shown that a MAP detector provides superb performance even in a dispersive channel with high D-T.", "paper_title": "MAP detectors for differential pulse-position modulation over indoor optical wireless communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100032"}
