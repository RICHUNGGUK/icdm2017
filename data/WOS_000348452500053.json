The practical hydrothermal system possesses various constraints which make the problem of finding global optimum difficult. This paper develops an improved multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm to solving the above problem. A local learning operation is added into the original regularity model-based multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA) in the improved approach so as to improve the local search ability and enhance the convergence efficiency. Furthermore, a repair mechanism is employed to repair the searched infeasible solutions in order to be able to search in the feasible region. In the experiment, the results obtained by the proposed approach have been compared with those from other three MOEAs: NSGA-II, NNIA, and RM-MEDA. Results from some pervious reported methods have also been employed to compare with our method. In addition, the results demonstrate the superiority of this proposed method as a promising MOEA to solve this power system multiobjective optimization problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
