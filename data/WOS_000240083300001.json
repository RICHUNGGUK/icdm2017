First a recursive rule base adjustment algorithm is developed, which has the benefit that it is computationally more efficient for the generation of a decision table. Then utilizing the advantage of CA optimization, a novel approach that each random combination of the optimized parameters (including the membership function selection for the rule base and controller scaling factors) is coded into a Real Coded string and treated as a chromosome in genetic algorithms is given. The optimization for rule base with the correspondent membership function and scaling factors using CA is easy to be realization in engineering. Simulation results are presented to support this thesis.", "paper_title": "GA optimization for FLC with its rule base and scaling factors adjustment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300001"}
