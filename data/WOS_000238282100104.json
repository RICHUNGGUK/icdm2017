This model extends the articulater modelling technique recently used in audio-only speech recognition to audio-visual domain. A multiple-stream structure with a shared articulator layer is used in the model to mimic the speech production process. We also present an adaptive reliability measure (ARM) based on two local dispersion indicators, integrating audio and visual streams with local, temporal reliability. Experiments on the AVCONDIG database shows that our model can achieve comparable recognition performance with the multi-stream hidden Markov model (MSHMM) under various noisy conditions. With the help of the ARM, our model even performs the best at some testing SNRs.", "paper_title": "Multi-stream articulator model with adaptive reliability measure for audio visual speech recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100104"}
