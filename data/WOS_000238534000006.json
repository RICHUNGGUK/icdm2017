Very often, the measured distortion levels are less severe than those predicted by the models but often show the presence of noncharacteristic harmonics that do not exit in simulation results. This is due to the fact that the harmonic generation is a stochastic process. It is particularly true in the case of loads made of a multitude of small nonlinear loads such as computer power supplies. The minute differences between the individual loads must be taken into account. An auxiliary module was added to the well-known ATP/EMTP software to randomly vary several simulation parameters. Using Monte Carlo iterative process much more realistic distortion levels are obtained. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of IMACS.
