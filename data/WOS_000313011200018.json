Supertargeting using CC has two key limitations. Firstly, the HEN area calculations are drastically simplified through the assumption that CC segments may be considered as pseudo-single hot and cold streams exchanging heat via only one exchanger that is governed by a single cost correlation. Secondly, the current Supertargeting approach of considering only one hot and one cold utility level may lead to a crude estimation of the total HEN cost and the optimum Delta T-min. This work presents the stream temperature vs. enthalpy plot supertargeting (STEPS) method that overcomes these limitations. This paper proves that supertargeting based on CC can lead to up to 50% error in the total cost target and poor Delta T-min estimations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
