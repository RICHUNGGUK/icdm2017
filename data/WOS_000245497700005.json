While Granger causality tests have been studied extensively in the univariate setting, much less is known for the multivariate case. Multivariate out-of-sample tests for Granger causality are proposed and their performance is measured by a simulation study. The results are graphically represented by size-power plots. It emerges that the multivariate regression test is the most powerful among the considered possibilities. As a real data application, it is investigated whether the consumer confidence index Granger causes retail sales in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
