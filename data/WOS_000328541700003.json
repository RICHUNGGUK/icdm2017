One of the central techniques for extending the span of BPM applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This work aggregates and reviews previous works on NLP standardization for BPM. Based on these works, we present a set of BPM applications, aiming at extending the utilization of the knowledge embedded in business process repositories. To verify the industrial deployment, we then present an extended case study that examines the feasibility of the suggested applications in real life scenarios using the ProcessGene BPM suite.", "paper_title": "Business Process Management Applications based on Semantic Process Models: the ProcessGene Suite Case-Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000328541700003"}
