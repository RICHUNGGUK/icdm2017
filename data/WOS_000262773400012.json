There is a growing interest in identifying the relationship between miRNAs and their target mRNAs. Various experimental studies have been carried out to discover miRNAs involved in cancer and to identify their target genes. At the same time, a large volume of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles have become available owing to the development of high-throughput measurement technologies. So, there is now a pressing need to develop a computational method by which we can identify the target mRNAs of given miRNAs from such massive expression data sets. In this respect, we propose an effective linear model based identification method to unravel the relationship between miRNAs and their target mRNAs in colorectal cancer by using microarray expression profiles and sequence data.
