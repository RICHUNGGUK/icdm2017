Then, we exploit this experimental scheme to identify a physical situation where the known notions of quantum interferometry do not directly apply. A generalization of such notions is proposed that turns out to satisfy the authentic meaning of the interferometric quantum complementarity.", "paper_title": "KNOWLEDGE ABOUT NONCOMMUTING OBSERVABLES AND INTERFEROMETRIC COMPLEMENTARITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000308558200005"}
