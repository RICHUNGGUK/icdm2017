It was found that lipoic acid is capable of scavenging only very reactive radicals, while the dehydrogenated form is an excellent scavenger via a hydrogen transfer mechanism. The environment plays an important role in the free radical scavenging activity of DHLA because in water it is deprotonated, and this enhances its activity. In particular, the reaction rate constant of DHLA in water with an HOO center dot radical is close to the diffusion limit. This has been explained on the basis of the strong H-bonding interactions found in the transition state, which involve the carboxylate moiety, and it might have implications for other biological systems in which this group is present.", "paper_title": "Lipoic Acid and Dihydrolipoic Acid.
