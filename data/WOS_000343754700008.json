In the random connection model two points x and y are connected with probability g(y - x), where g is a given function. We prove that the diameter of the graph is bounded by a constant, which depends only on parallel to g parallel to(1), with high probability as the number of vertices in the graph tends to infinity.", "paper_title": "The Random Connection Model on the Torus", "paper_id": "WOS:000343754700008"}
