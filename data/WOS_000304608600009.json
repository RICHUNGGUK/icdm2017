In the proposed scheme, the Shannon entropy is employed to measure randomness of the generated random numbers. In addition, some characteristics of the generated random numbers are investigated. To reach the pure quantum randomness, an extraction approach based on universal hash functions for the generated quantum random numbers is presented. Results show that the proposed scheme based on squeezed vacuum state has remarkable advantages over the one associated with the vacuum state.", "paper_title": "UNBIASED QUANTUM RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION BASED ON SQUEEZED VACUUM STATE", "paper_id": "WOS:000304608600009"}
