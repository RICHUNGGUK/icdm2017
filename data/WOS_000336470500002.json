We first propose definitions of complex fuzzy sets and discuss entailed results which parallel those of regular fuzzy numbers. We then give two existence results relevant to the Cauchy problem for fuzzy differential equations in the case of bounded integral operators. These results require either Holder continuous or Lipschitz continuous response functions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
