In this article the spatial variability of soil nutrients was investigated and a regionalized nutrient management system was developed using geostatistics and geographic information system technologies. A total of 511 GPS-referenced soil samples were taken in Yongji County, Shanxi province, China, and analysed for major soil nutrients: soil total nitrogen (TN), Olsen extractable phosphorus (OLSENP) and extractable potassium (EXTK). Low concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were found and they are likely to be the main limiting nutrients for crop growth in this county. Within the county moderate spatial dependence was found for all three soil variables, but at different spatial scales. The spatial distributions of TN, OLSENP and EXTK were estimated by using kriging interpolation. The cropped areas of the county were divided into fertilizer management categories consisting of four classes of TN, three classes of OLSENP and two classes of EXTK. For the targeted crop yields, regionalized fertilization maps of N, P and K in the county were produced using geographic information system. In 3-year field verification trials in two villages the crop yields of the wheat-maize rotation system increased by 10-20%, and farmers' cash income increased by 1550-2610 RMB ha(-1) year(-1) where regional fertilization recommendations were implemented, in comparison with traditional farmers' practices. The regionalized maps are a practical alternative to site-specific soil nutrient management approaches in areas where it is not practical, because of small farm size or other constraints, to use intensive soil sampling and chemical analyses.", "paper_title": "Spatial variability of soil nutrients and GIS-based nutrient management in Yongji County, China", "paper_id": "WOS:000278668800001"}
