Existing members are costless, but new members and additions to the cross-section of existing members have a non-zero cost. The added weight is minimized for given behavioural constraints. The proposed analytical theory is illustrated with examples of least-weight (Michell) trusses having (a) stress or compliance constraints, (b) one loading condition and (c) some pre-existing members. Different permissible stresses in tension and compression are also considered. The proposed theory is also confirmed by finite element (FE)-based numerical solutions.", "paper_title": "Exact analytical theory of topology optimization with some pre-existing members or elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000242612000005"}
