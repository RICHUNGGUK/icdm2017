Thus, improving fault diagnosis systems and reducing the mean time to repair with automatic systems is an important area of research for telecommunications companies. This paper presents a Fault Diagnosis Multi-Agent System (MAS) applied for the management of a business service of Telefonica Czech Republic. The proposed MAS is based on an extended Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model that combines heterogeneous reasoning processes, ontology-based reasoning and Bayesian reasoning. This hybrid diagnostic technique is described in detail in the paper. The system has been evaluated with data collected during one and a half years of system operation on a live network. The main benefits of the system have been a significant reduction in both the average incident solution time and the mean diagnosis time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
