The decision upon lot acceptance can be made in the first or second stage according to the number of failures from each group. The design parameters of the proposed plan such as number of groups required and the acceptance number for each of two stages are determined independently of an underlying lifetime distribution so as to satisfy the consumer's risk at the specified unreliability. Single-stage group sampling plans are also considered as special cases of the proposed plan and compared with the proposed plan in terms of the average sample number and the operating characteristics. Some important distributions are considered to explain the procedure developed here.", "paper_title": "A two-stage group sampling plan based on truncated life tests for a general distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000299727100011"}
