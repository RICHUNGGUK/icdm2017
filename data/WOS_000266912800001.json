Semantic web aims to provide a new framework that can enable knowledge sharing and reusing. Semantic web is a collection of web technologies that include a number of markup languages such as RDF, OWL and RDFS. These markup languages are used for modeling a domain ontology. By using ontology to model resources, humans and computers (software agents) can have a consensus on the resource structure. The use of these technologies allows the creation of a more effective web search system. In this paper, we modeled travel domain ontology by using Web Ontology Language ( OWL). Instead of inviting an expert to model the ontology, we created the travel ontology by collecting and analyzing the structural information from a number of travel related websites. Besides, we implemented an intelligent ontology-based Multi-Agent System for sighTseER (MASTER), which is constructed by using semantic web technologies. MASTER integrates Global Positioning System (GPS), ontology and agent technologies to support location awareness for providing the precise navigation and classify the tourist information for the users. The system was tested on 30 novice users. 83% of the users felt that the system can help tourists find tourist information in Hong Kong.", "paper_title": "MASTER: AN INTELLIGENT ONTOLOGY-BASED MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM FOR SIGHTSEER", "paper_id": "WOS:000266912800001"}
