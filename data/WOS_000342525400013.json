Based on separation results of outputs, this paper proposes the interval type-2 fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (T2FCMAC)-based learning rate adjustment for the BSS. The adopted T2FCMAC system has the ability of generating the proper learning rate by using the inputs of second- and higher order correlation coefficients of output components. In addition, to enhance the performance of the T2FCMAC-based learning rate approach, the T2FCMAC system is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm by the performance index of second-order correlation measure. Simulation and comparison results are introduced to show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Type-2 Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller-Based Learning Rate Adjustment for Blind Source Separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342525400013"}
