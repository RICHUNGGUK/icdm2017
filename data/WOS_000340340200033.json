For k pairs of valence nucleons in n non-degenerate single-particle energy levels, the approach utilizes that solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations can be obtained from two matrices of dimensions (k + 1) x (k + 1) and (n - 1) x (k + 1), which are associated with the extended Heine-Stieltjes and Van Vleck polynomials, respectively. Since the coefficients in these polynomials are free from divergence with variations in contrast to the original Bethe ansatz equations, the approach provides an efficient and systematic way to solve the problem. The method reduces to solving a system of k polynomial equations, which can be efficiently implemented by the fast Newton-Raphson algorithm with a Monte Carlo sampling procedure for the initial guesses. By extension, the present algorithm can also be used to solve a large class of Gaudin-type quantum many-body problems, including an efficient angular momentum projection method for multi-particle systems.
