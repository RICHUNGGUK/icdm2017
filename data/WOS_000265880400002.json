First, we develop a new and effective technique based on a probabilistic method that allows us to develop a simpler and more efficient deterministic kernelization algorithm for the unweighted set splitting problem. We then propose a randomized algorithm for the weighted set splitting problem that is based on a new subset partition technique and has its running time bounded by O (*)(2 (k) ), which is significantly better than that of the previous best deterministic algorithm (which only works for the simpler unweighted set splitting problem) of running time O (*)(2.65 (k) ). We also show that our algorithm can be de-randomized, which leads to a deterministic parameterized algorithm of running time O (*)(4 (k) ) for the weighted set splitting problem and gives the first proof that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable.", "paper_title": "Improved Parameterized Set Splitting Algorithms: A Probabilistic Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000265880400002"}
