In this work, a real-time perishable food supply chain monitoring system is developed based on ZigBee-standard wireless sensor network (WSN). Some important improvements including a configurable architecture for comprehensive sensors and an improved network switching scheme are designed to meet the application requirements. A tree-topology WSN system with 192 EndDevices and a star-topology WSN system with 80 EndDevices are implemented and evaluated in terms of both functions and performance. Test results show that the success rate of data communication is over 99%. Both theoretical analysis and realistic measurement results show that the EndDevices have a lifetime long enough for the application of supply chain monitoring. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
