The proposed method is based on a generalized nonlinear least squares approach, taking into account the spatial covariance. Weak consistency of the regression parameters estimator is derived, along with its asymptotic Gaussian limit. The behavior of the proposed estimator is illustrated with a simulation study, considering different correlation structures in R-2 and a more general case including a spatial covariate. The method is also applied to two real data cases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
