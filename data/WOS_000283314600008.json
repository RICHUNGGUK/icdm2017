The statistic properties of the Markov process and Brownian motion are employed to compute the constructed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional of a rather general form. This enables us to make sense of the challenging problems in the stochastic framework, and then find a way to extend the techniques developed in the deterministic framework. Therefore, the stability conditions are established with the aid of some slack matrices and the boundary conditions on time-varying delay. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the reduced conservatism.", "paper_title": "A new delay-dependent exponential stability criterion for Ito stochastic systems with Markovian switching and time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000283314600008"}
