Main capabilities include descriptive analysis, test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium. Analysis of association is based on linear or logistic regression according to the response variable (quantitative or binary disease status, respectively). Analysis of single SNPs: multiple inheritance models (co-dominant, dominant, recessive, over-dominant and log-additive), and analysis of interactions (gene-gene or gene-environment). Analysis of multiple SNPs: haplotype frequency estimation, analysis of association of haplotypes with the response, including analysis of interactions.", "paper_title": "SNPStats: a web tool for the analysis of association studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000239899700020"}
