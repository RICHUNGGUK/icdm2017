The relative mobility pattern between two nodes is evaluated by using a received message and the cluster is created by grouping nodes with a relative mobility below a specific threshold. Also, we create a hierarchical clustering structure by allowing a merge among clusters based on the mobility pattern. In this way, the proposed mechanism can increase a continuity of total cluster structure. Since we allow the combination of clusters, we can reduce the number of cluster and message required for a routing. To evaluate a performance of our mechanism, we compared ours with the existing LCC and WCA by a Glomosim. The simulation results show that our scheme can provide the higher stability and efficiency than existing schemes.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical clustering algorithm based on mobility in mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300100"}
