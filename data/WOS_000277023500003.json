Contrary to traditional algorithmic research, faults as well as joins and leaves occurring in a worst-case manner are hardly considered. In this article, we devise techniques to build dynamic peer-to-peer systems which remain fully functional in spite of an adversary who continuously adds and removes peers. We exemplify our algorithms on hypercube and pancake topologies and present a system which maintains small peer degree and network diameter.", "paper_title": "Towards worst-case churn resistant peer-to-peer systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277023500003"}
