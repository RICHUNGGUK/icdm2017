Using L-p-norm enables WLp-SVR to select financial variables for creating the financial conditions index (FCI) reliably. We use a weighted sum method to construct a Chinese FCI. We then evaluate our FCI's ability to forecast real output based on the Granger-causality and Engle-Granger cointegration tests. Regression results show that our FCI has strong predictive power in forecasting real output, indicating that our FCI is a potential leading indicator of the future state of the economy.", "paper_title": "Financial Conditions Index Construction Through Weighted L-p-Norm Support Vector Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189700009"}
