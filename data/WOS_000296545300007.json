By means of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models, the dynamics of filtering error generator and the fuzzy RFDF system are constructed. With the aid of the selected weighting matrix function, the design objective is to find an optimal RFDF which results in a minimal difference between the reference model (ideal solution) and the RFDF (real solution) to be designed. A sufficient condition is firstly established on the stochastic stability by using stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. Then in terms of linear matrix inequalities techniques, sufficient conditions on the existence of fuzzy RFDF are presented and proved. Finally, the design problem is formulated as an optimization algorithm. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed RFDF can detect the faults shortly after the occurrences.
