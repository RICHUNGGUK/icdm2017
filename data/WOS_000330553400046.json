I2I-ST performs the reversible subband transform and the AGDE method is a state-of-the-art method of reversible data hiding. The results of experiments we performed objectively and perceptually show that the proposed method has better visual quality than conventional methods at the same embedding rate due to low variance in the frequency domain.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Reversible Data Hiding via Integer-to-Integer Subband Transform and Adaptive Generalized Difference Expansion Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000330553400046"}
