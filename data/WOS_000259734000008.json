A new pipelined architecture to deal with range reduction for floating point representation is presented in this paper. The algorithm is based on a look-up table storing the corresponding powers of 2 mod A. The overall design has been optimized for a modulo equal to 2 pi, which is the most widely used due to trigonometric functions requirements. We provide an evaluation of different configurations and a full error propagation study which ensures an accuracy of one unit in the last place.", "paper_title": "Pipelined architecture for additive range reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000259734000008"}
