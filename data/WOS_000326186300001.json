We use the commonly used median objective as a measure of effectiveness, and the Gini index as a measure of (in)equity, and formulate bicriteria problems involving these objectives. We develop procedures to identify an efficient set of solutions to these problems, analyze the complexity of the proposed procedures, and finally illustrate the procedures with an example.Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
