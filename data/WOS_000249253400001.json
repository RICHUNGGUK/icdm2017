A desirable property of the ECDF is that a multivariate Elliptically Contoured Distribution (ECD) can be deduced directly from its lower dimension marginal distribution. Using the property, we extend a bivariate model that has been used to successfully model the 2-D joint probability distribution of a two dimension random vector-a wavelet coefficient and its parent to multivariate cases. Though our method only provides a simple and rough characterization of the full probability distribution of wavelet coefficients in a neighborhood, we find that the resulting denoising algorithm based on the extended multivariate models is computably tractable and produces state-of-the-art restoration results. In addition, we discuss the equivalence relation between our denoising algorithm and several other state-of-the-art denoising algorithms. Our work provides a unified mathematic interpretation of a type of statistical denoising algorithms. We also analyze the limitations and advantages of algorithms of this type.", "paper_title": "Multivariate statistical models for image denoising in the wavelet domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000249253400001"}
