However, the open SIP architecture constitutes the provided services vulnerable to various attacks, similar to those currently existing in Internet. The lack of a formal way to describe VoIP vulnerabilities hinders the development of tools being independent from a specific implementation. This paper introduces such a formalization for SIP-based VoIP services, utilizing ontologies, facilitating and extensible description of known SIP security vulnerabilities that can be employed in a real environment for testing or intrusion detection purposes.
