The method is based on decomposing the building blocks of the Fan-Hasan subquadratic Toeplitz matrix-vector multiplier. We reduce the space complexity of their architecture by recombining the building blocks. In comparison to other similar schemes available in the literature, our proposal presents a better space complexity while having the same time complexity. We also show that block recombination can be used for efficient implementation of the GHASH function of Galois Counter Mode (GCM).", "paper_title": "Block Recombination Approach for Subquadratic Space Complexity Binary Field Multiplication Based on Toeplitz Matrix-Vector Product", "paper_id": "WOS:000298560500002"}
