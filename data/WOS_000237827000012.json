The proposed framework consists of ubi-UCAM for generating user's contexts, NAVER for managing virtual environment, and rv-Interface for linking ubi-UCAM with NAVER. Firstly, personalized interface helps users to concentrate on their tasks of interest by reducing burdensome menu selections according to user's context. In addition, user-adaptive contents based on user's preferences allow more pleasure personal experiences. Finally, personalized interface with context hand-over mechanism enables users to continuously interact with virtual environments, even if the users move around. According to experimental results, we expect that the proposed framework can play an important role for realizing user-centric VR applications by exploiting personalized interface that adapts to user-centric context.", "paper_title": "Framework for personalized user interface by sharing user-centric context between real and virtual environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000237827000012"}
