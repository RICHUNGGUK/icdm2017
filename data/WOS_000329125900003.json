In addition, the sensor variables from plasma sensors require additional knowledge about plasmas, which becomes a big burden for engineers to utilize them in this filed. Thus an effective procedure for sensor variable selection with minimum plasma knowledge is needed to develop in plasma etching. The integrated squared response (ISR) based sensor variable selection method which facilitates collecting and analyzing sensor data at one time with regard to manipulated variables (MVs) is suggested in this paper. The reference sensor library as well as sensor ranking tables constructed on the basis of ISR can give insight into plasma sensors. The ISR based sensor variable selection method is incorporated with relative gain array (RGA) or non-square relative gain array (NRGA) for effective variable selection in building a virtual metrology (VM) system to predict critical dimension (CD) in plasma etching. The application of the technique introduced in this paper is shown to be effective in the CD prediction in plasma etching for a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) manufacturing. The procedure for sensor variable selection introduced in this paper can be a starting point for various sensor-related applications in semiconductor manufacturing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
