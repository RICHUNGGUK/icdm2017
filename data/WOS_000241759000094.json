The Intelligent Space (iSpace) can sense the whole space and evaluate the situations in the space by distributing sensors. The mobile agents serve the inhabitants in the space utilizes the evaluated information by iSpace. The iSpace evaluates the situations in the space and learns the walking behavior of the inhabitants. The human intelligence manifests in the space as a behavior, as a response to the situation in the space. The iSpace learns the behavior and applies to mobile agent motion planning and control. This paper introduces the application of fuzzy-neural network to describe the obstacle avoidance behavior learned from humans. Simulation and experiment results are introduced to demonstrate the efficiency of this method.", "paper_title": "Human hierarchical behavior based mobile agent control in ISpace with distributed network sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000094"}
