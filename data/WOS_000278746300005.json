Our proposed scheme is localized, uses greedy forwarding approach, and does not rely on neighborhood information. These characteristics reduce the communication overhead (no neighborhood information exchange), make the protocol highly scalable (no routing tables are maintained and beacons are not exchanged when a node leaves or enters a network), and performs better in mobile environments (as the next hop is non-deterministic and is computed at run time). It also deals with dead end problem by a recovery strategy in a distributed and localized way. The proposed protocol is implemented in the OMNET++ based discrete event simulation environment PAWiS. The results show that the proposed protocol provides guaranteed delivery, extended network lifetime, and a mechanism to route on the basis of end-to-end delay and/or energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Position-based Routing Protocol for Low Power Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278746300005"}
