This has led to a host of methods for quantifying recombination from sequence data. These methods are usually based on aligned DNA sequences. Here, we propose an efficient alignment-free alternative. Results: Our method is based on the distribution of match lengths, which we look up using enhanced suffix arrays. By eliminating the alignment step, the test becomes fast enough for application to whole bacterial genomes. Using simulations we show that our test has similar power as established tests when applied to long pairs of sequences. When applied to 58 genomes of Escherichia coli, we pick up the strongest recombination signal from a 125 kb horizontal gene transfer engineered 20 years ago.", "paper_title": "An alignment-free test for recombination", "paper_id": "WOS:000327714700004"}
