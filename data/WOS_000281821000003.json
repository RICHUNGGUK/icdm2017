We apply these results to graphs converging locally to trees and derive a new formula for the Stieltjes transform of the spectral measure of such graphs. We illustrate our results on the uniform regular graphs, Erdos-Renyi graphs and graphs with a given degree sequence. We give examples of application for weighted graphs, bipartite graphs and the uniform spanning tree of n vertices. 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
