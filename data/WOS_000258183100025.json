The network under investigation is quite general to reflect the reality, where the state, delays are allowed to be time varying with given lower and upper bounds, and the stochastic disturbances are assumed to be Brownian motions that affect not only the network coupling but also the overall networks. By utilizing the Lyapunov functional method combined with linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, we obtain several sufficient delay-dependent conditions that ensure the coupled networks to be globally exponentially synchronized in the mean square. A control law is designed to synchronize the addressed coupled complex networks in terms of certain LMIs that can be readily solved using the Matlab LMI toolbox. Two, numerical examples are presented to show the validity of our theoretical analysis results.", "paper_title": "Global synchronization control of general delayed discrete-time networks with stochastic coupling and disturbances", "paper_id": "WOS:000258183100025"}
