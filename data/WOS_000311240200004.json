In this context, the collaborative development of products provides new challenges in distributed systems. It requires continuous communication and exchanges between teams of collaborators having different roles and using different tools. A global model of collaboration is necessary to guarantee the quality of communication and to ensure adaptability and interoperability between tools within dynamically changing contexts. In this paper, we present a framework for collaborative model-based networked services development that supports a semantic adaptation model enabling the awareness of the presence, roles and tasks of collaborating actors. In this paper, the implementation of the framework FADYRCOS and its conceptual model are presented. Algorithms that implement the dynamic reconfiguration are described. A test case for collaborative software development has been developed to validate the framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
