Design/methodology/approach - The authors employed the innovation-diffusion model and the OLS estimating method to study message diffusion of two documentary films on the Wretch, the largest blog community in Taiwan. Findings - The results indicate that the mass media is the main source of message diffusion and that the internal communication power may increase as the opinion leader promotes these messages. Research limitations/amplications - Other factors that may influence message diffusion such as topic, design characteristics, and the existing social network have not been included. Practical implications - For practice, the result indicates that the mass media and the blog might complement each other. Originality/value - This research is one of the first that attempts to apply the innovation-diffusion model to analyze message diffusion within the blog community.", "paper_title": "Exploring individual communication power in the blogosphere", "paper_id": "WOS:000261445700006"}
