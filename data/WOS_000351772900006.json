Although consistency is a desirable property of databases, enforcing the satisfaction of integrity constraints might not be always feasible. In such cases, the presence of inconsistent data may have a negative effect on the results of data analysis and processing and, in consequence, there is an important need for data-cleaning tools to detect and remove, if possible, inconsistencies in large data sets. This work proposes strategies to support data cleaning of spatial databases with respect to a set of integrity constraints that impose topological relations between spatial objects. The basic idea is to rank the geometries in a spatial data set that should be modified to improve the quality of the data (in terms of consistency). An experimental evaluation validates the proposal and shows that the order in which geometries are modified affects both the overall quality of the database and the final number of geometries to be processed to restore consistency.", "paper_title": "Rank-based strategies for cleaning inconsistent spatial databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000351772900006"}
