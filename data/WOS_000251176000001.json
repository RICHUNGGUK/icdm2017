The systems under consideration allow all users use all available subcarriers independently and thus involve multiuser interference in the frequency domain. Direct application of the known pilot-aided single-user channel estimation methods to these systems is prohibited, requiring much more new investigations. The decentralized and centralized channel estimation algorithms are developed according to different multiuser scenarios. Optimal multiuser pilots are proposed, especially for centralized estimation methods with respect to the mean square error (MSE) of LS channel estimate. In addition, channel tracking algorithms are represented in terms of individual user's channels.", "paper_title": "Pilot-aided multiuser channel estimation and tracking in MIMO-OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251176000001"}
