WFG is based on the recently-described observation that the exclusive hypervolume of a point p relative to a set S is equal to the difference between the inclusive hypervolume of p and the hypervolume of S with each point limited by the objective values in p. WFG applies this technique iteratively over a set to calculate its hypervolume. Experiments show that WFG is substantially faster (in five or more objectives) than all previously-described algorithms that calculate hypervolume exactly.", "paper_title": "A Fast Way of Calculating Exact Hypervolumes", "paper_id": "WOS:000299812000006"}
