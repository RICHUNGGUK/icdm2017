The aim of this research is to analyse and discuss the application of 2.0 systems thinking (ST) in three countries (France, UK and Serbia) to promote sustainable tourism thinking. Design/methodology/approach - Online tourism ads available on YouTube, Vimeo, and Dailymotion, related to the cultural contexts of the UK, France and Serbia, have been analysed through a qualitative approach based on the use of visual methods. Furthermore, sustainable tourism dimensions and discourses have been identified in each context by applying intra- and intertextual analysis. Findings - The results show that the use of 2.0 ST to promote sustainable tourism should take into account environmental and socio-cultural issues in each cultural context. These findings show that both the UK and France promote sustainable tourism logic through applying a 2.0 ST. This is not the case with Serbia where online sustainable tourism videos are underrepresented and the online content is different from the one in the UK and France. Research limitations/implications - This research might help tourism researchers and professionals to understand cultural differences when promoting sustainable tourism through a 2.0 communication and online videos. The results show that tourism system has to be considered as a complex and a dynamic framework where intense interlinking of social media with political, cultural, promotional, and organizational aspects of tourism systems in different countries is present. Practical implications - The proposed framework in this study represents a tool that will enable tourism professionals to improve their sustainable tourism communication, especially the environmental and socio-cultural dimensions when considering a 2.0 communication approach. Originality/value - The original aspect of this research is related to the analysis of interactive videos in tourism studies and to the introduction of a new framework based on 2.0 ST, used to promote sustainable tourism in a cross-cultural context.", "paper_title": "Towards viral systems thinking: a cross-cultural study of sustainable tourism ads", "paper_id": "WOS:000334146900014"}
