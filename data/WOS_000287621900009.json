In this paper, we add a directional factor based on the flow of the target image, creating a stroke-like effect that follows edges more accurately. In addition, we propose a method to clearly express object boundaries by considering the effect of the medium on edges in the reference image. We also show how to select an appropriate weight for this directional factor from the reference image. We demonstrate the suitability of this improved form of texture transfer for expressing various artistic styles, and compare our results with those from previous texture-transfer algorithms. We find that our algorithm can be adapted to texture synthesis as well. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
