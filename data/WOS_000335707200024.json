The major obstacle to a routine application of this class of models is, however, the calibration of microplane-related constants from macroscopic data. The goal of this paper is twofold: (i) to introduce the basic ingredients of a robust inverse procedure for the determination of dominant parameters of the M4 model proposed by Bazant et al. (2000) based on cascade artificial neural networks trained by evolutionary algorithm and (ii) to validate the proposed methodology against a representative set of experimental data. The obtained results demonstrate that the soft computing-based method is capable of delivering the searched response with an accuracy comparable to the values obtained by expert users.
