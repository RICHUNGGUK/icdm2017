As proposals from DW subproblems are accumulated in the DW master problem, the solution time and memory requirements are increasing for the master problem. Approximation of the DW master problem solution significantly reduces the computational effort required to find the equilibrium. The approximate DW algorithm is applied to a time of use pricing model with realistic network constraints for the Ontario electricity market and to a two-region energy model for Canada. In addition to empirical analysis, theoretical results for the convergence of the approximate DW algorithm are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
