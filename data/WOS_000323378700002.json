However, it is desirable to have fresher data for business insights at near real-time. To this end, the authors propose to leverage a data warehouse's capability to directly import raw, unprocessed records and defer the transformation and data cleaning until needed by pending reports. At that time, the database's own processing mechanisms can be deployed to process the data on-demand. Event-processing capabilities are seamlessly woven into our proposed architecture. Besides outlining an overall architecture, the authors also developed a roadmap for implementing a complete prototype using conventional database technology in the form of hierarchical materialized views.", "paper_title": "On-Demand ELT Architecture for Right-Time BI: Extending the Vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000323378700002"}
