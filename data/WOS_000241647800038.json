It is mainly designed to be machine-readable and -processable. This paper takes the opposite side of view: RDF is investigated as a logic system designed for the needs of humans. RDF is developed as a logic system based on mathematical graphs, i.e., as diagrammatic reasoning system. As such, is has humanly-readable, diagrammatic representations. Moreover, a sound and complete calculus is provided. Its rules are suited to act on the diagrammatic representations. Finally, some normalforms for the graphs are introduced, and the calculus is modified to suit them.", "paper_title": "RDF as graph-based, diagrammatic logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800038"}
