This paper presents the Sticky-ERfair Scheduler, an Early-Release Fair (ERfair) scheduler that attempts to minimize task migrations and preemptions. Given any processor V (i) , Sticky-ERfair allocates to it the most recently executed ready task that previously executed on V (i) (thus restricting migrations and preemptions) in such a way that this allocation does not cause any ERfairness violations in the system at any time during the schedule length. Experimental results reveal that Sticky-ERfair can achieve upto over 40 times reduction both in the number of migrations and preemptions suffered with respect to Basic-ERfair (for a set of 25 to 100 tasks running on 2 to 10 processors) while simultaneously guaranteeing ERfairness at each time slot.", "paper_title": "Sticky-ERfair: a task-processor affinity aware proportional fair scheduler", "paper_id": "WOS:000291254200003"}
