Although, in general, a sufficient number of sensors are used to ensure a certain degree of redundancy in coverage, a good sensor deployment is still necessary to balance the workload of sensors. In a sensor network with locomotion facilities, sensors can move around to self-deploy. The movement-assisted sensor deployment deals with moving sensors from an initial unbalanced state to a balanced state. Therefore, various optimization problems can be defined to minimize different parameters, including total moving distance, total number of moves, communication/ computation cost, and convergence rate. In this paper, we first propose a Hungarian-algorithm-based optimal solution, which is centralized. Then, a localized Scan-based Movement-Assisted sensoR deploymenT method (SMART) and several variations of it that use scan and dimension exchange to achieve a balanced state are proposed. An extended SMART is developed to address a unique problem called communication holes in sensor networks. Extensive simulations have been done to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Scan-based movement-assisted sensor deployment methods in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247541500008"}
