To overcome this problem, a novel face-recognition system has been proposed, consisting of the extracted feature vectors from the multiple-size discrete cosine transforms (mDCTs) and the recognition mechanism with selective Gaussian mixture models (sGMMs). The mDCT could extract enough visual features from low-resolution face images while the sGMM could exclude unreliable observation features in recognition phase. Thus, the mDCT and the sGMM can greatly improve recognition rate at low-resolution conditions. Experiments are carried out on George Tech and AR facial databases in 16 x 16 and 12 x 12 pixels resolution. The results show that the proposed system achieves better performance than the existing methods for low-resolution face recognition.", "paper_title": "Low-resolution face recognition in uses of multiple-size discrete cosine transforms and selective Gaussian mixture models", "paper_id": "WOS:000348193900002"}
