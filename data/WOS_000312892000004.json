Most of the existing perceptual IQA metrics cannot accurately represent the degradations from different types of distortion, e. g., existing structural similarity metrics perform well on content-dependent distortions while not as well as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) on content-independent distortions. In this paper, we integrate the merits of the existing IQA metrics with the guide of the recently revealed internal generative mechanism (IGM). The IGM indicates that the human visual system actively predicts sensory information and tries to avoid residual uncertainty for image perception and understanding. Inspired by the IGM theory, we adopt an autoregressive prediction algorithm to decompose an input scene into two portions, the predicted portion with the predicted visual content and the disorderly portion with the residual content. Distortions on the predicted portion degrade the primary visual information, and structural similarity procedures are employed to measure its degradation; distortions on the disorderly portion mainly change the uncertain information and the PNSR is employed for it. Finally, according to the noise energy deployment on the two portions, we combine the two evaluation results to acquire the overall quality score. Experimental results on six publicly available databases demonstrate that the proposed metric is comparable with the state-of-the-art quality metrics.", "paper_title": "Perceptual Quality Metric With Internal Generative Mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000312892000004"}
