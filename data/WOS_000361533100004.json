Although a variety of DEM products are available, they often suffer from problems varying in spatial coverage, data resolution, and accuracy. However, the multi-source DEMs often contain supplementary information, which makes it possible to produce a higher-quality DEM through blending the multi-scale data. Inspired by super-resolution ( SR) methods, we propose a regularized framework for the production of high-resolution ( HR) DEM data with extended coverage. To deal with the registration error and the horizontal displacement among multi-scale measurements, robust data fidelity with weighted L-1 norm is employed to measure the conformance of the reconstructed HR data to the observed data. Furthermore, a slope-based Markov random field ( MRF) regularization is used as the spatial regularization. The proposed method can simultaneously handle complex terrain features, noises, and data voids. Using the proposed method, we can reconstruct a seamless DEM data with the highest resolution among the input data, and an extensive spatial coverage. The experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method under different cases.", "paper_title": "Fusion of multi-scale DEMs using a regularized super-resolution method", "paper_id": "WOS:000361533100004"}
