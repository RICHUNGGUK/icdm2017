Lung segmentation is a requisite preprocessing step for most CAD schemes. This paper proposes a parameter-free lung segmentation algorithm with the aim of improving lung nodule detection accuracy, focusing on juxtapleural nodules. A bidirectional chain coding method combined with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to selectively smooth the lung border while minimizing the over-segmentation of adjacent regions. This automated method was tested on 233 computed tomography (CT) studies from the lung imaging database consortium (LIDC), representing 403 juxtapleural nodules. The approach obtained a 92.6% re-inclusion rate. Segmentation accuracy was further validated on 10 randomly selected CT series, finding a 0.3% average over-segmentation ratio and 2.4% under-segmentation rate when compared to manually segmented reference standards done by an expert.
