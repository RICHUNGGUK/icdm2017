In the optimal double auction mechanism, optimality is represented as multi-objectives to maximize the expected total revenue of sellers and buyers respectively at the same time. We give representation of allocation rules and payment rules of the optimal double auction mechanism that satisfies incentive compatibility, individual rationality, market clearing, and budget-balanced restrictions. Finally, we present a numerical example to demonstrate the function of the developed optimal double auction mechanism and its efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
