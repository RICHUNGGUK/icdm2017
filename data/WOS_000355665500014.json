These languages can be used to model meaning representations in the formal semantics of natural languages following the tradition of Montague. Using techniques pertaining to the denotational semantics of the simply typed lambda-calculus, we show that the emptiness and membership problems for both types of grammars are decidable. In the course of the proof of the decidability results for OI, we identify a decidable variant of the lambda-definability problem, and prove a stronger form of Statman's finite completeness Theorem.
