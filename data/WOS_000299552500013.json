For this purpose, the governing system is discretized in time using a semi-implicit scheme, and the resulting time-discrete system is formulated as an optimal control problem with pointwise constraints on the control. For the numerical solution of the optimal control problem, we propose a function space-based algorithm which combines a Moreau-Yosida regularization technique for handling the control constraints with a semi-smooth Newton method for solving the optimality systems of the resulting sub-problems. Further, for the discretization in space and in connection with the proposed algorithm, an adaptive finite-element method is considered. The performance of the overall algorithm is illustrated by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "An adaptive finite-element Moreau-Yosida-based solver for a non-smooth Cahn-Hilliard problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000299552500013"}
