Uncorrelated noise of up to 40% was added to scalp EEG signals. The performance of the ICA-based algorithm is compared with the conventional localization procedure using Simplex method. The present simulation results indicate the robustness of the ICA-based approach in localizing multiple dipoles of independent sources.", "paper_title": "ICA-based EEG spatio-temporal dipole source localization: A model study", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300083"}
