Background models should detect foreground objects robustly against background changes, such as \"illumination changes\" and \"dynamic changes\". In this paper, we propose two types of spatiotemporal background modeling frameworks that can adapt to illumination and dynamic changes in the background. Spatial information can be used to absorb the effects of illumination changes because they affect not only a target pixel but also its neighboring pixels. Additionally, temporal information is useful in handling the dynamic changes, which are observed repeatedly. To establish the spatiotemporal background model, our frameworks model an illumination invariant feature and a similarity of intensity changes among a set of pixels according to statistical models, respectively. Experimental results obtained for the BMC database show that our models can detect foreground objects robustly against background changes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
