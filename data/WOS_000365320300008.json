Different from the existing works, the H-infinity and passivity control problem with probabilistic occurrence of time-varying delays and actuator failures is considered in a unified framework, which is more general in some practical situations. The main aim of this paper is to design a reliable mixed H-infinity and passivity-based controller such that the stochastic TS fuzzy system with Markovian switching is stochastically stable with a prescribed mixed H-infinity and passivity performance level gamma > 0. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) involving lower and upper bound of probabilistic time delay and convex combination technique, a new set of delay-dependent sufficient condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is established for obtaining the required result. Finally, a numerical example based on the modified truck-trailer model is given to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design techniques.", "paper_title": "Reliable Mixed H-infinity and Passivity-Based Control for Fuzzy Markovian Switching Systems With Probabilistic Time Delays and Actuator Failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000365320300008"}
