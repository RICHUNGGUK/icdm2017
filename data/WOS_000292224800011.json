We compute all attribute reductions using the vague-rough lower approximation distribution, concepts of attribute reduction and the discernibility matrix in a vague decision information system (VDIS). Research results for extracting decision rules from the VDIS show the proposed approaches extend the corresponding method in classical rough set theory and provide a new avenue to uncertain vague knowledge acquisition.
