The integrated system employs a multimedia paddle and a tracking device on PC to generate a more sophisticated 6-degree-of-freedom data using either of magnet or optics. The lab-made paddle embeds a Bluetooth module, vibration motor, LED, and mini-speaker. Advantages of this webcam-based game are wireless, robust to electromagnetic interference, and low cost. The game software includes comprehensive physical modeling of most of the parameters of a real ping-pong game. Build up of the overall system is inexpensive and sufficiently accurate for game play. It presents a more functional and realistic feeling in playing computer game compared to existing commercial systems.
