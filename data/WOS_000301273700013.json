In the vicinity of material interfaces, the swept region is intersected with pure material polygons in the Lagrangian mesh to construct the material fluxes. Far from interfaces, the fluxes are constructed in a standard swept-region manner without intersections. This method is conservative, second-order accurate and linearity-preserving (in case of straight material interfaces), and faster than method based on intersections, as shown on selected numerical examples.
