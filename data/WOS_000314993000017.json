Using a toy model of a marginal chemical producer operating in a dynamic market, we examine two different control strategies for dealing with stochastic price fluctuations. The key contribution of this work is the derivation of switching rules under risk-neutral and risk-sensitive control formulations for problems where the dynamics arise from the market. These results provide a basis for exploring more complex control problems that include the effects of market forces. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
