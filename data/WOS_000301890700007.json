This method is based on averaging a full three-dimensional model made by a system of PDEs describing the hydrodynamic process coupled with transport, adsorption and attachment equations. Few crucial assumptions are needed to guarantee the physical coherence of the model, but a practical way to check the fulfilment of these constraints is provided, so that one can quickly verify the applicability of the model. This work has been tested in the framework of a collaboration project with a manufacturing company to provide an optimization of both product and process. To this purpose, a program was written in Python programming language, implementing both the calibration and the forward simulation part, in order to be used by the membranes manufactures for obtaining information on the filter efficiency.
