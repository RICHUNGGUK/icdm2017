The resource allocation scheme based on a bargaining model, which may be completed in a very short time, seems to be suitable for providing emergency services. A distributed call admission control algorithm exploiting the predictability of the satellite channel to guarantee quality of service (QoS) is also presented. According to the suggested scheme, each user unilaterally decides whether to accept a new call and, if all users unanimously agree, the new call is admitted. The performance of the proposed scheme is investigated using Markov chain modeling. Finally, analytical results concerning bounds for the call blocking probability and the system throughput are presented.", "paper_title": "Distributed Resource Allocation for Delay-Sensitive Services in Satellite Networks Using Game Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000208081900004"}
