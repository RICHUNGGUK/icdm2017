Then a 3N March-like algorithm is used for locating the aggressor words (bits) of coupling faults (CFs) in word-oriented (bit-oriented) memories. It also can distinguish the faults which cannot be identified by the March-15N algorithm. Thus, the proposed diagnosis scheme can achieve full diagnosis and locate aggressors with (15N + 3mN) Read/Write operations for a bit-oriented RAM with m CFs. For word-oriented RAMs, a March-like algorithm is also proposed to locate the aggressor bit in the aggressor word with 41092 B Read/Write operations, where B is the word width. Analysis results show that the proposed diagnosis scheme has higher diagnostic resolution and lower time complexity than the previous fault location and fault diagnosis approaches. A programmable built-in self-diagnosis (BISD) design is also implemented to perform the proposed diagnosis algorithms. Experimental results show that the area overhead of the BISD is small-only about 2.17% and 0.42% for 16 Kx8-bit and 16 Kx128-bit SRAMs, respectively.", "paper_title": "An efficient diagnosis scheme for RAMs with simple functional faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700008"}
