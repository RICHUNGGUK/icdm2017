Unsteady pulsatile flow coupled with induced valve motion has been examined in details. State-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are adopted in the present flow solver development. To account for nonstationary valve motion, the meshes surrounding the valve are generated and updated in each time-marching step using hybrid grid method. A single-degree-of-freedom rotational valve model is integrated simultaneously with the CFD adaptive time-stepping. It is found in the present study that, on both side of the occluder, strong shedding vortices occur and persist in the valve closing phase. These closure vortices show great influence on the prediction of the regurgitate flow characteristics and the subsequent valve opening dynamics as well. Based on the present software system, the results obtained from quasi-steady simulations performed at various instants of interest with prescribed valve motion are critically evaluated to assess whether simplified flow and valve conditions may lead to erroneous conclusions.", "paper_title": "Dynamic simulation of a tilting-disc valve with clearance in pulsatile channel flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000290686400008"}
