This analysis calculates the interstitial fluid velocity as the result of interstitial fluid pressure gradients and mechanical deformations of the vessel wall. The deformed geometry, interstitial fluid velocity field and porosity field are extracted and used as input for the drug release simulation: a reaction-advection-diffusion (RAD) transport analysis calculating the spatial and temporal drug distribution. The advantage of this approach is that the deformed geometry and interstitial fluid velocity field are not assumed a priori, but are actually calculated using a stent deployment simulation. The framework is demonstrated simulating a DES in an idealised, 3D vessel. Varying mechanical and transport properties based on literature data are assigned to each of the three layers in the wall. The results of the drug release simulation for a period of one week show that the drug distributes longitudinally but will remain in the proximity of the stented area.", "paper_title": "Drug transport in artery walls: A sequential porohyperelastic-transport approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000268911800002"}
