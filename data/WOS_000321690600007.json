In most of these research works, the normality and independency of the process data or measurements are assumed and that the process is subjected to only one assignable cause. While, in practice, these assumptions usually do not hold, some recent studies are focused on working with only one or two of these violations. In this paper, the situation in which the process data are correlated and follow a non-normal distribution and that there is multiplicity of assignable causes in the process is considered. For this case, a cost model for the economic design of the VSI X control chart is developed, where the Burr distribution is employed to represent the non-normal distribution of the process data. To obtain the optimal values of the design parameters, a genetic algorithm is employed in which the response surface methodology is applied. A numerical example is presented to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Sensitivity analysis is also carried out to evaluate the effects of cost and input parameters on the performance of the chart.", "paper_title": "Economic design of VSI X control chart with correlated non-normal data under multiple assignable causes", "paper_id": "WOS:000321690600007"}
