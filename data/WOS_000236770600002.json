In this paper, we demonstrate that the methodology can be successfully applied to the domain of networking. Specifically, we obtain increased throughput with a significant decrease in delay in a ns-2 simulation model of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) by using RSM to optimize protocol interaction found by factor screening. Whether the experimentation is with a stochastic simulation model or a physical system, such as a MANET or a wireless sensor network test-bed, RSM provides a general and practical methodology to screen factors and robustly and jointly optimize responses.", "paper_title": "Optimizing protocol interaction using response surface methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000236770600002"}
