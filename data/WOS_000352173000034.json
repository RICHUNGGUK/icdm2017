We present a solution based on communication channels connecting sequences of adjacent nodes. All the nodes in a channel share the same key. This result is obtained by propagating the key connecting the first two nodes to all the other nodes in the channel. The key propagation mechanism is also used for key replacement, as is required, for instance, in group communication to support forms of forward and backward secrecy, when a node leaves a group or a new node is added to an existing group.
