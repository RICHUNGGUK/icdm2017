In this paper we present an automatic method to extract genomic glossary triggered by the initial gene name in query. LocusLink gene names and MEDLINE abstracts are employed in our system, playing the roles of query triggers and genomic corpus respectively. The evaluation of the extracted glossary is through query expansion in TREC2003 Genomics Track ad hoc retrieval task, and the experiment results yield evidence that 90.15% recall can be achieved.", "paper_title": "Automatic extraction of genomic glossary triggered by query", "paper_id": "WOS:000237241100004"}
