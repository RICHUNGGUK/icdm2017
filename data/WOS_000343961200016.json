In this research, the non-destructive ultrasonic time-domain reflectometry (UTDR) signals from the block-scanning mode are used to investigate membrane fouling in various conditions. Through Hilbert transform on UTDR signals, direct visualization of the membrane fouling distribution is developed. Although ultrasonic data acquirements are automatically achieved, the analysis of ultrasonic images is achieved manually by an operator. To build up the automatic fouling monitoring system, in this research, the texture analysis and the wavelet transform applied to UTDR images are used to extract the spatial statistic features of the fouling distribution. Then the principal component analysis of multivariate statistics is applied to statistic features. The research results show that it is more convenient to detect faults using the proposed method than the commonly used visualized approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
