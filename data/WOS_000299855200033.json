In these systems, policies are usually used to simplify the tasks of the system management, thus making way for further system enlargement. Accordingly, a variety of policy languages are proposed to express intentions of administrators in the policy-driven systems, especially for the network and security management. This paper, therefore, investigates current works, discusses the key issues, and then outlines the future work of policy languages. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
