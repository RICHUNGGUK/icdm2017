However, they require large training time and large number of neurons to deal with complex problems. Taking benefit of the characteristics of a Generalized Neuron that requires much smaller training data and shorter training time, the pseudo-linear neural network (PNN) based model predictive approach used in the single and multi-machine power system studies is proposed in this paper. A simulation is carried out. It is demonstrated that the proposed control strategy is applicable to some of nonlinear systems.", "paper_title": "Adaptive control for synchronous generator based on pseudolinear neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000195"}
