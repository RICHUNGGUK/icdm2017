Our approach is based on non-Archimedean ergodic theory: Both the criteria and algorithm use van der Put series to represent 1-Lipschitz p-adic functions and to study measure-preservation/ergodicity of these.", "paper_title": "T-functions revisited: new criteria for bijectivity/transitivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000334179100002"}
