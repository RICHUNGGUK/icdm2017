Previously only small scale corpora have been available, thus restricting their practical use. This paper describes a system that overcomes this limitation by automatically collecting high quality parallel bilingual corpora from the web. Previous systems used a single principle feature for parallel web page verification, whereas we use multiple features to identify parallel texts via a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. Our system was evaluated using a data set containing 6500 Chinese-English candidate parallel pairs that have been manually annotated. Experiments show that the use of a k-nearest-neighbors classifier with multiple features achieves substantial improvements over the systems that use any one of these features. The system achieved a precision rate of 95% and a recall rate of 97%, and thus is a significant improvement over earlier work.", "paper_title": "Automatic acquisition of Chinese-English parallel corpus from the web", "paper_id": "WOS:000238083200037"}
