To accomplish this, a sensor that controls the amount of numerical dissipation is applied to a sixth-order compact scheme as well as a fourth-order two-register Runge-Kutta method for numerical simulation of various cases including inviscid and viscous shock-vortex and shock-mixing-layer interactions. Detailed study is performed to investigate the performance of the sensor, that is, the effect of control parameters employed in the sensor are investigated in the long-time integration. In addition, the effects of nonlinear weighting factors controlling the value of the second-order and high-order filters in fine and coarse non-uniform grids are investigated. The results indicate the accuracy of the nonlinear filter along with the promising performance of the shock-detecting sensor, which would pave the way for future simulations of turbulent flows containing shocks.
