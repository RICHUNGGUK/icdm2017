SOA based systems are built of services - atomic or complex ones. Each service may have a different functional and non-functional description. The methods how to retrieve atomic service and compose complex services according to the user's needs are discussed here.", "paper_title": "Service Composition in Knowledge-based SOA Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000306286000005"}
