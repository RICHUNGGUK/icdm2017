A residual based empirical process test statistic marked by proper functions of the regressors is proposed. We derive asymptotic distribution of the proposed empirical process test statistic: a centered Gaussian process under the null hypothesis and a non-centered one under local alternatives converging to the null hypothesis at parametric rates. We also suggest a bootstrap procedure to calculate critical values. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed test statistic and real examples are analyzed for illustrations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
