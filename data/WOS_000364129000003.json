The aim of this framework is to speed up the construction of ontologies and ontology networks by reusing available knowledge resources (ontologies, non-ontological resources and ontology design patterns). The methodology is founded on four pillars: (1) a glossary of processes and activities; (2) a set of nine scenarios for building ontologies and ontology networks; (3) two ontology life-cycle models; and (4) a set of prescriptive methodological guidelines for performing specific processes and activities. The paper also shows how to apply this methodology framework to develop an ontology network within the multimedia domain. Finally, it presents an empirical evaluation of the NeOn Methodology framework.", "paper_title": "The NeOn Methodology framework: A scenario-based methodology for ontology development", "paper_id": "WOS:000364129000003"}
