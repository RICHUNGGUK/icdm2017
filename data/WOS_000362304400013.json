In this paper, the effects of multiple mobile PUs on the spectrum sensing functionality are analyzed to jointly maximize the sensing efficiency and the sensing accuracy. To this aim, as first, a new mathematical model (the aggregate PU model) is proposed to effectively describe the cumulative effects of multiple mobile PUs on the spectrum sensing functionality. Then, stemming from this model, closed-form expressions for the sensing time and the transmission time that jointly maximize the sensing efficiency and the sensing accuracy are derived. Through the derived closed-form expressions, the following fundamental questions are answered: (i) How long can a CR user transmit without interfering with the multiple mobile PUs? (ii) How long must a CR user observe a targeted spectrum band to reliably detect multiple mobile PUs? All the theoretical results are derived by adopting a general mobility model for the multiple mobile PUs. The analytical results are finally validated through simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
