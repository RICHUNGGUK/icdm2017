In particular, we prove that if A* is the largest subset of diameter r of n points in the Euclidean space, then for every epsilon > 0 there exists a polynomial time algorithm that outputs a set B of size at least vertical bar A*vertical bar and of diameter at most r(root 2 + epsilon). On the hardness side, roughly speaking, we show that unless P = NP for every epsilon > 0 it is not possible to guarantee the diameter r(root 4/3 - epsilon) for B even if the algorithm is allowed to output a set of size (95/94 -epsilon)(-1) vertical bar A*vertical bar.
