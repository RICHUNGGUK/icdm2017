Jain [A fixed point theorem in Menger space through weak compatibility, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 301 (2005), 439-448] proved a fixed point theorem for six self-mappings using the concept of weak compatibility and compatibility of pair of self-mappings. The purpose of the present. paper is to establish this fixed point theorem by using generalized (psi, phi) weak contractive condition which is defined for two mappings. This concept introduced D. Doric [Common fixed point for generalized (psi, phi) weak contractions, Applied Mathematics Letters 22 (2009), 1896-1900]. Our result generalizes an existing result in metrical fixed point theory.", "paper_title": "Fixed points of weakly contractions through occasionally weak compatibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000288576000011"}
