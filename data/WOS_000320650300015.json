Basically, the parameters are selected set by set using a given criterion for ranking the parameters. Since parameters identifiability procedures are strongly dependent on the initial estimates of parameters values, simultaneous parameters re-estimation step has been proposed in this paper. Two examples were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed criterion. In both cases, a significant reduction of the computational time was observed, and the results regard to the model fit are similar to those criteria based on the selection of parameters one by one, as usually presented in the literature.
