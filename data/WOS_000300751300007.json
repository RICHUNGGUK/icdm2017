This comes from the fact that production managers desire to utilize from an ideal production plan by considering a number of objectives over a set of technological constraints. This paper presents a new multi-objective production planning model which is proved to be NP-Complete. So a random search heuristic is proposed to explore the feasible solution space with the hope of finding the best solution in a reasonable time while extracting a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Then each Pareto-optimal solution is considered as an alternative production plan in the hand of production manager. Both the modeling and the solution processes are carried out for a real world problem and the results are reported briefly. Also, performance of the proposed problem-specific heuristic is verified by comparing it with a multi-objective genetic algorithm on a set randomly generated test data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
