However, for the specific case of video coding, standards do not specify it, thus different decoders may - and typically do - use different concealment techniques. This work investigates the impact of assuming, in the transmission optimization phase, a concealment algorithm different from the one that is actually used by the decoder, in order to determine which are the best assumptions to use at the transmitter. Firstly, we investigate the typical performance provided by ten concealment techniques belonging to three widely used algorithmic families (spatial, temporal and mixed). Then, we assess the impact that an incorrect concealment assumption causes, in terms of both packet transmission policy changes and video quality degradation, using a simple rate-distortion transmission optimization technique that targets a generic two QoS-level network. Simulation results over several standard video sequences show that the performance impact of incorrectly assuming the decoder-side concealment technique may be significant but it is limited if the two techniques belong to the same algorithmic family. Moreover, the impact on performance caused by incorrect assumptions is strongly mitigated if the decoder employs a high-performance concealment algorithm. Finally, the impact on the performance of several parameters such as the encoding pattern, the packet loss statistics (uniform and burst losses) and the amount of high-priority traffic is evaluated, showing that the conclusions can be confidently applied to actual multimedia communication scenarios.", "paper_title": "On the effects of sender-receiver concealment mismatch on multimedia communication optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000352742800002"}
