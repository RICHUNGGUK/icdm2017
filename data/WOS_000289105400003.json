We first describe how to design artificial potential fields to obtain a formation with the shape of a regular polygon. We provide a formal proof of the asymptotic stability of the system, based on the definition of a proper Lyapunov function. We also prove that our control strategy is not affected by the problem of local minima. Then, we exploit a bijective coordinate transformation to deform the polygonal formation, thus obtaining a completely arbitrarily shaped formation. Simulations and experimental tests are provided to validate the control strategy.", "paper_title": "Arbitrarily shaped formations of mobile robots: artificial potential fields and coordinate transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000289105400003"}
