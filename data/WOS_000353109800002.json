Offloading data traffic becomes one of the most urgent technical problems. Recent work has proposed to exploit opportunistic communications to offload cellular traffic for mobile data dissemination services, especially for accepting large delayed data. The basic idea is to deliver the data to only part of subscribers (called target-nodes) via the cellular network, and allow target-nodes to disseminate the data through opportunistic communications. Human mobility shows temporal and spatial characteristics and predictability, which can be used as effective guidance efficient opportunistic communication. Therefore, based on the regularity of human mobility we propose NodeRank algorithm which uses the encounter characteristics between nodes to choose target nodes. Different from the existing work which only using encounter frequency, NodeRank algorithm combined the contact time and inter-contact time meanwhile to ensure integrity and availability of message delivery. The simulation results based on real-world mobility traces show the performance advantages of NodeRank in offloading efficiency and network redundant copies.", "paper_title": "Cellular Traffic Offloading through Opportunistic Communications Based on Human Mobility", "paper_id": "WOS:000353109800002"}
