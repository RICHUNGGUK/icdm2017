NBTI effects in fact manifest themselves as an increase of the propagation delay of the devices over time, which adds up to the delay penalty incurred by most low-power design solutions. This implies that, given a desired lifetime of a circuit (i.e., a given performance target at some point in time), a power-managed component will fail earlier than a nonpower-managed one. In this work, we show how it is possible to partially overcome this conflict, by leveraging the benefits in terms of aging provided by power-gating (i.e., by using switches that disconnect a logic block from the ground). Thanks to some electrical properties, it is possible to nullify aging effects during standby periods. Based on this important property, we propose a methodology for a NBTI-aware power gating that allows synthesizing low-leakage circuits with maximum lifetime.", "paper_title": "NBTI-Aware Clustered Power Gating", "paper_id": "WOS:000284931600003"}
