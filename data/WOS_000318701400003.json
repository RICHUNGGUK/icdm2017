We focus on the application of DC-OFDM to vehicular networks based on IEEE 802.11p technology and analyze the performance improvement using this new technology. It is shown that DC-OFDM significantly improves the performance of vehicular ad hoc networks in terms of throughput and the expected number of correctly received symbols.", "paper_title": "Improving the Performance of OFDM-Based Vehicular Systems through Diversity Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000318701400003"}
