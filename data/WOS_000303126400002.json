By studying drug action across multiple scales of complexity, from molecular to cellular and tissue level, network-based computational methods have the potential to improve our understanding of the impact of chemicals in human health. In this review we present the available large-scale databases and tools that allow integration and analysis of such information for understanding the properties of small molecules in the context of cellular networks. With the recent advances in the omics area, global integrative approaches are necessary to cope with the massive amounts of data, and biomedical researchers are urged to implement new types of analyses that can lead to new therapeutic interventions with increased safety and efficacy compared with existing medications.", "paper_title": "The impact of network biology in pharmacology and toxicology", "paper_id": "WOS:000303126400002"}
