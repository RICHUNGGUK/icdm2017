The hardware/software architecture of the wireless sensor nodes is developed for a low-cost design implementation. Energy efficiency is another objective of this paper, achieved by the combination of a low-power-mode algorithm and a power-aware routing strategy. A selected set of simulation studies indicate a reduction in energy consumption and a significant increase in node lifetime whereas network performance is not affected significantly. Finally, a lightweight management architecture is presented to facilitate autonomous management of ad-hoc sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Architecture design and implementation of an ad-hoc network for disaster relief operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000244803600008"}
