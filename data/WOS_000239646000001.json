When links fail, affected paths are replaced by new paths, and by observing the entire path information, one might hope to infer the failed links that caused these changes. However, inferring the exact topological changes behind observed routing changes may not be possible due to limited information, and the same changes may be explained by more than one set of candidate failures. In this paper, using a simple path vector routing model, we present the problem of finding the candidate set with minimum number of failures to explain observed route changes. We call this problem the minimum e-set problem and present algorithms for solving it optimally for certain cases. We also show that the minimum e-set problem is NP-complete in the general case.", "paper_title": "Minimum failure explanations for path vector routing changes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239646000001"}
