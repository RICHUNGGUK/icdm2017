A return-to-zero (RZ) pulse, centered in the sampling period by a quadrature clock, is used in the innermost DAC to reduce the sensitivity to loop-delay variations in the modulator, and omit implementing the additional loop delay compensation usually needed in CT modulators. The performance and stability of the NRZ/NRZ/RZ feedback scheme is thoroughly analysed using a discrete-time model. The modulator has been implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process, where it occupies an area of 0.2 x 0.4 mm(2). It achieves an SNR of 71 dB and an SNDR of 69 dB over a 9 MHz bandwidth with an oversampling ratio of 16, and a power consumption of 7.5 mW from a 1.2 V supply.", "paper_title": "Theory and design of a CT modulator with low sensitivity to loop-delay variations", "paper_id": "WOS:000323652500009"}
