The effective DOF of the sensor may be enhanced considerably without compromising the quality of the image by fusing images captured with different focused regions. This paper presents an image fusion technique suitable for combining multifocus images of a scene. The method employs morphological filters to select sharply focused regions from various images and then combines them together to reconstruct the image in which all the regions are properly focused. A performance measure based on image gradients is used to compare the results obtained by the proposed method with those obtained by other image fusion techniques. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
