We derive a lower bound on the optimal tradeoff between the transmit power and the achievable reconstruction distortion pair. Our derivation is based on a new bounding technique which involves the introduction of appropriate remote sources. Furthermore, it is shown that this lower bound is achievable by a class of hybrid schemes for the special case, where the weak receiver wishes to reconstruct a scalar source under the mean squared error distortion constraint.", "paper_title": "Broadcasting Correlated Vector Gaussians", "paper_id": "WOS:000353515700019"}
