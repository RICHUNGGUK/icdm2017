This approach is mainly adapted to a job-shop problem (JSP) with high flexibility and is based on the decomposition of the problem in an assignment subproblem and a sequencing subproblem. For the first subproblem, we propose two methods: the first one is based successively on a heuristic approach and a local search; the second one, however, is based on a branch-and-bound algorithm. The quality of the assignment is evaluated by a lower bound. For the second subproblem we apply a hybrid genetic algorithm to deal with the sequencing problem. Computational tests are finally presented.", "paper_title": "Assignment and scheduling in flexible job-shops by hierarchical optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000247644800021"}
