User interfaces of the developed expert system, named MAEAC (MCDM-based expert system for adaptation analysis under changing climate), was developed based on system configuration, knowledge acquisition, survey analysis, and MCDM-based policy analysis. A number of processes that were vulnerable to climate change were examined and pre-screened through extensive literature review, expert consultation and statistical analysis. Adaptation policies to impacts of temperature increase, precipitation-pattern variation and sea-level rise were comprehensively explicated and incorporated within the developed system. The MAEAC could be used for both acquiring knowledge of climate-change impacts on water resources in the Georgia Basin and supporting formulation of the relevant adaptation policies. It can also be applied to other watersheds to facilitate assessment of climate-change impacts on socio-economic and environmental sectors, as well as formulation of relevant adaptation policies.
