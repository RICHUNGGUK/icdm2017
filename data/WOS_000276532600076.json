There are many types of urological dysfunctions causing urinary incontinence, which makes cheap and accurate diagnosing an important issue. This paper proposes a support vector machine (SVM) based method for diagnosing urological dysfunctions. 381 registers collected from patients suffering from a variety of urological dysfunctions have been used to ensure the (generalization) performance of the decision support system. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed system is examined by fivefold cross-validation and the results show that the SVM-based method can achieve an average classification accuracy at 84.25%.
