Adopting the top-plated sampling technology and dummy-capacitor-aided switching technology, the number of capacitors can be reduced by 75 % compared with the conventional scheme. Employing the one-side switching instead technology and higher-bit switching instead technology, the average switching energy can be reduced to 1.2 % compared with the conventional scheme. Employed the proposed switching scheme, a 10-bit 20-kS/s 0.6-V SAR ADC is designed in 0.18-mu m CMOS technology. Post-layout simulation results indicate that a SNDR of 60.3 dB can be achieved with the Nyquist input at 20 kS/s. And the figure-of-merit of the proposed ADC is 1.04 fJ/conversion-step.", "paper_title": "SAR ADC architecture with 98.8 % reduction in switching energy over conventional scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000355333800009"}
