In traditional split-and-merge method (SM), there exists the problem of dependence on the given initial solution. For solving this problem, a novel split-and-merge method (RSM), which applies the ranking selection scheme of genetic algorithm to the split and merge process, is proposed. Experiments of using two benchmark curves to test RSM are conducted and show its good performance.", "paper_title": "A split/merge method with ranking selection for polygonal approximation of digital curve", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300071"}
