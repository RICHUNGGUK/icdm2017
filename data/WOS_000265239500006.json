A multi-agent system architecture with two fuzzy rule based systems has been used: a fuzzy model, to estimate the energy requirements and a fuzzy controller, to distribute the energy to all of the installed heaters. The aim is to reduce the energy spent for heating the house while maintaining the predefined comfort level. The proposal has proved valid in realistic simulations, although some revisions must be be carried out prior to integrating it into a microcontroller hardware. The real prototype must also be validated in real situations. This system is to be included in the local company's product catalogue.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy logic based efficient energy saving approach for domestic heating systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000265239500006"}
