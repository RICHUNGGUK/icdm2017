One of the best, approaches for voltage sag estimation is instantaneous voltage estimation. The approach uses traditional state estimation where redundant measurements are available. The proposed method is used to estimate voltage sag performance during a fault. At the fault, duration, the grid topology is changed. In such a case the measurement matrix must be re-determined at, the fault duration. The proposed approach is an efficient method for fault detection and identification which is based on residual analysis and topology error detection. The performance of the novel approach is tested on an IEEE 14 bus system, and the results are shown.", "paper_title": "Fault detection and identification for voltage sag state estimation in power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000281623300012"}
