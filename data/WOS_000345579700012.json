However, the local execution of resource-demanding mobile tasks, such as real-time rendering in 3D gaming, may result in poor performance and short battery lifetime on MDs. One solution to the resource scarcity problem on MDs is to offload resource-demanding mobile tasks to surrogates, which are remote servers with stronger capabilities. When multiple MDs in the same cell attempt to offload mobile tasks to surrogates through a cellular network, the communication latencies for data transmissions may be high due to limited radio resources. To improve the offloading performance of mobile tasks, the limited radio resources should be carefully scheduled to reduce the communication latencies of data transmissions. As motivated, we pose the optimal radio resource allocation problem for the mobile task offloading in cellular networks, and solve the problem. Moreover, extensive numerical results show the performance comparison of the optimal radio resource allocation plan and two baseline plans.", "paper_title": "Optimal Radio Resource Allocation for Mobile Task Offloading in Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345579700012"}
