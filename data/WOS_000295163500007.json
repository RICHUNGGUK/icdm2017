The proposed architecture achieves global overlay and has the capability of solving the triangular routing problem for the domain-based P2P-SIP architecture to reach route optimization. Demonstrated by our numerical results, the proposed architecture can exhibit its superiorities over the closest-related architectures in the literature in terms of message rate, latency, and physical hops count.", "paper_title": "A Globally Overlaid Hierarchical P2P-SIP Architecture with Route Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000295163500007"}
