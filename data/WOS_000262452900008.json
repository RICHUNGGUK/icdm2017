We consider processes that not only keep track of their history in a log, but also make decisions based on this log. To model such processes we extend the basic Petri net framework with the notion of history and add guards to transitions evaluated on the process history. We show that some classes of history-dependent nets can be automatically converted to classical Petri nets for analysis purposes. Some of these classes are characterized by the form of the guards (e. g., LTL + Past guards), while others by restrictions on the underlying classical Petri net.", "paper_title": "Working with the Past: Integrating History in Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000262452900008"}
