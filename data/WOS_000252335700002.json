A product data model is also proposed for the propagation procedure, which integrates base product definitions for product design, and product data views for other manufacturing or customer support. The product data view in the proposed model enables manufacturing or customer support engineers to define their own product data views, without copying the existing product definition. Integrated with other components, the engineering changes in the data model provide structure-oriented change history, effectivity management for production, and integration with product configurations. Based on the integrated product data model, the proposed procedure propagates engineering changes to product data views using the history of product structure changes. The propagation procedure maintains consistency of product data during collaboration between various design, manufacturing and customer support departments, who have different product data views. Prototype database applications together with an example of illustrative change propagation are also presented.", "paper_title": "Propagation of engineering changes to multiple product data views using history of product structure changes", "paper_id": "WOS:000252335700002"}
