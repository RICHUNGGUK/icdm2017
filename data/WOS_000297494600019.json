Wavefront coding provides an extension of the depth-of-field at the expense of a slight reduction of image quality. This trade-off results from the amount of coding used. By using spatial light modulators, a flexible coding is achieved which permits it to be increased or decreased as needed. In this paper a computational method is proposed for evaluating the output of a wavefront coding imaging system equipped with a spatial light modulator, with the aim of thus making it possible to implement the most suitable coding strength for a given scene. This is achieved in an unsupervised manner, thus the whole system acts as a dynamically selfadaptable imaging system. The program presented here controls the spatial light modulator and the camera, and also processes the images in a synchronised way in order to implement the dynamic system in real time. A prototype of the system was implemented in the laboratory and illustrative examples of the performance are reported in this paper.

The program controls the acquisition by a camera, the display of a spatial light modulator and the image processing operations synchronously. The spatial light modulator is used to implement the phase mask with flexibility given the trade-off between depth-of-field extension and image quality achieved. The action of the program is to evaluate the depth-of-field requirements of the specific scene and subsequently control the coding established by the spatial light modulator, in real time.
