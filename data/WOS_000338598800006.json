A solution is a matching M with a vector p is an element of R->= 0(V) that satisfies p(u) + p(v) = w(uv) for all uv is an element of M and p(u) = 0 for all u unmatched in M. A solution is stable if it prevents blocking pairs, i.e., pairs of adjacent vertices u and v with p(u) + p(v) < w(uv), or equivalently, if the total blocking value Sigma(uv is an element of E), max{0, w(uv) - (P-u + P-v)} = 0. By pinpointing a relationship to the accessibility of the coalition structure core of matching games, we give a constructive proof for showing that every yes-instance of the stable roommates problem with payments allows a path of linear length that starts in an arbitrary unstable solution and that ends in a stable solution. This generalizes a result of Chen, Fujishige and Yang (2011) [4] for bipartite instances to general instances. We also show that the problems BLOCKING PAIRS and BLOCKING VALUE, which are to find a solution with a minimum number of blocking pairs or a minimum total blocking value, respectively, are NP-hard. Finally, we prove that the variant of the first problem, in which the number of blocking pairs must be minimized with respect to some fixed matching, is NP-hard, whereas this variant of the second problem is polynomial-time solvable.
