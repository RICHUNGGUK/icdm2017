However, all of them consider the consensus reaching process a rigid or inflexible one because its behavior remains fixed in all rounds of the consensus process. The aim of this paper is to improve the consensus reaching process in GDM problems defined in multigranular linguistic contexts, i.e., by using linguistic term sets with different cardinality to represent experts' preferences. To do that, we propose an adaptive consensus support system model for this type of decision-making problem, i.e., a process that adapts its behavior to the agreement achieved in each round. This adaptive model increases the convergence toward the consensus and, therefore, reduces the number of rounds to reach it.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Consensus Support Model for Group Decision-Making Problems in a Multigranular Fuzzy Linguistic Context", "paper_id": "WOS:000265089700003"}
