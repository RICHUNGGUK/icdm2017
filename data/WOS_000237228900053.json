Secondary analysis is the bipartite network as the method for formatting the structure or the structure knowledge. In this step the different clusters' components could link each other, but the linkage could not connect the components on same cluster. Furthermore, some weak ties' components or weak links are emerged by Bipartite Graph based Interactive Genetic Algorithm (BiGIGA) to assemble the creative products for customers. Finally, we investigated two significantly different cases. Case one, the customer did not change his preference, and the Wilcoxon test was used to evaluate the difference between IGA and BiGIGA. The results indicated that our model could correctly and directly capture the customer wanted. Case two, after the Wilcoxon test, it evidenced the lateral transmitting using triad closure extent the conceptual network, which could increase the weight of weak relation and retrieved a good product for the customer. The lateral transmitting did not present its convergent power on evolutionary design, but the lateral transmitting has illustrated that it could quickly discover the customer's favorite value and recombined the creative product.", "paper_title": "Creating chance by new interactive evolutionary computation: Bipartite graph based interactive genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900053"}
