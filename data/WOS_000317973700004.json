We prove that the maximum number of k-edge-colourings of a connected k-regular graph on n vertices is ka <...((k-1)!) (n/2). Our proof is constructive and leads to a branching algorithm enumerating all the k-edge-colourings of a connected k-regular graph in time O (au)(((k-1)!) (n/2)) and polynomial space. In particular, we obtain a algorithm to enumerate all the 3-edge-colourings of a connected cubic graph in time O (au)(2 (n/2))=O (au)(1.4143 (n) ) and polynomial space. This improves the running time of O (au)(1.5423 (n) ) of the algorithm due to Golovach et al. (Proceedings of WG 2010, pp. 39-50, 2010). We also show that the number of 4-total-colourings of a connected cubic graph is at most 3a <...2(3n/2). Again, our proof yields a branching algorithm to enumerate all the 4-total-colourings of a connected cubic graph.", "paper_title": "Enumerating the edge-colourings and total colourings of a regular graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000317973700004"}
