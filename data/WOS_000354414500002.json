Because of the conservativeness in additive increase congestion avoidance, current transmission control protocols are inefficient in utilizing the super high bandwidth of data centers. This may cause many deadline-sensitive flows to miss their deadlines before achieving their available bandwidths. We propose an Adaptive-Acceleration Data Center TCP, A(2)DTCP, which takes into account both network congestion and latency requirement of application service. By using congestion avoidance with an adaptive increase rate that varies between additive and multiplicative, A(2)DTCP accelerates bandwidth detection thus achieving high bandwidth utilization efficiency. At-scale simulations and real testbed implementations show that A(2)DTCP significantly reduces the missed deadline ratio compared to (DTCP)-T-2 and DCTCP. In addition, A(2)DTCP can co-exist with conventional TCP as well without requiring more changes in switch hardware than (DTCP)-T-2 and DCTCP.", "paper_title": "Adaptive-Acceleration Data Center TCP", "paper_id": "WOS:000354414500002"}
