By utilizing suitable variable substitution, the second-order system can be transformed into first-order differential equations. It is shown that the states of the inertial BAM neural networks with time-varying delay via periodically intermittent control can be globally exponential stabilized with a desired oribis under the designed intermittent controller. Finally, a typical example is chosen to illustrate the validation of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Exponential stability of inertial BAM neural networks with time-varying delay via periodically intermittent control", "paper_id": "WOS:000360005900021"}
