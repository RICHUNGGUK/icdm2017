In this work, we tried to calculate signal FD directly from its Fourier amplitudes. First, dependence of Higuchi's FD of mathematical sinusoids on their individual frequencies was modeled with a two-parameter exponential function. Next, FD of a finite sum of sinusoids was found to be a weighted average of their FDs, weighting factors being their Fourier amplitudes raised to a fractal degree. Exponent dependence on frequency was modeled with exponential, power and logarithmic functions. A set of 280 EEG signals and Weierstrass functions were analyzed. Cross-validation was done within EEG signals and between them and Weierstrass functions. Exponential dependence of fractal exponents on frequency was found to be the most accurate. In this work, signal FD was for the first time expressed as a fractal weighted average of FD values of its Fourier components, also allowing researchers to perform direct estimation of signal fractal dimension from its FFT spectrum.", "paper_title": "Modeling the relationship between Higuchi's fractal dimension and Fourier spectra of physiological signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000305683500005"}
