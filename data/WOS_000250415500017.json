In this paper, we propose w timing-reasoning-based algorithm and an adaptive test-generation algorithm for diagnosing timing errors in the silicon-debug phase. We first derive three metrics that are strongly correlated to the probability of a candidate's being an actual error source. We analyze the problem of circuit timing uncertainties caused by delay variations and test sampling. Then, we propose a candidate-ranking heuristic, which is robust with respect to such sources of timing uncertainty. Based on the initial ranking result and the timing information, we further propose an adaptive path-selection and test-generation algorithm to generate additional diagnostic patterns for further improvement of the first-hit-rate. The experimental results demonstrate that combining the ranking heuristic and the adaptive test-generation method would result in a very high resolution for timing diagnosis.", "paper_title": "Silicon debug for timing errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000250415500017"}
