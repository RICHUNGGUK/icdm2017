Solutions based on smart cards offer physical and logical portability, robustness, low cost, and high security. Nevertheless, such solutions concentrate only on offering the cryptographical capabilities of the smart card, together with key and user certificate storage. Advanced trust management and access control axe not addressed. In this article, we propose a scheme to include trust management and attribute certificates for authorization in two widely used cryptographic APIs: Microsoft CryptoAPI and RSA labs PKCS#11.", "paper_title": "A smart card solution for access control and trust management for nomadic users", "paper_id": "WOS:000237245000005"}
