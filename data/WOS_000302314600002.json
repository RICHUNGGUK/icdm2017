In this paper, by exploring the sparsity of the basis matrix and the coefficient matrix under certain domains, we propose an alternative iteration approach with l (1)-norm minimization for face recognition. Moreover, a modified version of linearized Bregman iteration is developed to efficiently solve the proposed minimization problem. Experimental results show that new algorithm is promising in terms of detection accuracy, computational efficiency.", "paper_title": "Bregman iteration algorithm for sparse nonnegative matrix factorizations via alternating l (1)-norm minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000302314600002"}
