Due to these effects, the position control of SMA actuators has been a great challenge in recent years. Literature review of the research conducted in this area shows that using the inverse of the phenomenological hysteresis models can compensate the hysteresis of these actuators effectively. But, inverting some of these models, such as Preisach model, is numerically a complex task. However, the generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is analytically invertible, and therefore can be implemented conveniently as a feedforward controller for compensating hysteresis nonlinearities effects in SMA actuators. In this paper a feedforward-feedback controller is used to control the tip deflection of a large deflected flexible beam actuated by an SMA actuator wire. The feedforward part of the control system is based on the generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii inverse model while a conventional proportional-integral feedback controller is added to the feedforward controller to increase the accuracy together with eliminating the steady state error in position control process. Experimental results show that the proposed controller performs well in terms of achieving small overshoot and undershoot for square wave tracking as well as small tracking errors for sinusoidal trajectory. It has also great capability for tracking hysteresis minor loops. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
