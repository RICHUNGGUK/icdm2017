The simulations were conducted for reactors considering two-phase flow. Simulation of two reactors of different sizes and tube diameters is presented here for investigating the effect of tube diameter in gas hold-up and velocities. The data which is obtained from the simulation is compared with the experimental data to determine the gas hold-up. The comparison between gas hold-up and superficial gas velocity was made and the velocities were set between 0.018 and 0.108. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
