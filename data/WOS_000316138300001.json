The problem is formulated as a repeated game with the aim of maximizing the total transmission rate of SUs. Firstly, a clustering formation procedure is proposed to reduce the overhead and delay of game process in cognitive radio network (CRN). Then the repeated game-inspired model for SUs is introduced. With the model, the convergence condition of the proposed spectrum-sharing algorithm is conducted, and the convergence performance is investigated by considering the effects of three key factors: transmission power, discount factor, and convergence coefficient. Furthermore, the fairness of spectrum sharing is analyzed, and numerical results show a significant performance improvement of the proposed strategy when compared to other similar spectrum-sharing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Repeated Game-Inspired Spectrum Sharing for Clustering Cognitive Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316138300001"}
