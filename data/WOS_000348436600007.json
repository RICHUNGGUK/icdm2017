When operating on a list of n data, permuted uniformly at random, the appropriately normalized complexity Y-n is known to converge almost surely to a non-degenerate random limit Y. This assumes a natural embedding of all Y-n on one probability space, e.g., via random binary search trees. In this note a central limit theorem for the error term in the latter almost sure convergence is shown: where N denotes a standard normal random variable. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
