The proposed technique employs a test tone applied at the input of the quantizer to evaluate the noise transfer function of the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) using the capabilities of the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) platform usually available in mixed-mode systems. Once the ADC output bit stream is captured, necessary information to generate the control signals to tune the ADC parameters for best Signal-to-Quantization Noise Ratio (SQNR) performance is extracted via an LMS software-based algorithm. Simulation results show that notch frequency of the NTF due to process variations and temperature tolerances can be tuned using the proposed methodology. The proposed global calibration approach can be used during the system start-up and the idle system time. The proposed approach uses a single in-band calibration tone, but it can be expanded using out-of band test tones for background calibration schemes.", "paper_title": "Digital based calibration technique for continuous-time bandpass sigma-delta analog-to-digital converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000263113700010"}
