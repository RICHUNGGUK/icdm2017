The network has two types of state variables, one corresponds to the fast neural activity and another to the slow unsupervised modification of connection weights. Based on the nonsmooth analysis techniques, we prove the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium for the system and establish some new theoretical conditions ensuring global exponential stability of the unique equilibrium of the neural network. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the derived conditions in characterizing stability regions of the neural network.", "paper_title": "Global exponential stability of multitime scale competitive neural networks with nonsmooth functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000240511600005"}
