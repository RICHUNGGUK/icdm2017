We extend the fuzzy preference programming method to fuzzy group prioritization by introducing important weights of decision-makers (DMs). The modified prioritization problem is represented as a weighted fuzzy goal programming model. Additionally, we represent the uncertain DMs' importance weights as fuzzy numbers and modify the goal programming model by a possibilistic approach. Both proposed models transform the initial prioritization problems with fuzzy or crisp important weights into equivalent crisp linear programs. Unlike the known fuzzy prioritization methods, the proposed approach does not require an additional defuzzification procedure for final ranking of alternatives and can deal with incomplete set of comparison judgments.", "paper_title": "WEIGHTED PRIORITIZATION MODELS IN THE FUZZY ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000292515400006"}
