The uncertain fuzzy large-scale systems consist of J interconnected subsystems, which are represented by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional theory and the linear matrix inequality optimization technique, decentralized control is proposed to guarantee asymptotic stability for uncertain fuzzy large-scale systems and minimize the guaranteed cost. Furthermore, the prerequisite that the time-derivative of time-varying delay must be smaller than one is unnecessary in this study. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results developed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Decentralized guaranteed cost control for uncertain fuzzy large-scale systems with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000250591900005"}
