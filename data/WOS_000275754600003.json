Despite these uses, there have been no attempts made towards investigating the resulting tensor weight in respect to the contribution of the individual tensor sources. Motivated by the increase in the current availability of Neuroscience data, specifically for two-source analyses, we propose a novel approach for decomposing the resulting tensor weight into its two components without accessing the feature space. We demonstrate our method and give experimental results on paired fMRI image-stimuli data.", "paper_title": "Decomposing the tensor kernel support vector machine for neuroscience data with structured labels", "paper_id": "WOS:000275754600003"}
