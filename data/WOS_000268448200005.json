The new model of BSWI Rayleigh-Euler rotary beam element considering gyroscopic effect and rotational inertia was constructed to solve the first three natural frequencies of the cracked rotor with high precision, and the first three frequencies solution surfaces of normalized crack location and size were obtained by using surface-fitting technique. Then the first three metrical natural frequencies were employed as inputs of the solution curve surfaces. The intersection of the three frequencies contour lines predicted the normalized crack location and size. The numerical and experimental examples were given to verify the validity of the beam element for crack quantitative identification in rotor systems. The new method can be applied to prognosis and quantitative diagnosis of cracks in the rotor system.", "paper_title": "QUANTITATIVE IDENTIFICATION OF ROTOR CRACKS BASED ON FINITE ELEMENT OF B-SPLINE WAVELET ON THE INTERVAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000268448200005"}
