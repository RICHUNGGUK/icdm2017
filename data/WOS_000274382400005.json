Nevertheless, in many applications, the constraints are continuous with respect to some parameters so that computational difficulties arise. Discretizing the constraints is a reasonable solution for these difficulties. However, in the context of kernel-based regression, most of existing works utilize the prior discretization strategy; this strategy suffers from a few inherent deficiencies: it cannot ensure that the regression result totally fulfills the original constraints and can hardly tackle high-dimensional problems. This paper proposes a cutting plane method (CPM) for constrained kernel-based regression problems and a relaxed CPM (R-CPM) for high-dimensional problems. The CPM discretizes the continuous constraints iteratively and ensures that the regression result strictly fulfills the original constraints. For high-dimensional problems, the R-CPM accepts a slight and controlled violation to attain a dimensional-independent computational complexity. The validity of the proposed methods is verified by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Cutting Plane Method for Continuously Constrained Kernel-Based Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000274382400005"}
