The evaluation of each alternative with respect to each criterion may be imperfect and is provided by one or several experts. We model each imperfect evaluation as a basic belief assignment (BBA). In order to rank the BBAs characterizing the performances of the actions according to each criterion, a new concept called RBBD and based on the comparison of these BBAs to ideal or nadir BBAs is proposed. This is performed using belief distances that measure the dissimilarity of each BBA to the ideal or nadir BBAs. A model inspired by Xu et al.'s method is also proposed and illustrated by a pedagogical example. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
