When a power symmetry transfer function is given, a filter bank is realized as cascade of paraunitary 2-port lattice sections. The method can synthesize both odd- and even-order filters with Butterworth or elliptic characteristics. The number of multiplications per second can also be reduced.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of 2-Channel IIR Paraunitary Filter Banks by Successive Extraction of 2-Port Lattice Sections", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600026"}
