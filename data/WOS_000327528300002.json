The generalization abilities of the SBLLM often rely on whether the available dataset is free of uncertainties to ensure successful result, which means that its generalization capability is sometimes limited depending on the nature of the dataset. Type-2 FLS has been choosing in order to better handle uncertainties existing in datasets and in the membership functions (MFs) in the traditional type-1 fuzzy logic system (FLS). In the proposed method, the type-2 FLS is used to handle uncertainties in reservoir data so that the cleaned data from type-2 FLS is then passed to the SBLLM for training and then final prediction using testing dataset follows. Comparative studies have been carried out to compare the performance of the proposed hybrid system with that of the standard SBLLM. Empirical results from simulation show that the proposed improved hybrid model has greatly improved upon the performance of the standard SBLLM. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
