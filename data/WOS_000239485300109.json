In this paper we propose the BP neural network model for Color Blindness Cure (CBC) according to the biological experimental results. This model transforms abnormal output signals of two paths corresponding to two kinds of cones of the dichromats into normal ones of three paths corresponding to three kinds of cones of normal people. Computer simulation results show that this model has good performance and changes the abnormal vision of the dichromats into normal ones. In addition, some improvements of our model are introduced.", "paper_title": "A new color blindness cure model based on BP neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300109"}
