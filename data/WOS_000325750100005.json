An anatomical model for human knee was constructed and a three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis was developed to determine temperature distribution of the tissues subject to single freezing (SF), single heating (SH) and alternate freezing-heating (AFH), respectively. The heat fluxes of the probes wall and the ablation volume are particularly tracked to comparatively evaluate the ablation ability of different probe configurations with varied diameter, number and active working length. As example, an effective conformal treatment strategy via one time's insertion while cyclic freezing-heating using multiple probes is designed for a predefined knee bone tumor ablation. Both SF and SH could create large enough ablation volume, while it is hard for them to perform a conformal treatment on irregular and slender knee tumor. As an alternative, AFH could form a flexible and controlled shape and volume of the ablation by changing the size and number of the probes and adjusting their insertion depth. In addition, a thermal protection method is considered to reduce cryoinjury of the health tissue. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
