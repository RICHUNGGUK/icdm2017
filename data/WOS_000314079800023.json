Users would like to directly get a list of relevant entities instead of a list of documents when they submit a query to the search engine. So the research of related entity finding (REF) is a meaningful work. In this paper we investigate the most important task of REF: Entity Ranking The wrong-type entities which don't belong to the target-entity type will pollute the ranking result. We propose a novel method to filter wrong-type entities. We focus on the acquisition of seed entities and automatically extracting the common Wikipedia categories of target-entity type. Also we demonstrate how to filter wrong-type entities using the proposed model. The experimental results show our method can filter wrong-type entities effectively and improve the results of entity ranking.", "paper_title": "An Approach of Filtering Wrong-Type Entities for Entity Ranking", "paper_id": "WOS:000314079800023"}
