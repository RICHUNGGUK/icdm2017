Our procedures are based on a combination of Lagrangian relaxation and scenario decomposition, which we solve using a novel variant of Rockafellar and Wets' progressive hedging algorithm [Rockafellar, R. T., R. J.-B. Wets. 1991. Scenarios and policy aggregation in optimization under uncertainty. Math. Oper. Res. 16(1) 119-147]. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to quickly find near-optimal solutions-where verifiable-to both difficult and very large chance-constrained stochastic programs, both with and without integer decision variables. The algorithm exhibits strong scalability in terms of both run time required and final solution quality on large-scale instances.", "paper_title": "Scalable Heuristics for a Class of Chance-Constrained Stochastic Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000283842100005"}
