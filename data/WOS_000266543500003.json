By defining new Lyapunov functions and making use of novel techniques to achieve delay dependence, new conditions for the existence of robust H-infinity controller are obtained based on the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) method. In this article, all the conditions are shown in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be solved efficiently by using the LMI optimization techniques. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the less conservatism of the proposed method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
