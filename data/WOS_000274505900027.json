Although they can improve convergence for sparse impulse responses, the steady-state misalignment is limited by the constant step-size parameter. In this article, based on the principle of least perturbation, we first present a derivation of normalized version of proportionate algorithms. Then by taking the disturbance signal into account, we propose a variable step-size proportionate NLMS algorithm to combine the benefits of both variable step-size algorithms and proportionate algorithms. The proposed approach can achieve fast convergence with a large step size when the identification error is large, and then considerably decrease the steady-state misalignment with a small step size after the adaptive filter reaches a certain degree of convergence. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A Variable Step-Size Proportionate NLMS Algorithm for Identification of Sparse Impulse Response", "paper_id": "WOS:000274505900027"}
