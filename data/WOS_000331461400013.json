In this paper, we present a graph-based representation for biomedical articles and use graph kernels to classify those articles into high-level categories. In our representation, common biomedical concepts and semantic relationships are identified with the help of an existing ontology and are used to build a rich graph structure that provides a consistent feature set and preserves additional semantic information that could improve a classifier's performance. We attempt to classify the graphs using both a set-based graph kernel that is capable of dealing with the disconnected nature of the graphs and a simple linear kernel. Finally, we report the results comparing the classification performance of the kernel classifiers to common text-based classifiers.", "paper_title": "Text Categorization of Biomedical Data Sets Using Graph Kernels and a Controlled Vocabulary", "paper_id": "WOS:000331461400013"}
