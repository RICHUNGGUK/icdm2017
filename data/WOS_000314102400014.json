It is assumed that the processing times of jobs are independent random variables. The stochastic problems are solved based on chance constrained programming. An equivalent deterministic problem is generated for each stochastic problem by linearization of the chance constraints. Then, the generated deterministic problems are solved using efficient algorithms, which have been developed for the deterministic version of the problems. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the solution methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
