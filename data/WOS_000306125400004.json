Through a simple analysis on the packet headers of the bit-stream, the information about the bit-rate and lost status is obtained for each frame. Then the frame quality is measured in terms of coding distortion, frame loss, and contamination because of error propagation. Given the frame quality, a two-level temporal pooling scheme is designed to predict the overall speech quality. Experimental results show that the proposed model is very accurate in quality assessment. Moreover, the proposed packet layer model is featured by its low complexity, which makes it very suitable for real-time quality monitoring for Voice over Internet Protocol services.
