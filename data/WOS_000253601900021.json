However, since simultaneously dealing with the discrete and continuous variables is very difficult, most of the models result in a unified but more complicated and unnatural format. Moreover, design engineers cannot be allowed to use their preferred domain models. Based on the multiparadigm modeling concept, this correspondence proposes a Petri net framework with associated state equations to model the HDSs. In the presented approach, modeling schemes of the hybrid systems are separated but combined in a hierarchical way through specified interfaces. Designers can still work in their familiar domain-specific modeling paradigms, and the heterogeneity is hidden when composing large systems. An application to a rapid thermal process in semiconductor manufacturing is provided to demonstrate the practicability of the developed approach.", "paper_title": "Multiparadigm modeling for hybrid dynamic systems using a Petri net framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000253601900021"}
