In this paper, we present a new classification method based on gravitational potential energy between particles. The basic principle of gravitation based classification (GBC) algorithm is to find the equilibrium condition of the classifier, which is modeled as a classifier line between two groups of fixed particles. In the proposed approach, the input data is a collection of masses, which interact with each other based on Newton's universal law of gravitation and the laws of motion. We present a convex formulation for this problem that always converges to a global optimum solution. The proposed method has been compared with some well-known classification approaches, and the results confirm the high performance of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
