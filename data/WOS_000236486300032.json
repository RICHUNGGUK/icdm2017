However, it is known not to lead to unique results when applied to nonnegative Blind Source Separation (BSS) problems. In this paper we present first results of an extension to the NMF algorithm which solves the BSS problem when the underlying sources are sufficiently sparse. As the proposed target function has many local minima, we use a genetic algorithm for its minimization.", "paper_title": "Sparse nonnegative matrix factorization applied to microarray data sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300032"}
