First, a face detector is applied to detect the facial region, and the edge map of this region is calculated. The distance vector field of the face is extracted by assigning to every facial image pixel a vector pointing to the closest edge pixel. The x and y components of these vectors are used to detect the eyes and mouth regions. Luminance information is used for eye center localization, after removing unwanted effects, such as specular highlights, whereas the hue channel of the lip area is used for the detection of the mouth corners. The proposed method has been tested on the XM2VTS and BioID databases, with very good results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
