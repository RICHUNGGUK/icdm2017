The robustness of MLLR adaptation against data scarcity is thus ensured. The proposed mechanism is conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive and effective; the experiments in recognition rate show that FLC-MLLR outperforms standard MLLR especially when encountering data insufficiency and performs better than MAPLR at much less computing cost.
