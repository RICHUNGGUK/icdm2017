All the simulations were started with A-DNA, with different salt concentrations, and converged with B-DNA with similar conformational parameters. However, the dynamic processes of the three MD simulations were very different. We found that the conformation transition was slow in the solution with higher salt concentration. To determine the cause of this retardation, we performed three additional 1.5-ns simulations starting with B-DNA and with the salt concentrations corresponding to the simulations mentioned above. However, astonishingly, there was no delayed conformation evolution found in any of the three simulations. Thus, our simulation conclusion is that higher salt concentrations slows the A --> B conformation transition, but have no effect on the final stable structure.", "paper_title": "The effect of salt concentration on DNA conformation transition: a molecular-dynamics study", "paper_id": "WOS:000235756300001"}
