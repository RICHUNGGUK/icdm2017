An adaptive hybrid differential evolution algorithm (AHDE) is proposed in this paper to solve DED problem. In the proposed algorithm, an adaptive dynamic parameter control mechanism is adopted to obtain parameter settings in differential evolution algorithm (DE). Moreover, a local random search (LRS) operator is integrated with DE to avoid premature convergence. In view of the difficulties of handling the complicated constraints of DED problem, a new heuristic constraints handling method which does not require penalty factor settings is presented. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated for an application example. Compared with other algorithms, AHDE can find the global optimum dispatch result with a shorter computational time along with higher effectiveness and robustness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
