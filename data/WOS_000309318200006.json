Inspired by the definition of generalized distance, the criterion of this new metric learning is defined by finding an embedding that preserves local information and obtaining a subspace that best detects the essential manifold structure. Furthermore, the two transformation matrices for the query and the register are obtained by a generalized eigen-decomposition. Experiments tested on biometric applications of CASIA(B) gait database and the UMIST face database, demonstrate that our proposed method performs better than classical metric learning methods and the current radial basis function (RBF) algorithms.
