The development of new drugs, new medical equipment and non-invasive techniques for the heart demand multidisciplinary efforts towards the characterization of cardiac anatomy and function from the molecular to the organ level. Computational modeling has demonstrated to be a useful tool for the investigation and comprehension of the complex biophysical processes that underlie cardiac function. The set of Bidomain equations is currently one of the most complete mathematical models for simulating the electrical activity in cardiac tissue. Unfortunately, large scale simulations, such as those resulting from the discretization of an entire heart, remain a computational challenge. In order to reduce simulation execution times, parallel implementations have traditionally exploited data parallelism via numerical schemes based on domain-decomposition. However, it has been verified that the parallel efficiency of these implementations severely degrades as the number of processors increases. In this work we propose and implement a new parallel algorithm for the solution of cardiac models. By relaxing the coherence of the execution, a new level of parallelism could be identified and exploited: pipelining. A synchronous parallel algorithm that uses both pipelining and data decomposition techniques was implemented and used the MPI library for communication. Numerical tests were performed in two different cluster configurations. Our preliminary results indicated that the proposed algorithm is able to increase the parallel efficiency up to 20% on an 8-core cluster. On a 32-core cluster the multi-level algorithm was 1.7 times faster than the traditional domain decomposition algorithm. In addition, the numerical precision was kept under control (relative errors under 6%) when the relaxed coherence execution was adopted.", "paper_title": "Multi-Level Parallelism for the Cardiac Bidomain Equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000270909000003"}
