This paper addresses the design and implementation of remote laboratories employing web technologies, both at the client and the server side. These types of remote laboratories are called WebLabs, and can be deployed over different networks such as the public internet, campuswide networks, or high-speed private networks. Although most published works on WebLabs focus on their functional and operational aspects, nonfunctional requirements related to security, quality of service, and federated operation of WebLabs have received little attention. This paper addresses how these requirements can be incorporated into WebLab design, and discusses the most appropriate web technologies to fulfill such requirements.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation Issues for Modern Remote Laboratories", "paper_id": "WOS:000292542600005"}
