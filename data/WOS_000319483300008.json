This work presents ABC-DynF, an adaptive learning framework with dynamic feature space that we use to compare several incremental and adaptive strategies to cope with these two difficulties. Several studies have been carried out using datasets from the ENRON email corpus and different configuration settings of the framework. The main aim is to study how feature ranking methods, concept drift monitoring, adaptive strategies and the implementation of a dynamic feature space can affect the performance of Bayesian email classification systems.
