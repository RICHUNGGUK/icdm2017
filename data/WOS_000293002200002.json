Tests of intelligence can play an important role in this endeavour. We suggest some criteria for tests that measure progress towards human-level artificial intelligence (HLAI) and argue that tasks designed to study child cognition can be used in constructing such tests. When these tasks are presented in properly constructed simulated environments, which we call microcosms, systems that test well will represent significant progress towards achieving broad HLAI. We illustrate this approach using the domain of infant physical reasoning.", "paper_title": "Microcosms for testing common sense reasoning abilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000293002200002"}
