In this paper, we analyze the average convergence behavior of the single-unit FastICA algorithm with kurtosis contrast for general m-source noiseless mixtures. We prove that this algorithm causes the average inter-channel interference (ICI) to converge exponentially with a rate of (1/3) or -4.77dB at each iteration, independent of the source mixture kurtoses. Explicit expressions for the average ICI for the three- and four-source mixture cases are also derived, along with an exact expression for the average ICI in a particular situation. Simulations verify the accuracy of the analysis.", "paper_title": "Average convergence behavior of the FastICA algorithm for blind source separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300098"}
