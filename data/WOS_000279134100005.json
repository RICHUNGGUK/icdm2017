We have analyzed that a high-dimensional feature space with limited training data will introduce difficulties to DML algorithms in both computation and performance. To tackle these difficulties, we decompose the high-dimensional feature space into a set of low-dimensional feature spaces with minimal dependencies. Then we perform DML for each low-dimensional feature space to construct a sub-metric and the sub-metrics are finally combined into a global metric. We conduct experiments on Corel and TRECVID datasets with different DML methods, and empirical results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.
