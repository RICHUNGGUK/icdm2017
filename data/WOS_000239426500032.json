Our generalization is not as strong as for the case p(2) and we indicate the reason. We give a class of homogeneous weights, including the homogeneous weight defined by Constantinescu and Heise, and we show their relations. We also give an application of our improvements on the homogeneous weights of some codewords.", "paper_title": "Improved bounds on Weil sums over Galois rings and homogeneous weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000239426500032"}
