In this paper, we present a systematic study of the hardware implementation of RC4, and propose the fastest known architecture for the cipher. We combine the ideas of hardware pipeline and loop unrolling to design an architecture that produces 2 RC4 keystream bytes per clock cycle. We have optimized and implemented our proposed design using VHDL description, synthesized with 130, 90, and 65 nm fabrication technologies at clock frequencies 625 MHz, 1.37 GHz, and 1.92 GHz, respectively, to obtain a final RC4 keystream throughput of 10, 21.92, and 30.72 Gbps in the respective technologies.", "paper_title": "High-Performance Hardware Implementation for RC4 Stream Cipher", "paper_id": "WOS:000315959200008"}
