Therefore, how to minimize energy consumption and keep mobile robots to stay alive becomes an important problem. In this paper, we propose a staying-alive and energy-efficient path planning algorithm, SLEEP (Staying-aLive and Energy-Efficient Path planning), to solve this problem based on the Tabu-search method. In SLEEP, we consider both energy consumption and staying-alive for the path planning of rechargeable mobile robots. We design and implement our approach based on a real mobile robot platform, and conduct experiments in a real-life environment. The experimental results show that SLEEP can provide an effective path planning by which a robot can be guaranteed to stay alive and finish all tasks with the minimum energy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
