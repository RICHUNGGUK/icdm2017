Existing substructure miners are deterministic, requiring the activity of all mined molecules to be known with high confidence. In contrast, we introduce pGraphSig, a probabilistic structure miner, which effectively mines structures from noisy data, where many molecules are labeled with their probability of being active. We benchmark pGraphSig on data from several small-molecule high throughput screens, finding that it can more effectively identify overrepresented structures than a deterministic structure miner.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Substructure Mining From Small-Molecule Screens", "paper_id": "WOS:000295878500007"}
