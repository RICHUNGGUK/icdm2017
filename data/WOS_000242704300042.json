Non-linearity is studied under three different specifications of the conditional distribution: Gaussian, Student-t and mixture of Gaussians. To rank the volatility models, a Bayesian framework is adopted to perform a Bayesian model selection within the different classes of models. In the empirical analysis, the return series of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index, FTSE 100 and NIKKEI 225 indices over a period of 16 years are studied. The results show different behavior across the three markets. In general, if a statistical model accounts for non-normality and explains most of the fat tails in the conditional distribution, then there is less need for complex non-linear specifications.
