The BPSKO algorithm integrates both the particle swarm. optimization algorithm and K-means algorithm. Besides, roulette selection operator is applied for avoiding premature convergence. Simulation results using four data sets, Iris, Wine, Vowel, and Glass are very promising. The results for an international industrial personal computer (PG) manufacturer show that the proposed algorithm, ART2+BPSKO, is superior to continuous particle swarm optimization algorithm. Through order clustering, scheduling orders belonging to the same cluster together can, reduce the production time as well as the machine idle time.", "paper_title": "APPLICATION OF PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION-BASED CLUSTERING METHOD TO REDUCE SMT SETUP TIME FOR INDUSTRIAL PC MANUFACTURER IN TAIWAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400005"}
