Prior to a full effort for this model development, however, studies are needed to select and assess the suitability of a lake hydrodynamic model in terms of its capability to couple with the CRCM. This paper evaluates the performance of the 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model ELCOM on Great Slave Lake, one of Canada's largest lakes in the northern climatic system. Model simulations showed dominant circulation patterns that can create relatively large spatial and temporal gradients in temperature. Simulated temperatures compared well with cross-lake temperature observations both at the surface and vertically. Sensitivity analysis was applied to determine the critical meteorological variables affecting simulations of temperature and surface heat fluxes. For example, a 10% increase in air temperature and solar radiation was found to result in a 3.1% and 8.3% increase in water surface temperature and 8.5% increase in latent heat flux. Knowledge of the model sensitivity is crucial for future research in which the hydrodynamic model coupled with the atmosphere will be forced from the CRCM output.
