In this paper, we propose a new public key traitor tracing scheme based on cover-free families. The new traitor tracing scheme is similar to the Boneh-Franklin scheme except that in the Boneh-Franklin scheme, decryption keys are derived from Reed-Solomon codes while in our case they are derived from a cover-free family. This results in much simpler and faster tracing algorithms for single-key pirate decoders, compared to the tracing algorithms of Boneh-Franklin scheme that use Berlekamp-Welch algorithm. Our tracing algorithms never accuse innocent users and identify all traitors with overwhelming probability.", "paper_title": "An efficient single-key pirates tracing scheme using cover-free families", "paper_id": "WOS:000238570400006"}
