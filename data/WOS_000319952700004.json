Based on the swarm optimization theory, a particle selecting approach is proposed to search for the optimal parameters, a key property of this set of multi-category classifiers. By utilizing the particle swarm search, it is able to obtain higher classification accuracy with significant savings on the training time compared to the conventional grid search. For wall-following robot navigation, the best accuracy (98.8%) is achieved by the particle swarm search with only 114 of the training time by the grid search. Through communicating the social information available in particle swarms in the training process, classification-based learning can achieve higher classification accuracy without prematurity. One of such learning classifiers has been implemented in SIAT mobile robot. Experimental results validate the proposed search scheme for optimal parameter settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
