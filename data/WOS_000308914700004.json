The authors' approach considers selected places of interest that a traveller would potentially wish to visit and derives a near-optimal itinerary for each day of visit; the places of potential interest are selected based on stated or implied user preferences. The authors' method enables the planning of customised daily personalised tourist itineraries considering user preferences, time available for visiting sights on a daily basis, opening days of sights and average visiting times for these sights. Herein, the authors propose a heuristic solution to this problem addressed to both web and mobile web users. Evaluation and simulation results verify the competence of the authors' approach against an alternative method.", "paper_title": "Web application for recommending personalised mobile tourist routes", "paper_id": "WOS:000308914700004"}
