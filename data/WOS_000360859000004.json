Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) can be used to find the best possible design taking into account several disciplines simultaneously, but it is not yet fully integrated within automotive product development. The challenge is to find methods that fit company organizations and that can be effectively integrated into the product development process. Based on the characteristics of typical automotive structural MDO problems, a metamodel-based MDO process intended for large-scale applications with computationally expensive simulation models is presented and demonstrated in an example. The process is flexible and can easily fit into existing organizations and product development processes where different groups work in parallel. The method is proven to be efficient for the discussed example and improved designs can also be obtained for more complex industrial cases with comparable characteristics.", "paper_title": "A metamodel-based multidisciplinary design optimization process for automotive structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000360859000004"}
