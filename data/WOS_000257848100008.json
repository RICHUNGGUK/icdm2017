To investigate the system stability, a T-S fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear system. A sampled-data fuzzy controller is employed to close the feedback loop. Due to the sampling activity of the sampled-data fuzzy controller, discontinuity is introduced which complicates the stability analysis. Consequently, the existing analysis approach for continuous-time systems cannot be applied. Furthermore, the imperfectly matched grades of membership lead to the favourable technique relaxing stability analysis result not applicable. To facilitate the stability analysis of sampled-data fuzzy-model-based control systems, a membership function condition is proposed to introduce some slack matrices for nonlinearity compensation. LMI-based stability conditions are derived using the Lyapunov-based approach to guarantee the system stability. An application example is given to illustrate the merits of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of sampled-data fuzzy-model-based control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257848100008"}
