The existing performance models require intricate system architecture knowledge, making the modeling task difficult. In this research, we propose a regression-based performance prediction framework for general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) clusters that statistically abstracts the system architecture characteristics, enabling performance prediction without detailed system architecture knowledge. The regression-based framework targets deterministic synchronous iterative algorithms using our synchronous iterative GPGPU execution model and is broken into two components: the computation component that models the GPGPU device and host computations and the communication component that models the network-level communications. The computation component regression models use algorithm characteristics such as the number of floating-point operations and total bytes as predictor variables and are trained using several small, instrumented executions of synchronous iterative algorithms that include a range of floating-point operations-to-byte requirements. The regression models for network-level communications are developed using micro-benchmarks and employ data transfer size and processor count as predictor variables. Our performance prediction framework achieves prediction accuracy over 90% compared with the actual implementations for several tested GPGPU cluster configurations. The end goal of this research is to offer the scientific computing community, an accurate and easy-to-use performance prediction framework that empowers users to optimally utilize the heterogeneous resources.
