Based on an equal clustering algorithm, M-3-SVMS can divide the training data set of the original problem into several subsets with nearly equal number of samples, and combine them to a series of balanced subproblems which can be trained more efficiently and effectively. In this paper, we explore the use of M-3-SVMs with equal clustering method in gender recognition. The experimental results show that M-3-SVMS with equal clustering method can be successfully used for gender recognition and make the classification more efficient and accurate.", "paper_title": "Gender recognition using a min-max modular support vector machine with equal clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000031"}
