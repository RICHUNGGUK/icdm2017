An inherent problem with this technique is the resulting high-dimensional recordings and the subsequent problems for diagnostic classifiers. A data set, recorded from a 192-lead BSPM system, containing 74 records is investigated. QRS isointegral maps, offering a summary of the information obtained during ventricular depolarization, were derived from 30 old inferior myocardial infarction and 44 normal recordings. Principal component analysis was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the recordings and a linear classifier was employed for classification. This perceptron-based classifier has been adapted so that the final weight and bias values are estimated prior to the learning process. This estimation process, referred to as the linear hyperplane approach (LHA), derives the estimated weights from a bisector hyperplane, placed orthogonal to the means of two class distributions in an n-dimensional Euclidean space. Estimating weights encourages a network to exhibit better generalization ability. Utilizing a number of different principal components as input features, the LHA achieved an average sensitivity and specificity of 79.58% and 76.45%, respectively, across all experiments. The average accuracy of 76.73% achieved with this approach was significantly better than the other benchmark classifiers evaluated against it.", "paper_title": "Diagnosing old MI by searching for a linear boundary in the space of principal components", "paper_id": "WOS:000239033000007"}
