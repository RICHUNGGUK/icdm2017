A classic approach to generate video textures is to apply principal components analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction (i.e. extraction of frame signatures) and autoregressive (AR) process for prediction purposes. In this paper we investigate the use of other dimensionality reduction techniques to generate accurate video textures. Based on our experiments, the quality of video textures can be improved further. We also propose a new approach for generating video textures using probabilistic principal components analysis (PPCA) and Gaussian process dynamical model (GPDM) to synthesize video textures which contain frames that never appeared before and with similar motions as original videos. Furthermore, we propose two ways of generating online video textures by applying the incremental Isomap and incremental Spatio-temporal Isomap (IST-Isomap). Both approaches can produce good online video texture results. In particular, IST-Isomap, that we propose, is more suitable for sparse video data (e.g. cartoon). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
