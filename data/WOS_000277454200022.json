Sleep mode operation is widely used to save battery power. However, by using the sleep mode, the delay in packet transmission increases. In this paper, we propose an adaptive scheme, called the p-persistent sleep decision (SD), which controls the tradeoff between the power saving and the delay performance. The proposed p-persistent SD scheme can be used for the systems adopting frame structure with fixed length. At each beginning of frame, a node decides its state (i.e., sleep or active) for the frame, according to the result of p-persistent test, considering a variety of sleep-decision parameters, for examples, the number of queued packets and the channel condition. The performance of the p-persistent SD is evaluated by using Markov analysis. Numerical results show that we can easily control the tradeoff between the power saving and the delay performance by assigning different weights to the sleep-decision parameters. As an application example, we suggest the p-persistent SD applied to IEEE 802.11 MAC and compare its performance with that of the conventional IEEE 802.11 power save mode by using simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme saves more energy under the given delay constraint. Since the proposed scheme is simple and practical, it can be applied to any star- and mesh-topology wireless networks with fixed frame length.", "paper_title": "Power saving with p-persistent sleep decision for wireless communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000277454200022"}
