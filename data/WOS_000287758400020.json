We introduce an efficient and scalable method for fast identification of viral vector integration sites from long read high-throughput sequencing. Individual sequence reads are masked to remove non-genomic sequence, aligned to the host genome and assembled into contiguous fragments used to pinpoint the position of integration.", "paper_title": "Identifying viral integration sites using SeqMap 2.0", "paper_id": "WOS:000287758400020"}
