PSCSV produces class contours with support vectors, and further extracts center information of classes. Data is labeled according to its affinity to class centers. A novel Kernel function encoded in PSCSV is defined for multi-relational version and parameterized by supervisory information. Another point is the self learning of penalty parameter and Kernel scale parameter in the support-vector-based procedures, which eliminates the need to search parameter spaces. Expermients on real datasets demonstrate performance and efficiency of PSCSV.", "paper_title": "Parameterized Semi-supervised Classification based on Support Vector for multi-relational data", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600010"}
