The factors and levels studied were as follows: four text display methods (rapid serial visual presentation 'RSVP', leading, paged view scrolling, and continuous scrolling), three text display rates (160 characters per min 'cpm', 240 cpm, and 320 cpm), and seven observation angles (-75 degrees, -60 degrees, -30 degrees, 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 75 degrees). The results indicated that a display rate of 160 cpm was in general superior to 240 and 320 cpm for comprehension scores and subjective evaluations. The effects of display method and observation angle were found to be non significant. However, there was a significant interaction between display method and display rate. The results of this study were used to make ergonomics recommendations applicable to LED displays for determining optimum dynamic text display methods for Chinese characters. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
