To obtain the insight in the internationalisation of e-commerce, we investigated online shopping preferences in three nations - the US (well developed in e-commerce), Korea (fast growing with good infrastructure) and Turkey (developing with good potentials). A survey of 205 Korean university students was conducted, and its results were compared with the results of Turkish and US surveys in Lightner et al. (2002). We found significant cross-national differences in online shopping preferences, especially in information accuracy, security and product-price comparison, and discussed those differences in terms of economic, infrastructural and cultural factors. Several practical guidelines were provided for website design in the Korean online market.", "paper_title": "Internationalisation of e-commerce: a comparison of online shopping preferences among Korean, Turkish and US populations", "paper_id": "WOS:000234238100002"}
