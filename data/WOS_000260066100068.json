Based on locality preserving projections (LPP) and discriminant locality preserving projections (DLPP) methods, NDLPP comes into the characteristics of DLPP that encodes both the geometrical and discriminant structure of the data manifold, and addresses the small sample size problem by solving an eigenvalue problem in null space. Experiments on synthetic data and ORL, Yale, and FERET face databases are performed to test and evaluate the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of NDLPP.
