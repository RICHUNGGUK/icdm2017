A necessary and sufficient condition is proposed for the existence of the Hopf bifurcation. Saddle-node bifurcations and canards of the simplified model with the coefficients of different linear forms are also discussed. Finally, the bifurcation curves with the coefficients of different linear forms are shown. The numerical results demonstrate that some linear forms can retain the bifurcation characteristics of the original model, which is of great use to simplify the H-H model for the real-world applications.", "paper_title": "Bifurcation analysis of a two-dimensional simplified Hodgkin-Huxley model exposed to external electric fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000329407500006"}
