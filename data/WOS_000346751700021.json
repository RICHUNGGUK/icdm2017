The algorithm is based on the subdivision of the domain into smaller ones and the solution of those sub-domains independently. Regarding water distribution systems modeling, the hydraulic simulation could be formulated as a sequence of systems of linear equations. Therefore, this paper utilizes the domain decomposition method to accelerate the simulation process further. The method is evaluated using a large scale real-world system with 63,616 junctions and 64,200 pipes as case study. The case study shows that the methodology could improve the performance of hydraulic simulation app. by a factor of 8 without losing accuracy at a suitable level of domain decomposition. Although the optimal level of decomposition is case specific, considerable speedup might still be achievable by decomposing a large system into only a few subsystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
