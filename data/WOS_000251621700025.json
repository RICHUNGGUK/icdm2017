To resolve the conflict, we proposed an efficient model predictive controller with pole placement for a class of discrete-time linear systems. By specifying a group of circular regions that contain the desired closed-loop poles, appropriate terminal weighting matrices and local controllers are calculated to construct a time-varying terminal convex set, which is a significant constraint for the online optimization problem. During the online optimization, the size of the terminal convex set can adjust itself according to the actual state at each sampling time. In this way, a large initial feasible region can be achieved while maintaining the good dynamic performance. An illustrative example is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
