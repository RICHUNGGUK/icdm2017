Different from existing approaches, a parameter-dependent filter is designed in finite frequency range, which is important in practice since full frequency approaches are conservative to some extent for the case when frequency ranges of disturbances are known beforehand. With the aid of Generalised Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma, the filter design problem is formulated into solving a set of linear matrix inequalities problem. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Reliable H filtering for LPV systems with sensor faults in finite frequency domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000320191500011"}
