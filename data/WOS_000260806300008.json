For that, we propose a fuzzy active object-oriented database for modeling knowledge intensive applications. In that, we incorporate fuzziness within the event, condition and action parts of an active rule. We consider deductive rules as special cases of active rules so that deductive queries are handled using abstract kind of events. We also introduce a model for fuzzy inferencing of fuzzy active rules where we develop a model for scenario concept. We use a Fuzzy Petri Net model for fuzzy rule-based inference.", "paper_title": "INCORPORATING FUZZINESS INTO ACTIVE RULES", "paper_id": "WOS:000260806300008"}
