Namely, it is proved that the summation over some naturally chosen planes in the pyramid composed of these matrices yields a new integer sequence, which is the convolution of the Fibonacci numbers and the (alternating) Padovan numbers. In turn, this convolution is linearly represented in terms of the Lucas numbers and the Padovan numbers.", "paper_title": "The Fibonacci-Padovan sequence and MacWilliams transform matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000245537300004"}
