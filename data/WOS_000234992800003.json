This is especially true for correlations between variables. Although many statistical techniques have been developed for dealing with directional data, software is scarce for the unique calculations. This paper describes a MATLAB script, located on the IAMG server, that calculates measures of association (correlations) between two circular variables, or between a circular and a linear variable. The calculations include tests of significance of the associations. These tests use large-sample approximations or resampling methods. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
