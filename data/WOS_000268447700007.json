In our previous work, we proposed a belief-driven method with fuzzy set theory for discovering the unexpected sequences that contradict existing knowledge of data, including occurrence constraints and semantic contradictions. In this paper, we present a new approach that discovers unexpected sequences with determining semantic contradictions by using concept hierarchies associated with the data. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach with experiments on Web usage analysis.", "paper_title": "DISCOVERING FUZZY UNEXPECTED SEQUENCES WITH CONCEPT HIERARCHIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000268447700007"}
