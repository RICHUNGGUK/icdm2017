For that we single out one particular instance of a set of models defining image similarities that was earlier studied in [C. Ballester et al., Multiscale Model. Simul., 12 (2014), pp. 616-649], using an axiomatic approach that extended the classical Alvarez-Guichard-Lions-Morel work to the nonlocal case. Namely, we study a linear model to compare patches defined on two images in RN endowed with some metric. Besides its genericity, this linear model is selected by its computational feasibility since it can be approximated leading to an algorithm that has the complexity of the usual patch comparison using a weighted Euclidean distance. Moreover, we propose and study some intrinsic metrics which we define in terms of affine covariant structure tensors and we discuss their properties. These tensors are defined for any point in the image and are intrinsically endowed with affine covariant neighborhoods. We also discuss the effect of discretization over the affine covariance properties of the tensors. We illustrate our theoretical results with numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Linear Multiscale Analysis of Similarities between Images on Riemannian Manifolds: Practical Formula and Affine Covariant Metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000362417500023"}
