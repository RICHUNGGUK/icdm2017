In this paper, an energy efficiency analysis is performed for a hexapod walking robot to reduce these energy costs. To meet the power-saving demands of legged robots, the torque distribution algorithm required to minimize the system's energy costs was established with an energy-consumption model formulated. In contrast to the force distribution method, where the objective function is related to the tip-point force components, the torque distribution scheme is based on minimization of the mechanical energy cost and heat loss power. The simulation results show that this scheme could reduce the system energy costs with use of the appropriate walking velocities and duty factors for the robot. The paper also discusses the effects of the gait patterns and the mechanical structure on the system energy costs. For this purpose, the prescribed periodic walking gait of the robot is described in terms of several parameters, including the duty factor, the stride length, the body height, and the foot trajectory lateral offset. The numerical results indicate some analogies between the characteristics of the simulated walking robot and those of animals in nature. The optimized parameters derived here are intended for robot platform development applications.", "paper_title": "Power Consumption Optimization for a Hexapod Walking Robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000321567200006"}
