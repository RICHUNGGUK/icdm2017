The particular forms of the IS-MCSCF method designated IS-GVB-PP, IS-FVBL and IS-CASSCF stand for perfect pairing generalized valence bond, full valence bond-like MCSCF and complete active space self consistent field, respectively. A comparison of these different versions of the IS-MCSCF method was carried out for the first time. The results indicate that inner-shell states are described accurately even for the simplest version of the method (IS-GVB-PP). Dynamic correlation was recovered by multireference configuration interaction or multireference perturbation theory. For molecules not having equivalent atoms, all methods led to comparable and accurate transition energies. For molecules with equivalent atoms, the most accurate results were obtained by multireference perturbation theory. Scalar relativistic effects were accounted for using the Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian.", "paper_title": "Transition energy and potential energy curves for ionized inner-shell states of CO, O-2 and N-2 calculated by several inner-shell multiconfigurational approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000318274700012"}
