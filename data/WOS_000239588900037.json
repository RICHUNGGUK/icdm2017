The extended BA (Balabasi and Abert) model was used as the concept model for this simulation. In developing this model, we have focused on the following two issues: (i) characteristics of agent and contents, and (ii) agent decision rules regarding sending, receiving and searching contents. The simulator processes communications among the agents and uncovers emerging social behavior. Assuming parameters of this generic scenario, the simulation results show that the network possesses scale-free and small-world properties.", "paper_title": "Analyzing peer to peer communication through agent-based simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239588900037"}
