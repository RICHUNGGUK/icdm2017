Setting the scene with a review of classical measures for determining the structural information content of graphs, we discuss graph entropy measures which play an important role in a variety of problem areas, including biology, chemistry, and sociology. In addition, we examine relationships between selected entropy measures, illustrating differences quantitatively with concrete examples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
