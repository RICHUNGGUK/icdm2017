The congestion problem is modeled as a distributed dynamic system with time-varying delay, and it can be proven that the sent rate for all nodes converges to the available bandwidth of the sink by the proposed congestion control algorithm. Via Lyapunov function, the validity of the proposed algorithm is shown under the varying network topologies. Ns simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm restrains the congestion over the wireless sensor network, maintains a high throughput and a low delay time, and also improves the quality of service for the whole network.", "paper_title": "Congestion Control Based on Consensus in the Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000325014300001"}
