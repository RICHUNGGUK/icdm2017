First, it takes up issues on the border of labour and language by examining the importance of viewing information as mutually constituted out of these two components. Second, it addresses the boundary between workers and users by explaining the need to incorporate workers more directly into information studies research. Third, it aims to integrate information labour with communication and cultural work. Finally, it points to the importance of bridging the divide that separates informational labour in rich countries from labour in poorer regions of the world. In doing so, the paper intends to shed light on why information studies scholars and practitioners need to spend more time on the study of labour.", "paper_title": "Working Knowledge: Why Labour Matters for Information Studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000273545200004"}
