The simulator presents the trainee with a three-dimensional (3D) virtual model of the ear that can be viewed through a mock surgical microscope consisting of a stereo visor mounted on a custom-designed stand. The trainee interacts with the virtual ear using a real myringotomy blade, the movements of which are tracked in real time using a stereo optical tracker. Interactions of the blade with virtual tissues are calculated and rendered on the visor using freely available physics and graphics software engines. Six experienced surgical residents and surgeons assessed the effectiveness of the simulator as a viable training tool by completing a questionnaire designed specifically for this study after using the simulator. Surgeons and residents were positively impressed by the simulator as a training tool and would recommend its use as part of training. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
