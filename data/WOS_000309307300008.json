This study presents a systematic review of the literature using a meta-analysis approach to provide a more comprehensive analysis and synthesis of relevant studies based on four orientations of learning theories and principles: behaviorism, cognitivism, humanism, and constructivism. Major findings of this study include that the majority of published studies were not based on learning theory and the development of learning theory orientations has prompted more studies to focus on constructivism and humanism than on behaviorism and cognitivism. In addition, most studies adopted a descriptive approach, followed by experimental methods and surveys, and most presented positive outcomes. These findings not only advance understanding of game-assisted learning from the important perspective of learning theory, but also provide useful insights for researchers and educators in issues related to game-assisted learning.
