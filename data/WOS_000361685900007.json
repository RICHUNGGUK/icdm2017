In this channel, the NA-antenna transmitter adopts transmit antenna selection (TAS) to choose the antenna that maximizes the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver to transmit, while the NB-antenna receiver and the NE-antenna eavesdropper adopt maximal-ratio combining (MRC) to combine the received signals. We focus on the practical scenario where the channel state information (CSI) during the TAS process is outdated. In this scenario, we propose a new transmission scheme to prevent the detrimental effect of the outdated CSI on the wiretap codes design at the transmitter. To thoroughly assess the secrecy performance achieved by the proposed scheme, we derive new closed-form expressions for the exact secrecy outage probability and the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity for arbitrary SNRs. We also derive new compact expressions for the asymptotic secrecy outage probability at high SNRs. Notably, in the analysis, we take spatial correlation at the receiver into consideration. Apart from the advantage of our scheme over the conventional TAS/MRC scheme, we demonstrate that the outdated TAS reduces the secrecy diversity order from NANB to NB. We also demonstrate that antenna correlation improves the secrecy performance at low SNR but deteriorates the secrecy performance at medium and high SNRs, by affecting the secrecy array gain only.", "paper_title": "A New Secure Transmission Scheme With Outdated Antenna Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000361685900007"}
