Commercial off-the-shelf embedded devices, such as embedded medical equipment, are more vulnerable as these type of products cannot be amended conventionally or have limited resources to implement protection mechanisms. In this paper, we present a self-organizing map (SOM)-based approach to enhance embedded system security by detecting abnormal program behavior. The proposed method extracts features derived from processor's program counter and cycles per instruction, and then utilises the features to identify abnormal behavior using the SOM. Results achieved in our experiment show that the proposed method can identify unknown program behaviors not included in the training set with over 98.4% accuracy.", "paper_title": "A Method for Detecting Abnormal Program Behavior on Embedded Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000359984600012"}
