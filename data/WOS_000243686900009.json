However, the lack of efficient optical buffering requires investigation of new topologies and routing techniques. This paper introduces and evaluates the Data Vortex optical switching architecture which uses cylindrical routing paths as a packet buffering alternative. In addition, the impact of the number of angles on the overall network performance is studied through simulation. Using optimal topology configurations, the Data Vortex is compared to two existing switching architectures - butterfly and omega networks. The three networks are compared in terms of throughput, accepted traffic ratio, and average packet latency. The Data Vortex is shown to exhibit comparable latency and a higher acceptance rate (2x at 50 percent load) than the butterfly and omega topologies.", "paper_title": "The data vortex, an all optical path multicomputer interconnection network", "paper_id": "WOS:000243686900009"}
