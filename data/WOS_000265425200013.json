The code consists of 4 pegs, each of which is one of 6 colors. In Generalized Mastermind a general number p of pegs and a general number c of colors is considered. Let f(p, c) be the pessimistic number of questions for the generalization of Mastermind with an arbitrary number p of pegs and c of colors. By a computer program we compute ten new values of f(p, c). Combining this program with theoretical methods, we compute all values f(3, c) and a tight lower and upper bound for f(4, c). For f(p, 2) we give an upper bound and a lower bound. Finally, combining results for fixed p and c, we give bounds for the general case f(p, c). (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
