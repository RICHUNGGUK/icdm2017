For this purpose, a control point based Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method is employed and the material density is considered as a continuous function throughout the design domain and approximated by the Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) basis functions. To prevent the formation of layouts with porous media, a penalization technique similar to the SIMP method is used. For optimization an optimality criteria is derived and implemented. A few examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the method. It is shown that, dissimilar to the element based SIMP topology optimization, the resulted layouts by this method are independent of the number of the discretizing control points and checkerboard free.", "paper_title": "An isogeometrical approach to structural topology optimization by optimality criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000298500500005"}
