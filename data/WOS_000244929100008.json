As different services have different quality of service and data rate requirements, admission control is essential in safeguarding the performance of different services in VSG-CDMA cellular systems in harsh wireless environment. In this paper, we propose an admission control scheme for multiple services VSG-CDMA cellular system in a practical multi-cell environment where there exist adverse effects due to imperfect power control and shadowing. Rather than with a fixed bound as in previous studies, the admission bound in our scheme is based on the probability distribution of total intra-cell power (P-in) and other-cell interference power (I-other). This is used to estimate the blocking probability by utilizing a simple and accurate approximation that incorporates the random nature of P-in and I-other. Evaluation of the impact of power control error to the mean and standard deviation of P-in and I-other, we performed and compared the blocking probability with fixed admission bound scheme in an integrated voice/data environment. Our work has enabled the calculation of the blocking probability and capacity of different mobility users having different power control errors under shadowing.
