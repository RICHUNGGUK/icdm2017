The formation of conductive paths in TiO2 composed of oxygen vacancy filaments were investigated using the LDA + U-d + U-p method to calculate the band-structure, electron localization functions, partial charge densities of defect states and the Bader charge decompositions. The thermodynamic stability of charged oxygen vacancies on resistive switching are discussed based on the defect formation energies and a resistive switching mechanism is proposed based on models of filament formation and rupture.
