Running multiple applications simultaneously on a many-core NoC is a promising approach to implement high performance parallel processing. This paper presents a novel methodology for mapping multiple applications adaptively with unbounded or bounded number of cores. Composed of application mapping and task mapping, the proposed two-step mapping methodology provides minimized communication energy consumption and execution time for multiple applications. It is evaluated by several kernels and real applications with a variety of settings on a NoC simulator. The quantitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance and energy efficiency of the proposed mapping methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
