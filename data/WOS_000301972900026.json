Thus, an important task is to know what has been modified between two versions of an ontology (diff). This diff should contain all performed changes as compact and understandable as possible. We present CODEX (Complex Ontology Diff Explorer), a tool that allows determining semantic changes between two versions of an ontology which users can interactively analyze in multiple ways.", "paper_title": "CODEX: exploration of semantic changes between ontology versions", "paper_id": "WOS:000301972900026"}
