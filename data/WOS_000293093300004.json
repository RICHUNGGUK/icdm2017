Recently, the treatment of mental disorders through biofeedback therapy is emerging as an important topic. A number of studies on the integration of mental healthcare and the Internet have also been proposed, since the Internet plays a more and more crucial role in various healthcare applications. By performing biofeedback therapy via the Internet, the treatment time can be highly reduced and the medical costs can also be significantly cut down. In view of this, this research aims at developing an intelligent treatment system for the patients with mental disorders by integrating biofeedback therapy and web technology. The system provides not only a convenient mechanism for the patients to perform biofeedback therapy at home but also an effective communication channel for patients and medical professionals. Moreover, the functions which enable the therapists to manage their patients more conveniently are proposed. The results of this research are expected to bring a pivotal impact on the healthcare industry with increased and enhanced levels of technology and services.", "paper_title": "AN INTELLIGENT AND EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR MENTAL DISORDER TREATMENT BY USING BIOFEEDBACK ANALYSIS AND WEB TECHNOLOGIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000293093300004"}
