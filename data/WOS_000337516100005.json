A new kind of public key system, called identity-based public key system, sets the users' public identity, for example, their email addresses, as their public key. This characteristic of identity-based public key systems decreases expense and increases speed in executing many important protocols in data security such as cryptography, identification, key agreement, and digital signatures. But, the major shortcoming of these systems is Key Escrow (legal key retrieval) and also the key generation center's ability to impersonate users. In this paper, two certificateless identity-based identification schemes devoid of the aforementioned shortcomings are represented. These are Challenge-response Identification protocols. Also, the second scheme introduced in this paper has the batch verification quality. The security analysis of the introduced schemes will come at the end.
