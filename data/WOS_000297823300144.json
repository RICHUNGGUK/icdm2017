In this paper, a new model is proposed to assist E-Commerce practitioners in the assessment of E-Commerce security. The proposed model is based on Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory of evidence. First, according to the characteristics of E-Commerce, a hierarchical structure of E-Commerce security is established to calculate the weights of relevant issues using AHP. Then Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is applied to combine all the issues, regarded as evidences, in order to derive a consensus decision for the degree of E-Commerce security. An illustrative example is given to show the efficiency of our model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
