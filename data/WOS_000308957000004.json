The main contribution is to build algorithms that hold for a general right-hand side faH (-1)(Omega). Prior work assumes almost exclusively that faL (2)(Omega). New data indicators based on local H (-1) norms are introduced, and then the AFEMs are based on a standard bulk chasing strategy (or Dorfler marking) combined with a procedure that adapts the mesh to reduce these new indicators. An analysis of our AFEM is given which establishes a contraction property and optimal convergence rates N (-s) with 0 < sa parts per thousand currency sign1/2. In contrast to previous work, it is shown that it is not necessary to assume a compatible decay s < 1/2 of the data estimator, but rather that this is automatically guaranteed by the approximability assumptions on the solution by adaptive meshes, without further assumptions on f; the borderline case s=1/2 yields an additional factor logN. Computable surrogates for the data indicators are introduced and shown to also yield optimal convergence rates N (-s) with sa parts per thousand currency sign1/2.", "paper_title": "Convergence Rates of AFEM with H-1 Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000308957000004"}
