This program allows for the simulation of complex scenarios of interaction in water-rock-gas systems while accounting for mineral dissolution kinetics and solution transport. The thermodynamic calculations are realized using the GEOCHEQ program. CRONO was developed for simulations of regolith formation on the surfaces of early Earth and Mars and can be applied to other targets formed mainly as a result of chemical weathering. In this paper, an application of the code using a simulation of modern subaerial weathering of basaltic rocks is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
