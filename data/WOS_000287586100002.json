However, when representing user profiles, many models have utilized only knowledge from either a global knowledge base or a user local information. In this paper, a personalized ontology model is proposed for knowledge representation and reasoning over user profiles. This model learns ontological user profiles from both a world knowledge base and user local instance repositories. The ontology model is evaluated by comparing it against benchmark models in web information gathering. The results show that this ontology model is successful.", "paper_title": "A Personalized Ontology Model for Web Information Gathering", "paper_id": "WOS:000287586100002"}
