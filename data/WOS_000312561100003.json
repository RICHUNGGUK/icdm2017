We first devise several novel heuristic measures using minimal domain knowledge and then use them as building blocks in two evolutionary setups involving a standard genetic algorithm and policy-based, genetic programming. Our evolved solvers outperform the best FreeCell solver to date by three distinct measures: 1) number of search nodes is reduced by over 78%; 2) time to solution is reduced by over 94%; and 3) average solution length is reduced by over 30%. Our top solver is the best published FreeCell player to date, solving 99.65% of the standard Microsoft 32 K problem set. Moreover, it is able to convincingly beat high-ranking human players.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary Design of FreeCell Solvers", "paper_id": "WOS:000312561100003"}
