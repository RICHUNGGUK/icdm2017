Existing media access control (MAC) protocols like carrier sense multiple access always try to minimize the number of concurrent transmissions to avoid collision, although collisions at sender sides are harmless to the overall performance. The reason for such conservative strategy is that those protocols cannot obtain accurate channel status (who is transmitting and receiving) with low cost. They can only avoid potential collisions through rough channel status (idle or busy). To obtain additional information in a cost-efficient way, we propose a novel coding scheme, Attachment Coding, to allow control information to be \"attached\" on data packet. Nodes then transmit two kinds of signals simultaneously, without degrading the effective throughput of the original data traffic. Based on Attachment Coding, we propose an Attached-RTS MAC (AR-MAC) to exploit exposed terminals for concurrent transmissions. The attached control information provides accurate channel status for nodes in real time. Therefore, nodes can identify exposed terminals and utilize them for concurrent transmission. We theoretically analyze the feasibility of Attachment Coding, and implement it on the GNU Radio testbed to further verify it. We also conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of Attached-RTS. The experimental results show that by leveraging Attachment Coding, AR-MAC achieves up to 180 percent in dense deployed ad hoc networks.", "paper_title": "Attached-RTS: Eliminating an Exposed Terminal Problem in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319678800003"}
