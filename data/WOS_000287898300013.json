Equivalent mechanisms of cartons were established by describing carton creases as joints and carton panels as links. With the analysis of the equivalent mechanism, the gusset vertexes of cartons were analyzed based on their equivalent spherical linkages and were identified as guiding linkages that determine folding. A reconfigurable robotic system was developed to demonstrate the ability to erect diverted cartons in the reconfigurable packaging system which could previously only be achieved manually.
