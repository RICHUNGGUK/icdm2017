We study parametric AE solution sets, which are defined by universally and existentially quantified parameters, and the former precede the latter. Based on a recently obtained explicit description of such solution sets, we present three approaches for obtaining outer estimations of parametric AE solution sets. The first approach intersects inclusions of parametric united solution sets for all combinations of the end-points of the universally quantified parameters. Polynomially computable outer bounds for parametric AE solution sets are obtained by parametric AE generalization of a single-step Bauer-Skeel method. In the special case of parametric tolerable solution sets, we derive an enclosure based on linear programming approach; this enclosure is optimal under some assumption. The application of these approaches to parametric tolerable and controllable solution sets is discussed. Numerical examples accompanied by graphic representations illustrate the solution sets and properties of the methods.", "paper_title": "Outer enclosures to the parametric AE solution set", "paper_id": "WOS:000321644600009"}
