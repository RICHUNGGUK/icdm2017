The gain is evaluated in a single link, such as the radio interface of a cellular network. Two approaches to define such a gain are presented: one based on the average link occupancy, and another based on the blocking probability. The developed methods enable determining how popular the most popular contents should be in order to justify the use of multicast or a combination of broadcast and unicast from a performance point of view.
