We consider in this letter the case of dual space diversity FSO systems when the fading coefficients corresponding to the two sub-channels are correlated. In order to evaluate the receiver performance analytically, we propose to approximate the sum of correlated Gamma Gamma random variables by an alpha-mu distribution. We show that there is a good match between the performance obtained by simulated data based on the Gamma Gamma channel model and that obtained from analytical calculation based on the approximate alpha-mu model.", "paper_title": "Approximation to the Sum of Two Correlated Gamma-Gamma Variates and its Applications in Free-Space Optical Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696400018"}
