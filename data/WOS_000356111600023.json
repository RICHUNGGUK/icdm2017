These include the case where facilities provide a certain amount of service level for the customers, the possibility where customers do not allocate their demand completely to one facility but prorate their demand based on the service level, and finally we explore the situation where customers will not opt for sharing their demand irrespective of the service level if the next attractive facility is too far way which we express by a distance threshold. These models are put forward to mimic realistic situations related to customer behavior when it comes to selecting a facility. Their respective mathematical formulations are put forward and tested on a case study and also over a range of larger data sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
