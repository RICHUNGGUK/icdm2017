This paper presents an insight on the benefits that type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs) can offer towards the efforts to realize Ambient Intelligent Environments (AIEs). We will introduce research results from the Scaleup project showing different type-2 FLSs based applications in AIEs. Such applications include intelligent machine vision systems, blending real and virtual realities over dispersed geographical areas and allowing natural communication between the AIE and humans.", "paper_title": "Employing Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems in the Efforts to Realize Ambient Intelligent Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000352025600006"}
