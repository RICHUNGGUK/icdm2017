In this paper, we give an overview towards the developments of Physarum-inspired models for graph-optimization problems. Specifically, we reported the applications of Physarum in the following graph-optimization problems: influential nodes identification, shortest path tree problem, bi-objective shortest path problem, improved Physarum algorithm and approximating the transport network.", "paper_title": "Physarum-Inspired Applications in Graph-Optimization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000365777000006"}
