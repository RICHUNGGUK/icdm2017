By taking only three diameter measures at the base of the tree, diameters are predicted recursively until they reach the value of minimum merchantable diameter, with no previous knowledge of total tree height. It was considered the diameter top of 4 cm outside bark as minimum merchantable diameter. The training was conducted with only 10% of the trees from the total planted site. The Smalian method utilizes the predicted diameters to calculate merchantable tree volumes. The performance of the proposed model was satisfactory when predicted diameters and volumes are compared to actual ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
