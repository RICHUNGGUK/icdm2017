AMD is a new paradigm for developing autonomous machines, which are adaptive and flexible to the environment. Language development, a kind of mental development, is an important aspect of intelligent conversational agents. In this paper, we propose an intelligent conversational agent and its language development mechanism by putting together five promising techniques: Bayesian networks, pattern matching, finite-state machines, templates, and genetic programming (GP). Knowledge acquisition implemented by finite-state machines and templates, and language learning by GP are used for language development. Several illustrations and usability tests show the usefulness of the proposed developmental conversational agent.", "paper_title": "Autonomous language development using dialogue-act templates and genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000245518500006"}
