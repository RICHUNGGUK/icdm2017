After proposing various alternatives for the generalization of the definition of the Costas property, based on the definitions of the Costas property in one or two dimensions, we also offer some construction methods, the main one of which is based on the idea of reshaping Costas arrays into higher-dimensional entities.", "paper_title": "ON THE GENERALIZATION OF THE COSTAS PROPERTY IN HIGHER DIMENSIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275051900001"}
