As compared to other solvers, it is easy to implement and can keep conservation of mass and momentum. In the diffuse interface method, the interface is not considered as a sharp discontinuity. Instead, it treats the interface as a diffuse layer with a small thickness. This treatment is similar to the shock-capturing method. To have a fine resolution around the interface, one has to use very fine mesh in the computational domain. As a consequence, a large computational effort will be needed. To improve the computational efficiency, this paper incorporates the efficient 5-points stencil adaptive algorithm [1] into the diffuse interface method with local refinement around the interface and then applies the developed method to simulate two-dimensional incompressible multiphase flows. Three cases are chosen to test the performance of the method, including Young-Laplace law for a 2D drop, drop deformation in the shear flow and viscous finger formation. The method is well validated through the comparison with theoretical analysis or earlier results available in the literature. It is shown that the method can obtain accurate results at much lower cost, even for problems with moving contact lines. The improvement of computational efficiency by the stencil adaptive algorithm is demonstrated obviously. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
