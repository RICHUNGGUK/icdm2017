A dual-threshold CMOS circuit, which has both high and low threshold transistors in a single chip, can be used to deal with the leakage problem in high performance applications. This paper presents dual-threshold voltage technique for reducing leakage power dissipation of Quasi Delay Insensitive asynchronous pipelines while still maintaining high performance of these circuits. We exploited the Dependency Graph model to produce a formal performance analysis. In order to reduce leakage power an efficient algorithm for selecting and assigning high threshold voltage to templates of a pipeline is proposed. Results obtained indicate that our proposed technique can achieve on average 40% savings for leakage power, while there is no performance penalty.", "paper_title": "LEAKAGE POWER REDUCTION OF ASYNCHRONOUS PIPELINES", "paper_id": "WOS:000288223400003"}
