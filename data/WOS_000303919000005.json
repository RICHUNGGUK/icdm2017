(Random Structures Algorithms 31 (2007), 3122). Here the vertices of the graph are divided into a fixed finite number of sets (called layers) the probability of {u,v} being in our edge set depends on the respective layers of u and v. We determine the exponential rate function for the probability that a giant component occupies a fixed fraction of the graph, while all other components are small. We also determine the exponential rate function for the probability that a particular exploration process on the random graph will discover a certain fraction of vertices in each layer, without encountering a giant component (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
