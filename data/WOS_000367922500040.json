At present, there are many different PRE schemes that have been proposed with different properties. However, all of them are based on the logarithm assumption and the large integer factorization assumption except for a bidirectional PRE scheme over lattices. In this paper, we construct the first multi-use unidirectional PRE scheme based on lattices. In addition, the generation of the PRE key does not interact with two users, and the scheme can resist collusion attacks. Moreover, it is proved chosen plaintext attack secure in the standard model based on the Learning With Errors assumption. Finally, an identity-based PRE is obtained from the basic construction.
