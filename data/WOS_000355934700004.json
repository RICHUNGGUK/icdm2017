Closed form expressions for optimal attacking strategies that minimize the miss detection error exponent at the fusion center (FC) are obtained. We also look at the problem from the network designer's (FC's) perspective. We study the problem of designing optimal distributed detection parameters in a tree network in the presence of Byzantines. Next, we model the strategic interaction between the FC and the attacker as a leader-follower (Stackelberg) game. This formulation provides a methodology for predicting attacker and defender (FC) equilibrium strategies, which can be used to implement the optimal detector. Finally, a reputation-based scheme to identify Byzantines is proposed and its performance is analytically evaluated. We also provide some numerical examples to gain insights into the solution.", "paper_title": "Distributed Detection in Tree Networks: Byzantines and Mitigation Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000355934700004"}
