Therefore, multi-objective decision making (MODM) is a practical framework in implicational areas. In this paper, a fuzzy MODM problem is considered, where all of its parameters are defined fuzzily, and a solution inspired by multi-attribute VIKOR method is proposed. The proposed method tries to find fuzzy efficient solution for a problem by minimizing its combinational distance from an ideal and anti-ideal solution. This method can reveal the efficient frontier of the problem. Applicability of the proposed method is shown in an illustrative example and its application is summarized in an investment problem. Both examples show applicability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Multi-Objective Linear Programming Based on Compromise VIKOR Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000340430200002"}
