The scheme is named coded slotted ALOHA. A bipartite graph representation of the SIC process, resembling iterative decoding of generalized low-density parity-check codes over the erasure channel, is exploited to optimize the selection probabilities of the component erasure correcting codes through a density evolution analysis. The capacity (in packets per slot) of the scheme is then analyzed in the context of the collision channel without feedback. Moreover, a capacity bound is developed, and component code distributions tightly approaching the bound are derived.", "paper_title": "Coded Slotted ALOHA: A Graph-Based Method for Uncoordinated Multiple Access", "paper_id": "WOS:000368420200027"}
