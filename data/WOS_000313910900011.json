The First XLDB Conference at Asia (XLDB Asia) was held at Beijing, China on June 22-23, 2012. The conference attracted nearly 200 participants. XLDB takes a fresh format on the organization through invited talks, lightning talks and open discussions. Most invited speakers are also owners of real extremely large data from industries and scientific research, practitioners who are handling the real data, or DBMS researchers who are researching new solutions. Based on the enthusiastic embrace and positive feedbacks from participants, we believe the conference series will continue as a venue for the discussion on the management and analysis of extremely large data sets with increasing popularity.", "paper_title": "XLDB Asia 2012: the First Extremely Large Databases Conference at Asia", "paper_id": "WOS:000313910900011"}
