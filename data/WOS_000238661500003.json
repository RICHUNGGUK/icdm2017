Most of the block-based motion estimation algorithms are based on computing the sum of absolute differences (SAD) between corresponding elements in the candidate and reference blocks. In this paper, an field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) design is proposed for rapidly computing the minimum SAD. Two goals are achieved due to the use of online arithmetic (OLA): it is possible to implement a full 16 X 16 macroblock SAD in a single FPGA device; and it allows us to speed up computation by early termination of the SAD calculation when the candidate involved is bigger than the current reference SAD. Reconfigurable devices enable us to change 8 X 8 or 16 X 16 pixels per block quickly and easily. For a 16 X 16 SAD unit 1945 look-up tables (LUTs) are required at 425 MHz.
