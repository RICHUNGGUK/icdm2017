In this way, a new covert transmitter is designed based on a modified CSMA protocol that enables the transmitter to embed a covert message in its overt traffic. The proposed scheme provides high covert rate without compromising the stealthiness of the channel.", "paper_title": "Covert Channels in Multiple Access Protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000302124800042"}
