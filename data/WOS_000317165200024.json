Computational experiments demonstrate that branch-and-price guided search quickly produces solutions that are near-optimal and of better quality than those produced by a state-of-the-art, commercial integer programming solver that is given much more time. We also develop local search schemes to further reduce the time needed to find high quality solutions and present computational evidence of their efficacy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
