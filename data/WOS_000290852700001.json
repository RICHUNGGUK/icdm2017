To speed up the synthesis, we can represent the appearance of the scene under different lighting directions as an illumination adjustable image (IAI). Relighting the scene under a lighting environment is then achieved by manipulating the pre-recorded images of the IAI. However, the relighting based on the pre-recorded images is still inefficient because of the large storage and computation requirements. The approaches based on spherical harmonics (SH) and cubemap-based spherical wavelets (CSW) have been proposed to improve the relighting efficiency. Note that the SH approach is suitable for low-frequency lighting only, whereas the CSW approach suffers the problem of uneven sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Isocube-based spherical wavelets (IsoSW), to efficiently synthesise images based on the IAI representation. Unlike the SH approach, our approach can effectively capture high-frequency illumination effects. Compared with the CSW approach, our approach not only improves the rendering quality, but also makes the synthesis process more efficient.", "paper_title": "Isocube-based spherical wavelet for image-based relighting", "paper_id": "WOS:000290852700001"}
