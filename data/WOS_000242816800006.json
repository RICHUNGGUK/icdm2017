While the discretized governing equations are updated conservatively, the method treats the topological changes naturally by combining interface description and geometric operations with a level set technique. Extensive tests in 1D are carried out, and 2D examples suggest that the present scheme is able to handle multi-fluid and complex (static or moving) boundary problems in a straightforward way with good robustness and accuracy.
