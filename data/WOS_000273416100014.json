The problem it self comes from a real industrial case. Specific route duration constraints result in a route feasibility subproblem. We propose an exact algorithm for this subproblem, and we embed it in a variable neighborhood search method to solve the whole routing problem. We then provide experimental results for this method. We compare them to a commercial solver. We also adapt our method to standard benchmark OP and TOP instances, and provide comparative tables with state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
