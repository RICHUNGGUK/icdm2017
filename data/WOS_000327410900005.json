Recently, modeling and querying uncertain data have attracted considerable attention from the database community. However, how to perform advanced analysis on uncertain data remains an interesting question. In this paper, we focus on the execution of skyline computation over uncertain moving objects. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where an uncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline at a certain time point, therefore a p-t-skyline contains those moving objects whose skyline probabilities are at least p at time point t. Computing probabilistic skyline over a large number of uncertain moving objects is a daunting task in practice. In order to efficiently compute the probabilistic skyline query, we propose a discrete-and-conquer strategy, which follows the sampling-bounding-pruning-refining procedure. To further reduce the skyline computation cost, we propose an enhanced framework that is based on a multi-dimensional indexing structure combined with the discrete-and-conquer strategy. Through extensive experiments with synthetic datasets, we show that the framework can efficiently support skyline queries over uncertain moving object and is scalable on large data sets.", "paper_title": "PROBABILISTIC SKYLINE QUERIES OVER UNCERTAIN MOVING OBJECTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000327410900005"}
