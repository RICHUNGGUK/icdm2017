A case study, funded by the NCCHTA, estimating the cost-effectiveness of thrombophilia testing is presented. Thrombophilia may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) which can be fatal; however, the preventative treatment, warfarin, is associated with an increased risk of haemorrhage, which is also potentially fatal. A DES model, populated from literature reviews and incorporating VTE events, haemorrhages and death was constructed. The most cost-effective duration of warfarin treatment ('standard treatment' of 3 or 6 months, 10 years, 20 years or lifelong) was estimated for patients with initial idiopathic VTE, sub-divided into age, gender, VTE type and known thrombophilia type groups. The primary goal was to ascertain, for each sub-group, whether the cost of thrombophilia testing for all patients, given subsequent tailoring of warfarin duration, would be cost-effective. Thrombophilia testing was estimated to be cost-effective in most sub-groups; however these results are subject to large uncertainty. Primary research is required before a definitive conclusion can be reached.", "paper_title": "A review of discrete event simulation in National Coordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment-funded work and a case study exploring the cost-effectiveness of testing for thrombophilia in patients presenting with an initial idiopathic venous thromboembolism", "paper_id": "WOS:000208735700003"}
