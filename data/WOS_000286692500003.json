In this paper, we present the hardware and software for offloading the socket processing in order to improve the network performance of a server. The experimental results showed that the proposed solution could improve the network performance of a typical solution significantly. Furthermore, the proposed solution can provide the binary compatibility with the BSD socket standard such that the existing network programs can be used without modification and/or recompilation.", "paper_title": "Offloading Socket Processing for Ubiquitous Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000286692500003"}
