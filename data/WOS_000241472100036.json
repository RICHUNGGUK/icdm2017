To achieve these features we have implemented an encryption-unit (EU) using ST filters for encryption and a decryption unit (DU) using learning algorithms and decision trees for decryption.", "paper_title": "Development of a neural net-based, personalized secure communication link", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100036"}
