The graphical calculus is shown to be reduction equivalent to stochastic pi, ensuring that the two calculi have the same expressive power. The graphical representation is used to model a couple of example biological systems, namely a bistable gene network and a mapk signalling cascade. One of the benefits of the representation is its ability to highlight the existence of cycles, which are a key feature of biological systems. Another benefit is its ability to animate interactions between system components, in order to visualise system dynamics. The graphical representation can also be used as a front end to a simulator for the stochastic pi-calculus, to help make modelling and simulation of biological systems more accessible to non computer scientists.", "paper_title": "A graphical representation for biological processes in the Stochastic pi-calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000243595000007"}
