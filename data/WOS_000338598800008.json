Dominating sets in unit disk graphs are widely studied due to their applicability in wireless ad-hoc networks. Because the minimum dominating set problem for unit disk graphs is NP-hard, numerous approximation algorithms have been proposed in the literature, including some PTASs. However, since the proposal of a linear-time 5-approximation algorithm in 1995, the lack of efficient algorithms attaining better approximation factors has aroused attention. We introduce an O(n + m) algorithm that takes the usual adjacency representation of the graph as input and outputs a 44/9-approximation. This approximation factor is also attained by a second algorithm, which takes the geometric representation of the graph as input and runs in O(nlogn) time regardless of the number of edges. Additionally, we propose a 43/9-approximation which can be obtained in O(n(2)m) time given only the graph's adjacency representation. It is noteworthy that the dominating sets obtained by our algorithms are also independent sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
