For a square plant, its inverse is stable if the plant is minimum phase (MP). Nevertheless, this conclusion does not hold for a non-square plant. In this paper, the pole feature of the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of a non-square transfer function matrix is analysed. Instead of complicated advanced mathematical tools, only basic results of polynomial theory and the Binet-Cauchy theorem are used in the analysing procedure. The condition for testing the stability of the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of an MP non-square transfer function matrix is given. This condition implies that the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of a non-square transfer function matrix cannot be directly used as the optimal controller. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the correctness of the condition.", "paper_title": "On the pole of non-square transfer function matrix Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverses", "paper_id": "WOS:000357933000007"}
