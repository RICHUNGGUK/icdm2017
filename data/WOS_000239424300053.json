We applied hybrid recommendation mechanism, which is combining both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering in our suggested model. It not only retains the advantages of a content-based and collaborative filtering approach, but also improves the disadvantages found in both. We expect that the approach would be helpful for students to find relevant precedents more efficient and more precise with their preferences.", "paper_title": "eDAADe: An adaptive recommendation system for comparison and analysis of architectural precedents", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300053"}
