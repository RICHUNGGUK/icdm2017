Knowledge (intelligence) is incorporated into the coordinator to improve performance. This knowledge is incorporated through a set of rules and models obtained from a knowledge extraction process applied to the records of the results returned by individual metaheuristics. The effectiveness of the approach is tested in several computational experiments in which we compare the results obtained by the individual metaheuristics, by several non-cooperative and cooperative strategies and by the strategy proposed in this paper.
