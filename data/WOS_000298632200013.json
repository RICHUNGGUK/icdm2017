The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program is enabling communications within the military by implementing different military radio waveforms on software defined radio (SDR) platforms. It is logical to include a Project 25 (P25) public safety waveform in the JTRS waveform portfolio. This paper describes the rapid development of a P25 waveform on a surrogate JTRS SDR platform. The development process and methodology, which starts from a platform agnostic executable waveform model in Matlab, through an intermediate implementation using open tools on generic platforms, to the final platform-specific implementation, is introduced and discussed. This paper shows that adopting this methodology can speed up waveform development and porting. Furthermore, this paper presents the design and implementation of a three way voice bridge among P25, the future multiband multi-waveform modular tactical radio (FM3TR), and voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), with software communication architecture (SCA) compliant implementation for both the P25 and FM3TR waveforms. This paper shows that critical issues such as interoperability can be tackled efficiently by leveraging SDR and SCA.", "paper_title": "Design and rapid prototyping of SCA-compliant public safety P25 waveform and P25-FM3TR-VoIP bridge", "paper_id": "WOS:000298632200013"}
