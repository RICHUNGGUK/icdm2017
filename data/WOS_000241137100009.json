Aspect-oriented software development is a well-known approach to improve this. In this paper, we present an aspect-oriented extension for the WS-BPEL language that improves on current state-of-the-art by introducing an explicit deployment construct, a richer joinpoint model, and a higher-level pointcut language. In addition, the supporting technology is compatible with existing WS-BPEL engines.", "paper_title": "Isolating process-level concerns using padus", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137100009"}
