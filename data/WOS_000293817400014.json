WMAN/WLAN networks is still a challenging issue to be tackled. This work thus incorporates a variant of the particle swarm optimization.(PSO) algorithm, the so-called immune binary particle swarm optimization algorithm (IBPSO), into the design of the dynamic resource management scheme for heterogeneous wireless networks to effectively reduce the dropping probability of handoff calls and to maximize bandwidth utilization. The simulation results show that our scheme is effective in terms of performance metrics, including dropping probability of handoff calls, new call blocking probability, throughputs and bandwidth utilization.", "paper_title": "INTELLIGENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SCHEMES FOR HETEROGENEOUS WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293817400014"}
