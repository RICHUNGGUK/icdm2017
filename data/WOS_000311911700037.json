In this paper, we deal with a rather untouched version of MCLP which is called dynamic MCLP (DMCLP). In order to solve this problem, a simulated annealing (SA) has been presented. The proposed solution algorithm is capable of solving problems with up to 2500 demand nodes and 200 potential facilities with a fair amount of exactness. Our experiments showed that the proposed approach finds solutions with errors less than one percent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
