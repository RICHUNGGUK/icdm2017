However, the longitudinal dimension of naturally occurring chitin fibers exceeds hundreds of nanometer, beyond the investigation range of all-atom simulation due to the limitation of computational power. Under this context, coarse-grained simulation is a useful alternative that facilitates the investigation of a large system. We develop a coarse-grained model for describing the structural and mechanical properties of alpha-chitin. The developed coarsegrained model can reasonably predict these properties. Moreover, this model is consistent with existing coarse-grained force fields for proteins. The present model of alpha-chitin possesses good potential and applicability in the investigation of natural chitin-based materials at the length scale of several hundred nanometers.", "paper_title": "Development of a coarse-grained alpha-chitin model on the basis of MARTINI forcefield", "paper_id": "WOS:000362408200009"}
