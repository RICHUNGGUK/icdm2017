Many methods have been proposed for testing H-0: tau(X) = 1, the hypothesis that the error term is homoscedastic, with most methods known to be unsatisfactory in terms of controlling the probability of a Type I error. This paper considers several approaches based on a quantile regression estimator, one of which ( method N2) is recommended for general use. A minor goal is to report new results related to a method suggested by Koenker. Method N2 does not dominate Koenker's method in terms of power, but as illustrated, the choice of method can make a considerable difference when testing H-0. In particular, situations occur where Koenker's method is highly non-significant, yet method N2 rejects at the 0.01 level.", "paper_title": "Detecting heteroscedasticity in a simple regression model via quantile regression slopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000238565500004"}
