First, commonly used radiopharmaceuticals such as hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) quantitatively underestimate large blood flows, leading to subtracted SPECT images that do not reflect the true cerebral physiological conditions, and often display non-distinct epileptic foci. The proposed relative change subtraction method of SPECT image analysis helps alleviate this quantitative burden. Second, the image analysis process traditionally performed by physicians is time consuming and prone to error. Toward this end, an automated algorithm was designed to analyze SPECT images and provide feedback to users through a visual interface. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
