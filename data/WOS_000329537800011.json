In this paper we summarize the principal challenges facing the current Internet, introduce the research status of the future Internet, analyze the principal design goals of the new generation Internet evaluation methods and models of the present Internet architecture, introduce the research achievements made under the new generation Internet architecture in detail, and propose our next-step research priorities and perspectives in the face of an increasing number of innovative Internet applications.", "paper_title": "Research achievements on the new generation Internet architecture and protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000329537800011"}
