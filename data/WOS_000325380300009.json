Its utility, however, is often depreciated by spectral leakage artifacts resulting from low spatial resolution measurements through an effort to reduce acquisition times. Though model-based techniques can help circumvent these drawbacks, they require strong prior knowledge, and can introduce additional artifacts when the underlying models are inaccurate. We introduce a novel scheme in which a generative model is estimated from the raw MRSI data via a regularized variational framework that minimizes the model approximation error within a measurement-prescribed subspace. As additional a priori information, our approach relies only upon a measured field inhomogeneity map at high spatial resolution. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on both synthetic and experimental data.", "paper_title": "Data-Driven MRSI Spectral Localization Via Low-Rank Component Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000325380300009"}
