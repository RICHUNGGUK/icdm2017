To support our view, we analyze a \"ghost\" imaging experiment with chaotic light for which the classical understanding does not give a satisfactory interpretation. We also provide a two-photon optical picture of ghost imaging with chaotic light in terms of a two-photon phase-conjugate mirror, which suggests lensless imaging applications for radiations for which no effective lens is available.", "paper_title": "Two-photon correlation of chaotic light: A quantum interference phenomenon", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862500018"}
