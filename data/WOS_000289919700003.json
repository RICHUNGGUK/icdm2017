These studies are usually conducted with the purpose of identifying usability issues related to the resource(s) used or understanding aspects of users' information behaviour. However, few of these studies present detailed accounts of how their think-aloud data was collected and analysed or provide detailed reflection on methodological decisions made. In this article, we discuss and reflect on the methodology used when planning and conducting a think-aloud study of lawyers' interactive information behaviour. Our discussion is framed by Blandford et al.'s PRET A Rapporter ('ready to report') framework - a framework that can be used to plan, conduct and describe user-centred studies of electronic information resource use from an information work perspective.
