A vertex set S subset of V is a paired-dominating set if every vertex in V - S has a neighbor in S and the induced subgraph G vertical bar S vertical bar has a perfect matching. In this paper, we investigate the approximation hardness of paired-domination in graphs. For weighted paired-domination, an approximation algorithm in general graphs and an exact dynamic programming style algorithm in trees are also given. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
