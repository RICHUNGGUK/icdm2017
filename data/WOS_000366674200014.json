The property weight calculation method based on rough sets is used to reduce the dependency on prior knowledge; the structural similarity calculation is used to solve the problem of property missing and matching angle varying; the fuzzy set calculation method is adopted to solve the problem of fuzzy property similarity missing. The traffic emergency plan matching case for Changzhou section of Shanghai-Nanjing highway demonstrates that the proposed method can improve the accuracy and reliability of highway traffic emergency matching, reflecting the advantages of rough sets and fuzzy sets in emergency plan matching.", "paper_title": "Matching method for emergency plans of highway traffic based on fuzzy sets and rough sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200014"}
