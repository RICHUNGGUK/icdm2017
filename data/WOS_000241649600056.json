To overcome this issue, we use a system that combines stereo graphics and haptics to facilitate efficient 3D interaction. We propose a new method, based on the 2D live-wire method, for segmenting volume images. Our method consists of two parts: an interface for drawing 3D live-wire curves onto the boundary of an object in a volume image, and an algorithm for connecting two such curves to create a discrete surface.", "paper_title": "A 3D live-wire segmentation method for volume images using haptic interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241649600056"}
