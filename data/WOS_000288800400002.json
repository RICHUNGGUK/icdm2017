A three-layer feed-forward back-propagation neural network with 2-5-1 architecture was trained and tested using 130 experimental and monitored blast records from the surface coal mines of Singareni Collieries Company Limited, Kothagudem, Andhra Pradesh, India. Twenty new blast data sets were used for the validation and comparison of the peak particle velocity (PPV) by ANN and conventional vibration predictors. Results were compared based on coefficient of determination and mean absolute error between monitored and predicted values of PPV.", "paper_title": "Application of soft computing to predict blast-induced ground vibration", "paper_id": "WOS:000288800400002"}
