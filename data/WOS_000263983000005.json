With the T-NHZ in the time- frequency (TF) correlation functions, the proposed T-NHZ sequences can be directly employed in time-frequency hopping code division multiple access (TFH-CDMA) communication systems to reduce or eliminate multipath interference. Simulation results show that T-NHZ sequences can achieve much better bit error performance than the NHZ sequences and the traditional FH sequences.", "paper_title": "Time-frequency hopping sequences with three no hit zones", "paper_id": "WOS:000263983000005"}
