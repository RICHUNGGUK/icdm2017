In this paper, we propose a spike-based IP model/adaptation rule for an integrate-and-fire (IF) neuron to model this biological phenomenon. By utilizing spikes denoted by Dirac delta functions rather than computing instantaneous firing rates for the time-dependent stimulus, this simple adaptation rule adjusts two parameters of an individual IF neuron to modify its excitability. As a result, this adaptation rule helps an IF neuron to keep its firing activity in a relatively \"low but not too low\" level and makes the spike-count distributions computed with adjusted window sizes similar to the experimental results.", "paper_title": "A Spike-Based Model of Neuronal Intrinsic Plasticity", "paper_id": "WOS:000316482100006"}
