Thus, cloud users may want to be sure that their stored data have not been relocated into unknown geographic regions that may compromise the security of their stored data. Albeshri et al. (2012) combined proof of storage (POS) protocols with distance-bounding protocols to address this problem. However, their scheme involves unnecessary delay when utilising typical POS schemes due to computational overhead at the server side. The aim of this paper is to improve the basic GeoProof protocol by reducing the computation overhead at the server side. We show how this can maintain the same level of security while achieving more accurate geographic assurance.", "paper_title": "Enhanced GeoProof: improved geographic assurance for data in the cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000333351500005"}
