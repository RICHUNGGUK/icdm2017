We introduce the lex game, which yields a combinatorial description of the lexicographic standard monomials of the ideal I (V) of polynomials vanishing on V. As a consequence, we obtain a fast algorithm which computes the lexicographic standard monomials of I (V). We apply the lex game to calculate explicitly the standard monomials for special types of subsets of {0, 1}(n). For D subset of Z let V-D denote the vectors y is an element of {0, 1}(n) in which the number of ones (the Hamming weight of y) is in D. We calculate the lexicographic standard monomials Of VD, where D = D(d, l, r) = (a is an element of Z : there exists a' is an element of Z with d <= a' <= d + l - 1 and a' equivalent to a (mod r)), for d, l, r is an element of N fixed with 0 <= d < r and 0 < l < r.
