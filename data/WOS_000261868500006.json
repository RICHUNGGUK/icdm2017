This problem consists of choosing the embryos to be transferred in human-assisted reproduction treatments, which Bayesian classifiers address as a supervised classification problem. Different Bayesian classifiers capable of taking into account diverse dependencies between variables of this problem are tested in order to analyse their performance and validity for building a potential decision support system. The analysis by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) proves that the Bayesian classifiers presented in this paper are an appropriated and robust approach for this aim. From the Bayesian classifiers tested, the tree augmented naive Bayes, k-dependence Bayesian and naive Bayes classifiers showed to perform almost as well as the semi naive Bayes and selective naive Bayes classifiers.
