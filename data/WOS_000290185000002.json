We present a systematic generalization of the residual distribution method of [1] to very high order of accuracy, by extending the preliminary work discussed in [2] to systems and hybrid meshes. We present extensive numerical validation for the third and fourth order cases with Lagrange finite elements. In particular, we demonstrate that we both have a non-oscillatory behavior, even for very strong shocks and complex flow patterns, and the expected accuracy on smooth problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
