A detection algorithm based on texture may cause detection errors in regions of blank texture and heterogeneous texture, and a detection algorithm based on color is easily influenced by illumination changes and shadows. In this paper, a new detection and fusion algorithm is proposed. At the detection stage based on texture, the background texture is classified according to the steering kernel. At the fusion stage, for the moving objects detected on the basis of texture and color respectively, a scheme based on a boundary selection strategy is proposed for combining the different detection objects. A relatively smooth boundary is selected as the true boundary, and the shadow detection is carried out to assist the boundary selection. Experimental results verify the advantages of the proposed algorithm as compared to the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
