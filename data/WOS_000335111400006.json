In this paper, we present an approach to detect flat vegetation, such as grass, which cannot be identified using range measurements. This type of vegetation is typically found in structured outdoor environments such as parks or campus sites. Our approach classifies the terrain in the vicinity of the robot based on laser scans and makes use of the fact that plants exhibit specific reflection properties. It uses a support vector machine to learn a classifier for distinguishing vegetation from streets based on laser reflectivity, measured distance, and the incidence angle. In addition, it employs a vibration-based classifier to acquire training data in a self-supervised way and thus reduces manual work. Our approach has been evaluated extensively in real world experiments using several mobile robots. We furthermore evaluated it with different types of sensors and in the context of mapping, autonomous navigation, and exploration experiments. In addition, we compared it to an approach based on linear discriminant analysis. In our real world experiments, our approach yields a classification accuracy close to 100%. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
