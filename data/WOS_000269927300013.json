With smart sensors and actuators, the WSANs are able to not only sense the control system states and report measurements, but also perform control and actuation. This paper investigates WSANs on their ability of control. A centralized controller is introduced into WSANs to make up closed-loop control systems, in which control decisions are made based on global network-wide information. A model of the control and communication over WSANs is made theoretically, based on which we achieved an optimal control method. It is demonstrated by simulations that the control method proposed could stabilize the control system quickly. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
