It provides a robust topological representation of arbitrary meshes that are combined in closely interlinked levels of resolution. The proposed combinatorial model is formalized through the mathematical model of combinatorial maps allowing us to give a general formulation, in any dimensions, of the topological subdivision process that is a key issue to robustly and soundly define mesh hierarchies. It fully supports multiresolution edition what allows the implementation of most mesh processing algorithms - like filtering or compression - for n-dimensional meshes with arbitrary topologies. We illustrate this model, in dimension 3, with an new truly multiresolution representation of subdivision volumes. It allows us to extend classical subdivision schemes to arbitrary polyhedrons and to handle adaptive subdivision with an elegant solution to compliance issues. We propose an implementation of this model as an effective and relatively inexpensive data structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
