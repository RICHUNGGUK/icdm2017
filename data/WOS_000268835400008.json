Design/methodology/approach - Introduces recent studies, NO studied models and the experimental model before considering the diffusion-reaction model. Enzymatic kinetics and an analysis of systems and the NA diffusion equations in mice cortex are given. Numerical results are featured. Findings - Based on these studies, both a bio-mathernatical and physiological conclusions are given. The way to protect the brain was to inhibit the NO-synthase of the neurons during a stroke. Originality/value - The paper is of value, particularly as stroke is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide and the most common cause of dementia in western countries. In Europe. each year, over 1,200,000 people experience a stroke.", "paper_title": "Modelling and mathematical studies of neuronal NO-synthase: NO versus NA theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000268835400008"}
