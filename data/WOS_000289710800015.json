The transfer energy was calculated as a sum of the first solvation shell energy and the long-range electrostatic contribution. The first term was proportional to solvent accessible surface area and solvation parameters (sigma(i)) for different atom types. The electrostatic term was computed as a product of group dipole moments and dipolar solvation parameter (eta) for neutral molecules or using a modified Born equation for ions. The regression coefficients in linear dependencies of solvation parameters sigma(i) and eta on dielectric constant, solvatochromic polarizability parameter e, and hydrogen-bonding donor and acceptor capacities of solvents were optimized using 1269 experimental transfer energies from 19 organic solvents to water. The root-mean-square errors for neutral compounds and ions were 0.82 and 1.61 kcal/mol, respectively. Quantification of energy components demonstrates the dominant roles of hydrophobic effect for nonpolar atoms and of hydrogen-bonding for polar atoms. The estimated first solvation shell energy outweighs the long-range electrostatics for most compounds including ions. The simplicity and computational efficiency of the model allows its application for modeling of macromolecules in anisotropic environments, such as biological membranes.", "paper_title": "Anisotropic Solvent Model of the Lipid Bilayer. 1.
