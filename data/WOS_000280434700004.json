In this paper we address the security and privacy requirements for a secure coexistence proofs protocol on RFID tags to defend against tag privacy divulgence, forward secrecy disclosure, denial-of-proof (DoP) attack, and authentication sequence disorder. Along with these design criterions, a recent published secure proofs protocol [11] is evaluated to identify the demand area for security enhancement. To overcome found security weaknesses, tag privacy divulgence and the new known DoP attack in previous proofs schemes, we introduce three anonymous coexistence proofs protocols. According to our security and performance analyses, the proposed protocols possess all required security properties with the same complexity order of the clumping-proofs protocol on computation cost.", "paper_title": "Anonymous Coexistence Proofs for RFID Tags", "paper_id": "WOS:000280434700004"}
