Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology, the prototype consumes 25.2 and 22.8-mW from 1.2-V supply and root-mean-square jitter of the recovered clock was measured to be 7.2 and 8.5-ps for 6-Gbps mesochronous system and plesiochronous system, respectively. For both operation modes, less than 10(-12) bit-error-rate was achieved with 2(7)-1 pseudo-random binary sequence pattern and active area of the implemented CDR circuit is 0.025-mm(2).", "paper_title": "A 6-Gbps dual-mode digital clock and data recovery circuit in a 65-nm CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000360664400019"}
