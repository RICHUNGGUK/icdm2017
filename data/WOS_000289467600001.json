Altitude measurements are obtained from GPS receivers utilizing both GPS-based and barometric altitude data, with data averaging used to reduce fluctuations. The estimation process is sensitive to the degree of averaging, and is related to the well-known question of determining coastline length. Barometric-based measurements prove more reliable, due to their insensitivity to GPS altitude fluctuations.", "paper_title": "EVALUATING CUMULATIVE ASCENT: MOUNTAIN BIKING MEETS MANDELBROT", "paper_id": "WOS:000289467600001"}
