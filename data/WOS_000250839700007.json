We support this approach on three concepts: Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS), a tool able to collect and manage explicit decisional knowledge; Decisional DNA, a structure for decisional knowledge akin to human DNA; and a group of ontologies for ubiquitous applications called SOUPA (Standard Ontology for Ubiquitous and Pervasive Applications). The SOUPA is extended with the Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS), enhancing the decisional experience used to assemble Decisional DNA with ontology characteristics for ubiquitous and pervasive applications. Additionally, we propose a SOEKS Java class created for the support and easy implementation of applications using the extended SOUPA which will allows the construction of a Decisional DNA repository useful within many different intelligent systems and platforms.", "paper_title": "Towards the construction of decisional DNA: A set of experience knowledge structure java class within an ontology system", "paper_id": "WOS:000250839700007"}
