The dynamic two-tier cell structure determines the reservation and non-reservation zones according to the speed of MHs. The handoff probability is calculated using the moving speed and the direction of MHs.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Two-Tier Cell Structure for Bandwidth Reservation of Handoffs in Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400600041"}
