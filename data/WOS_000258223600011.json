We derive a pre-filter for evaluating the illumination integral yielding filtered importance sampling, a simple GPU-based rendering algorithm for image-based lighting. Furthermore, we extend the algorithm with real-time visibility computation. Free from any pre-computation, the algorithm supports fully dynamic scenes and, above all, is simple to implement.", "paper_title": "Real-time shading with filtered importance sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000258223600011"}
