The formulation has been derived through an extended Noether's theorem and the bond graphs. An additional time-like variable has been used which is termed an umbra and this notation was appended to all kinds of energies and the Lagrangian itself. We extend Lagrangian-Hamiltonian mechanics to deal with asymmetries in the system, which incorporates dissipative and non-potential fields. The gauge-functions have been used to symmetrize the umbra-Lagrangian of the system. Several new examples have been incorporated to elucidate the concept. The first example presents the complex gauge functions for a radiation thermal system, where a mass of ice is heated by the radiation process. The conservation law for such a system is obtained. In the second example, gauge functions for the system with time-varying stiffness are considered, which clearly expresses the usefulness of the umbra-Lagrangian method. In another example, gauge functions for a control system have been obtained, which shows the applicability of the method in different energy domains.", "paper_title": "Conservation laws for a gauge-variant umbra-Lagrangian in classical mechanics using bond graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000289161600002"}
