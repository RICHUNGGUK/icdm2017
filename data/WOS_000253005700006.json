Let s be a vertex designated as a source, k be a positive integer, and S subset of V be a set of terminals. The capacitated multicast tree routing problem (CMTR) asks to find a partition {Z(1), Z(2), . . . , Z(l)} of S and a set {T-1, T-2, . . . , T-l} of trees of G such that Z(i) consists of at most k terminals and each Ti spans Z(i) boolean OR {s}. The objective is to minimize Sigma(l)(i=1) w(T-i), where w(T-i) denotes the sum of weights of all edges in T-i. In this paper, we propose a (3/2 + (4/3)rho)-approximation algorithm to the CMTR, where rho is the best achievable approximation ratio for the Steiner tree problem. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
