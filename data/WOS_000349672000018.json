The use of formal semantic descriptions of service interfaces and functionalities enable automated reasoning over service compositions. The growing challenge of finding effective methods to satisfy non-functional QoS requirements of customers exacerbates the composition problem. Fuzzy reasoning provides an effective means to represent QoS concepts that are vague or approximate thus providing a flexible best-match service query scheme. This paper presents a new fuzzy-induced, semantic-similarity-based service-specific overlay network composition over a hybrid service overlay network. The presented composition method allows for efficient, accurate, and QoS-aware component service discovery, composition, and execution. We demonstrate that our approach provides better performance and reduced composition delay when compared to other service-composition solutions.", "paper_title": "QoS-Based Composition of Service Specific Overlay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000349672000018"}
