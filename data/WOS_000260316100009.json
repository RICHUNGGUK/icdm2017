In this paper, we present a novel approach to distribute high-resolution images to multiple tiled displays in real-time using a high-performance PC cluster. This approach allows users to share their visualization applications and videos on multiple tiled displays, repositioning and resizing each application window independently. These operations require high-resolution image multicasting from a rendering cluster to multiple display clusters. A high-performance bridging system called SAGE Bridge performs the image multicasting on a high-performance PC cluster. We show in several experiments that this system enables sharing of high-resolution scientific animations and high-definition videos (with audio) between multiples international sites, hence creating virtual research laboratories (i.e. virtual organizations), as observed in a figure given in this article.
