We also establish and prove the basis transformation between the GJPs basis and Bernstein basis and vice versa. This transformation embeds the perfect least-square performance of the GJPs with the geometrical insight of the Bernstein form. Moreover, the GJPs with indexes corresponding to the number of endpoint constraints are the natural basis functions for least-square approximation of Bezier curves and surfaces. Application to multidegree reduction (MDR) of Bezier curves and surfaces in computer aided geometric design (CAGD) is given.", "paper_title": "On Generalized Jacobi-Bernstein Basis Transformation: Application of Multidegree Reduction of Bezier Curves and Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000344473500010"}
