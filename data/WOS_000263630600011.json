The two systems without mutual interaction are independently coupled to different two-band non-Markovian environments. By comparing our results to others in the literature, we find that taking one of the Bell states as the initial state, certain non-Markovian effect protects the entanglement in short time scale, while on long time scale it leads to the entanglement sudden death (ESD), which never occurs for this initial state in the Markovian case. Finally, by analyzing the parameters in our model, a relation between disentanglement and decoherence is established and discussed.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT EVOLUTION OF A PAIR OF TWO-LEVEL SYSTEMS IN NON-MARKOVIAN ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000263630600011"}
