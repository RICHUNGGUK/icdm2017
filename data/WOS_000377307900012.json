For the first time, a novel estimation framework is proposed for fast time-varying channels. The noise variances and channel are jointly estimated via the maximum a posteriori (MAP) expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. By considering in the EM formulation the channel as the unwanted parameter and the noise variances as the parameters to be estimated, a closed-form analytical expression for the estimation of the noise variances is obtained; the channel being given by the Kalman smoother. Mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER) simulations confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the approach against mobility and its adequacy for practical interference scenarios.", "paper_title": "Fast Time-Varying Channel Estimation for OFDM Systems With Narrowband Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000377307900012"}
