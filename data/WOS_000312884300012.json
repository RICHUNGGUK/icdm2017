In the past few years, fault-based logic coverage criteria have been studied intensively both in theory and in practice. However, there is a lack of authentic evidence of the comparison of fault-based logic coverage criteria with other logic coverage criteria, such as branch coverage and modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC). In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study that compares these logic coverage criteria on test case prioritization, which is currently a hot topic in software testing. Several useful conclusions are drawn from our research: (1) Fine-grained coverage criteria are always more effective and efficient. (2) The effectiveness of fault-based logic coverage criteria is not significantly different from that of MC/DC in terms of statistics, but the former is more stable. (3) A random strategy is more effective than branch coverage if a certain number of test cases are redundant.", "paper_title": "Comparing logic coverage criteria on test case prioritization", "paper_id": "WOS:000312884300012"}
