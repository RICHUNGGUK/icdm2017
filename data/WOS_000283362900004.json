Firstly, based on the structural characteristic of the nonlinear Hamiltonian descriptor system, an equivalent nonlinear dissipative Hamiltonian differential-algebraic system is obtained by using restricted system equivalent theory. With the dissipative form, the stabilization problem is then discussed for the nonlinear Hamiltonian descriptor systems, and an H (a) controller is designed. Finally, simulations on a nonlinear circuit system are given.", "paper_title": "H infinity control of a class of nonlinear Hamiltonian descriptor systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283362900004"}
