In this paper, a novel methodology is proposed for detecting and trending events from tweet clusters that are discovered by using locality sensitive hashing (ISH) technique. Key challenges include: (1) construction of dictionary using incremental term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) in high-dimensional data to create tweet feature vector, (2) leveraging LSH to find truly interesting events, (3) trending the behavior of event based on time, geo-locations and cluster size, and (4) speed-up the cluster-discovery process while retaining the cluster quality. Experiments are conducted for a specific event and the clusters discovered using LSH and K-means are compared with group average agglomerative clustering technique. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
