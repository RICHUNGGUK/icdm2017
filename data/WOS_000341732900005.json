There is only one player for each hierarchical level: there is an upper level leader (player L0), an intermediate level leader (player L1) who acts as a follower for L0 and as a leader for the lower level player (player F) that is the sole actual follower of this situation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a computational result via GA approach. The idea of the Stackelberg-GA is to bring together GAs and Stackelberg strategy in order to process a GA to build the Stackelberg strategy. Any player acting as a follower makes his decision at each step of the evolutionary process, playing a simple optimization problem whose solution is supposed to be unique. Findings - A GA procedure to compute the Stackelberg equilibrium of the three-level hierarchical problem is given. An application to a Authority-Provider-User (APU) model in the context of wireless networks is discussed. The algorithm convergence is illustrated by means of some test cases. Research limitations/implications - The solution to each level of hierarchy is supposed to be unique. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates the possibility of using computational procedures based on GAs in hierarchical three level decision problems extending previous results obtained in the classical two level case.", "paper_title": "Three level hierarchical decision making model with GA", "paper_id": "WOS:000341732900005"}
