The language features values and datatypes that extend XML documents and schemas with channels, an expressive type system with subtyping, a pattern matching mechanism for deconstructing XML values, and control constructs that are based on Milner's asynchronous pi calculus. The runtime environment supports the execution of PiDuce processes over networks by relying on state-of-the-art technologies, such as XML schema and WSDL, thus enabling interoperability with existing Web services. We thoroughly describe the PiDuce project: the programming language and its semantics, the architecture of the distributed runtime and its implementation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
