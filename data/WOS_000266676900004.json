The scheme is applied to the computation of several inviscid and viscous compressible flows governed by the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Its efficiency and accuracy properties are compared with those of conventional second-order upwind schemes based on variable reconstruction. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
