The aim of this system is to realize automatic and intelligent design of turntable. Utilizing the parametric design method, a knowledge-base composed of parameterized 3D product models is first constructed. All the corresponding design specifications or parameters are then saved in a data-base. Taking advantages of the CBR methodology, a most similar case can be easily retrieved from the pre-built design knowledge-base and case-base when a new design task comes. Only with a few revisions, the modified design can mostly satisfy the new design requirements to fulfill a new design and can be further saved as a new case into the database. The design system is built as a module embedded in Pro/ENGINNER 3.0. It contains a turntable case-base, a design knowledge-base, a CAD software and a graphic user interface. Now this system is on a trial operation in a ship institute, the result shows that it can enhance the design efficiency and reduce the design time and cost. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
