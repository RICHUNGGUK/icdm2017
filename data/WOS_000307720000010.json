Therefore, a fast dynamic image stabilization precision test system for an optical image-stable device is developed. A large-aperture collimator with a designed cross divisional board is used to simulate the infinity goal. The image-stable device is installed on the motion simulator with six degrees of freedom which is used to simulate the moving state of the device. The CCD camera installed behind the eyepiece lens of the image-stable device acquires images rapidly and in real time. The local energy maxima center of the cross light spot can be acquired accurately through the proposed algorithm using the Hessian matrix. In addition, to deal with the CCD non-uniformity, an adaptive non-uniformity correction algorithm based on bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition is provided. The actual test results for the proposed method show that the test error of dynamic image stabilization is less than 0.7aEuro(3), and the time for the frame image acquisition and processing is less than 10 ms, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the test system.", "paper_title": "Dynamic image stabilization precision test system based on the Hessian matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000307720000010"}
