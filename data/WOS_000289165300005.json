One major benefit of the self-healing key distribution mechanism is the reduction of energy consumption due to the elimination of such additional transmission. Also in some applications, e.g., uni-directional broadcast channel from the GM, the self-healing key distribution mechanism seems to be the ideal solution. Desired features of self-healing key distribution schemes include energy awareness, short broadcast message, efficient users addition, revocation and so on. A primary challenge is managing the trade-off between providing an acceptable level of security and conserving scarce resources in particular energy which is critical for wireless network operations. Over a decade, a great number of self-healing key distribution schemes have been proposed for establishing a group key amongst a dynamic group of users over an unreliable, or lossy, network. In this paper a comprehensive survey is conducted on the state-of-the-art in the field of self-healing key distribution. First, we clarify the security requirements of self-healing key distribution scheme for their special application environment. Then, we present a classification of self-healing key distribution schemes according to different cryptographic primitives, and give an insight to their features and goals. Furthermore, we consider several problems, namely authentication on broadcast messages, sponsorization and mutual-healing, related to the robustness of self-healing key distribution schemes. At last, we delineate their similarities and differences and outline several future research directions.", "paper_title": "Self-Healing Key Distribution Schemes for Wireless Networks: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000289165300005"}
