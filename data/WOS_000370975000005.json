It is shown that the bistability and multistability in the strong-coupling regime are gradually generated or eliminated by properly adjusting the coupling strength or the amplitude of the input pump laser. The proposed system serves as a good candidate for the diverse control optical switch and the potential applications.", "paper_title": "The multistability in the coupled semiconductor microcavities", "paper_id": "WOS:000370975000005"}
