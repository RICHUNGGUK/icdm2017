Let Psi(n,m) be the set of the (n, m)-graphs, where n and m are the numbers of vertices and edges, respectively. With the aid of the new method, the graphs with the minimum matching energy in Psi(n,m) are deduced for three cases, namely unicyclic and bipartite unicyclic graphs (m = n), bicyclic graphs (m = n + 1), and cactus graphs, where a cactus is a graph with all of its blocks being either edges or cycles.", "paper_title": "On Minimum Matching Energy of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000361847100014"}
