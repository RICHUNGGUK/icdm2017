The purpose of this paper is to survey the known results in the area and to present an interleaved construction of binary low correlation zone sequences. The interleaved construction unifies many constructions currently available in the literature. These sequences are useful in quasi synchronous code division multiple access (QS COMA) communication systems.", "paper_title": "Low Correlation Zone Sequences from Interleaved Construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000284448800046"}
