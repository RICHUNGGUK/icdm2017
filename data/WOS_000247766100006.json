The behaviour of such an automaton is a mapping, called a formal power series, assigning to each word a weight in some semiring. We generalize Buchi's and Elgot's fundamental theorems to this quantitative setting. We introduce a weighted version of MSO logic and prove that, for commutative semirings, the behaviours of weighted automata are precisely the formal power series definable with particular sentences of our weighted logic. We also consider weighted first-order logic and show that aperiodic series coincide with the first-order definable ones, if the semiring is locally finite, commutative and has some aperiodicity property.
