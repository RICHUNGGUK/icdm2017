A vertex set S subset of V is a paired-dominating set if every vertex in V - S has at least one neighbor in S and the induced subgraph G vertical bar S vertical bar has a perfect matching. In this paper, we present a linear-time algorithm to find a minimum paired-dominating set in strongly chordal graphs if the strong (elimination) ordering of the graph is given in advance.
