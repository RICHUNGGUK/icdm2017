It has been shown by Prieur that it can be decided whether such a function is continuous. We prove here that surprisingly, it cannot be decided whether such a function f has at least one point of continuity and that its continuity set C(f) cannot be computed. In the case of a synchronous rational function, we show that its continuity set is rational and that it can be computed. Furthermore we prove that any rational Pi(0)(2)-subset of Sigma(omega) for some alphabet Sigma is the continuity set C(f) of an omega-rational synchronous function f defined on Sigma(omega).", "paper_title": "On the continuity set of an omega rational function", "paper_id": "WOS:000252463900013"}
