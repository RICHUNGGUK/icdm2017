To make intrusion detection systems adaptive to changing environments, supervised learning techniques had been applied in intrusion detection. However, supervised learning needs a large amount of training instances to obtain classifiers with high accuracy. Limited to lack of high quality labeled instances, some researchers focused on semi-supervised learning to utilize unlabeled instances enhancing classification. But involving the unlabeled instances into the learning process also introduces vulnerability: attackers can generate fake unlabeled instances to mislead the final classifier so that a few intrusions can not be detected. In this paper we show that the attacker could mislead the semi-supervised intrusion detection classifier by poisoning the unlabeled instances. And we propose a defend method based on active learning to defeat the poisoning attack. Experiments show that the poisoning attack can reduce the accuracy of the semi-supervised learning classifier and the proposed defending method based on active learning can obtain higher accuracy than the original semi-supervised learner under the presented poisoning attack.", "paper_title": "ACTIVE LEARNING TO DEFEND POISONING ATTACK AGAINST SEMI-SUPERVISED INTRUSION DETECTION CLASSIFIER", "paper_id": "WOS:000209497000007"}
