NAREGI also aims to lead the way in standardization of grid middle-ware, based on the OGSA architecture. Its super-scheduler is based on the proposed OGSA-EMS Architecture, in that it becomes the first working implementation that implements the documented component relationships within the OGSA-EA11S architecture document v.1.0. Through the efforts and experience in the design and implementation, it has been confirmed that the documented OGSA-EMS architecture is quite feasible, but will require significant amount of refinement and speed improvements to finalize its detailed specifications. The super-scheduler also supports co-allocation across multiple sites to support automated execution of grid-based MPIs that execute across machines. Such a resource allocation requires sophisticated interactions between the OGSA-EMS components not covered in the current OGSA-EMS architecture, some of which are non-trivial. Overall, job scheduling with OGSA-EMS has proven to not only work, but also that its job allocation and execution time is within reasonable bounds.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of NAREGI SuperScheduler based on the OGSA architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000239255200009"}
