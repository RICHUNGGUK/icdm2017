This drives a significant demand for provisioning broadband Internet services in high-speed trains. In this article, we propose a novel solution named RADIATE for high-speed train communications. RADIATE utilizes cellular networks as backhauls to avoid the expensive capital expenditure in provisioning broadband Internet services in high-speed trains. RADIATE, by applying radio over fiber, deploys on-roof antennas and optimally operates these antennas to address the drawbacks of utilizing cellar networks as backhauls. Thus, RADIATE provides a cost-effective and high-quality communications solution for provisioning broadband Internet services in high-speed trains.", "paper_title": "RADIATE: RADIO OVER FIBER AS AN ANTENNA EXTENDER FOR HIGH-SPEED TRAIN COMMUNICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000351372600018"}
