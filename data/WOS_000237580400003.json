Conventional redundancy-based fault tolerance and adaptive approaches are not appropriate because of the tremendous system cost (fault tolerance is limited to a maximum of 10% overhead). In this work, we developed a framework for building robust embedded systems, which utilizes an autonomic reflex-healing approach to achieve fault tolerance. Components of the framework implement user-defined failure adaptation strategies within the context of a large-scale embedded environment. The tools embrace a model-based approach combining design specification and code-generation for both simulation and system implementation. In this paper we present the concepts and entities of the reflex and healing framework.", "paper_title": "Modeling reflex-healing autonomy for large-scale embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237580400003"}
