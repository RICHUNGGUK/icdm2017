In this new scenario, the educational environments, despite having many benefits and facilities with regard to teaching and learning, have problems and challenges that need to be addressed. One of the important aspects to be investigated concerns the establishment and adoption of architectural patterns. In fact, most of these environments are built in an isolated form, having their own architectures and structures, which may negatively impact the ability of standardization and support of architectural definition. The main goal of this paper is to investigate and define a service-oriented reference architecture for m-learning environments. The proposed architecture, named Ref-mLearning, aims to contribute to the evolution, reuse, and interoperability of such environments, enabling an increase in quality and cost reduction during their development, due to the use of features provided by service-oriented architecture. Ref-mLearning was also evaluated through qualitative and quantitative aspects: 1) in comparison with a reference architecture model and 2) with the support of specialists. The results showed that the proposed architecture comprises relevant elements with respect to a service-oriented reference architecture.", "paper_title": "A Contribution to the Establishment of Reference Architectures for Mobile Learning Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000372658300006"}
