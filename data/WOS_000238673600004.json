It is well known that any oriented matroid having no coloops; has a totally cyclic reorientation, a reorientation in which every signed cocircuit B = {B+,B-} satisfies B+, B- not equal phi. We show that, for some reorientation, every signed cocircuit satisfies l/f(r) <= vertical bar B+vertical bar/vertical bar B-vertical bar <= f(r), where f (r) <= 14 r(2) ln(r), and r is the rank of the oriented matroid. In geometry, this problem corresponds to bounding the discrepancies (in ratio) that occur among the Radon partitions of a dependent set of vectors. For graphs, this result corresponds to bounding the chromatic number of a connected graph by a function of its Betti number (corank) vertical bar E vertical bar-vertical bar V vertical bar + 1.", "paper_title": "Balanced signings and the chromatic number of oriented matroids", "paper_id": "WOS:000238673600004"}
