In this paper, we propose to tackle the joint routing and admission control problem for the IP traffic flows in MPLS networks with multiconstrained end-to-end QoS. We propose a mathematical programming model for this problem that includes end-to-end delay and packet loss constraints. These constraints are imposed not only for the new traffic flow, but also for all already admitted flows in the network. Three objective functions are proposed and analyzed: the end-to-end delay, the end-to-end packet loss and the cost of the path used by the new flow. Numerical results show that considering end-to-end delay and packet loss constraints for all flows has a small impact on the flow blocking rate, but improves significantly the end-to-end QoS parameters. Moreover, the proposed approach is able to make the decision to admit or not a new flow in less than 270 ms of computational time. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
