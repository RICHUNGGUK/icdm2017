Recently, using fast algorithms for computing the linear complexity and the k-error linear complexity of 2(n)-periodic binary sequences, Meidl determined the counting function and expected value for the 1-error linear complexity of 2(n)-periodic binary sequences. In this paper, we study the linear complexity and the 1-error linear complexity of 2(n)-periodic binary sequences. Some interesting properties of the linear complexity and the 1-error linear complexity of 2(n)-periodic binary sequences are obtained. Using these properties, we characterize the 2(n)-periodic binary sequences with fixed 1-error linear complexity. Along the way, we obtain a new approach to derive the counting function for the 1-error linear complexity of 2(n)-periodic binary sequences. Finally, we give new fast algorithms for computing the 1-error linear complexity and locating the error positions for 2(n)-periodic binary sequences.", "paper_title": "The characterization of 2(n)-periodic binary sequences with fixed 1-error linear complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000008"}
