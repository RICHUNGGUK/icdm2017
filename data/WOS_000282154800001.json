Based on the contact density model for the computation of shear transfer across cracks, an open-slip coupled model was developed for simulating three-dimensional bond behavior for reinforcing bars in concrete. A parameter study was performed and verified by simulating pull-out experiments of extremely different boundary conditions: short bar embedment with a huge concrete cover, extremely long bar embedment with a huge concrete cover, embedded aluminum bar and short bar embedded length with an insufficient concrete cover. The bar strain effect and splitting of the concrete cover on a local bond can be explained by finite element (FE) analysis. The analysis shows that the strain effect results from a large local slip and the splitting effect of a large opening of the interface. Finally, the sensitivity of rebar geometry was also checked by FE analysis and implies that the open-slip coupled model can be extended to the case of plain bar.", "paper_title": "Open-slip coupled model for simulating three-dimensional bond behavior of reinforcing bars in concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000282154800001"}
