A comprehensive comparison of two representation approaches (global and local), three types of features (grey levels, PCA and LBP), three classifiers (1-NN, PCA + LDA and SVM) and two performance measures (CCR and d') is provided over single- and cross-database experiments. Experiments revealed some interesting findings, which were supported by three non-parametric statistical tests: when training and test sets contain different types of faces, local models using the 1-NN rule outperform global approaches, even those using SVM classifiers; however, with the same type of faces, even if the acquisition conditions are diverse, the statistical tests could not reject the null hypothesis of equal performance of global SVMs and local 1-NN5.
