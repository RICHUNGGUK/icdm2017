Although it is possible to use domain-expert knowledge on the car racing, it is not trivial to represent the knowledge into controllers and tune the parameters for them. Therefore, it is natural to adopt machine learning approach into the knowledge-oriented controllers to enhance their performance and minimize tedious parameter tunings. In this paper, we try to enhance our own heuristic controllers using machine learning models which decide the appropriate parameters of the heuristic controllers given the current sensory inputs. At first, we predict the desired speed only using the equations derived by the linear regression analysis for the both curved and straight track segments. Because the decision on reducing speed before the corner is more complex than the one in the straight line and the corners, it is necessary to use a non-linear model such as artificial neural networks. Secondly, the linear regression and artificial neural networks are specialized to predict desired speed in different situations. Experimental results on TORCS-based car racing simulations show that the combination of the two machine learning algorithms with the heuristic outperforms other alternatives (heuristic only, heuristic+linear regression, and heuristic+artificial neural networks).
