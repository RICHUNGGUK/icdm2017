In theory, the objective is usually to optimise some classical system performance measures such as makespan, tardiness/earliness and flowtime under deterministic and static assumptions. In practice, however, scheduling systems operate in dynamic and stochastic environments. Hence, there is a need to incorporate both uncertainty and dynamic elements into the scheduling process. In this paper, the major issues involved in scheduling decisions are discussed and the basic approaches to tackle these problems in manufacturing environments are analysed. Proactive scheduling is then focused on and several robustness and stability measures are presented. Previous research on scheduling robustness and stability is also reviewed and further research directions are suggested.", "paper_title": "Hedging production schedules against uncertainty in manufacturing environment with a review of robustness and stability research", "paper_id": "WOS:000262860500005"}
