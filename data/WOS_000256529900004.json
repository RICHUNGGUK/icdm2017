Fault effects received by the scan flipflops are shifted out while shifting in the next test vector like scan testing. Unlike deterministic testing, it is unnecessary to apply a complete test vector to the scan chains. A new scan-based BIST scheme is proposed by properly controlling the test signals of the scan chains. Different biased random values are assigned to the test signals of scan flip-flops in separate scan chains. Capture cycles can be inserted at any clock cycle if necessary. A new testability estimation procedure according to the proposed testing scheme is presented. A greedy procedure is proposed to select a weight for each scan chain. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve test effectiveness of scan-based BIST greatly, and most circuits can obtain complete fault coverage or very close to complete fault coverage.", "paper_title": "Scan BIST with biased scan test signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000256529900004"}
