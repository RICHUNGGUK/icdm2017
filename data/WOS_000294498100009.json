Some solutions for the key problem are presented in order to apply in an actual bearing-only engineering system. They include sensor technology, measurement pretreatment technology, association gate technology, data association technology, state filtering technology, etc. The premise of these new approaches is designing an effective sensor system which can reliably search and track targets in a large range. Then, it is important to improve the confirming efficiency of the real target and limit false track overextension with the dense clutter. Then, tracking processing needs a precise target initialization information and association information between the existing target and isolated measurement. At the same time, the threat level of the bearing-only target needs to be estimated based on limited bearing-only information. Finally, aiming at unrecognized model and complex maneuvering motion for bearing-only target in polar coordinates, an effective approach of state filtering algorithm with appropriate computation cost will be given. The application of the proposed approach in an actual engineering system proves its effectiveness and practicability.", "paper_title": "Research on tracking of maneuvering multi-target based on bionics for IRST system", "paper_id": "WOS:000294498100009"}
