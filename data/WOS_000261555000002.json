Knowledge processing in complex intelligent systems faces new challenges from the increased number of applications and environment, such as the requirements of representing domain and human knowledge in intelligent systems, and discovering actionable knowledge on a large scale in distributed web applications. In this paper, we discuss the main challenges of, and promising approaches to, intelligence metasynthesis and knowledge processing in open complex intelligent systems. We believe (1) ubiquitous intelligence, including data intelligence, domain intelligence, human intelligence, network intelligence and social intelligence, is necessary for OCIS, which needs to be meta-synthesized; and (2) knowledge processing should pay more attention to developing innovative and workable methodologies, techniques, tools and systems for representing, modelling, transforming, discovering and servicing the uncertain, large-scale, deep, distributed, domain-oriented, human-involved, and actionable knowledge highly expected in constructing open complex intelligent systems. To this end, the meta-synthesis of ubiquitous intelligence is an appropriate way in designing complex intelligent systems. To support intelligence meta-synthesis, m-interaction can play as the working mechanism to form m-spaces as problem-solving systems. In building such m-spaces, advancement in knowledge processing is necessary.", "paper_title": "Intelligence Metasynthesis and Knowledge Processing in Intelligent Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000261555000002"}
