All incoming and outgoing packets have to pass through the firewall via several different layers. Gamage, Leiwo, and Zheng have studied the verification of message authentication in the firewall application layer on the basis of digital signcryption. Encrypted message authentication by fircwall has been proposed to verify the signature without disclosing the messages. It preserves confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, and authenticity of the messages. In this paper, we propose a more efficient scheme than the Gamage-Leiwo-Zheng scheme for firewall. The computational costs of signing and verifying using the proposed scheme significantly reduce to more than 92% and 86%\" in comparision to those of the Gamage-Leiwo-Zheng scheme.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Blind Verifying for Firewall Using Online/Offline Signcryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000307426400009"}
