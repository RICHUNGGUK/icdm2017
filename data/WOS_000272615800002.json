It also takes the position that interval type-2 fuzzy sets, and not type-1 fuzzy sets, should be used in perceptual computing. Finally, it proposes some testable guidelines for when a solution (e.g., perceptual computing) may be branded computing with words.", "paper_title": "Historical reflections and new positions on perceptual computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000272615800002"}
