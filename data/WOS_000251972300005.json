The error performance is optimized by transforming the non-unitary space-time code into unitary space-time code. By exploiting the desired structure of the proposed code, a grouped generalized likelihood ratio test decoding algorithm is presented to overcome the high complexity of the optimal algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed code possesses high spectrum efficiency in contrast to the unitary space-time code despite slight loss in the SNR, and besides, the proposed grouped decoding algorithm provides good tradeoff between performance and complexity.", "paper_title": "Non-coherent space-time code based on full diversity space-time block coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000251972300005"}
