A method is presented for computing ACI and deriving capacity limitation. This method is based on an interference analysis that accounts for shadow fading, and random distribution of mobile users. The results indicate that both the base station (BS) separation and adjacent channel interference power ratio (ACIR) strongly affect system capacity reduction. The proposed method in this paper is useful for measuring the impacts of ACI on uplink capacity.
