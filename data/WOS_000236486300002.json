MLP networks are used to model the nonlinear unmixing mapping. Learning is guided by a denoising function which uses prior knowledge about the sparsity of the edges in images. The main benefit of the method is that it is simple and computationally efficient. Separation results on a real-world image mixture proved to be comparable to those achieved with MISEP.", "paper_title": "Separation of nonlinear image mixtures by denoising source separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300002"}
