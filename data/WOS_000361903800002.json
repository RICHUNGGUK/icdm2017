In contrast to standard control systems, there has been much less reported on applications where the multidimensional setting is the only possible setting for design or produces implementations that perform to at least the same level. This paper addresses the latter area where case studies focusing on control law design and evaluation, including experimental results in one case, are reported. These demonstrate that movement towards the actual deployment of multidimensional control systems is increasing.", "paper_title": "Multidimensional control systems: case studies in design and evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000361903800002"}
