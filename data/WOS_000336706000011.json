In this paper, some operations of clouds and several new aggregation operators are proposed. These include the cloud weighted arithmetic averaging (CWAA) operator, cloud-ordered weighted arithmetic averaging (COWA) operator, and cloud hybrid arithmetic (CHA) operator. The conversion between linguistic variables and clouds is introduced. Based on this conversion, a linguistic multi-criteria group decision-making method is developed. In this method, linguistic variables are first converted into clouds and then aggregated using cloud aggregation operators. The proposed method is then compared to the existing methods to confirm its feasibility and rationality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
