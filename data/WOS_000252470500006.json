Based on the joint optimization of physical layer and data link layer, an optimization model is derived to achieve efficient and fair downlink data scheduling in multi-user OFDM wireless networks by maximizing the total utility function with respect to the average waiting time of user queue. A dynamic sub-carrier allocation algorithm (DSAA) based on the optimization model is proposed in order to obtain the maximization of the total scheduling utility. Efficiency is improved by combining DSAA with time scale interference predictor (TSIP) which at large time scales predict ON/OFF period of user data with temporal correlation structure across multiple time scales in multi-user interference environment. Simulation results verify the efficiency and fairness of the scheme.", "paper_title": "Efficiency-aware and fairness-aware joint-layer optimization for downlink data scheduling in OFDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000252470500006"}
