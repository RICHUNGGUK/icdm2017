Wu and Zou proposed image copy detection methods based on elliptical track division and circle division to conquer the problem, respectively. Nevertheless, their methods can only deal with rotations having central cropping, which are cropped to the original image size, but cannot handle common rotation. For the above problem, this paper utilizes image normalization technology and proposes an image copy detection method in the DCT domain with a common rotation tolerance. It uses the signs of the DCT coefficients of the significant region extracted from a normalized image as feature information, by computing and comparing correlation coefficients to decide whether or not an image is a copy. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully solves the common rotation problem.", "paper_title": "ROTATION INVARIANT IMAGE COPY DETECTION USING DCT DOMAIN", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626800005"}
