The problem of pattern matching with L (p) distance is to compute L (p) (i) for every i=1,2,aEuro broken vertical bar,n-m+1. We discuss the problem for d=1,2,a. First, in the case of L (1) matching (pattern matching with an L (1) distance) we show a reduction of the string matching with mismatches problem to the L (1) matching problem and we present an algorithm that approximates the L (1) matching up to a factor of 1+epsilon, which has an O (1/epsilon 2nlogm log vertical bar Sigma vertical bar) run time. Then, the L (2) matching problem (pattern matching with an L (2) distance) is solved with a simple O(nlog m) time algorithm. Finally, we provide an algorithm that approximates the L (a) matching up to a factor of 1+epsilon with a run time of O (1/epsilon 2nlogm log vertical bar Sigma vertical bar). We also generalize the problem of String Matching with mismatches to have weighted mismatches and present an O(nlog (4) m) algorithm that approximates the results of this problem up to a factor of O(log m) in the case that the weight function is a metric.", "paper_title": "Approximate Pattern Matching with the L-1, L-2 and L infinity Metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000288752600008"}
