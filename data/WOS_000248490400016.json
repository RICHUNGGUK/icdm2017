The MIMO systems are composed of n subsystems and each of subsystems is in the nested lower triangular form. It is difficult and complicated to control this class of systems due to the existence of unknown nonaffine functions and the couplings among the nested subsystems. This difficulty is overcome by introducing some special type Lyapunov functions and taking advantage of the mean-value theorem, the backstepping design method and the approximation property of the fuzzy systems. The proposed control approach can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. A simulation experiment is utilized to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach.
