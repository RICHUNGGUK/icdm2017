In this study, the nitro derivatives 1-4 of epoxyethane (ETO) were investigated, and their synthetic possibilities in thermodynamics and thermal stability were predicted. The trigger bond for 1, 2 and 3 is the C-C bond, but for 4 it is the C-NO2 bond. The bond dissociation energies (E(BD)s) were estimated to be 205.40-164.86 kJ mol(-1) and h(50)s were 53-126 cm. E-BD, h(50) and energy gap all decrease from 1 to 4. A linear relationship exists between the strain energy and the number of the NO2 group. Derivative 2 has a zero oxygen balance and possesses the best detonation properties (D=8.77 km s(-1) and P=33.88 GPa) as a single explosive. Derivatives 3 and 4 used as oxidizers in the composite explosives of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) produce very good detonation performance (D=9.36 km s(-1), P = 40.15 GPa and I-s = 281.56 s for 3/RDX, and D=9.45 km s(-1), P=41.04 GPa and I-s=280.34 s for 4/RDX). The intermolecular hydrogen bonding and dispersion interactions of 3/RDX and 4/RDX show that the compatibilities of these composites are acceptable.", "paper_title": "Theoretical studies on the stability, detonation performance and possibility of synthesis of the nitro derivatives of epoxyethane", "paper_id": "WOS:000340869400022"}
