In the FFGN, the fuzzy-filtered reasoning mechanism is proposed to formulate fuzzy rules corresponding to different data characteristics; grey models are used to carry out short-term forecasting corresponding to different rules. A novel hybrid training method is proposed to adaptively update model parameters and improve training efficiency. The effectiveness of the developed FFGN is demonstrated by a series of simulation tests. It is also implemented for material fatigue prognosis. Test results show that the developed FFGN predictor can capture data characteristics effectively and forecast data trend accurately.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy-filtered grey network technique for system state forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000365164400012"}
