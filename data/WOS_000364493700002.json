The system is capable of classifying any percussive sounds produced by the user from an everyday desktop environment, e.g. clapping, snapping, stroking different objects with a pencil, etc., recognizing up to six different classes of drum hits. These different types of user-generated sounds will subsequently be associated to predefined drumkit sounds, resulting in a natural and intuitive audio interface for drummers and percussionists, which only requires a computer with a built-in microphone. A set of audio features and classification techniques are evaluated for the implementation of the aforementioned system.", "paper_title": "Drumkit simulator from everyday desktop objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000364493700002"}
