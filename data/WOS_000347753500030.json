Considering the delay distributions, a novel class of Lyapunov functional is introduced. By exploiting all possible information in mixed time delays, a sufficient condition for the whole system to be mean-square exponentially stable is given. Numerical examples are proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the method, and show that by using the approach in this paper, the obtained results are less conservative than the existing ones.
