In order to avoid full decoding, three fast algorithms that convert block-based discrete cosine transform (BDCT) into wavelet transform are developed, so that wavelet-based features can be extracted from JPEG images as in JPEG2000 images. The first algorithm exploits the similarity between the BDCT and the wavelet packet transform. For the second and third algorithms, the first algorithm or an existing algorithm known as multiresolution reordering is first applied to obtain bandpass subbands at fine scales and the lowpass subband. Then for the subbands at the coarse scale, a new filter bank structure is developed to reduce the mismatch in low frequency features. Compared with the extraction based on full decoding, there is more than 72% reduction in computational complexity. Retrieval experiments also show that the three proposed algorithms can achieve higher precision and recall than the multiresolution reordering, especially around the typical range of compression ratio.
