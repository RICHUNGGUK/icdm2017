In this work, we deal with the problem of organizing the network topology into clusters in order to minimize the total energy consumption. The problem is modeled as an Independent Dominating Problem with Connecting requirements. We first present a state-of-the-art on the problems to optimize energy consumption in WSN. Then, we propose a mixed integer linear programming formulation, constructive heuristics, a local search procedure, and a GRASP-based metaheuristic. Results are provided for large scale WSN instances.", "paper_title": "Strategies for designing energy-efficient clusters-based WSN topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000306220300006"}
