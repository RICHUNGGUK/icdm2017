In this project, Cloud Point Extraction (CPE) method was developed for determination of Diazinon in aqueous samples. CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) was used as cationic surfactant to extract and preconcentrate of Diazinon at the same time and the extracted Diazinon was determined by UV spectrophotometery. Taguchi L-9 array was employed for design of experiments to investigate influences of surfactant concentration, salt concentration, temperature and incubation time as effective parameters. According to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) results, the most effective parameter of the process is incubation time. The results show that a surfactant concentration of 10(-5)% (w/v), an incubation time of 30 min, a KI concentration of 10(-6) mol L-1 and a temperature of 35 degrees C are the best operating conditions. Also, the linear calibration graph in the range of 0.02-24 ng ml(-1) of Diazinon with r = 0.999 was obtained. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.02 ng ml(-1) and relative standard deviation (RSD) for 15 ng ml(-1) of Diazinon was 0.76%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
