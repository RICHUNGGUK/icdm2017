This FDS result not only includes the FDS research for the p-center problem, but also extends the case of a < b in the lambda-weights provided by Kalcsics et al. (Kalcsics, J., Nickel, S., Puerto, J. (2003). Multi-facility ordered median problems: A further analysis. Networks, 41(1), 1-12. Furthermore, based on the FDS result, we devise an exact algorithm for the problem. In addition, we present a polynomial time algorithm for the problem with at most three different values in the lambda-weights in tree networks. Finally, we pose an open problem on identifying the existence of a polynomial size FDS for the multi-facility convex ordered median problem in networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
