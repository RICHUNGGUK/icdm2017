Cross-docking simulations have been performed on a number of ligaild-protein complexes for various proteins whose crystal structures contain water molecules in their binding sites. Only common sets of water molecules found in the binding site of the proteins were considered. A statistically significant overall increase in accuracy was observed when water molecules were included ill cross-docking simulations. These results confirm the importance of including water molecules whenever possible in ligand-protein docking simulations.", "paper_title": "Ligand-Protein Cross-Docking with Water Molecules", "paper_id": "WOS:000275858000010"}
