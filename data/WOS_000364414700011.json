This method is based on the idea of the switched evolution/relaxation method which can automatically adapt the step size for different circuit states. Considering the number of iterations needed for the convergence of the Newton-Raphson method, the new method adapts the suitable time-step size with the status of previous steps. By numerical examples, it is proved that this method can improve the simulation efficiency and convergence for the DPTA method to solve nonlinear DC circuits.", "paper_title": "An Effective Time-Step Control Method in Damped Pseudo-Transient Analysis for Solving Nonlinear DC Circuit Equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414700011"}
