Global warming, greenhouse effect, increasing temperature of the whole environment are major concerns regarding to rise in temperature and pollution of the environment of the whole world. No doubt cloud computing is providing basic facility of computing to general community but at the same time it is playing major role in increasing temperature of the whole world and becoming the source of pollution for the environment. In this paper different strategies have been adopted to control this problem. Virtualization technique is being utilized to control the problem of energy consumption and emission of carbon dioxide gas. So many techniques regarding to virtualization like live migration of VM, Dynamic Resource Allocation of different resources, virtualization of network resources like routers, routing protocols, virtualization of hardware resources like server, storage, memory and other devices. An effort is being exercised to reduce the problem of carbon emission and energy consumption of cloud computing to large extent.", "paper_title": "Cloud Computing and its Environmental Effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000366967700027"}
