However, as RFID is being integrated into legacy systems like Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and low-cost RFID readers are becoming more and more popular for their cost-savings, the security between RFID readers and backend servers should be further examined. Lo et al. proposed an efficient reader-server authenticated key agreement scheme to meet the requirement. However, we find several fatal security weaknesses in Lo et al.'s scheme. In this paper, we reveal these weaknesses and propose two new schemes to improve security, computational performance, and communication. We provide two efficient solutions: one is for a single domain without a trusted third party, and the other is for multi-domains where a trusted third party is required. These merits make our solution more suitable and flexible for practical applications.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT AND SCALABLE KEY AGREEMENT SCHEMES FOR MOBILE RFID READERS AND SERVERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000285273700011"}
