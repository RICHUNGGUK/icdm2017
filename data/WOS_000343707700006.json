Although various methods of stroke correspondence have been proposed, no comparative study for clarifying the relative superiority of those methods has been done before. In this paper, we firstly review the approaches for solving the stroke-order variation problem. Then, five representative methods of stroke correspondence proposed by different groups, including cube search (CS), bipartite weighted matching (BWM), individual correspondence decision (ICD), stable marriage (SM), and deviation-expansion model (DE), are experimentally compared, mainly in regard of recognition accuracy and efficiency. The experimental results on an online Kanji character dataset, showed that 99.17%, 99.17%, 96.37%, 98.54%, and 96.59% were attained by CS, BWM, ICD, SM, and DE, respectively as their recognition rates. Extensive discussions are made on their relative superiorities and practicalities.", "paper_title": "Comparative performance analysis of stroke correspondence search methods for stroke-order free online multi-stroke character recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000343707700006"}
