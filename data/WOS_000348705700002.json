They rarely considered the portability between both systems. Taking into consideration the matrix's sparse feature, we propose one portable data transmission strategy. Our proposed algorithm has two advantages, one is that it can be converted between loss system and lossless one easily; the other is that it can reduce the communication requirements further. Simulation results have verified the fusion performance of our proposed method for the loss and lossless occasions. Through the analysis of the saved communication requirements we also show using our algorithm the power at the sensor can be reduced compared with other algorithms.", "paper_title": "The portable distributed fusion algorithm between loss and lossless systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000348705700002"}
