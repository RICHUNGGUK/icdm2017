Most importantly, a robust and efficient secret key management scheme for home network was proposed. The idea behind the proposed method is to introduce a simple public one-way hash function to achieve the above requirements. In addition, the method does not only apply to the GSM system, but also applies to other wireless communication systems.", "paper_title": "A key management for wireless communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400020"}
