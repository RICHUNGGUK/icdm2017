However, little attention has been given to the problem of Web services evolution, with a focus on OWL-S, an ontology of services recently proposed. In this paper, we show that recent work on Temporal RDF can be extended to support versioning of an ontology of services. We introduce a formal model and a query language that allow accessing different versions of an OWL-S specification. We present the language semantics and discuss complexity issues. We show how our proposal can be implemented within the OWL-S framework.", "paper_title": "Version management in semantic Web services using OWL-S", "paper_id": "WOS:000241427500039"}
