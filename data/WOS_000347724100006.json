This article presents an undertaking that reconfigures the instruction of fundamental concepts in ADC by replacing traditional problem-solving approach with a method that relies on a simulation framework comprising of Matlab, USAF DATCOM, and flight simulation software. The typical challenges experienced by students including their inability to visualize complicated, multi-modal aircraft were overcome by the new method thus enhancing the student's learning experience. The implemented approach improved students' motivational belief and its calibration, their use of active learning strategies and actual performance. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
