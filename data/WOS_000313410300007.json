In this paper, we study a variation of this index calculus method, improving the overall asymptotic complexity when . In particular, we are able to successfully obtain relations on , whereas the more expensive computational complexity of Gaudry and Diem's initial algorithm makes it impractical in this case. An important ingredient of this result is a variation of FaugSre's Grobner basis algorithm F4, which significantly speeds up the relation computation. We show how this index calculus also applies to oracle-assisted resolutions of the static Diffie-Hellman problem on these elliptic curves.", "paper_title": "Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem over Small Degree Extension Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000313410300007"}
