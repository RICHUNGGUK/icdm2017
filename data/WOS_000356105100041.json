More precisely, the neuron activation functions are assumed to be more general and satisfy sector-like nonlinearities. Moreover, the effects of both variation range and probability distribution of mixed time-delays are taken into consideration in the proposed problem. The main objective of this paper is to design a state feedback reliable Ho, controller such that for all admissible uncertainties as well as actuator failure cases, the resulting closed-loop form of considered neural network is robustly asymptotically stable while satisfying a prescribed H-infinity performance constraint. Linear matrix inequality approach together with proper construction of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is employed for obtaining delay dependent sufficient conditions for the existence of robust reliable H-infinity controller. The obtained results are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily solved by using the MATLAB LMI toolbox. Finally, a numerical example with simulation results is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained control law and less conservativeness of the proposed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
