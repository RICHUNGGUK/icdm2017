The proposed architecture is a modification of the sliced message passing (SMP) decoding architecture which overlaps the check-node and variable-node update stages, achieving a good tradeoff between area and throughput, and also, high hardware utilization efficiency (HUE). The proposed modification does not affect the performance of the SMP algorithm and yields an area reduction of 33%. As an example, SMP architecture and the proposed modification was synthesized in a 90 nm CMOS process for the 2048-bit LDPC code of the IEEE802.3an standard with 16 iterations achieving a throughput of 5.9 Gbps with 15.3 mm(2) and 6.2 Gbps with 10.2 mm(2), respectively.", "paper_title": "Improved Sliced Message Passing Architecture for High Throughput Decoding of LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000299531400003"}
