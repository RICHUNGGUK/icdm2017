The patching mesh should keep the morphological features of generic teeth and gums while avoiding collision between two adjacent teeth. This paper presents an efficient hole-filling algorithm to reconstruct the missing part of teeth and gums. Our proposed method involves four necessary steps: boundary construction and projection, hole triangulation in 2D, back projection of vertices to 3D, and mesh fairing. By combining constrained Delaunay triangulation in 2D with back projection of vertices to 3D using mean value coordinates, we achieve high robustness of hole triangulation and a high-quality initial patching mesh. In addition, we propose an automatic method to control the deformation degree to avoid collision. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve satisfactory results, not only in morphology, but also in efficiency. The results are very similar to real teeth and gums and can meet the requirements of orthodontics in medicine.", "paper_title": "An efficient and collision-free hole-filling algorithm for orthodontics", "paper_id": "WOS:000319478400012"}
