The motion information of the ROIs is estimated by macro block padding and polygon matching. The derived motion vectors are set as the motion trajectory of the samples to generate a one-dimensional temporal signal. This signal is then filtered to reduce the temporal redundancy using motion compensated temporal filtering for arbitrary shape ROI. Compared to traditional non-ROI coding, the reconstructed quality of the ROI coding can be significantly improved at low bit-rates. The efficiency of motion compensated temporal filtering (MCTF) based on arbitrary ROI is also compared with that of the video object coding in MPEG-4. Based on large number of experiments, the ability of the MCTF to reduce the temporal redundancy is demonstrated as better than (or at least comparable to) that of MPEG-4.
