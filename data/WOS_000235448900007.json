In this paper, we propose a new online distributed gossiping protocol in the multicasting communication environment, where each node knows only its immediate neighbors. We show that the protocol can tolerate multiple node and link faults, mobility of nodes in the network (as long as the network remains connected) and it is more efficient than the a recently proposed protocol.", "paper_title": "An online distributed gossiping protocol for mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235448900007"}
