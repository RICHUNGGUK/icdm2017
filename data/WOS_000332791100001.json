In this paper, we develop improved collision finding techniques which enable us to double this number. More precisely, we can now find within a few minutes on a single PC actual collisions in the standard Keccak-224 and Keccak-256, where the only modification is to reduce their number of rounds to 4. When we apply our techniques to 5-round Keccak, we can get in a few days near collisions, where the Hamming distance is 5 in the case of Keccak-224 and 10 in the case of Keccak-256. Our new attack combines differential and algebraic techniques, and uses the fact that each round of Keccak is only a quadratic mapping in order to efficiently find pairs of messages which follow a high probability differential characteristic. Since full Keccak has 24 rounds, our attack does not threaten the security of the hash function.", "paper_title": "Improved Practical Attacks on Round-Reduced Keccak", "paper_id": "WOS:000332791100001"}
