This study proposes a CS evaluation method for customized product development using Entropy weight and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Firstly, customer requirements are identified based on Voice-of-Customer (VoC), and classified into four categories (positive, negative, must-be and fuzzy attributes) according to the characteristics of CS criteria. Then, CS evaluation model and its solution method are introduced in detail. This study especially focuses on the quantitative methods for each category of the evaluation criteria through formulating several mathematical models, and criteria weights are obtained through integrating Entropy weight and AHP method. Finally, a case study of applying the proposed methodology to customized portrait-based product industry demonstrates the functionality of the proposed methodology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
