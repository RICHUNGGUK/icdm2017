A number of interesting applications for interval graphs have been found in the literature. In order to find structural features common to structural data which can be represented by intervals, this paper proposes new interval graph structured patterns, called linear interval graph patterns, and a polynomial time algorithm for finding a minimally generalized linear interval graph pattern explaining a given finite set of interval graphs.", "paper_title": "A Polynomial Time Algorithm for Finding a Minimally Generalized Linear Interval Graph Pattern", "paper_id": "WOS:000265700800004"}
