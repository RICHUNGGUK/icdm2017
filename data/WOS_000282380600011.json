Misalignment between stacked chips reduces coupling coefficiency of on-chip inductors and increases transmitter power. We proposed a modeling which estimates the increase in transmitter power by considering misalignment as an additional communication distance. Proposed model was verified by electromagnetic simulations and by measurements using testchips fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology. The results calculated by the proposed modeling match well with measurement results. Measurement results show that misalignment tolerance of inductive-coupling link is well high and can be ignored in common conditions.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Experimental Verification of Misalignment Tolerance in Inductive-Coupling Inter-Chip Link for Low-Power 3-D System Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000282380600011"}
