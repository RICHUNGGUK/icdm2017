If the underlying measure rho is a combination of Dirac masses rho = 1/m Sigma(m)(i=1) delta(Zi) then we prove the algorithm converges to a local minimum and a law of large numbers result for a Frechet mean computed by the algorithm given observations drawn iid from rho. We illustrate the convergence of an empirical mean computed by the algorithm to a population mean by simulations from Gaussian random fields.", "paper_title": "Frechet Means for Distributions of Persistence Diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000339382600003"}
