CBD and PLE focus on reusable assets of components and core assets, MDA focuses on transforming reusable models into implementation. Although these approaches are orthogonal, they can be integrated into a comprehensive and extremely effective framework for software development. In this paper, we first present our strategies of integrating CBD, PLE and MDA, and propose an integrated process that adopts reuse engineering and automation paradigm. By applying the proposed approach, it becomes feasible to semiautomatically develop a number of applications in a domain.", "paper_title": "An extreme approach to automating software development with CBD, PLE and MDA integrated", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485900038"}
