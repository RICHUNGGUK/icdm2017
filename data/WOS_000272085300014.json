UN/CEFACT's modeling methodology (UMM) is a Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile for developing B2B processes. The formalisms introduced by UMM's stereotypes facilitate the communication with the software engineers. However, business experts-who usually have a very limited understanding of UML-prefer expressing their thoughts and evaluating the results by plain text descriptions. In this paper, we describe an approach that presents an equivalent of the UMM stereotypes and tagged values in text-based templates called worksheets. This strong alignment allows an integration into a UMM modeling tool and ensures consistency. We show how a specially designed XML-based worksheet definition language allows customization to special needs of certain business domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate how information kept in worksheets may be used for the semi-automatic generation of pattern-based UMM artifacts which are later transformed to web service definition language and business process execution language code.", "paper_title": "B2B Services: Worksheet-Driven Development of Modeling Artifacts and Code", "paper_id": "WOS:000272085300014"}
