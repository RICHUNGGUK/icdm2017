The increasing interest in social network services that are open systems has motivated the need for a reliable trust model that enables practical information sharing and information protection. In this paper, we propose an identity management-based social trust model for solving a sparsity problem and an information leakage. The proposed trust model contributes to increasing the opportunities for information sharing. In addition, the creation and use of identity groups with a clustering approach and partial identities in the proposed approach effectively address security and privacy risks in social networks. In experiments, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using precisionrecall and F-measures.
