In this paper, we address the problem of reconstructing the salient features when filling holes in mesh. It respects fine shape features and works well on various types of shapes, including natural mesh and mechanical parts. For representing salient surface features, we adopt crest lines. The connectivity of the hole including the lost crest lines are decided by triangulation and region growing. The geometric position of the vertices and crest points in the hole are resolved by using a least-squares problem.", "paper_title": "Feature sensitive hole filling with crest lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100081"}
