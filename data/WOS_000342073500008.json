Methods of this type for the Stokes-Darcy problem that use Robin boundary conditions on the interface are reviewed. Their common underlying structure and their main differences are identified. In particular, it is clarified that there are different updating strategies for the interface conditions. For small values of fluid viscosity and hydraulic permeability, which are relevant in applications from geosciences, it is shown in numerical studies that only one of these updating strategies leads to an efficient numerical method, if it is used with appropriate parameters in the Robin conditions.", "paper_title": "On classical iterative subdomain methods for the Stokes-Darcy problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000342073500008"}
