By equipping each node with multiple wireless interfaces, the transmissions can be separated into different channels and the throughput can be increased. Combining these two technologies, this work studies the capacity of wireless networks wherein each node is equipped with multiple interfaces and each interface can decode at most k concurrent transmissions within its receiving range.
