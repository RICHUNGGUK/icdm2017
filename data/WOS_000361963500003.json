Automatic generation of the so-called density maps is based on video sequences acquired by surveillance systems. Our approach offers two types of solutions. The first one increments the accumulation table when a moving object is detected in a location of interest, delivering a density map of the presence of moving objects. The second algorithm increments the accumulation table only in cases of detecting a new moving object, resulting in a density map of the count of moving objects. The proposed algorithms were tested with the use of PETS 2009 database and with our own database of long-term video recordings. Finally, results of the density maps visualization and determination of the \"busy hours\" are presented.", "paper_title": "NEW APPROACH TO TRAFFIC DENSITY ESTIMATION BASED ON INDOOR AND OUTDOOR SCENES FROM CCTV", "paper_id": "WOS:000361963500003"}
