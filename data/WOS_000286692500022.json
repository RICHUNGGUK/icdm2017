While the extensively used blend shape methods suffer detail losing during image blending, the proposed multi-layer method can retain the flexibility and variety of geometry editing and preserve detail features as well. For low-frequency sub-bands, optimization-based blend shape is presented for large-to-mid scale synthesis. In addition, statistics-based feature matching and enhancement are proposed for high-frequency details. Our results show that the proposed methods are adequate to high-resolution expression synthesis and detail-preserved image editing.", "paper_title": "Multi-layered Expression Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000286692500022"}
