The approach relies on (1) domain-specific languages for model specification, (2) the Alloy Specification Language and its constraint solving analysis capabilities for exploring the state space of the model dynamically, and (3) supporting visualization tools to relay the results of the analysis to the user. We show that our approach is applicable with generic languages such as the Web Ontology Language as well as special XML-based languages such as the Coalition Battle Management Language.", "paper_title": "ConceVE: Conceptual Modeling and Formal Validation for Everyone", "paper_id": "WOS:000334526100006"}
