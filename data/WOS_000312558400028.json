The #CLOSEST STRING problem aims to determine the number of center strings for a given set of strings S and input parameters n, l, and d. We show #CLOSEST STRING is impossible to solve exactly or even approximately in polynomial time, and that restricting #CLOSEST STRING so that any one of the parameters n, l, or d is fixed leads to a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS). We show equivalent results for the problem of efficiently sampling center strings uniformly at random (u.a.r.).", "paper_title": "On the Hardness of Counting and Sampling Center Strings", "paper_id": "WOS:000312558400028"}
