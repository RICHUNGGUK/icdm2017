We study control-flow obfuscation, which works by modifying the control flow of the program to be obfuscated, and observe that it is difficult to evaluate the robustness of these obfuscation techniques. In this paper, we present a framework for quantitative analysis of control-flow obfuscating transformations. Our framework is based upon the control-flow graph of the program, and we show that many existing control-flow obfuscation techniques can be expressed as a sequence of basic transformations on these graphs. We also propose a new measure of the difficulty of reversing these obfuscated programs, and we show that our framework can be used to easily evaluate the space penalty due to the transformations.", "paper_title": "A Graph Approach to Quantitative Analysis of Control-Flow Obfuscating Transformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000266330500008"}
