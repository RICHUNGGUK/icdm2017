However, several technical issues and challenges are associated with the integration of WBANs and MCC. In this article, we study a cloud-enabled WBAN architecture and its applications in pervasive healthcare systems. We highlight the methodologies for transmitting vital sign data to the cloud by using energy-efficient routing, cloud resource allocation, semantic interactions, and data security mechanisms.", "paper_title": "Cloud-Enabled Wireless Body Area Networks for Pervasive Healthcare", "paper_id": "WOS:000325658900010"}
