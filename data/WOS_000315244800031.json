At first, a unified and simple proof of some earlier results is shown. Then a property of balanced elementary symmetric Boolean functions is presented. With this property, we prove that the conjecture is true for n = 2(m) + 2(t) - 1 where m, t(m > t) are two non-negative integers, which verified the conjecture for a large infinite class of integer n.", "paper_title": "On the Balanced Elementary Symmetric Boolean Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000315244800031"}
