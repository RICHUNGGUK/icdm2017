In wireless networks, observations show that some multimedia streams requested by users in a certain geographical area for a certain period exhibit very similar behavior. By exploiting the similarity, we can significantly reduce power consumption in wireless cellular networks. In this article, we present the description of user behavior in HCN and then propose an architecture for multimedia transmission over HCN. Based on this architecture, an energy-efficient multimedia transmission scheme is proposed to optimize energy efficiency by exploiting user behavior. In this scheme macrocells and small cells cooperatively multicast/unicast multimedia steams without QoS degradation. Illustrative results indicate that the exploitation of user behavior and base station cooperation is able to bring green multimedia transmission for HCN.", "paper_title": "ENERGY-EFFICIENT MULTIMEDIA TRANSMISSIONS THROUGH BASE STATION COOPERATION OVER HETEROGENEOUS CELLULAR NETWORKS EXPLOITING USER BEHAVIOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000341629400009"}
