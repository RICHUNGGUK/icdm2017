Numerous micro water droplets breaking out from a ruptured water film around a rising bubble through the oil (upper phase)/water (lower phase) interface were demonstrated in the preceding paper (Uemura et al. in Europhys Lett 92:34004, 2010). In this study, we attempt to oppositely charge the oil and water layers, taking into account the findings of the preliminary study (Uemura et al. in J Vis 13:85, 2010). As a result, this study successfully produces more and finer water droplets than the preceding experiments.", "paper_title": "Micro droplets generated on a rising bubble through an oppositely charged oil/water interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000302382400004"}
