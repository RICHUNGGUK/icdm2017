Current approaches do this by slowing the playout frame rate of the decoder, this is known as adaptive media playout (AMP). However, doing this introduces playout distortion to the viewers as the video is played slower than its natural playout rate. We approach this by proposing a frame rate control scheme that jointly adjusts the encoder frame generation rate of the encoder and the playout frame rate of the decoder. In addition to using AMP to improve video continuity, we also allow the encoder to increase the encoder frame generation rate. This means the encoder will be sending more frames to the decoder to quickly increase the number of frames available at the playback buffer, thus lowering the chance of buffer underflow which causes discontinuity in video playback. At the same time, the increase in the number of frames at the playback buffer may mean that the decoder does not need to use AMP to delay the playback, thus lowering the playback distortion. However, the increase in encoder frame generation rate comes at a price because frame quality will need to decrease in order to meet the constraint on available network bandwidth. This implies that the scheme needs to find the optimal trade-off between frame quality, playout distortion and video continuity. To do that, we characterize the frame rate control problem using Lyapunov optimization. We then systematically derive the optimization policies. We also show that these policies can be decoupled into separate encoder and decoder optimization policies, thus allowing for a distributed implementation. Simulation results show significant reductions in the prebuffering requirements over a scheme that perform no frame rate control and lower playout distortions compared to the AMP schemes, while exhibiting a modest drop in frame quality.
