A key challenge is that the dynamic and complex communication/coordination required by these applications (dependent on the state of the phenomenon being modeled) are determined by the specific numerical formulation, the domain decomposition and/or sub-domain refinement algorithms used, etc. and are known only at runtime. This paper presents Seine, a dynamic geometry-based shared-space interaction framework for scientific applications. The framework provides the flexibility of shared-space-based models and supports extremely dynamic communication/coordination patterns, while still enabling scalable implementations. The design and prototype implementation of Seine are presented. Seine complements and can be used in conjunction with existing parallel programming systems such as MPI and OpenMP. An experimental evaluation using an adaptive multi-block oil-reservoir simulation is used to demonstrate the performance and scalability of applications using Seine.
