The optimal synthesis of general two-qubit orthogonal gate is obtained. For two-qubit unimodular orthogonal gate, it requires at most 2 CNOT gates and 6 one-qubit R-y gates. For the general three-qubit unimodular orthogonal gate, it can be synthesized by 16 CNOT gates and 36 one-qubit R-y and R-z gates in the worst case.", "paper_title": "Decomposition of orthogonal matrix and synthesis of two-qubit and three-qubit orthogonal gates", "paper_id": "WOS:000300538100012"}
