A solver for the problem, which integrates both teacher assignment and course scheduling, is described. An initial solution is obtained by a mathematical programming approach based on Lagrangian relaxation. This solution is further improved by a simulated annealing algorithm. The proposed method has been tested on instances from a university in Indonesia, as well as on several randomly generated datasets, and the corresponding computational results are reported.
