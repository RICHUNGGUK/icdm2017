However, usually they require a modification of the environment by placing artificial landmarks in order to work reliably. In this paper we combine the Average Landmark Vector with invariant feature points automatically detected in panoramic images to overcome this limitation. The proposed approach has been evaluated first in simulation and, as promising results are found, also in two data sets of panoramas from real world environments.", "paper_title": "Combining Invariant Features and the ALV Homing Method for Autonomous Robot Navigation Based on Panoramas", "paper_id": "WOS:000297365600017"}
