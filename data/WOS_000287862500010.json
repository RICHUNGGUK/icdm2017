We demonstrate both the efficiency of our multiresolution algorithm and its real interest to learn a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the texture feature set of an image which can then subsequently be exploited in a simple clustering-based segmentation algorithm. The resulting segmentation procedure has been successfully applied on the Berkeley image database, demonstrating its efficiency compared to the best existing state-of-the-art segmentation methods recently proposed in the literature.", "paper_title": "MDS-Based Multiresolution Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Model for Color Image Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000287862500010"}
