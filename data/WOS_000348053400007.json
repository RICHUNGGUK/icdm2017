Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming an enabling technology for SHM applications that are more prevalent and more easily deployable than traditional wired networks. However, SHMbrings new challenges to WSNs: engineering-driven optimal deployment, a large volume of data, sophisticated computing, and so forth. In this paper, we address two important challenges: sensor deployment and decentralized computing. We propose a solution, to deploy wireless sensors at strategic locations to achieve the best estimates of structural health (e.g., damage) by following the widely used wired sensor system deployment approach from civil/structural engineering. We found that faults (caused by communication errors, unstable connectivity, sensor faults, etc.) in such a deployed WSN greatly affect the performance of SHM. To make the WSN resilient to the faults, we present an approach, called FTSHM (fault-tolerance in SHM), to repair the WSN and guarantee a specified degree of fault tolerance. FTSHM searches the repairing points in clusters in a distributed manner, and places a set of backup sensors at those points in such a way that still satisfies the engineering requirements. FTSHM also includes an SHM algorithm suitable for decentralized computing in the energy-constrained WSN, with the objective of guaranteeing that the WSN for SHM remains connected in the event of a fault, thus prolonging the WSN lifetime under connectivity and data delivery constraints. We demonstrate the advantages of FTSHM through extensive simulations and real experimental settings on a physical structure.", "paper_title": "Deploying Wireless Sensor Networks with Fault-Tolerance for Structural Health Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000348053400007"}
