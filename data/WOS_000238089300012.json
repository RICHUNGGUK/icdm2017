In this mode of learning, the learners decide their learning goals, choose the contents which they want to learn, and arrange the sequences of their learning, etc. In self-learning environment, the learning system must proposes a method for piloting the learning process, so the learners can learn in a correct sequence, and get the goal at last. Based on the characteristics of self-learning, and the fundamental law of cognition based on knowledge points, a novel meta data model of learning resources is proposed, so the knowledge network of learning resources can be constructured. In this way, the knowledge network can make support to the self-learning in E-learning environment.", "paper_title": "The research on a kind of knowledge network for self-learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300012"}
