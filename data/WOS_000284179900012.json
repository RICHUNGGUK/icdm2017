A detailed analysis of the transmission error sources is presented, and a number of relevant mathematical models are developed using a priori knowledge of the process. This paper demonstrates that such schemes are very effective when the drive system is not subjected to external loads and operating conditions do not change considerably i.e. ambient temperature, belt tension.", "paper_title": "Analysis and estimation of motion transmission errors of a timing belt drive", "paper_id": "WOS:000284179900012"}
