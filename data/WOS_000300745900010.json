Logistics outsourcing, or third-party logistics (3PL), involves the use of external companies to perform some or all of the firm's logistics activities. In this paper, through analyzing the features and role of third-party logistics, for 3PL provider selection, we propose an indicator system and a method for data integration. We also establish a comprehensive evaluation model for 3PL suppliers based on fuzzy sets; furthermore, we propose a compound quantification model based on centralized quantification values, a comparison method based on the synthesis effect, and a 3PL supplier selection model. A real-world case analysis is provided. The results show that the proposed 3PL supplier selection model can effectively integrate decision preferences into decision processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
