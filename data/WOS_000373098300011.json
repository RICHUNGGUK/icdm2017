They are used to support a variety of personalized, advanced, and integrated applications in the field of medical, fitness, sports, military, and consumer electronics. In a WBAN, network longevity is a major challenge due to the limitation of the availability of energy supply in body nodes. Therefore, routing protocols can play a key role towards making such networks energy efficient. In this work, we exhibit that a routing protocol together with an effective body node coordinator (BNC) deployment strategy can influence the network lifetime eminently. Our initial work shows that the variation in the placement of a BNC within a WBAN could significantly vary the overall network lifetime. This motivated us to work on an effective node placement strategy for a BNC, within a WBAN; and thus we propose three different BNC placement algorithms considering different features of available energy efficient routing protocols in a WBAN. Our simulation results show that these algorithms along with an appropriate routing protocol can prolong the network lifetime by up to 47.45%.", "paper_title": "Body Node Coordinator Placement Algorithms for Wireless Body Area Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098300011"}
