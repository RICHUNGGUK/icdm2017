This paper proposes a new variable selection heuristic for Max-SAT local search algorithms, which works particularly well for weighted Max-2-SAT instances. Evolving from the recent configuration checking strategy, this new heuristic works in three levels and is called CCTriplex. According to the CCTriplex heuristic, a variable that is both decreasing and configuration changed has the higher priority to be flipped than a decreasing variable, which in turn has the higher priority than a configuration changed variable. The CCTriplex heuristic is used to develop a new SLS algorithm for weighted Max-2-SAT called CCMaxSAT. We evaluate CCMaxSAT on random benchmarks with different densities, and the hand crafted Frb benchmark, as well as weighted Max-2-SAT instances encoded from MaxCut, MaxClique and sports scheduling problems. Compared with the state-of-the-art SLS solver for weighted Max-2-SAT called ITS and the best SLS solver in Max-SAT Evaluation 2012 namely ubcsat-IRoTS, as well as the famous complete solver wMaxSATz, our algorithm CCMaxSAT shows rather good performance on all the benchmarks.", "paper_title": "An effective variable selection heuristic in SLS for weighted Max-2-SAT", "paper_id": "WOS:000354953500004"}
