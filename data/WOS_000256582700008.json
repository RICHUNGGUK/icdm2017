We formulate a next-best-point problem and transform the uncertainty of a B-spline surface into a higher-dimensional B-spline surface. This technique allows the use of the convex hull and subdivision properties of B-spline surfaces in the divide-and-conquer algorithm. It thus greatly reduces the search time for determining the next best sensing location.", "paper_title": "An efficient sensing localization algorithm for free-form surface digitization", "paper_id": "WOS:000256582700008"}
