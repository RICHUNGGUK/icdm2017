The source case is represented as a schema that contains its line drawing and its structural model represented at multiple levels of abstraction: the lines and intersections in the drawing, the shapes, the structural components, and connections of the device are depicted in the drawing. Given a target drawing and a relevant source case, our method of compositional analogy first constructs a representation of the lines and the intersections in the target drawing, then uses the mappings at the level of line intersections to transfer the shape representations from the source case to the target; next, it uses the mappings at the level of shapes to transfer the full structural model of the depicted system from the source to the target.", "paper_title": "Analogical recognition of shape and structure in design drawings", "paper_id": "WOS:000254593300004"}
