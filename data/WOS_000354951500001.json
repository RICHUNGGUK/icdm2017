Through measurement-based analysis, we find that adapting all available 802.11n features results in higher goodput than adapting only a subset of features, thereby showing that holistic link adaptation is crucial to achieve best performance. We then design a novel hybrid link adaptation scheme termed SampleLite that adapts all 802.11n features while being efficient compared to sampling-based open-loop schemes and practical relative to closed loop schemes. SampleLite uses sender-side RSSI measurements to significantly lower the sampling overhead, by exploiting the monotonic relationship between best settings for each feature and the RSSI. Through analysis and experimentation in a testbed environment, we show that our proposed approach can reduce the sampling overhead by over 70% on average compared to the widely used Minstrel HT scheme. We also experimentally evaluate the goodput performance of SampleLite in a wide range of controlled and real-world interference scenarios. Our results show that SampleLite, while performing close to the ideal, delivers goodput that is 35-100% better than with existing schemes.", "paper_title": "SampleLite: A Hybrid Approach to 802.11n Link Adaptation", "paper_id": "WOS:000354951500001"}
