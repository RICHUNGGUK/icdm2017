In previous work, we have proposed a method to dynamically extend the order of a Markov chain model and a complimentary method for assessing the predictive power of such a variable-length Markov chain. Herein, we review these two methods and propose a novel method for measuring the ability of a variable-length Markov model to summarize user Web navigation sessions up to a given length. Although the summarization ability of a model is important to enable the identification of user navigation patterns, the ability to make predictions is important in order to foresee the next link choice of a user after following a given trail so as, for example, to personalize a Web site. We present an extensive experimental evaluation providing strong evidence that prediction accuracy increases linearly with summarization ability.", "paper_title": "Evaluating variable-length Markov chain models for analysis of user Web navigation sessions", "paper_id": "WOS:000244332000001"}
