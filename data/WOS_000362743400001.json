However, there is a lack of consented concept on the definition and scope of ICT convergence in the existing studies. In the case of considering convergence as an \"innovation activity\" in particular, there is a limitation of not being able to quantify it. In spite of the social consent and consensus on its importance, basic data, particularly quantified base data, is relatively lacking. Accordingly, this study examined the concept of the existing convergence and summarized the concept of ICT convergence based on which a methodology for researching the ecosystem of ICT convergence was designed. The significance of this study is in the fact that it proposed systemized research design and methodology for all industries for quantitative estimation of ICT convergence market scale. In the future, there is a need to research areas that were not included in this study and for gradual improvement of elements that need further specified criteria.", "paper_title": "An Exploratory Research on Future ICT Convergence Research Design in Smart Sensor Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000362743400001"}
