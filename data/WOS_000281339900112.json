Therefore, long-term strategies for gaining a competitive advantage are now starting to focus on innovation rather than cost reduction. Although attention to the importance of innovation is rising, there are few studies today that provide airlines with a clear and precise way to successfully conduct innovation operations. The aim of this study is to solve this dilemma by constructing a novel aviatic innovation system (AIS). In this paper, a hybrid fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on a fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) and a VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) is adopted to complete the construction of the AIS. The value of the AIS is to provide Taiwanese airlines with innovation-oriented techniques for future strategy development. We believe that the AIS can contribute to the survival of Taiwanese airlines in the near future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
