Relying heavily on artificial intelligence techniques, the system has been in production since December 2002 and in 2004 completely automates the underwriting of 19 percent of the LTC applications. A fuzzy logic rules engine encodes the underwriter guidelines and an evolutionary algorithm optimizes the engine's performance. Finally, a natural language parser is used to improve the coverage of the underwriting system.", "paper_title": "Automating the underwriting of insurance applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000240933700004"}
