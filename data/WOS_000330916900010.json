It is assumed that the macrostructure is made of composite materials whose effective properties are calculated through the homogenization method. By conducting finite element analysis of both structures and materials, sensitivity numbers at the macro- and micro-scale levels are derived. Then, the BESO method is used to iteratively update the macrostructures and the composite microstructures according to the elemental sensitivity numbers at both scales. Some 2D and 3D numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm. A variety of optimal macrostructures and optimal material microstructures have been obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
