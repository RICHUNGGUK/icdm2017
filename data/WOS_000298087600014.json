Network topology must be designed as well, by assigning clients to facilities and facilities to higher level entities, when necessary. We tackle a particular location problem, where two sets of facilities have to be located, and in which different devices can be installed at each site, providing different capacities at different costs. We optimize location and dimensioning of these facilities simultaneously. We introduce a compact formulation of that problem, we use discretization and DantzigWolfe reformulation techniques to improve models, and we design an exact optimization algorithm. We test our approach on a set of instances derived from existing literature on facility location. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
