A simple inhibition mechanism is used to generate automatically the spiral patterns and the magic Fibonacci numbers. We constrain the mechanism by introducing the requirement of the threshold energy-rate in producing primordia. With this modification, we are able to generate not only spiral but also whorled patterns. Our model can yield various possibilities of the whorled patterns observed in plants.", "paper_title": "Whorled patterns of phyllotaxis", "paper_id": "WOS:000253297900013"}
