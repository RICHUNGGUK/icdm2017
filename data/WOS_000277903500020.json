Balaban index has been used in various QSAR. and QSPR studies. In this paper, we characterize the graphs with both some parameters (such as the number of vertices, connectivity, diameter) and extreme Balaban indices.", "paper_title": "Character of Graphs with Extremal Balaban Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000277903500020"}
