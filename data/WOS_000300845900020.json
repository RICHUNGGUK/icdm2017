It is assumed that the users have perfect channel state information (CSI) of their own channels, while the BS only knows the partial CSI provided by the receivers via a feedback channel. We study the fundamental limits on the amount of feedback required at the BS to achieve the sum-rate capacity of the system (when BS has perfect CSI for all users) in the asymptotic case of N -> infinity, considering various signal to noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The main results of this paper can be expressed as follows. 1) In the fixed-SNR regime (where the SNR does not scale with N) and low-SNR regime (where the SNR is much smaller than 1/ln(N)), to achieve the (1 - epsilon)-portion of the sum-rate capacity, the total amount of feedback should scale at least with ln(epsilon(-1)). In the fixed-SNR regime, to reduce the gap between the achievable sum rate and the sum-rate capacity of the system (which is defined as the sum-rate gap) to zero, the amount of feedback should scale at least logarithmically with the sum-rate capacity, which is achievable by using the random beam-forming (RBF) scheme proposed by Sharif and Hassibi. In the low-SNR regime, we propose an opportunistic beam-forming (OBF) scheme, which is shown to be asymptotically feedback optimal. 2) In the high-SNR regime (where the SNR grows to infinity N -> infinity), the total amount of feedback depends on the number of receive antennas. In particular, to reduce the sum-rate gap to zero in the case of, K < M, the amount of feedback in the SNR regime of ln(P)/ln(N) > 1/M-1, should scale at least logarithmically with the SNR. In the case of K >= M, the amount of feedback does not need to scale with the SNR. Moreover, we show that RBF is asymptotically feedback optimal in the high-SNR regime.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Analysis of the Amount of CSI Feedback in MIMO Broadcast Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000300845900020"}
