The fundamental principle in template matching is to minimize a potential energy function, which is a quantitative representation of the 'closeness' of a defined object (template) relative to a portion of an image. However, the computation of potential energy suffers a major drawback in efficiency. A significant amount of the processing time is dedicated to match the information from the template to the image. This work proposes an alternative way to match the template and the image that reduces the number of operations from O(nm) to O(n) in calculating the potential energy of a template and an image that have n and m number of edge pixels, respectively. This work illustrates this approach by template edge matching which uses the edge information to perform the template matching. The experimental results show that while the proposed method produces a slightly larger error in the resulting template location, the processing time is decreased by a factor of 4.8 on average.", "paper_title": "A fast algorithm for template matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600036"}
