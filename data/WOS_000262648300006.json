Sensors are assumed to be placed on the grid points of a grid in the sensor. field and complete information coverage is claimed if all the grid points are information covered. This sensor placement problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the total cost while guaranteeing certain coverage requirement. We propose a greedy algorithm to solve this problem. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently obtain a good quality solution with greatly reduced computation complexity and the number of sensors can be greatly reduced for information coverage.", "paper_title": "SENSOR PLACEMENT FOR COMPLETE INFORMATION COVERAGE IN DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262648300006"}
