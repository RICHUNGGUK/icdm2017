Most existing techniques are based on the singular points of the fingerprint which is sensitive to fingerprint artifacts and is not well defined for arch type fingerprints. In this study, we present a topological interpretation of fingerprint reference point, where the reference points are posed as topological features of fingerprint structure and can be detected seamlessly from either arch type or non-arch type fingerprints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over the existing ones.
