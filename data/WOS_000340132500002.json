Service providers apply the user's preference to supply the user adaptive broadcasting service. However, in an error-prone environment, such as wireless networks, faults due to diverse conditions weaken the efficiency and fairness of the broadcasting service. It is crucial to broadcast to the user adaptively in the error-prone environment. This paper suggests a mechanism to enhance efficiency and maintain the fairness of the service by rescheduling the faulty item when the fault occurs. The proposed method uses the fault queue to get faulty items and can afford to provide fair broadcasting by supplementing the shortage item and provide adaptive broadcasting to the user groups by selecting the item of largest deviation value of preference among user groups in faulty items and new arrived items. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces waiting time up to 31% compared to the retransmission scheme, while maintaining fairness.", "paper_title": "USER ADAPTIVE AND FAIR BROADCASTING IN AN ERROR-PRONE ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000340132500002"}
