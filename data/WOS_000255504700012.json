In this paper, we propose a metaheuristic approach for VCP that performs two phases: the first phase is based on an evolutionary algorithm, whereas the second one is a postoptimization phase based on the set covering formulation of the problem. Computational results on a set of DIMACS instances show that the overall algorithm is able to produce high-quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time. For four instances, the proposed algorithm is able to improve the best-known solution while for almost all the remaining instances, it finds the best-known solution in the literature.", "paper_title": "A metaheuristic approach for the vertex coloring problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000255504700012"}
