We try to find out what are the major components of each facial expression, what are the patterns that distinguish them from one another. We applied widely used pattern recognition technique-principle component analysis to characterize the feature point displacements of each basic human facial expression for each individual in the existing database. For faces not existent in the database, so called \"novel face\" in our experiment, we will first find the face in the database that has most likely neutral face to this individual, and base on an assumption that are widely accepted in cognitive science, we will classify this novel face to the category where the most similar one belongs, and classifying his/her facial expression using the so called \"expression model\" of the most similar individual. This kind of approach has never be exploited before, then we will examine its robustness in our experiment.", "paper_title": "A facial expression classification algorithm based on principle component analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000009"}
