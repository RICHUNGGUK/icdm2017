As a corollary, a criterion of existence of conservative dilations for corresponding dissipative commutative N-D systems is obtained. We point out the cases where this criterion is always fulfilled, and the cases where it is not always fulfilled.", "paper_title": "Conservative dilations of dissipative multidimensional systems: The commutative and non-commutative settings", "paper_id": "WOS:000252281400004"}
