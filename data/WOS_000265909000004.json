The optimal tuning of the fuzzy controller using a maximum known delay is based on the integral time absolute error (ITAE) performance index. The goal is to obtain the optimal tuning parameters for the input scaling factors where the ITAE performance index is minimized. In this study, a step change in the force reference signal is considered a disturbance, and the goal is to assess how well the system follows set-point changes using the ITAE criterion. In order to improve the efficiency of high-performance drilling processes while preserving tool life, the current study focuses on the design and implementation of an optimal fuzzy-control system for drilling force. Simulation results demonstrate good convergence properties of the proposed strategy. Experimental tests of the drilling of two materials (GGG40 and 17-4 PH) corroborate the excellent transient response and the minimum overshoot predicted by the simulation results. Thus, the optimal fuzzy control system reduces the influence of the increase in cutting force that occurs at larger drill depths, eliminating the risk of rapid drill wear and catastrophic drill breakage.
