The system utilizes description tools standardized in MPEG-7, like color and shape descriptors and simple semantic annotations, to support image retrieval. The implementation also exploits eXist, a native xml database system with XQuery support to manage and query the MPEG-7 meta data. Two query methods are supported: Query-By-Example(QBE) and Query-By-Keyword(QBK). This system is integrated into SDU-ADM, Archaeological Digital Museum of Shandong University.", "paper_title": "An image retrieval system based on MPEG-7 and XMLDB query for digital museum", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300159"}
