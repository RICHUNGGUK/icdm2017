Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the primary examples of such networks, in which elongating the network lifetime is the main concern. Optimal WSN design is highly dependent oil the application scenario context. Correct quantification of the application specific network lifetime is a must to further optimize the design or to comparatively evaluate the proposed schemes - e.g. a legacy layered design vs. a cross-layer implementation. However, in practice, we observe that the focus is given on proposing sophisticated schemes to increase the energy efficiency, whereas only rudimentary lifetime metrics are employed to evaluate the outcome of this effort which compromises the correctness of the results. To realistically and correctly quantify the lifetime, we propose a utility based lifetime measurement framework called Weighted Cumulative Operational Time (WCOT). WCOT lets users incorporate the application dependence into the lifetime metric through its utility based interface. WCOT performs a weighted summation of time where utility values are the weights. With this mechanism, a more representative lifetime metric which maps the complete network behavior into a numeric value is obtained. This is in contrast with metrics which focus solely on certain milestones of the network functionality to quantify the lifetime which include the first node death, the last node death.
