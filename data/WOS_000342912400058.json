The best understood prions are from yeast and have a prion-forming domain with strongly biased amino acid composition, most notably enriched for Q or N. PLAAC is a web application that scans protein sequences for domains with prion-like amino acid composition. Users can upload sequence files, or paste sequences directly into a textbox. PLAAC ranks the input sequences by several summary scores and allows scores along sequences to be visualized. Text output files can be downloaded for further analyses, and visualizations saved in PDF and PNG formats.", "paper_title": "PLAAC: a web and command-line application to identify proteins with prion-like amino acid composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000342912400058"}
