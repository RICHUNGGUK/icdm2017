A malignant nodule beneath the oral tissue surface was visualized using 2-D and B-scan THz imaging techniques. The THz images were well correlated with the histological findings. The nodule was found to have lower water content than that of normal cells, and this water effect may have influenced the THz refractive index and absorption coefficient at 20 degrees C. The THz spectroscopic image of the frozen tissue at -20 degrees C showed better contrast because of the lack of liquid water; this implies that there are significant structural differences between malignant oral melanoma cells and normal mucosal cells. The better contrast in the frozen tissue images was due to the greater penetration of THz radiation into the sample. This temperaturedependent THz imaging approach demonstrated the feasibility of accurate imaging of the oral tumor tissue.", "paper_title": "Temperature-Dependent Terahertz Imaging of Excised Oral Malignant Melanoma", "paper_id": "WOS:000321218700004"}
