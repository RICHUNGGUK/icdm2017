By using the approximation capability of T-S fuzzy models, the nonlinear systems are expressed by uncertain T-S fuzzy models with norm-bounded approximation errors. A novel fuzzy dynamic integral sliding-mode control (DISMC) scheme is then developed for the nonlinear systems based on their T-S fuzzy approximation models. One of the key features of the new DISMC scheme is that the restrictive assumption that all local linear systems share a common input matrix, which is required in most existing fuzzy integral sliding-mode control (ISMC) approaches, is removed. Furthermore, the results of universal fuzzy ISMCs for two classes of nonlinear systems, along with constructive procedures to obtain the universal fuzzy ISMCs, are provided, respectively. Finally, the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approaches are illustrated via a numerical example.", "paper_title": "Universal Fuzzy Integral Sliding-Mode Controllers Based on T-S Fuzzy Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000334178800010"}
