We first characterize the set of quantum channels having polytopic images and show that additivity of the minimal output entropy can be violated in this class. We then provide a complete characterization of quantum channels T that are universally image additive in the sense that for any quantum channel S, the image of T circle times S is the convex hull of the tensor product of the images of T and S. These channels turn out to form a strict subset of entanglement breaking channels with polytopic images and a strict superset of classical-quantum channels.", "paper_title": "Quantum Channels With Polytopic Images and Image Additivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000351470800021"}
