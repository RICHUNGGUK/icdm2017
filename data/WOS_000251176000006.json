We analyze the performance of the proposed scheme and propose a two-dimensional random walk model for simulation. Performance evaluation is done by computing several key performance criteria, i.e., prediction accuracy, average number of reservation per call, reservation efficiency, and reservation time overhead. The influences of threshold distance, average distance where the mobile station moves along a straight line, location error and sample time are investigated, and the effectiveness of mobility prediction is also evaluated. Performance comparison reveals that the proposed scheme performs better than a solely distance-based scheme without mobility prediction.", "paper_title": "Location-aided resource reservation for handoff based on mobility prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000251176000006"}
