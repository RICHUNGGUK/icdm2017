The method is inspired by de Simone's FH-bisimilarity and uses transition rules as schematic transitions in a bisimulation-like relation between open terms. The soundness of the method is proved and examples showing its applicability are provided. The proposed bisimulation-based proof method is incomplete, but we do offer some completeness results for restricted classes of GSOS specifications. An extension of the proof method to the setting of GSOS languages with predicates is also offered.", "paper_title": "Proving the validity of equations in GSOS languages using rule-matching bisimilarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000300844900006"}
