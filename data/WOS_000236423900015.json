The routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) algorithm efficiently manages optical network resources and is separated from the optical topology. This paper proposes a dynamic LLR algorithm using fuzzy logic control (FLC LLR) with different wavelength assignments. The unexpected traffic load is increased when the traffic load is high and the lightpath is long for the LLR routing algorithm. How to balance the traffic load of each link and minimize the hop count for each lightpath is considered. The fuzzy logic control in the FLC LLR algorithm is based on the traffic load and hop count to determine whether the lightpath can be established. Simulation results show that the FLC LLR algorithm has better performance than the LLR algorithm in terms of connection, blocking probability and channel utilization, especially when the traffic load is high. We also show that the FLC LLR algorithm increases the number of connections to be set up without incrementing the channel utilization. The number of conversions are compared as three wavelength assignments embedded in the FLC LLR algorithm when the converters are considered.", "paper_title": "Performance assessment of fuzzy logic control routing algorithm with different wavelength assignments in DWDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000236423900015"}
