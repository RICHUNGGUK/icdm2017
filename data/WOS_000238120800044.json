Therefore, dynamic data transmission with proposed scheme for MB-OFDM system is considered in this paper. The proposed scheme is investigated for the most suitable adaptation in home networking environments. And this scheme includes STBC, VBLAST, and STBC-VBLAST in all. By properly selecting their MIMO schemes agreeable to estimated SNR, the proposed scheme has the advantage of each technique, diversity gain or high transmission rate relative to general scheme.", "paper_title": "Enhanced MIMO transmission scheme for MB-OFDM system with spatial mode selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000238120800044"}
