Several other operations provided by fuzzy sets theory can be used. In the present paper, pseudo-linear approximation operators are investigated from the practical point of view in Image Processing. We study max-min, max-product Shepard type approximation operators together with Shepard operators based oil pseudo-operations generated by an increasing continuous generator. It is shown that in several cases these outperform classical approximation operators based on sum and product operations. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
