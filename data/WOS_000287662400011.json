Under special condition of single user in the system or when the number of subcarrier is only one, the system reduces to conventional MIMO-OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) system or MIMO-BC (Broadcast Channel) system respectively. By analysing sub-optimal antenna selection schemes developed earlier for single user MIMO-OFDM systems and single carrier MIMO-BC systems, one can see many similarities which can be extended to multicarrier MIMO broadcast systems. The proposed method exploits these similarities to obtain a low complexity system design with acceptable performance. The performance of the proposed scheme is studied via extensive simulation, and the computational complexity involved is compared to the conventional scheme. A selection gain of approximately 0.5 b/s/Hz is shown to be achievable using only two out of three antennas, and the proposed scheme is able to achieve up to 90% of the gain. This is achieved at a complexity that is significantly lower than the conventional methods, hence the practical implementation of the proposed scheme can be justified.", "paper_title": "Low Complexity Antenna Selection Scheme for Multicarrier MIMO Broadcast Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000287662400011"}
