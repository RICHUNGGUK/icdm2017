Although query languages adequate in expressiveness to OWL reasoning capabilities were introduced before, their implementations are rather limited. In this paper, the authors study SPARQL-DLNOT, an extension of one of these query languages, SPARQL-DL, and present novel evaluation and optimization techniques for efficient SPARQL-DLNOT execution. As queries become complex easily, they also present a novel graph-based visualization that simplifies query construction and maintenance. Presented techniques and algorithms were implemented in the Pellet reasoner and in their novel Protege plug-in OWL2Query.", "paper_title": "Expressive OWL Queries: Design, Evaluation, Visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000323380200004"}
