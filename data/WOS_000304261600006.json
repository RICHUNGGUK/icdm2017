An important prerequisite for the development of safe and effective chemical compounds is the identification of their cellular targets. High-throughput screening is increasingly being used to test new drug compounds and to infer their cellular targets, but these quantitative screens result in high-dimensional datasets with many inherent sources of noise. We review here the state-of-the-art statistical scoring approaches used in the prediction of drug-target interactions, and illustrate their operation using publicly available data from yeast chemical-genomic profiling studies. The real data examples underscore the need for developing more advanced data mining approaches for extracting the full information from the high-throughput screens. A particular medical application stems from the concept of synthetic lethality in cancer and how it could open up new opportunities for personalized cancer therapies.
