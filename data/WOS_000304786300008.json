Under the framework of competitive analysis. a randomized algorithm for the modified model is constructed and then is proved optimal by Yao's Lemma, and thus the optimal competitive ratio is obtained. The result shows that the introduction of the interest rate puts off the optimal purchase date and diminishes the uncertainty involved in the decision making. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
