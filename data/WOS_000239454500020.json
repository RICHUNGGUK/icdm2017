They have a continuous, unpredictable and unbounded flow of data as input, referred as streams. The fact that data comes as a stream with varying input rates (instead of accessing data stored on a disk in a predictable way) and that quality of service (QoS) requirements are stringent for these applications warrants a re-examination of the fundamental architecture of a DBMS. This paper describes the basic processing model and architecture of MavStream - a new Data Stream Management System (DSMS) being developed at UT Arlington. The architecture of MavStream is the primary focus of this paper. The user can give a continuous query from a graphical user interface (GUI), which is instantiated, scheduled, and executed by the MavStream server. We first provide an overview of the basic model and architecture and then describe some of the components of the system. We provide some experimental results to demonstrate the utility of the system and the effect of different scheduling strategies and buffer sizes on the performance and output.", "paper_title": "The anatomy of a stream processing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454500020"}
