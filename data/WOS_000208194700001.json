Recently there have been proposed new algorithms for the basic clustering problem for massive data sets that produce an approximate solution using efficiently the memory, which is the most critical resource for streaming computation. In this paper, based on these solutions, we present a new model for clustering clickstream data which applies three different phases in the data processing, and is validated through a set of experiments.
