With interesting game based scenarios and an intelligent tutoring module, our content could give adaptive feedbacks to learners as needed in order to make the learners well-motivated and immersed in learning context. We performed an experiment for three student groups (one experimental group and two control groups) which were learning the minimization of boolean functions at a vocational high school in Korea, and compared our content aided learning to other conventional ones for evaluating the learning effectiveness. In this experiment, we identified that our content aided learning was more effective than other ones significantly in terms of both academic achievement and learning attitude. More specifically, our content was very useful for learners to improve academic attitude and learning habit.", "paper_title": "Effectiveness of game based learning to minimize boolean functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000360071800025"}
