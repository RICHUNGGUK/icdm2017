A minimum number of controllers are used to force the LCSNNs to the desired equilibrium point by fully utilizing the structure of the network. In order to pinning control the LCSNNs to a certain desired state, only one controller is required for strongly connected network topology, and m controllers, which will be shown to be the minimum number, are needed for LCSNNs with m-reducible coupling matrix. The isolate node of the LCSNNs can be stable, periodic, or even chaotic. The coupling Laplacian matrix of the LCSNNs can be symmetric irreducible, asymmetric irreducible, or m-reducible, which means that the network topology can be strongly connected, weakly connected, or even unconnected. There is no constraint on the network topology. Some criteria are derived to judge whether the LCSNNs can be controlled in mean square by using designed controllers. The given criteria are expressed in terms of strict linear matrix inequalities, which can be easily checked by resorting to recently developed algorithm. Moreover, numerical examples including small-world and scale-free networks are also given to demonstrate that our theoretical results are valid and efficient for large systems.", "paper_title": "Pinning Stabilization of Linearly Coupled Stochastic Neural Networks via Minimum Number of Controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000270949900008"}
