Among different algorithms used to construct a recommender system, collaborative filtering methods have attracted much attention and been used in many commercial applications. Incorporating the time into the recommendation algorithm can greatly enhance its performance. In this paper, we propose a novel time-aware model-based recommendation system. We show that future ratings of a user can be inferred from his/her rating history. We assume that there is cascade of information between the items such that rating an item can lead to other items being rated. There is indeed a hidden network structure among the items and each user tracks a sequence of items in this network. The dependencies between the items are modeled based on statistical diffusion models and the parameters are obtained through maximum-likelihood estimation. We show that under some mild assumptions, the estimation task becomes a convex optimization problem. A major advantage of the proposed method over classical recommender systems is the ability to include novel items in its recommendation lists besides providing accurate recommendations. The proposed model also results in personalized and diverse recommendations. Experimental evaluations show that the model can be trained based on the ratings of a limited number of users. Furthermore, the proposed model outperforms classical recommendation algorithms in terms of both accuracy and novelty.", "paper_title": "A Time-Aware Recommender System Based on Dependency Network of Items", "paper_id": "WOS:000361469800009"}
