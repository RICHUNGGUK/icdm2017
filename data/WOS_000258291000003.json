With the classical derivation modes <= k and = k as well as with the internally hybrid mode (>= l Lambda <= A;) we obtain a characterization of the family of recursively enumerable languages even with only one component, with the derivation modes *, t, and >= k as well as with the internally hybrid mode (t Lambda >= k) two components working in the same mode and only one common regular set for both components yield computational completeness. For the internally hybrid modes (t Lambda <= k) and (t Lambda = A;) we only obtain languages of finite index, but combining one component working in one of these modes (t Lambda <= A;) and (t Lambda = A;) with a component working in one of the modes * and >= k we again obtain a characterization of the family of recursively enumerable languages.", "paper_title": "CD grammar systems with regular start conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000258291000003"}
