Similarly, two s-starting Hamiltonian cycles are independent if the ith vertices of the cycle are distinct for every 2 <= i <= 2(n). A set S of Hamiltonian paths (s-starting Hamiltonian cycles) are mutually independent if every two paths (cycles, respectively) from S are independent. We show that for n pairs of adjacent vertices w(i) and b(i), there are n mutually independent Hamiltonian paths with endvertices w(i), b(i) in Q(n). We also show that Q(n) contains n - f fault-free mutually independent s-starting Hamiltonian cycles, for every set of f <= n - 2 faulty edges in Q(n) and every vertex s. This improves previously known results on the numbers of mutually independent Hamiltonian paths and cycles in the hypercube with faulty edges. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
