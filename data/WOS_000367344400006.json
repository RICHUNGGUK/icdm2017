For dependence and independence logic, we completely characterize the tractability/intractability frontier of data complexity of both quantifier-free and quantified formulas. For inclusion logic formulas, we reduce the model-checking problem to the satisfiability problem of so-called Dual-Horn propositional formulas. Via this reduction, we give an alternative proof for the recent result showing that the data complexity of inclusion logic is in PTIME.", "paper_title": "Tractability Frontier of Data Complexity in Team Semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000367344400006"}
