A modified ant colony system is proposed to solve the scheduling problems. A two-dimensional matrix is proposed in this study for assigning jobs on processors, and it has a time-dependency relation structure. The dynamic rule is designed to modify the latest starting time of jobs and hence the heuristic function. In exploration of the search solution space, this investigation proposes a delay solution generation rule to escape the local optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed modified ant colony system algorithm provides an effective and efficient approach for solving multiprocessor system scheduling problems with resource constraints.
