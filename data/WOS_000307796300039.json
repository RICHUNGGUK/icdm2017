However, in many cases, the aim of exploring behaviors is to exploit their motivations. Based on discovered behavioral reasons, we are able to conduct subsequent actions to impel or impede those behaviors. Although some logical approaches have been proposed to derive an explanation for a set of observations using abductive reasoning, there are few methods that take a statistical approach for group behavioral reason mining. Statistical methods enable us to discover behavioral reasons automatically in an uncertain situation. To address this issue, we propose a computational model and a family of algorithms called BRMA (Behavioral Reason Mining Algorithm), which exploits various distance functions to discover group behavioral reasons in three statistical ways. The BRMA algorithms have low time complexity and run extremely fast. Based on two datasets, we conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the BRMA algorithms. The empirical experimental results indicate that the BRMA algorithms have a relatively high accuracy, and that among the BRMA family, BRMA(MP) outperforms BRMA(Average) and BRMA(Weight).
