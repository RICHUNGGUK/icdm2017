The system suggests adaptations and the student also submits his/her adaptation preference. When the student preference opposes the system suggestion, the student then negotiates with the system to reach an agreement of adaptation. A negotiation-based adaptive learning system (NALS) is implemented to support the generation of personalized adaptive learning sequences by system negotiations with students regarding assessments of learning performance (i.e. negotiated open student model) of the current content and choices of the next learning content (i.e. negotiation of adaptation). Students require two metacognitions in deciding adaptive learning sequences: self-assessment for evaluating their understanding of the current content and regulation for choosing appropriate learning content. Negotiated open student model are used for assist student self-assessment and negotiation of adaptation are used for assist student regulation of content choices. An experiment was conducted to compare a system-controlled adaptive learning system (SALS, adaptivity), a user-controlled adaptive learning system (UALS, adaptability), and a NALS. The results revealed that NALS promoted better metacognitions in student calibration (i.e. self-assessment) accuracy and learning content choices (i.e. regulation). Preliminary evidences also showed that NALS promoted better student performance in a delay test. The results further suggested that students with poor calibration accuracy and inappropriate content choices were not suitable to use UALS and were suitable to use SALS. The NALS can also be used for training students to make appropriate adaptation for learning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
