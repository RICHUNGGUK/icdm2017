The freshness of information depends upon the frequent transmission of beacons. Similarly, to increase the awareness area or communicating with the distant nodes, beacons are disseminated with a high transmission power. However, increasing the beacon transmission power or rate has a negative effect on information communication efficiency because of the finite bandwidth of the wireless link. Therefore, different schemes have been proposed to individually control beacon's transmission power, transmission rate, or contention window at the MAC layer, or any combination of those, to achieve quality beacon communication in VANETs. The latter case is called hybrid adaptive beaconing schemes. In literature, there are many hybrid adaptive beaconing schemes that control multiple communication parameters to efficiently broadcast beacon messages in VANETs. In this paper, we explicitly survey and summarized various aspects of those schemes. The open and challenging issues are also highlighted in this paper.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Adaptive Beaconing in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000355827100001"}
