The uncontrollable and partially unpredictable nature of thrust forces on one hand and the complex kinematics of sailboats on the other hand. This paper proposes a new reactive navigation approach, based on artificial potential fields, that addresses these two problems simultaneously. Environment and specific sailboat navigation constraints are represented by a local potential built around the vehicle location. Changes of wind direction and detected obstacles affect this periodically updated potential, which guarantees the real-time computation of a feasible heading for the boat. Numerical simulations are presented and validate the proposed algorithm under various wind conditions. Field trials eventually illustrate the efficiency of this navigation technique using a reduced-scale autonomous sailboat prototype. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
