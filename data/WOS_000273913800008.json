Gauge repeatability and reproducibility (R&R) study is an important approach for evaluating the precision of MSA. Although many gauge capability studies exist and are common in industry, few have discussed cases with attribute data. Modem manufacturing processes must monitor two or more related quality characteristics simultaneously to enhance the quality management effectiveness. This study presents a novel model for evaluating gauge R&R for bivariate attribute data. An alloy manufacturing case is utilized to illustrate the process and potential of the proposed model. Findings are employed to assess and improve measurement systems with bivariate attribute data.", "paper_title": "Evaluating the precision of bivariate attribute measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000273913800008"}
