The proposed code provides coding gain due to the characteristics of the complex Hadamard matrix, which is a special case of Jacket matrices. Also, it can achieve full rate and full diversity with the simple decoding. Simulations show the good performance of the proposed codes in terms of symbol error rate. For generality, a kind of quasi-orthogonal STBC may be similarly designed with the improved performance.", "paper_title": "Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes Designs Based on Jacket Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000279276000006"}
