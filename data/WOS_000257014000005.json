The variables must satisfy a number of exact restrictions. The system is both large and sparse. Two aspects of the statistical and computational development are a practical procedure for solving a linear integer system, and a stable linearization routine for ratios. The numerical method for solving large sparse linear least-squares estimation problems is tested and found to perform well, even when the n x k design matrix is large (nk = O(10(8))).
