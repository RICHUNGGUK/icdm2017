We compared three-dimensional (3D) scapular positions obtained with skin markers to those obtained through palpation of three scapular anatomical landmarks. The scapular kinematics of nine subjects were collected. Static positions of the scapula were recorded with the right arm elevated at 0 degrees, 40 degrees, 80 degrees, 120 degrees and 160 degrees in the sagittal plane. Palpation and subsequent digitisation of anatomical landmarks on scapula and thorax were done at the same positions. Scapular 3D orientation was also computed during 10 repeated movements of arm elevation between 0 degrees and 180 degrees. Significant differences in scapular kinematics were seen between static positions and palpation when considering anterior/posterior tilt and upward/downward rotation at angles over 120 degrees of humeral elevation and only at 120 degrees for internal/external rotation. There was no significant difference between positions computed during static positions and during the movement for the three scapular orientations. A rotation correction model is presented in order to reduce the errors between static position and palpation measurement.", "paper_title": "Difference between palpation and optoelectronics recording of scapular motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000274221500005"}
