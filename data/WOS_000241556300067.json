Intra-operative detection of 5-ALA induced PpIX fluorescence provides useful information for tumor detection. The wavelength of the micro laser is 2.8 mu m close to the absorption band of water. This laser is effective only on the surface of brain tissue, enabling precise ablation at the boundary between tumor and normal tissue identified by intra-operative 5-ALA induced fluorescence. Combination tests of the fluorescence measurement and the laser ablation were performed, and it was possible to extract the area with fluorescence appropriately from the measurement data, and the micro laser with automatically scanning selectively ablated the extracted area.", "paper_title": "A novel robotic laser ablation system for precision neurosurgery with Intraoperative 5-ALA-Induced PpIX fluorescence detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300067"}
