Emotional decision-making model is also presented according to mood updating equation and emotion updating equation and it is used for facial expression synthesis. The model constructed can reasonably reflect the law of changes of human emotions and the wave process of the mood state and emotion state of people with introversive or extroversive personality under external stimuli of five single-attribute signals and multi-attribute signal. A facial expression robot is built to work as the experiment platform to produce expression outputs. The simulation results demonstrate that the affective model can better simulate the dynamic process of the change of emotion and mood and provide a new mechanism for the affective decision-making of human-computer interaction systems.", "paper_title": "Affective transfer computing model based on attenuation emotion mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000309997800002"}
