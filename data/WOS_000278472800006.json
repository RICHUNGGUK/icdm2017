In particular, we examine the example of multivariate regression in a Bayesian setting. We compare the computation time for using the Gibbs sampler both with and without the sufficient statistic. We show that the difference in computation time grows quadratically with the number of covariates and products and linearly with the number of individuals. In the simulation study, speedup factors ranging from at least 20 times to almost 300 times were observed when using the Kronecker sufficient statistic.", "paper_title": "Multivariate sufficient statistics using Kronecker products", "paper_id": "WOS:000278472800006"}
