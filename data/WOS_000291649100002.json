Current methods of signal control policy are based on the junction topography and prespecified static traffic volumes. However, the actual daily traffic volumes can be affected by many time-dependent factors making a static policy hardly optimal. In this paper, we induce nonstationary predictive models of traffic flow by applying novel methods of time-series data mining to the traffic sensors data collected from a signalized intersection in Jerusalem over a period of 3 years. Our methodology for modeling dynamic traffic volumes combines clustering and segmentation algorithms. The results of a case study based on real-world traffic data demonstrate that a dynamic signal policy using the data mining approach can produce a decrease of about 33.7% in the total waiting time of drivers during 1 year, in comparison to the existing static traffic policy. The resulting savings for this junction only would be about 13,800 driving hours, which are worth of about $ 52,000 per annum in terms of Israeli economy.
