The K-NN is essential for many applications such as information retrieval and visualization, machine learning and data mining. The exponential growth of data imposes to find approximate approaches to this problem. Permutation-based indexing is one of the most recent techniques for approximate similarity search. Objects are represented by permutation lists ordering their distances to a set of selected reference objects, following the idea that two neighboring objects have the same surrounding. In this paper, we propose a novel quantized representation of permutation lists with its related data structure for effective retrieval on single and multicore architectures. Our novel permutation-based indexing strategy is built to be fast, memory efficient and scalable. This is experimentally demonstrated in comparison to existing proposals using several large-scale datasets of millions of documents and of different dimensions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
