The model stands on logic positions and brings a degree of logical proving into advanced microscopic models of road traffic. The future improvement of microscopic simulation is possible only by improvement of driver's behavior models, applying mental models of human drivers. The works are based on many sources: robotics, mathematical logic, cognitive science, computer science (ontologies, object oriented representation), and psychological researches from the fields of mental capacity, human problem solving, etc.", "paper_title": "The application of behavioral features model to road traffic modeling and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000254356900007"}
