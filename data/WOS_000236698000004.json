We also give an analytic solution of the equations, and some closed expressions for these thresholds, in an expansion around large K. The stability of the solution is also computed. For any K, the satisfiability threshold is found to be in the stable region of the solution, which adds further credit to the conjecture that this computation gives the exact satisfiability threshold.
