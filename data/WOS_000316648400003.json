There can be more than polynomially many subfields. We introduce the notion of generating subfields, a set of up to n subfields whose intersections give the rest. We provide an efficient algorithm which uses linear algebra in k or lattice reduction along with factorization in any extension of K. Implementations show that previously difficult cases can now be handled. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Generating subfields", "paper_id": "WOS:000316648400003"}
