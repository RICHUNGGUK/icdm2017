We show the guidelines to connect this network to internet using the 6LowPAN standard with a real prototype in the evolution of the Internet of Things. We assign a unique IPv6 address to the different nodes (motes) of the network. Gatherer is based on TinyOS using IPv6 and UDP protocols and allows the data gathering of temperature and relative humidity from the different motes, requesting specific data from individual motes when required, increasing the accuracy of the measures. We compare the performance of our IPv6-based proposed application against others and show the benefits of the client/server architecture defined.", "paper_title": "Gatherer: an environmental monitoring application based on IPv6 using wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000324303000006"}
