These approaches are generalizations of the Kohonen's self-organizing maps, a class of artificial neural networks. On several examples we show advantages of using non-linear objects for data approximation in comparison to the linear ones. We propose four numerical criteria for comparing linear and non-linear mappings of datasets into the spaces of lower dimension. The examples are taken from comparative political science, from analysis of high-throughput data in molecular biology, from analysis of dynamical systems.", "paper_title": "PRINCIPAL MANIFOLDS AND GRAPHS IN PRACTICE: FROM MOLECULAR BIOLOGY TO DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278826800005"}
