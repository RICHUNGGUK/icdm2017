This study terms this kind of customer behaviour as 'customer flexibility' and attempts to optimally solve the challenging problem of supplier selection and order allocation incorporating customer flexibility. A new mixed integer programming model is developed to maximise manufacturer's total profit. Due to the complexity and non-deterministic polynomial-time -hard nature of the problem, a novel hybrid constraint programming (CP) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm 'CP-SA' is developed to solve the problem optimally. Extensive computational experiments clearly demonstrate its excellent performance.", "paper_title": "Optimal supplier selection and order allocation for multi-product manufacturing featuring customer flexibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000353969100004"}
