This leads to increasingly pessimistic design as technology scaling introduces increasingly significant parametric variations that result in an increasing performance variability. Alternatively, by allowing computations in a logic stage to complete in a variable number of clock cycles, variable-latency design provides relaxed timing constraints for average performance, area, and power consumption optimization. In this article, we present improved variable-latency design techniques including: (1) a generic minimum-intrusion variable-latency VLSI design paradigm, (2) a signal probability-based approximate prediction logic construction method for minimum misprediction rate at minimum cost, and (3) an application-specific cross-layer analysis methodology. Our experiments show that the proposed variable-latency design methodology on average reduces the computation latency by 26.80%(14.65%) at cost of 0.08%(3.4%) area and 0.4%(2.2%) energy consumption increase for the interger (floating point) unit of an open-source SPARC V8 processor LEON2 synthesized with a clock-cycle time between 1.97ns(3.49ns) and 5.96ns(13.74ns) based on the 45nm Nangate open cell library, while an automotive application-specific design further achieves an average latency reduction of 41.8%.", "paper_title": "Application-Specific Cross-Layer Optimization Based on Predictive Variable-Latency VLSI Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000361670400002"}
