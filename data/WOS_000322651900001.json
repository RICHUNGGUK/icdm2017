Appropriate selection of active CB nodes and cluster is needed each time to perform CB. The nodes are modeled in circular array location in order to consider it as a circular antenna array (CAA). This newly proposed circular collaborative beamforming (CCB) is further presented to solve two different objectives, that is, sidelobe level (SLL) suppression and first null beamwidth (FNBW). Analyses obtained are compared to those from previous work. The findings demonstrate a better CB performance of intelligent capability, and the difference is shown in normalized power characteristic.", "paper_title": "Circular Collaborative Beamforming for Improved Radiation Beampattern in WSN", "paper_id": "WOS:000322651900001"}
