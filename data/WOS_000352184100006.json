Further, control is typically discussed in terms of the use of portfolios of control comprised of both formal (outcome and behavior) and informal (clan and self) mechanisms. Yet, the extent to which formal and informal controls individually relate to both performance and each other is still not fully established. This research utilizes meta-analysis to examine these relationships. The results indicate that control does enhance performance, although the strength of the relationship varies across types of control and different measures of performance. The results also show a significant relationship between formal and informal control modes, providing support for views of complementarities between modes within portfolios of control. It appears, however; that only clan control is positively associated with formal control. Building on these findings we suggest future directions for the study of control in ISD.", "paper_title": "EFFECT OF CONTROL ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PERFORMANCE: A META-ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000352184100006"}
