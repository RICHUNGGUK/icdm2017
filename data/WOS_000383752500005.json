ISA is considered as combination of knowledge and behavior, and called computed ISA. Knowledge and behavior is assessed using vocabulary test and scenario based questions, whereas perceived ISA (PISA) is measured on 5-point Liker type question. The application of t-test and Cohen's d values show that both the genders differ significantly from each other in their Knowledge, Behavior, computed ISA and PISA. In comparison to female students, male students are found better in terms of aforementioned variables. The study also shows that unlike male students, female students prefer to utilize their social circle to accumulate information security knowledge. Moreover, the male students prefer to learn security related issues by self-exploration, whereas, the female students prefer formal educational methods for similar learning.", "paper_title": "Observations on Genderwise Differences among University Students in Information Security Awareness", "paper_id": "WOS:000383752500005"}
