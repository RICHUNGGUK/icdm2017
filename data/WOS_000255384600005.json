Independent checkpointing and coordinated checkpointing have been widely used in the design of fault-tolerant mobile agent systems, but CIC has not attracted much attention. CIC is flexible, efficient, and scalable, which is desirable for mobile agent (MA) systems. Furthermore, CIC can be well integrated with independent checkpointing for reliable MA migrations. In this paper, we propose two CIC-based checkpointing algorithms for MA systems. The Basic-CIC algorithm is developed by applying the classic CIC technique to MA systems, while the deferred message processing-based CIC (DM-CIC) improves the time efficiency by deciding when to make the forced checkpointing. Simulation results show that DM-CIC is stable and can help the system recover fast from failures.
