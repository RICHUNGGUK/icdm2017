Multi Relaxation Time (MRT) and Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) was used to simulate lid-driven cavity flows at different cavity aspect ratios (1-3 cavity width depth) and the parallel computing platform is NVIDIA Tesla (TM) C2050 GPU. An amplitude coefficient is used to quantify the oscillation of the unsteady solutions. With the increase of the cavity depths, the first Hopf bifurcation Reynolds number decreases. Also, the efficiency of the GPU implementation is investigated. In the present study, the maximum GPU speed-up is 20.4 times faster than its Intel Core (TM) i7-920 CPU counterpart.
