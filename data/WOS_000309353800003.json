This paper surveys structures for representing Hamiltonian cycles, the use of these structures in heuristic optimization techniques, and efficient mapping of these structures along with respective operators to a newly proposed electrooptical vector by matrix multiplication (VMM) architecture. Record keeping mechanisms are used to improve solution quality and execution time of these heuristics using the VMM. Finally, the utility of a low-power VMM based implementation is evaluated.", "paper_title": "Parallel decomposition of combinatorial optimization problems using electro-optical vector by matrix multiplication architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000309353800003"}
