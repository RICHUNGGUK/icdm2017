The goal of this work is to introduce a neural network-based CAD method of lung nodule diagnosis by combining morphometry and perfusion characteristics by perfusion CT. Compared with previous methods, the proposed approach has the following distinctive features. Firstly, this work develops a very efficient semi-automatic procedure to segment entire nodules. Secondly, reliable nodule classification can be achieved by using only two time-point perfusion CT feature measures (precontrast and 90 s). This greatly reduces the amount of radiation exposure to patients and the data processing time. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is compared with those of several previously developed CAD methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
