The proposed controller uses the linear quadratic regulator method and its Riccati equation is considered as an adaptive function. The tracking error of the proposed controller is guaranteed to be asymptotically stable. A simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Stable optimal control applied to a cylindrical robotic arm", "paper_id": "WOS:000331638400043"}
