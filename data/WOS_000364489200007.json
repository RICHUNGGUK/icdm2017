A new targeted fully homomorphic encryption scheme based on the discrete logarithm problem is presented. Public-key encryption cryptosystems are classified to examine homomorphic encryption. Without employing techniques proposed by Gentry such as somewhat homomorphic and bootstrapping techniques, or relinearization technique proposed by Brakerski et al., a new method called \"Double Decryption Algorithm\" is employed in our cryptography to satisfy a fully or targeted fully homomorphic property. Inspired by ElGamal and BGN cryptography, we obtain the desired fully homomorphic property by selecting a new group and adding an extra component to the ciphertext. Proof of semantic security is also demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Targeted Fully Homomorphic Encryption Based on a Double Decryption Algorithm for Polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000364489200007"}
