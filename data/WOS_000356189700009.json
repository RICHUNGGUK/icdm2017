The phase stability of A(2)Ni(21)B(6) and Ce3Pd20Si6 is tested by high temperature disturbance under the control of the inverted potentials. The calculated lattice parameters are corresponding to the experimental results. We have calculated the magnetic properties and electronic density of states of Ce3Pd20Si6 compounds. Furthermore, the phonon density of states of A(2)Ni(21)B(6) and Ce3Pd20Si6, the according specific heat and vibrational entropy are calculated first, and a qualitative analysis with pair potentials is also carried out.
