A behavior trustworthiness analysis method of business process based on induction information is presented in the paper. Firstly, aimed to the internal factors, we analyze the consistent behavior relativity to guarantee the predictable function. Then, for the external factors, in order to analyze the behavior change of business process, we propose a process mining methods based on induction information. Finally, experiment simulation is given out, and compares our method with genetic process mining methods. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that our method is better than the genetic process mining method.", "paper_title": "The Trustworthiness Analyzing of Interacting Business Process Based on the Induction Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000295127500017"}
