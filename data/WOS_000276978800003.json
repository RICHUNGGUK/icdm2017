The solution provides a natural means of interaction enabling a motion parallax effect in applications. The algorithm considers the characteristics of mobile use-constrained computational resources and varying environmental conditions. The solution is based on color comparisons and works on images gathered from the front camera of a device. In addition to color comparisons, the coherency of the facial pixels is considered in the algorithm. Several applications are also demonstrated in this work, which use the face position to determine the viewpoint in a virtual scene, or for browsing large images. The accuracy of the system is tested under different environmental conditions such as lighting and background, and the performance of the system is measured in different types of mobile devices. According to these measurements the system allows for accurate (7% RMS error) face tracking in real time (20-100 fps).", "paper_title": "A color-based face tracking algorithm for enhancing interaction with mobile devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000276978800003"}
