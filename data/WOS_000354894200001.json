For this, we propose an initial resource allocation algorithm followed by a fault-tolerance protocol. The proposed fault-tolerance protocol is based on the passive replication of stateful operators in queries. We provide theoretical analyses of the proposed algorithms and consolidate our analyses with the simulations.", "paper_title": "Fault-tolerant resource allocation for query processing in grid environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000354894200001"}
