Double as are utilized to construct the rough margin for rough nu-SVR instead of single : for the classical nu-SVR, and this rough margin consisting of positive region, boundary region, and negative region yields the feasible set of the rough nu-SVR larger than that of the classical nu-SVR, which makes the objective function of the rough nu-SVR not more than that of the classical nu-SVR. This may lead to the improvement of the performance. Meantime, experimental results on benchmark data sets confirm the validation and feasibility of our proposed rough nu-SVR. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
