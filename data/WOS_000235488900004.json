Most of the systems require 0(log it) hops per lookup request with 0(log it) neighbors per node, where n is the network size. In this paper, we present a constant-degree P2P architecture, namely Cycloid, which emulates a cube-connected cycles (CCC) graph in the routing of lookup requests. It achieves a time complexity of O(d) per lookup request by using O(l) neighbors per node, where n = d x 2(d). We compare Cycloid with other two constant-degree systems, Viceroy and Koorde in various architectural aspects via simulation. Simulation results show that Cycloid has more advantages for large scale and dynamic systems that have frequent node arrivals and departures. In particular, Cycloid delivers a higher location efficiency in the average case and exhibits a more balanced distribution of keys and query loads between the node.,,. (D (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
