A large number of location cloaking algorithms have been proposed for protecting the location privacy of mobile users. In this paper, we consider the scenario where different location-based query requests are continuously issued by mobile users while they are moving. We show that most of the existing k-anonymity location cloaking algorithms are concerned with snapshot user locations only and cannot effectively prevent location-dependent attacks when users' locations are continuously updated. Therefore, adopting both the location k-anonymity and cloaking granularity as privacy metrics, we propose a new incremental clique-based cloaking algorithm, called ICliqueCloak, to defend against location-dependent attacks. The main idea is to incrementally maintain maximal cliques needed for location cloaking in an undirected graph that takes into consideration the effect of continuous location updates. Thus, a qualified clique can be quickly identified and used to generate the cloaked region when a new request arrives. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed ICliqueCloak algorithm are validated by a series of carefully designed experiments. The experimental results also show that the price paid for defending against location-dependent attacks is small.", "paper_title": "Protecting Location Privacy against Location-Dependent Attacks in Mobile Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000305900500012"}
