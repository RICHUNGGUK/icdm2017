However, PMIPv6 supports the mobility management via centralized anchors, which leads to many obvious shortcomings, such as sub-optimal routing, scalability and single point of failure issue. Besides, it remains an open issue how to deal with the inter-domain handover for PMIPv6 while keeping optimal routing and low signaling costs as well as supporting multicast efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel Prefix-Aggregation based Distributed Management Scheme for PMIPv6 (PA-DMSP), in which all the Local Mobility Anchors (LMAs) distributed in the extended home network are connected to each other via the global tunnel and announce their aggregated prefix to the Internet. By using the IP anycast routing, the signaling messages and data packets destined to any IP address that belongs to the aggregated prefix can be transmitted to the topologically closest LMA, which indicates that the optimized routing can always be achieved. Besides, the distributed LMA management scheme enables the inter-domain handover and eliminates the scalability and single point of failure issue. Moreover, PA-DMSP also proposes the multicast source mobility and receiver mobility support schemes. Our analysis verifies the better performance of PA-DMSP in terms of the signaling costs when compared with other baseline schemes. In addition, PA-DMSP can significantly improve the scalability in terms of reducing the number of LMA's routing entries.", "paper_title": "A Novel Prefix-Aggregation Based Distributed Management Scheme for PMIPv6", "paper_id": "WOS:000325239100001"}
