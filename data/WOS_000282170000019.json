The input to SPRINT is a list of protein structures, the rotamers modeled for each structure and the pre-calculated rotamer energies. Probabilistic inference is performed using the belief propagation or A* algorithms, and dead-end elimination can be applied as pre-processing. The output can either be a list of amino acid sequences simultaneously compatible with these structures, or probabilistic amino acid profiles compatible with the structures. In addition, higher order ( e. g. pairwise) amino acid probabilities can also be predicted. Finally, SPRINT also has a module for protein side-chain prediction and single-state design.", "paper_title": "SPRINT: side-chain prediction inference toolbox for multistate protein design", "paper_id": "WOS:000282170000019"}
