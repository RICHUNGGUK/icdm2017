Because it has been reported that good alignment cannot guarantee successful clinical outcomes, the soft tissue balance should be checked together with the alignment. Finite element models of patients' lower extremities were developed to analyse the medial and lateral contact force distribution on the tibial insert. The distributions for four out of five patients were not balanced equally, even though the alignment angles were within a clinically acceptable range. Moreover, the distribution was improved by changing soft tissue release and ligament tightening for the specific case. Integration of the biomechanical modelling, image matching and finite element analysis techniques with the patient-specific properties and various dynamic loading would suggest a clinically relevant pre-operative planning for soft tissue balancing.", "paper_title": "Quantification of soft tissue balance in total knee arthroplasty using finite element analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000337528400009"}
