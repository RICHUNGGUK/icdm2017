We employ a semi-implicit time discretization which leads to the solution of a sequence of linear algebraic systems. We develop an efficient strategy for the solution of these systems. It is based on a simple adaptive technique for the choice of the time step and a relatively weak stopping criterion for iterative linear algebraic solvers. The presented numerical experiments show that the proposed strategy is efficient for steady-state problems using various grids, polynomial degrees of approximations and flow regimes. Finally, we apply this strategy with a minor modification to an unsteady flow. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
