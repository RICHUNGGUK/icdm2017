But, Most of studies have been restricted to the linear elasticity problem. In this context, this study intends to explore its applicability to the non-linear solid mechanics, through the 2-D large deformation analysis of nearly incompressible bodies. The non-linear natural element approximation is implemented by the linearized total Lagrangian mixed u-p formulation incorporated with the penalty method. Numerical results illustrating the theoretical work are also presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
