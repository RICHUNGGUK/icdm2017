Based on the former, a direct fuzzy logic controller is designed, and on the latter, a new fuzzy controller incorporating the implication logic is designed. Three sets of relevant numerical simulation are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes through comparison.", "paper_title": "Extended fuzzy logic controller for high speed train", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600015"}
