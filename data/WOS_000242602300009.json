This paper describes a feature extraction method called semantic mapping. Semantic mapping, sparse random mapping and PCA are applied to self-organization of document collections using self-organizing map (SOM). The behaviors of the methods on projection of binary and tfidf document vector representations are compared. The classification error generated by SOM maps on text categorization of the K I collection was used to compare the performance of the methods. Semantic mapping generated better document representation than sparse random mapping. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
