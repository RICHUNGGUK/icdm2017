However, advanced searching for resources remains an open issue. The flooding technique used by some Peer-to-Peer systems is expensive in bandwidth usage, and it shows a serious lack in scalability. Also, more efficient systems based on distributed hash tables (DHT) lack in query expressiveness and flexibility. This paper addresses this issue by discussing existing solutions, and proposing a novel approach to support advanced multi-keyword queries in the context of Peer-to-Peer systems. It extends the existing, and widely established, DHT-based localization frameworks. This new approach can substantially reduce the bandwidth consumption and improve the load balancing over the network.", "paper_title": "Enhancing the P2P protocols to support advanced multi-keyword queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800053"}
