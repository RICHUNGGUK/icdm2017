Models have been developed that allow photorealistic rendering of trees at interactive frame rates. However, little attention has been devoted to expressive rendering of these models. In this work we present a multiresolution model designed specifically to speed up painterly rendering of trees. Our method proposes a novel clustering technique based on the computation of nested convex hulls. We employ variable multiresolution to obtain efficient models that contain higher resolution representations for the outside of the tree and lower resolution representations for the inner parts. This variable multiresolution method mimics the techniques used by traditional artists to paint trees.", "paper_title": "A multiresolution model for non-photorealistic rendering of trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400041"}
