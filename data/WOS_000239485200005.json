Our novel similarity metric incorporates both knowledge about the current observations and information gained from previous registration results and combines the relative influence of these two types of information in a principled way. We show that in the absence of prior information, the method reduces approximately to the popular entropy minimization approach of registration and we provide a theoretical comparison of incorporating prior information in our and other currently existing methods. We also demonstrate experimental results on real images.", "paper_title": "Multi-modal image registration using dirichlet-encoded prior information", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485200005"}
