Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the position and the velocity of each agent can converge to those of the virtual leader respectively, when the network is connected and at least one agent is informed, without any global information of the multi-agent system. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to verify the theoretical results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
