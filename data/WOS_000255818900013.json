These parameters are recovered from two images of the same scene acquired by a camera evolving in time and/or space and for which the intrinsic parameters are known. Using limited Taylor's expansion one of the images (and its partial derivatives) is expressed as a function of the partial derivatives of the two images, the blur difference, the affine parameters and a continuous parameter derived from homotopy methods. All of these unknowns can thus be directly computed by resolving a system of equations at a single scale. The proposed algorithm is tested using synthetic and real images. The results confirm that dense and accurate estimation of the previously mentioned parameters can be obtained. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
