Implementing networks, which use contrastive divergence as the learning algorithm on neuromorphic hardware, can be beneficial for real-time hardware interfacing, power efficient hardware and scalability. Neuromorphic hardware which uses memristors as synapses is one of the most promising areas to achieve the above-mentioned goals. This paper presents a restricted Boltzmann machine which uses a two memristor model to emulate synaptic weights and achieves learning using contrastive divergence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
