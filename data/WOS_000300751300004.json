A job is delivered on the earliest fixed delivery date that is no earlier than its completion time. The flowtime of a job is defined as its delivery date. The objective is to minimize the total weighted flowtime of the jobs. The largest ratio first (LRF) rule is a heuristic that sequences jobs in non-increasing order of w(j)/p(j), where p(j) and w(j) are the processing time and weight of job J(j), respectively. We investigate the performance bounds of the LRF heuristic under different scenarios of the problem. We conducted computational experiments to test the performance of the heuristic. The results show that the LRF heuristic is able to produce near-optimal and optimal solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
