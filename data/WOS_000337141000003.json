The generalized Lax conjecture states that this is always possible. We use generalized Clifford algebras for a new approach to the problem. Our main result is that if is not a sum of hermitian squares in the Clifford algebra of a hyperbolic polynomial, then its hyperbolicity cone is spectrahedral. Our result also has computational applications, since this sufficient condition can be checked with a single semidefinite program.", "paper_title": "Hyperbolic Polynomials and Generalized Clifford Algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000337141000003"}
