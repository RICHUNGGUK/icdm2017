Moreover, the homotopy-pade technique is employed to accelerate the convergence of solution series of traditional HAM. Results show that the second-order approximation by the OHAM is quick convergence and more accurate than the high-order of approximation by the homotopy-pade technique. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
