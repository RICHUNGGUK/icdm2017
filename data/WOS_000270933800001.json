Classification proceeds in two steps. Classification rules are first built by analyzing traffic traces, and then the classification rules are evaluated using test data. In this paper, we use self-organizing map and K-means clustering as unsupervised machine learning methods to identify the inherent classes in traffic traces. Three clusters were discovered, corresponding to transactional, bulk data transfer, and interactive applications. The K-nearest neighbor classifier was found to be highly accurate for the traffic data and significantly better compared to a minimum mean distance classifier.", "paper_title": "Classification of Traffic Flows into QoS Classes by Unsupervised Learning and KNN Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000270933800001"}
