The distinction can be broadly summarized as analysis versus synthesis, or explanation versus design. I compare and contrast these uses, and discuss sufficiency and necessity in simulations in general and in multi-agent systems in particular, with a computer science audience in mind.", "paper_title": "Analysis and synthesis: multi-agent systems in the social sciences", "paper_id": "WOS:000303835000002"}
