Based on the idea that different services may require different signal-to-interference ratios and different reuse factors, we proposed a channel allocation scheme called channel partitioning to support different services using different reuse factors. Under channel partitioning scheme, the channels in each cell are divided into two or more sets of channels and each set of the channels supports certain service, depending on the required reuse factor of the service. We first apply this channel partitioning with fixed channel allocation scheme called fixed channel partitioning (FCP), where a three-dimensional Markov chain is developed to analyze the impact of the mobile user. After that a simpler model, which can estimate the numeric result from the closed-form solution, is presented to make the analysis easier. In order to cater for the traffic variation between services and between cells, a dynamic channel partitioning with flexible channel combination scheme, called FDCP, is proposed to support multiple services. This FDCP tries to minimize the effect of assigned channels on the availability of channels for use in the interfering cells. The analysis and the simulation results show that for equal arrival rate of two services, the proposed FCP and FDCP scheme can provide about 32% and 54% improvement, respectively, in terms of grade of service as compared with conventional FCA scheme using a single reuse factor to support two services for the mobile users.
