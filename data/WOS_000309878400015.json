Electricity load forecasting is a challenging task because electric load has complex and nonlinear relationships with several factors. In this paper, two hybrid models are developed for short-term load forecasting (STLF). These models use \"ant colony optimization (ACO)\" and \"combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and ACO (GA-ACO)\" for feature selection and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for hourly load prediction. Weather and climatic conditions, month, season, day of the week, and time of the day are considered as load-influencing factors in this study. Using load time-series of a regional power system, the performance of ACO + MLP and GA-ACO + MLP hybrid models is compared with principal component analysis (PCA) + MLP hybrid model and also with the case of no-feature selection (NFS) when using MLP and radial basis function (RBF) neural models. Experimental results and the performance comparison with similar recent researches in this field show that the proposed GA-ACO + MLP hybrid model performs better in load prediction of 24-h ahead in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).", "paper_title": "Neural-based electricity load forecasting using hybrid of GA and ACO for feature selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000309878400015"}
