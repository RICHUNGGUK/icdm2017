Simplex architecture was designed to tolerate control software design and implementation. This architecture consists of a high assurance controller (HAC) and a high performance controller (HPC). The HAC uses the linear state feedback control to create a large maximum stability region (MSR). The HPC aims at achieving a better control performance and may use any design. However, the plant's states under HPC must stay within the MSR, or the control is switched to HAC. The paper extends Simplex architecture from a single node control system to a networked control system, where the stability analysis of this networked Simplex (NetSimplex) must address the challenge of computing the networked system's MSR (NetMSR) under both network delays and varying parameters. A simulation study of a satellite attitude control system is carried out to examine the efficacy of NetSimplex architecture.", "paper_title": "NetSimplex: Controller Fault Tolerance Architecture in Networked Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000312839600037"}
