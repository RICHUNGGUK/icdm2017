With the arrival of wireless multimedia sensor networks, traffic can be composed of time sensitive packets and reliability-demanding packets. In such situations, some works also take into account link reliability to provide probabilistic QoS. The trade-off between the guarantee of the QoS requirements and the network lifetime remains an open issue, especially in large scale WSNs. This paper proposes a promising multipath QoS routing protocol based on a separation of the nodes into two sub-networks: the first part includes specific nodes that are occasionally involved in routing decisions, while the remaining nodes in the second sub-network fully take part in them. The QoS routing is formulated as an optimization problem that aims to extend the network lifetime subject to QoS constraints. Using the percolation theory, a routing algorithm is designed to solve the problem on the respective sub-networks. Simulation results show the efficiency of this novel approach in terms of average end-to-end delays, on-time packet delivery ratio, and network lifetime. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
