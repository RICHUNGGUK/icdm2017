Erdos, Faudree and Sos conjectured that every c-Ramsey graph with n vertices contains Q(n(5/2)) induced subgraphs, any two of which differ either in the number of vertices or in the number of edges, i.e., the number of distinct pairs (vertical bar V(H)vertical bar, vertical bar E(H)vertical bar), as H ranges over all induced subgraphs of G, is Omega(n(5/2)). We prove an Q(n(2.3693)) lower bound.", "paper_title": "Sizes of Induced Subgraphs of Ramsey Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000267310400001"}
