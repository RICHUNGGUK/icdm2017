As a result, it is convenient and efficient to implement. The scheme is also secure against several common attacks and gets rid of partial-information leakage due to the revised coding method. Moreover, the quantitative analysis shows that the security can be further improved by using more product states from appropriate multiple sets.", "paper_title": "A SIMPLE AND SECURE QUANTUM SECRET SHARING SCHEME BASED ON PRODUCT STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000304611800006"}
