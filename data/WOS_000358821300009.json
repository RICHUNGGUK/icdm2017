To help understand how the HIV CA proteins self, organize into large assemblies of various Shape; we aim to computationally evaluate the binding affinity:and interfaces in a CA homodimer. We model the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of the CA as rigid bodies and treat the five-residue loop between the two domains as a flexible linker. We adopt a transferrable residue-level coarse-grained energy function to describe the interactions between the protein domains. In seven extensive Monte Carlo simulations with different volumes, a large number of binding/unbinding transitions between the two CA proteins are observed, thus allowing a reliable estimation of the equilibrium probabilities for the dimeric vs monomeric forms. The obtained dissociation constant for the CA homodimer from our simulations, 20-25 mu M, is in reasonable agreement with,experimental measurement. A wide range of binding interfaces, primarily between the NTDs, are identified in the simulations. Although some observed bound structures here closely resemble the major binding interfaces in the capsid assembly, they are statistically insignificant in our simulation trajectories. Our results suggest that although the general purpose energy functions adopted :here could reasonably reproduce the overall binding affinity for the CA homodimer, further adjustment would be needed to accurately represent the relative strength of individual binding interfaces.", "paper_title": "Monte Carlo Simulations of HIV Capsid Protein Homodimer", "paper_id": "WOS:000358821300009"}
