While current computer-aided software engineering tools can aid in creating object models, they do not provide much support in ensuring that the object models created are consistent with the specifications in use case narratives. This paper presents a methodology and a knowledge-based system to facilitate the verification of consistency of a given object model against a set of use case narratives. The methodology is implemented as a prototype knowledge-based extension to an open source CASE tool. The prototype's ability to reliably extract relevant information from use case narratives and its role in verifying the consistency of object models have been evaluated using a laboratory experiment. By analyzing use case narratives utilizing natural language processing techniques and applying collaboration patterns and heuristics, this methodology can determine missing and invalid model elements to guide the analyst in creating object models that are consistent with the requirements specified in a set of use case narratives. The results from this design science research indicate that the prototype system can be a useful tool to assist in this process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
