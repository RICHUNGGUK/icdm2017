A new user may need a general description of the contents available in the database in order to determine if the information is useful for his/her search needs. In this paper we present MTCIR, a system that summarizes the content of a database and provides the user with simple interfaces to access the information. The system uses a visual interface based on multi-term tag clouds, which presents the content of the database and can be used as assistance in the search process. The novelty of this approach is the underlying structure which provides the text with certain semantics and is able to retrieve the most relevant information. We test our proposal in four datasets and discuss the tag clouds obtained and the metrics computed for each of them. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
