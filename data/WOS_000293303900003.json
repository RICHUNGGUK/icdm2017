We explain how the duality between these two systems exactly corresponds to the intensively studied duality between call-by-value systems and call-by-name systems for classical logic. Relying on the uniqueness of the computational behaviour underlying these four logics (intuitionistic, dual-intuitionistic, call-by-value classical and call-by-name classical), we define a generic syntax of nets which can be used for any of these logics.", "paper_title": "Intuitionistic Dual-intuitionistic Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000293303900003"}
