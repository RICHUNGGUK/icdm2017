A particularly difficult part of these systems is the detector, where the optimal maximum-likelihood solution is desirable, but cannot be directly implemented due to its exponential complexity. This paper addresses this challenge and presents a digital circuit design for an 8 x 8 MIMO detection problem. A key feature is the integrated channel preprocessing unit, which performs the channel decomposition functions that are either omitted or performed \"off-line\" in other designs. The proposed device achieves near maximum likelihood bit error rate results at 57.6 Mbps. Other novelties include a high speed sorting mechanism and power saving features.", "paper_title": "A VLSI 8 x 8 MIMO Near-ML Detector with Preprocessing", "paper_id": "WOS:000267367200009"}
