In this article, we present a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the PCTSP. We have adapted and implemented some classical polyhedral results for the PCTSP and derived inequalities from cuts designed for the Orienteering Problem. Computational results on instances with more than 500 vertices are reported. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
