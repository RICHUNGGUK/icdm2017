Such Green's functions have various and practical applications in quantum modelling of electron transport within nano-MOSFET transistors. The proposed method is based on expansions of the eigenfunctions of the subordinate Sturm-Liouville problems and a collocation matching procedure along possibly curved interfaces of the potential blocks. Accurate numerical results are provided to validate the proposed algorithm. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
