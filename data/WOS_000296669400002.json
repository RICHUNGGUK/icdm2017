He can additionally create many replicas of a few compromised nodes and spread these replicas over the network, thus launching further attacks with their help. In order to minimize the damage incurred by compromised and replicated nodes, it is very important to detect such malicious nodes as quickly as possible. In this review article, we synthesize our previous works on node compromise detection in sensor networks while providing the extended analysis in terms of performance comparison to the related work. More specifically, we use the methodology of the sequential analysis to detect static and mobile compromised nodes, as well as mobile replicated nodes in sensor networks. With the help of analytical and simulation results, we also demonstrate that our schemes provide robust and efficient node compromise detection capability. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
