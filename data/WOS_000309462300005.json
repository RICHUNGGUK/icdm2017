In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to constructing photo collage in the hierarchical narrative manner. As opposed to previous methods focusing on spatial coherence in the collage layout, our narrative collage arranges the photos according to the basic narrative elements from literary writings, i.e., character, setting and plot. Face, time and place attributes are exploited to embody those narrative elements in the collage. Then, photos are organized into the hierarchical structure for the multi-level details in the events recorded by the album. Such hierarchical narrative collage can present a visual overview in the chronological order on what happened in the album. Experimental results show that our approach offers a better summarization to browse on the photo album content than previous ones.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Narrative Collage For Digital Photo Album", "paper_id": "WOS:000309462300005"}
