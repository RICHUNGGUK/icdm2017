While the high computational cost of the numerical methods for solving these problems can be tackled by the multiple cores of current processors, we propose to use the disk to store the large data structures associated with these applications. Our results also show that the limited amount of RAM and the comparatively slow disk of the system pose no problem for the solution of very large dense linear systems and linear least-squares problems. Thus, current desktop computers are revealed as an appealing, cost-effective platform for research groups that have to deal with large dense linear algebra problems but have no direct access to large computing facilities.", "paper_title": "Using desktop computers to solve large-scale dense linear algebra problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000296012700002"}
