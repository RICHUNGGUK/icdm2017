Previous results show that SVMs perform well with short training sequences but suffer from two drawbacks that are highly undesirable in real-time applications: the run-time complexity and the block-based learning. To deal with these problems, here we propose a sample-by-sample adaptive algorithm for CDMA systems based on incremental SVMs, incorporating an active learning strategy aimed to reduce the complexity of both the training phase and the final classifier.
