A heterogeneous network is represented by a graph G=(V,E), in which each edge has a weight that denotes the communication time between its two end vertices. The overall delay of a vertex vaV(G), denoted as b(v,G), is the minimum sum of the communication time required to send a message from v to all vertices in G. The broadcast median problem consists of finding the set of vertices vaV(G) with minimum overall delay b(v,G) and determining the value of b(v,G). In this paper, we consider the broadcast median problem following the heterogeneous postal model. Assuming that the underlying graph G is a general graph, we show that computing b(v,G) for an arbitrary vertex vaV(G) is NP-hard. On the other hand, assuming that G is a tree, we propose a linear time algorithm for the broadcast median problem in heterogeneous postal model.", "paper_title": "The broadcast median problem in heterogeneous postal model", "paper_id": "WOS:000317973700010"}
