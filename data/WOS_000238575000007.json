In order to store and efficiently query this information, a video database system (VDBS) is necessary. We propose a structural, event based and multimodal (SEBM) video data model which supports three different modalities that are visual, auditory and textual modalities for VDBSs and we can dissolve these three modalities within a single SEBM model. We answer the content-based, spatio-temporal and fuzzy queries of the user by using SEBM video data model more easily, since SEBM stores the video data as the way that user interprets the real world data. We follow divide and conquer technique when answering very complicated queries. We give the algorithms for querying on SEBM and try them on an implemented SEBM prototype system.", "paper_title": "Flexible querying using structural and event based multimodal video data model", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000007"}
