These concerns may discourage individuals from revealing their sensitive information. Existing data collection techniques have serious downsides in terms of both efficiency and the levels of protection they offer against various realizations of threats. Moreover, they do not provide any flexibility to the users to be able to specify acceptable levels of privacy protection before deciding whether to participate in the surveys. In this paper, we propose a two-pronged privacy protection model corresponding to these two privacy concerns: these are a new efficient anonymity preserving data collection technique and a method to incorporate heterogeneous privacy constraints. Together, they help preserve the privacy of respondents both during and after data collection.", "paper_title": "Freedom of Privacy: Anonymous Data Collection with Respondent-Defined Privacy Protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000280476300010"}
