The semi-supervised learning method based on hypergraph model can achieve multi-semantics labels, but a hypergraph model is sensitive to the radius parameter when it is constructed and the number of vertices belonging to a hyperedge is fixed. In this paper, a semi-supervised incremental learning method based on adaptive probabilistic hypergraph for video semantic detection is presented. In the probabilistic hypergraph modeling, a formula is presented as a measurement to adaptively decide whether a vertex is belonged to a hyperedge or not. The model has high robustness and can overcome the defect of fixed number of vertices belonging to the same hyperedge in the traditional probabilistic hypergraph model. In the semi-supervised incremental learning process, a threshold is defined, which is used to judge whether unlabeled sample can be added into the modeling, in order that the model learning result for unlabeled samples has high certainty. The experimental results show that our method can improve the model generalization ability and utilize the unlabeled samples effectively. In the aspects of recall rate and precision rate for semantic video concept detection from complex videos, our proposed method outperforms the compared methods.", "paper_title": "A semi-supervised incremental learning method based on adaptive probabilistic hypergraph for video semantic detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000358214100007"}
