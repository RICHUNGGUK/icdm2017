Considering that the large amounts of labeled samples are difficult to get in the actual application, we also propose a novel unsupervised scheme based the adaptive classifier to solve this problem. Sufficient experiments are conducted on the datasets from previous Brain-Computer Interface Competitions and the actual on-line EEG data in adaptive scheme. The results demonstrate that the new algorithm is efficiency and robust compared with non-adaptive classifiers. Besides, a couple of analyses are made on the selection of parameters in the adaptive BPR, and some advice has been come up with about their selections. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
