To account for the unavoidable modelling errors and parameter fluctuations, the network parameters are assumed to be time-varying but norm-bounded. Furthermore, scalar multiplicative white noises are introduced into both the translation process and the feedback regulation process in order to reflect the inherent intracellular and extracellular noise perturbations. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a linear state estimator that can estimate the true concentration of the mRNA and the protein of the uncertain GRNs. By resorting to the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method combined with the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, sufficient conditions are first established for ensuring the stochastic stability of the dynamics of the estimation error, and the estimator gains are then designed in terms of the solutions to some LMIs that can be easily solved by using the standard numerical software. A three-node GRN is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed design procedures.", "paper_title": "Robust state estimation for stochastic genetic regulatory networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273489600005"}
