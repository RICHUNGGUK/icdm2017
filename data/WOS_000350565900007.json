The preliminary concern for PCM applicability is its limited write endurance that results in fast wear-out of memory cells. Worse, process variation in the deep-nanometer regime increases the variation in cell lifetime, resulting in an early and sudden reduction in main memory capacity due to the wear-out of a few cells. Recent studies have proposed redirection or correction schemes to alleviate this problem, but all suffer poor throughput or latency. In this article, we show that one of the inefficiency sources in current schemes, even when wear-leveling algorithms are used, is the nonuniform write endurance limit incurred by process variation, that is, when some memory pages have reached their endurance limit, other pages may be far from their limit. In this line, we present a technique that aims to displace a faulty page to a healthy page. This technique, called On-Demand Page Paired PCM (OD3P, for short), when applied at page level, can improve PCM time-to-failure by 20% on average for different multithreaded and multiprogrammed workloads while also improving IPC by 14% on average compared to previous page-level techniques. The comparison between line-level OD3P and previous line-level techniques reveals about 2x improvement of lifetime and performance.", "paper_title": "Prolonging Lifetime of PCM-Based Main Memories through On-Demand Page Pairing", "paper_id": "WOS:000350565900007"}
