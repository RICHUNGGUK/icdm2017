In this paper, we propose a mobile cloud based architecture for enabling remote-resident multimedia service discovery and access. The main considered issues in the paper includes: security, cloud-based storage, cloud-based remote service discovery and control, REST-based lightweight negotiation, etc. After that; AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS algorithms are combined for cloud candidate selection optimization. Prototype implementation and theoretical analysis show availability and efficiency of proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Mobile Cloud Based Framework for Remote-Resident Multimedia Discovery and Access", "paper_id": "WOS:000345885500017"}
