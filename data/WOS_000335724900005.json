Most of the existing vehicle recognition algorithms use one sensor node to measure a vehicleaEuro-s signature. However, vehicle speed variation and environmental disturbances usually cause errors during such a process. In this paper we propose a method using multiple sensor nodes to accomplish vehicle recognition. Based on the matching result of one vehicleaEuro-s signature obtained by different nodes, this method determines vehicle status and corrects signature segmentation. The co-relationship between signatures is also obtained, and the time offset is corrected by such a co-relationship. The corrected signatures are fused via maximum likelihood estimation, so as to obtain more accurate vehicle signatures. Examples show that the proposed algorithm can provide input parameters with higher accuracy. It improves the average accuracy of vehicle recognition from 94.0% to 96.1%, and especially the bus recognition accuracy from 77.6% to 92.8%.", "paper_title": "A vehicle re-identification algorithm based on multi-sensor correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000335724900005"}
