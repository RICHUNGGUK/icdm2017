The optimization study took into consideration the physical constraints of the conventional method of treatment, and arrived at an optimized array design with the overall dimensions of 10 cm x 2.2 cm. The optimization study also addressed the following additional parameters: The maximum possible depth of penetration (DOP), the maximum possible steering angle, the Grating lobe level, the operating frequency, and the element size. In optimizing the design, the DOP and the steering angle are maximized while the grating lobe value is minimized. A 56 x 12 element 2-D array was found to be the optimum choice allowing both focusing and steering within the entire prostate without inducing damage at locations other than that of the focal point.", "paper_title": "Optimization of ultrasound array designs for high intensity focused treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia", "paper_id": "WOS:000266092600008"}
