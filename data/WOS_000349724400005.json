In order to apply previous pulse modulations, a fully decoupled position based visual servoing approach (i.e. with block-diagonal interaction matrix) is considered, controlling independently translational and rotational camera motions. These techniques, working at high frequency, could be considered to address the sensor latency problem inherent in visual servoing systems. The expected appearance of ripple due to the concentration of the control action in pulses is quantified and analyzed under simulated scenario. This high frequency ripple does not affect the system performance since it is filtered by the manipulator dynamics. On the contrary it can be seen as a dither signal to minimize the impact of friction and overcome back-lashing. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
