More and more calligraphy works are digitized, preserved and exhibited in digital libraries. Users may want to appreciate the style-similar works simultaneously. However, currently available services such as metadata-based browsing and searching can not satisfy such kind of requirement. To allow users to appreciate the style-similar works conveniently, we propose a Supervised Learning Weighted Random Walk Model to discover calligraphy style relationships. In the model, we consider the heterogeneity of both edges and nodes, and then use some preference pairs to learn the weights of different types of edges in the graph. After the weight learning, the style relationships can be discovered by random walk on the heterogeneous graphs. In order to solve the out-of-graph node problem, we pre-compute the personalized vector for each character or visual word, then utilize the Linearity Theory for vector addition to approximate the relationships between the new node and other nodes in graph. Then we demonstrate several applications which prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model and a user study for benefit verification. Finally, we explore some strategies to enhance the performance with the explicit or implicit user interaction including feedback, clickthrough data tracking.", "paper_title": "Discovering calligraphy style relationships by Supervised Learning Weighted Random Walk Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000269011000002"}
