SVM is trained to memorize relationship between the watermark and the image-dependent watermark other than embedding watermark into the host image. While needing to authenticate the ownership of the image, the trained SVM is used to recover the watermark and then the recovered watermark is compared with the original watermark to determine the ownership. Meanwhile, the robustness can be enhanced using a-trimmed mean operator against attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the technique not only possesses the robustness to resist on image-manipulation attacks under consideration but also, in average, is superior to other existing methods being considered in the paper.
