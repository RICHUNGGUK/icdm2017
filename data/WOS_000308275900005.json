In order to successfully adapt to changes in a dynamic environment the binding mechanism has to be supplemented with cross-modal learning. In this paper we define the problems of high-level binding and cross-modal learning. By these definitions we model a binding mechanism in a Markov logic network and define its role in a cognitive architecture. We evaluate a prototype binding system off-line, using three different inference methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier ay.
