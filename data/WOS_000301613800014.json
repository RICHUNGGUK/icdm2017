We propose a camera parameter independent and perspective distortion invariant approach to detect two types of abnormal crowd behavior. The two typical abnormal activities are people gathering and running. Since people counting is necessary for detecting the abnormal crowd behavior, we present an potential energy-based model to estimate the number of people in public scenes. Building histograms on the X- and Y-axes, respectively, we can obtain probability distribution of the foreground object and then define crowd entropy. We define the Crowd Distribution Index by combining the people counting results with crowd entropy to represent the spatial distribution of crowd. We set a threshold on Crowd Distribution Index to detect people gathering. To detect people running, the kinetic energy is determined by computation of optical flow and Crowd Distribution Index. With a threshold, kinetic energy can be used to detect people running. To test the performance of our algorithm, videos of different scenes and different crowd densities are used in the experiments. Without camera calibration and training data, our method can robustly detect abnormal behaviors with low computation load. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
