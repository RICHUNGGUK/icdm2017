Efficient scheduling of requests to use grid resources must adapt to this dynamic environment while meeting administrative policies. This paper discusses the necessary requirements of such a scheduler and proposes a framework that can administrate grid policies and schedule complex and data intensive scientific applications. We present early experimental results for proposed a framework that effectively utilizes other grid infrastructure such as work-flow management systems and execution systems. These results demonstrate that proposed a framework can effectively schedule work across a large number of distributed clusters that are owned by multiple units in a virtual organization.", "paper_title": "A scheduling middleware for data intensive applications on a grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100134"}
