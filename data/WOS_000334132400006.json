This result is the culmination of a series of previous partial results, finally establishing the equivalence (up to a polynomial) of many space complexity classes defined in terms of P systems and Turing machines. The equivalence we obtained also allows a number of classic computational complexity theorems, such as Savitch's theorem and the space hierarchy theorem, to be directly translated into statements about membrane systems.
