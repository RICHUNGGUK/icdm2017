An important issue in NoC design is how to map an application on this architecture and how to determine the hardware/software partition that satisfies the performance, cost and flexibility requirements. In this paper, we propose an approach that concurrently optimizes the mapping and the partitioning of streaming applications. The proposed approach exploits multiobjective evolutionary algorithms that are fed by execution performances scores corresponding to the evaluated mappings and partitioning ability to pipeline execution of the streaming application. As result, most promising solutions are highlighted for mapping multimedia applications onto a SoC architecture interconnecting 16 nodes through 2D-Mesh and Ring NoC. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
