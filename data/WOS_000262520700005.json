Next we. derive a theory yielding into the definition of inner structure of the measuring signal/device that performs resolution beyond Heisenberg's limit. The mathematical theory can he repeated again and again and the computing algorithm can be designed to achieve the predefined resolution precision. At the end of paper; some application examples are introduced.", "paper_title": "INVESTIGATION TO HEISENBERG'S UNCERTAINTY LIMIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000262520700005"}
