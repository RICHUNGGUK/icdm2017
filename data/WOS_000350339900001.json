In this model, the influence of density change caused by large pressure difference can be overcome by replacing density distribution function with pressure distribution function. A more simple processing format for external force is introduced so as to make the involved method in this paper more perfect. The coupling between flow velocity and pressure also can be significantly reduced when calculating the macroscopic quantities. Good agreement between the analytical solution and numerical results is also obtained based on this model and it also can provide guidance for other problem with such complicated force forms.", "paper_title": "Incompressible lattice Boltzmann model for axisymmetric flows through porous media", "paper_id": "WOS:000350339900001"}
