This phenomenon occurs frequently in vivo and has been implicated in biological processes, such as replication, transcription, recombination and translocation. SIST is a software package that analyzes sequence- dependent structural transitions in kilobase length superhelical DNA molecules. The numerical algorithms in SIST are based on a statistical mechanical model that calculates the equilibrium probability of transition for each base pair in the domain. They are extensions of the original stress-induced duplex destabilization SIDD) method, which analyzes stress-driven DNA strand separation. SIST also includes algorithms to analyze B-Z transitions and cruciform extrusion. The SIST pipeline has an option to use the DZCBtrans algorithm, which analyzes the competition among these three transitions within a superhelical domain.", "paper_title": "SIST: stress-induced structural transitions in superhelical DNA", "paper_id": "WOS:000350058800019"}
