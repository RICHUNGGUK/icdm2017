LIME adopts a coordination perspective inspired by work on the Linda model. The context for computation, represented in Linda by a globally accessible persistent tuple space, is refined in LIME to transient sharing of the identically named tuple spaces carried by individual mobile units. Tuple spaces are also extended with a notion of location and programs are given the ability to react to specified states. The resulting model provides a minimalist set of abstractions that facilitates the rapid and dependable development of mobile applications. In this article we illustrate the model underlying LIME, provide a formal semantic characterization for the operations it makes available to the application developer, present its current design and implementation, and discuss lessons learned in developing applications that involve physical mobility.", "paper_title": "LIME: A coordination model and middleware supporting mobility of hosts and agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000240456500003"}
