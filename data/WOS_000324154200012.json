Here we apply multi-indicator systems in order to describe and characterize the pollution in the South-West of Germany by the metals Lead, Pb, Cadmium, Cd, Zinc, Zn and Sulfur, S. We demonstrate the need of a preprocessing of data, before an analysis towards ranking is possible or meaningful. The univariate clustering method after Ward is applied and analyzed with respect to its robustness by a \"soft bootstrapping procedure\". We show that without the need of numerically aggregated indicators (which may insert a high degree of subjectivism into the analysis) or without performing more complex operations (as in traditional Decision Support Systems such as e.g. PROMETHEE) we can obtain relative orders of regions corresponding to their pollution load. In our example we discuss the pollution by chemicals elements in two biological targets.", "paper_title": "Ranking of Polluted Regions in South West Germany Based on a Multi-indicator System", "paper_id": "WOS:000324154200012"}
