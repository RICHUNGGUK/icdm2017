We often use text/video chat, but there are some problems, such as a lack of communication and anonymity. In this paper, we propose and implement a real-time talking avatar, where we can communicate with each other by synchronizing character's voice and motion from ours while keeping anonymity by using a voice conversion technique. For the voice conversion, we improve accuracy of the voice conversion by specializing to the target character's voice. Finally, we conduct subjective experiments and show the possibility of a new style of communication on the internet.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Talking Avatar on the Internet Using Kinect and Voice Conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000369852000041"}
