Significant insights regarding the stable relational patterns among the entities can be gained by analyzing temporal evolution of the complex entity relations. This can help identify the transitions from one conserved state to the next and may provide evidence to the existence of external factors that are responsible for changing the stable relational patterns in these networks. This paper presents a new data mining method that analyzes the time-persistent relations or states between the entities of the dynamic networks and captures all maximal non-redundant evolution paths of the stable relational states. Experimental results based on multiple datasets from real-world applications show that the method is efficient and scalable.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for mining the evolution of conserved relational states in dynamic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310871700005"}
