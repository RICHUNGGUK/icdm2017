In this study, we present a building block of proteins called order profiles to use the evolutionary information of the protein sequence frequency profiles and apply this building block to produce a class of propensities called order profile interface propensities. For comparisons, we revisit the usage of residue interface propensities and binary profile interface propensities for protein binding site prediction. Each kind of propensities combined with sequence profiles and accessible surface areas are inputted into SVM. When tested on four types of complexes (hetero-permanent complexes, hetero-transient complexes, homo-permanent complexes and horno-transient complexes), experimental results show that the order profile interface propensities are better than residue interface propensities and binary profile interface propensities. Therefore, order profile is a suitable profile-level building block of the protein sequences and can be widely used in many tasks of computational biology, such as the sequence alignment, the prediction of domain boundary, the designation of knowledge-based potentials and the protein remote homology detection.
