ISODATA is one of the most popular and widely used clustering methods in geoscience applications, but it can run slowly, particularly with large data sets. We present a more efficient approach to ISODATA clustering, which achieves better running times by storing the points in a kd-tree and through a modification of the way in which the algorithm estimates the dispersion of each cluster. We also present an approximate version of the algorithm which allows the user to further improve the running time, at the expense of lower fidelity in computing the nearest cluster center to each point. We provide both theoretical and empirical justification that our modified approach produces clusterings that are very similar to those produced by the standard ISODATA approach. We also provide empirical studies on both synthetic data and remotely sensed Landsat and MODIS images that show that our approach has significantly lower running times.", "paper_title": "A fast implementation of the ISODATA clustering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000250845000004"}
