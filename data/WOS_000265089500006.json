A simple rule for intercluster connectivity (node j in cluster i connected to node i in cluster j, for all i not equal j) leads to regularity, modularity, packageability, fault tolerance, and algorithmic efficiency of the resulting networks. We prove that an OTIS (swapped) network with a connected basis network possesses maximal fault tolerance, regardless of whether its basis network is maximally fault tolerant. We also show how the corresponding maximal number of node-disjoint paths between two nodes of a swapped network can be algorithmically constructed in a manner that is independent of the existence and construction of node-disjoint paths within its basis network. Our results complement previous studies that show swapped networks inheriting some desirable properties (e.g., Hamiltonicity) from their basis networks. Here, we show that the swapped connectivity actually introduces a desirable property that may not exist in the basis network. Furthermore, our general result about maximal connectivity and the corresponding node-disjoint path construction for swapped networks replace a number of proofs and constructions in the literature for specific basis networks and obviate the need for proving maximal fault tolerance and dealing with node-disjoint path constructions for many other basis networks of potential practical interest. Additionally, we use our parallel path constructions to establish that the fault diameter and wide diameter of an OTIS network is no more than 4 units greater than its diameter.", "paper_title": "Swapped (OTIS) Networks Built of Connected Basis Networks Are Maximally Fault Tolerant", "paper_id": "WOS:000265089500006"}
