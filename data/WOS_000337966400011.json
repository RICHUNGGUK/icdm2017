Although different implementations differ in the way they merge the conceptually different computational models, they all follow similar principles: they harness the parallelism and data synchronization inherent to the dataflow model, yet maintain the programmability of the von-Neumann model. In this paper, we classify hybrid dataflow/von-Neumann models according to two different taxonomies: one based on the execution model used for inter-and intrablock execution, and the other based on the integration level of both control and dataflow execution models. The paper reviews the basic concepts of von-Neumann and dataflow computing models, highlights their inherent advantages and limitations, and motivates the exploration of a synergistic hybrid computing model. Finally, we compare a representative set of recent general purpose hybrid dataflow/von-Neumann architectures, discuss their different approaches, and explore the evolution of these hybrid processors.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Dataflow/von-Neumann Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000337966400011"}
