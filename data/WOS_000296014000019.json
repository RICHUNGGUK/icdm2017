The proposed scheme is the first CAC scheme derived from an asymptotic analysis of the critical traffic load, where the critical traffic load represents the threshold for queue stability. The salient feature of our CAC scheme is that it can be performed quickly and easily without the need for network performance measurements and complex calculations. Using the proposed scheme, we specifically investigate the voice capacity of 802.11 DCF networks with unbalanced traffic. Extensive simulations covering both ad hoc and infrastructure-based networks, and a variety of nonsaturated traffic types, show that the proposed CAC scheme is very effective.", "paper_title": "A Simple Critical-Load-Based CAC Scheme for IEEE 802.11 DCF Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000296014000019"}
