One of the key problems of computer-aided process planning (CAPP), however, is the complexity of process knowledge representation of process planning and the diversity of manufacturing background. Process knowledge representation and inference mechanism of process parameter selection is one of the most important issues in the research on CAPP. A proper methodology for modeling inference mechanism of process parameter selection, hence, is essential for selection of process parameters in process planning. The paper presents an atomic inference engine model of process parameter selection in process planning using mathematical logic. The methodology of modeling the inference mechanism of process parameter selection is proposed with backward chaining of mathematical logic that is a form of goal-directed reasoning. An illustrative case has been analyzed using the proposed approach to demonstrate its potential application in the real manufacturing environment, by combining with a practical application of a hole-making in a industrially relevant workpiece. The outcomes of this work provide a process reasoning mechanism for process parameter selection in process planning and thus alleviate automated process reasoning problems in process planning.
