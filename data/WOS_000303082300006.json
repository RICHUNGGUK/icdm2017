In this research, we examined how aggressiveness changes if crickets cannot perceive normal visual inputs or antennal inputs. First, behavior of the crickets is segmented based on behavioral observation. Second, sensory input-behavior output models are selected by utilizing Minimal Description Length (MDL) criterion. Third, multi-modality sensory-behavioral experiments are realized with handicapped crickets. Last, relations between multi-modality and behavior are discussed based on the obtained parameters in the model derived with experimental results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
