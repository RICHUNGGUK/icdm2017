Relating the patterns exhibited on the control chart to assignable causes is an ambiguous and vague task especially when multiple patterns co-exist. In this work, a rule based fuzzy inference system is developed for X control chart to prioritize the control chart causes based on the accumulated evidence. When a process goes out of control, search for assignable causes can be assisted by the priorities assigned to the causes. For an in-control process, developing patterns can be tracked and preventive action can be taken to prevent the process from going out of control. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
