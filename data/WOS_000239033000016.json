Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are employed as a screening tool for preterm birth on a heterogeneous maternal population; risk estimations use obstetrical variables available to physicians before 23 weeks gestation. The objective was to assess if ANNs have a potential use in obstetrical outcome estimations in low-risk maternal populations. The back-propagation feedforward ANN was trained and tested on cases with eight input variables describing the patient's obstetrical history; the output variables were: 1) preterm birth; 2) high-risk preterm birth; and 3) a refined high-risk preterm birth outcome excluding all cases where resuscitation was delivered in the form of free flow oxygen. Artificial training sets were created to increase the distribution of the underrepresented class to 20%. T)raining on the refined high-risk preterm birth model increased the network's sensitivity to 54.8%, compared to just over 20% for the nonartificially distributed preterm birth model.", "paper_title": "Predicting high-risk preterm birth using artificial neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239033000016"}
