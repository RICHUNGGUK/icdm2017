Web services for the integration of cloud applications/services can be evaluated at the utilization-level as well as the serviceability of the service on the server side in the management for cloud computing. In web activity, a web server can be a unified hub for web interactions as well as for the real-time estimation model of service-based parameters, i.e. utilization-level/serviceability for service monitoring. With the real-time estimation/analysis of the parameters in a web server for service-based contents delivery, the utilization-level and serviceability of a social-web name-card portal are presented. Empirical results are presented on the basis of the implementation of the real-time estimation scheme in a social-web name-card portal server for a cloud SNS.", "paper_title": "Utilization-level and Serviceability of a Social Name-card Portal for QoS in a Cloud Social Networking Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000307496400007"}
