We study when such predictive lower previsions are representation insensitive, meaning that they are essentially independent of the choice of the (finite) set of possible values for the random variables. We establish that such representation insensitive predictive models have very interesting properties, and show that among such models, the ones produced by the Imprecise Dirichlet-Multinomial Model are quite special in a number of ways. In the Conclusion, we discuss the open question as to how unique the predictive lower previsions of the Imprecise Dirichlet-Multinomial Model are in being representation insensitive.
