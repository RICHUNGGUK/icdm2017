WSNs are the basic components of Internet of Things (IoT) and the key to machine-to-machine communications and the future Internet. Also, the security is an essential element for deploying WSNs. Recently the concept of trust-based mechanism was proposed in WSNs such as traditional cryptographic and authentication mechanisms. However, there is lack a survey on trust management for WSNs, IoT even future Internet. In this paper, we discuss the concept and potential application areas of trust management for WSNs and IoT worlds. Furthermore, we survey different trust management issues (i.e., cluster, aggregation, reputation). Finally, future research directions with respect to trust management in WSNs and future IoT world are provided. We give not only simple WSNs for IoT environments but also a simulated bootstrap platform to provide the discussion of open challenges and solutions for deploying IoT in Future Internet.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Trust Management in WSNs, Internet of Things and Future Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000300519400001"}
