In analogy to conventional system virtualization and cloud computing, there are customer-operated virtual vehicles that essentially perform like real vehicles, although they are in reality hosted by fewer, shared, provider-operated real vehicles. The motion of the virtual vehicles and real vehicles creates migration gain. As a result, cloud computing in space can do better than conventional cloud computing in the sense of realizing high performance isolation (e.g., 98%) while requiring significantly fewer real vehicles (e.g., approximately one for five).
