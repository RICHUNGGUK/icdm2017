Different algorithms have been proposed for this problem based on heuristic, geometrical and evolutionary methods. In this paper we present a new simple multiagent algorithm, ants, and we test its performance with standard graph benchmarks. The results show that this method can outperform several current methods while it is very simple to implement.", "paper_title": "A multiagent algorithm for graph partitioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900025"}
