We extend their observation to curves given by Laurent polynomials with a fixed Newton polygon, provided that the polygon satisfies a certain combinatorial property. We also show that in each of these cases, if the curve is ordinary, then there is no need for the words \"sufficiently general\". Our treatment includes many classical families, such as hyperelliptic curves of odd genus and C-a,C-b curves. In the hyperelliptic case, we provide alternative proofs using an explicit description of the 2-torsion subgroup.", "paper_title": "CURVES IN CHARACTERISTIC 2 WITH NON-TRIVIAL 2-TORSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000346108100008"}
