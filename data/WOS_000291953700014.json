The evaluation, which focused on the user's physical experience and elements important to the designer, has been methodologically derived from the Krofli's and Laban's framework Body, Space, Time and Relationship, and additionally supported by sport science measurements. An experiment with 8 participants playing 10 games for 20 min was conducted and recorded to a digital video. Participants' physical experience was evaluated through the analysis of postures, the quality of the movement, the body parts used in the interaction, the playing area, the direction of movement, direction of gaze, tempo, dynamics and the quantity of motion (QoM). Results of the experiment are discussed in relation and with implications for game design. Conclusions are drawn with the summary of main findings, to better understand the mechanisms and principles involved the design of user's physical activity in full body interactive games for children. The theoretical work of Laban and Krofli proved to be useful for interaction and games design in the transition from desktop to full body interactive games.", "paper_title": "Design and evaluation of user's physical experience in an Ambient Interactive Storybook and full body interaction games", "paper_id": "WOS:000291953700014"}
