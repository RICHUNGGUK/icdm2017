Our analysis allows designers to rapidly evaluate the impact of different mappings of tasks to IP cores on the traffic pattern. The accuracy varies with the application's data sharing pattern, and is around 65% in the average case and 1% in the best case when considering the traffic pattern as a whole. For individual connections, our method produces tight worst-case bandwidths. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
