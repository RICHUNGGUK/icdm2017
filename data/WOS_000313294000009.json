The 2012 Edition was focused on two pillars of AAL: Indoor localization and activity recognition. Results from both competitions suggest that there is still space for other editions not only to improve accuracy of such systems, but also their user acceptance and interoperability. This paper describes the organization and results of the 2012 edition.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of localization and activity recognition systems for ambient assisted living: The experience of the 2012 EvAAL competition", "paper_id": "WOS:000313294000009"}
