In this paper, a new class of generalized Legendre sequences are described and analyzed with respect to their period, distributional, arithmetic cross-correlation and distinctness properties. This analysis gives a new approach to study the connection between the Legendre symbol and the arithmetic cross-correlation. In the end of this paper, possible application of these sequences with optimal arithmetic cross-correlation is indicated.", "paper_title": "GLS: NEW CLASS OF GENERALIZED LEGENDRE SEQUENCES WITH OPTIMAL ARITHMETIC CROSS-CORRELATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000327128600004"}
