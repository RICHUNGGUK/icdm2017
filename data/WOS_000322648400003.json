To save energy, various routing protocols for VANETs have been proposed in recent years. However, VANETs impose challenging issues to routing. These issues consist of dynamical road topology, various road obstacles, high vehicle movement and the fact that the vehicle movement is constrained on roads and traffic conditions. Moreover, the movement is significantly influenced by driving behaviors and vehicle categories. To this end, we incorporate them into routing and propose energy-efficient routing using movement trends (ERBA) for VANETs-an energy-efficient routing protocol. ERBA classifies vehicles into several categories, and then leverages vehicle movement trends to make routing recommendation. It predicts the movement trends by current directions and next directions after going through the road intersections. With the vehicular category information, the driving behavior patterns, the distance between the current sections and the next intersections, ERBA propagates information among vehicles with less energy consumption. The proposed scheme is validated by real urban scenarios extracted from ShanghaiGrid project. Experimental results show that ERBA outperforms the compared routing protocols with respect to the end-end delay, the packet delivery ratio and the path duration time.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol Using Movement Trends in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322648400003"}
