The basic building block is the measurement service, i.e. a software object properly configured and made remote accessible across a network. A measurement service corresponds either to a single (virtual or physical) instrument, or to a collection of measurement services abstracting a test method. Service attributes include the graphical interface which supports user interactions. MADAMS is especially tuned to: (i) defining a common way to manage and use distributed measurement services, (it) introducing a data-exchange layer for inter-instrument communications, (iii) exploiting a design pattern which separates definition of service functionalities from distribution concerns. This paper introduces MADAMS, outlines its current implementation which depends on Java/Jini, and shows its application to a demand monitoring-control measurement system. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
