A new algorithm, called competitive co-evolutionary differential evolution (CODE). is proposed to design analog ICs with practical user-defined specifications. On the basis of the combination of HSPICE and MATLAB, the system links circuit performances, evaluated through electrical simulation, to the optimization system in the MATLAB environment, once a circuit topology is selected. The system has been tested by typical and hard-to-design Cases, Such as complex analog blocks with stringent design requirements. The results show that the design specifications are closely met, even in highly-constrained Situations. Comparisons with available methods like genetic algorithms and differential evolution, which use Static penalty functions to handle design constraints, have also been carried out, showing that the proposed algorithm offers important advantages in terms of optimization quality and robustness. Moreover, the algorithm is shown to be efficient. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
