We present a novel projection method which produces quite similar visual results as those produced with the traditional projection method, but uses much less computation time. Our method includes two steps: detail-capture and shape-correction. The first step preserves most of the smoke details using an efficient DST (Discrete Sine Transformation) Poisson Solver with auxiliary boundary sweeping. The second step maintains the overall flow shape by solving a correcting Poisson equation on a coarse grid. Our algorithm is very fast and quite easy to implement. Experiments show that our projection is approximately 1030 times faster than the traditional projection with PCG(Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient), while convincingly preserving both the flow details and the overall shape of the smoke.", "paper_title": "A Novel Projection Technique with Detail Capture and Shape Correction for Smoke Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000318546800001"}
