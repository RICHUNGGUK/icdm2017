In this paper, we present a new feature extraction algorithm by combing KDA and KPCA, and then apply it to the face recognition task. The experimental results on Yale face dataset show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance both KDA and KPCA.", "paper_title": "KDA plus KPCA for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000013"}
