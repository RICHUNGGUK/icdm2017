As a result, the energy of each node will be saved and the lifetime of the whole sensor network will be extended. In the associated clustering strategy, the different clusters can be divided by the correlation characteristics of nodes data, which is based on a dynamic model and a correlation characteristics model after the correlation coefficient analysis. Simulation results show that our proposed associated clustering strategy works very well in soil moisture measurement. Moreover, as compared with the traditional random clustering, the associated clustering strategy based on data correlation achieves better performance for each cluster, and will be more efficient in data fusion at the cluster heads.", "paper_title": "Associated Clustering Strategy for Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000335043900001"}
