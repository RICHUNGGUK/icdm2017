We study the entanglement entropy in these states and find that entanglement is extruded towards certain regions of the system due to the inhomogeneity aroused by q-deformation. We also calculate entanglement entropy in ground states of a related q-deformed Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model and show that the singularities of entanglement can correctly signify the quantum phase transition points for different strengths of q-deformation.", "paper_title": "Entanglement entropy in quasi-symmetric multi-qubit states", "paper_id": "WOS:000354325800001"}
