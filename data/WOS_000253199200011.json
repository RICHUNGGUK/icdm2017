An interesting problem, connected to the theory of BCH codes, is to determine the spectrum A(q) of maximal divisors k of q(4) - 1 for which C-k is a cap. Recently, Bierbrauer and Edel [Edel and Bierbrauer (2004) Finite Fields Appl 10: 168-182] have proved that 3(q(2) + 1) epsilon A(q) provided that q is an even non-square. In this paper, the odd order case is investigated. It is proved that the only integer m for which m(q(2) + 1) epsilon A(q) is m = 2 for q 3 (mod 4), m = 1 for q 1 (mod 4). It is also shown that when q 3 (mod 4), the cap C2(q2+ 1) is complete.", "paper_title": "On cyclic caps in 4-dimensional projective spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000253199200011"}
