The ever growing number of application areas requires a diverse set of algorithms with disparate processing needs. WSNs also need to adapt to prevailing energy conditions and processing requirements. The preceding reasons rule out the use of a single fixed design. Instead, a general purpose design that can rapidly be adapted to different conditions and requirements is desired. In lieu of the traditional inflexible wireless sensor node consisting of a separate micro-controller, radio transceiver, sensor array and energy storage, we propose a unified rapidly reconfigurable miniature sensor node, implemented with a transport triggered architecture processor on a low-power Flash FPGA. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind. The proposed approach does not solely concentrate on energy efficiency but a high emphasis is also put on the ease of development perspective. Power consumption and silicon area usage comparison based on solutions implemented using our novel rapid design approach for wireless sensor nodes are performed. The comparison is performed between 16-bit fixed point, 16-bit floating point and 32-bit floating point implementations. The implemented processors and algorithms are intended for rolling bearing condition monitoring, but can be fully extended for other applications as well.", "paper_title": "Low-Power Reconfigurable Miniature Sensor Nodes for Condition Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000348118600002"}
