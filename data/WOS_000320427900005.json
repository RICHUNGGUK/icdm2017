Working principle and characteristics of the actuator are analyzed. Total disturbance is estimated by an extended state observer, and the nonlinear system is compensated as a linear one. Time-optimal control is used to realize accurate point-to-point motions with minimal time. Comparative simulations and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially for non-repetitive point-to-point motions, and good positioning performance has been achieved in the presence of both model uncertainties and external disturbances.
