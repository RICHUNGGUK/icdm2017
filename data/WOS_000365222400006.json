Therefore, clock gating is an effective technique in saving dynamic power by reducing the switching activities. In this paper, we propose a centralized and fine-grained microarchitecture-level clock gating for low power hardware accelerators which are automatically designed by high-level synthesis (HLS) tool. The basic principium of our idea is not to use any extra computation for generating clock enabled signals and exploit exiting signals of finite state machine for controlling the datapath clock network. After determining the current state in finite state machine, clock sub-tree of current state is enabled and the other sub-trees are disabled with a slight increase in circuit area. Our approach is implemented within an HLS design flow for automatic low power hardware accelerator generation in application specific integrated circuit design. Experimental results are obtained on a set of representative benchmark programs. Depending on the circuit size and number of registers, it is shown that 47%-86% reduction in power dissipation is observed.", "paper_title": "Power Efficient High-Level Synthesis by Centralized and Fine-Grained Clock Gating", "paper_id": "WOS:000365222400006"}
