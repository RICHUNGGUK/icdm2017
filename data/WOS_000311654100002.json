Compared to an equivalent FPGA architecture, it has reduced flexibility but improved density. On the other hand, compared to an ASIC, it has reconfigurability but increased area. This work presents a new heterogeneous tree-based ASIF. Four ASIF generation techniques are explored for it using 17 benchmarks. Experimental results show that, on average, the best ASIF generation technique gives 70% area gain when compared to an equivalent FPGA architecture. Further experiments are performed to determine the effect of Lookup-Table (LUT) and arity size on heterogeneous tree-based ASIF. Later, area comparison between tree-based ASIF and equivalent mesh-based ASIF shows that the former gives either equal or better results than the latter. Finally quality comparison of two ASIFs shows that, on average, tree-based ASIF produces 18% better area results than mesh-based ASIF. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
