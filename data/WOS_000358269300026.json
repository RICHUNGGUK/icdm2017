The system consists of a semiautomatic frame selection method to find images with out-of-plane motion as well as a method for automatic motion compensation. Translational and non-rigid motion compensation is applied by introducing a temporal continuity assumption. A study consisting of 40 clinical datasets was conducted to compare the perfusion with simulated perfusion using pharmacokinetic modeling. Overall, the proposed approach decreased the mean average difference between the measured perfusion and the pharmacokinetic model estimation. It was non-inferior for three out of four patient cohorts to a manual approach and reduced the analysis time by 41% compared to manual processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
