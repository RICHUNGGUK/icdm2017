To better support both command center controllers and in-field operators, we have developed a mobile visual analytics tool to help enhance situational awareness and support rapid decision making. Our mobile visual analytics tool consists of a 2D/3D visualization component, which shows personnel-related information, situational and static scene-related information, integrated multi media playback functionality for personnel outfitted with cameras, and fast-forward/rewind capabilities for reviewing events. Our current system has been employed in the evaluation of two different scenarios: a simulated evacuation of The Station nightclub fire that occurred in Rhode Island during 2003 and a testing exercise for a rescue operation in an elementary school. Our system has been deployed on a Dell Axim X51v PDA, an OQO 02, and on a Sprint PCS Vision(SM) smart device PPC-6700.
