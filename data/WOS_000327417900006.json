In order to quantify such user satisfaction a utility function dependent on flow transfer delay is used. In this context, we formulate the Quality of Experience aware resource allocation optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process. This model is analytically unsolvable in general, and as an approximate solution we develop a simple and tractable index rule based on Gittins approach, originally aimed just at minimizing mean flow delay. As concluded from simulation results, when evaluating subjective quality performance this novel index rule proposal outperforms the most relevant existing scheduling disciplines.
