To decrease the risk of helper key exposures, Hanaoka et al. advocated parallel key-insulated mechanism where distinct helpers are independently used in key updates. In this paper, we propose the first parallel key-insulated signature scheme which is provably secure without resorting to the random oracle methodology. Our scheme not only allows frequent key updating, but also does not increase the risk of helper key exposures.", "paper_title": "Parallel Key-Insulated Signature Scheme without Random Oracles", "paper_id": "WOS:000322146200002"}
