In this paper, the key techniques are explored in the implementation of a cost-effective approach to constructing a flight control tower simulator using commodities. A client/server styled architecture is proposed to divide the system into subsystems, and a process model is abstracted to describe the high-level process of the system. Finite state machines (FSMs) and a primitive-command interaction mechanism are proposed for efficient behavior representation and flexible control of the simulated entities (which are encapsulated into a computing kernel component to handle the real-time computation and interaction), respectively, resulting in higher maintainability and extensibility. Parallel rendering based on a PC cluster and image warping and edge blending algorithms are explored to generate virtual tower out-the-window scenes of ultra-high resolutions and seamless tiled displays on a cylindrical screen, respectively; thus the special hardware is replaced with commercial off-the-shelf hardware to achieve much lower cost and higher maintainability. With these techniques, a flight control tower simulator based on COTS hardware has been implemented and employed to train some tower controllers in China.", "paper_title": "Implementation of a Flight Control Tower Simulator using Commercial Off-the-shelf Hardware", "paper_id": "WOS:000274156600004"}
