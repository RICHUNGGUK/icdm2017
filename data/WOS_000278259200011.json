By the analysis of the dynamic properties and numerical simulation of the continuous process, the conditions are obtained for the existence and stability of positive period-1 solution of the system. It is also pointed out that there does not exist positive period-2 solution. The results simplify the choice of suitable operating conditions for continuous culture systems. It also gives the complete expression of the period of the positive period-1 solution, which provides the precise feeding period fora regularly continuous culture system to achieve the same stable output as a continuous culture system with feedback control in the same production environment.
