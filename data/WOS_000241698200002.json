The method incorporates the Markov chain and universal generating function technique. In the model considered, both periodic inspection and repair (perfect and imperfect) of system elements are taken into account. The system state distributions and the overall system safety function are derived, based on the developed model. The proposed method is applicable to complex systems for analysing state distributions and it is also useful in decision-making such as determining the optimal proof-test interval or repair resource allocation. An illustrative example is given.", "paper_title": "State probability of a series-parallel repairable system with two-types of failure states", "paper_id": "WOS:000241698200002"}
