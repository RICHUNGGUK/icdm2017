However, deploying these pervasive situations is still a challenge for teachers. This paper presents GLUEPS-AR, a system for deploying learning designs across physical and web spaces, using mainstream Virtual Learning Environments, Web 2.0 artifacts and Augmented Reality applications. GLUEPS-AR has been evaluated through a mixed methods study on the deployment of three authentic pervasive learning situations. Results highlight that GLUEPS-AR supports teachers in deploying their pedagogical ideas on pervasive learning environments, overcoming the main limitations of existing approaches.
