Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative approach is explored, based on semi-structured interviews and observation through think-aloud protocol. This methodology provides fruitful insights as it focuses on the users' browsing habits. The author interviewed a sample of professionals of tourism, cybertourists and bloggers. Findings - Results reveal that only part of e-WOM is granted credibility. Therefore, its persuasiveness depends on those limited positive judgements. Travellers use a conceptual mindset and a series of cognitive heuristics (homophily, crowd consensus, etc.) to assess credibility. Formal knowledge background and social pressures have proven to be weak. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to a reduced sample of informants but their adjustment to the most typical profiles interviewed compensates this restriction. Another limitation is that data comes from a single cultural context (Spain), but on the other hand provides data that did not exist in the international literature on the topic. Practical implications - Outcomes can help tourism managers to monitor key heuristics employed by end-users in webs of e-WOM and detect new trends of travelling habits. Originality/value - The paper is original in that it establishes the rationalities behind the daily use of cognitive heuristics explored through different traveller's profiles.", "paper_title": "Conceptual mindsets and heuristics in credibility evaluation of e-Word of Mouth in tourism", "paper_id": "WOS:000348443200007"}
