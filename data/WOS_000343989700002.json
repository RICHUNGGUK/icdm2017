Conditions are established for this resemblance. A theorem on approximation of Gaussian and hyper-Gaussian filters by a cascade of simple filters is established and the corresponding phase and group delay characteristics are analyzed. The theorem and the analysis are exemplified by cascading moving-average filters and the first-order Butterworth filters.", "paper_title": "A THEOREM ON REPEATED FILTERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000343989700002"}
