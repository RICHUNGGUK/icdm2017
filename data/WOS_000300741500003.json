In this paper, we propose an online multipath routing protocol that uses nodes' positions to make forwarding decisions at each hop. Real-time decisions are made without any need to have the entire network topology knowledge. The protocol achieves load-balancing and minimises nodes' energy consumption by utilising: (a) smart greedy forwarding scheme for selecting next hop, and (b) walking back forwarding scheme to bypass network holes. Performance comparisons of the proposed protocol (schemes) are made with TPGF and GPSR. The results show that our schemes: (a) maximise the overall network lifespan by not draining energy from some specific nodes, (b) provide QoS delivery for video streams by using best nodes along the route, and (c) scale better in high-density WMSN.", "paper_title": "Streaming multimedia over WMSNs: an online multipath routing protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000300741500003"}
