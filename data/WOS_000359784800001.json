Our proposed hierarchical scheduling takes advantage of the interaction of cloud users, private cloud and public cloud. For high level optimization in hybrid cloud, the objective of public cloud provider optimization is to maximize the revenue of providing virtual machines (VMs) and minimize the energy cost. The private cloud users' applications give the unique optimal payment to public cloud providers under deadline and cost constraint to maximize the satisfaction of private cloud user applications. The objective of low-level scheduling optimization is to minimize the cost and execution time of private cloud application. From the simulation results, the revenue, execution success ratio and resource utilization of our proposed hierarchical scheduling algorithm are better than other related works.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Scheduling Optimization Scheme in Hybrid Cloud Computing Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000359784800001"}
