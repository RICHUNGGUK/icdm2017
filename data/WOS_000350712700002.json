The reliance on sensors and activity recognition in this approach introduces issues with scalability and ability to model activity variations. This study introduces a novel approach to assistive living which intends to address these issues via a paradigm shift from a sensor centric approach to a goal-oriented one. The goal-oriented approach focuses on identification of user goals in order to pro-actively offer assistance by either pre-defined or dynamically constructed instructions. This paper introduces the architecture of this goal-oriented approach and describes an ontological goal model to serve as its basis. The use of this approach is illustrated in a case study which focuses on assisting a user with activities of daily living.", "paper_title": "Goal lifecycles and ontological models for intention based assistive living within smart environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000350712700002"}
