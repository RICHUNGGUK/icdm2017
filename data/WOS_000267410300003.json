However, there is increasing concern about the motion cues provided in the simulator and their influence on the validity of these studies. Especially for curve driving, providing large sustained acceleration is difficult in the limited motion space of simulators. Recently built simulators, such as Desdemona, offer a large motion space showing great potential as automotive simulators. The goal of this research is: first, to develop a motion drive algorithm for urban curve driving in the Desdemona simulator; and second, to evaluate the solution through a simulator driving experiment. The developed algorithm, the one-to-one yaw algorithm, is compared to a classical washout algorithm (adapted to the Desdemona motion space) and a control condition where only road rumble is provided. Results show that regarding lateral motion, the absence of cues in the rumble condition is preferred over the presence of false cues in the classical algorithm. \"No motion\" seems to be favored over \"bad motion.\" In terms of longitudinal motion, the one-to-one yaw and the classical algorithm are voted better than the rumble condition, showing that the addition of motion cues is beneficial to the simulation of braking. In a general way, the one-to-one yaw algorithm is classified better than the other two algorithms.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Three Motion Cueing Algorithms for Curve Driving in an Urban Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000267410300003"}
