To improve the accuracy of fashion retail forecasting, a two-stage dynamic forecasting model is proposed, which is combined with both long-term and short-term predictions. The model introduces the improved adjustment methods, the main adjustment model and error forecasting model in the adjustment system collaborated with each other. The real-time data are demonstrated by applying the model in wireless mobile environment. The experiment shows that the model provides good results for fashion retail forecasting.
