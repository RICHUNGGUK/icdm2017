Expert systems are being successfully applied to the management of telecommunication networks. However, applying expert systems to network design is another especially beneficial yet still not very common approach. In this paper we propose a rule-based expert system called Datacab. Datacab was developed at Enditel Endesa in collaboration with the Electronic Technology Department of the University of Seville, for the automatic design of hybrid fibre coax (HFC) cable networks. Using data from a geographical information system as input, it automatically generates viable HFC network designs.", "paper_title": "Datacab: a geographical-information-system-based expert system for the design of cable networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258443300001"}
