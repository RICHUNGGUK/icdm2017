In our algorithm, we apply ridgelet transform to each block which is subbanded from the image after wavelet transform. Experimental results demonstrate this algorithm has good property to localize tampering, and robust to JPEG compression.", "paper_title": "Curvelet transform for image authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500096"}
