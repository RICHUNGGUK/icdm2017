However, the stringent latency and throughput requirements of modern DDRX (Double Data Rate Memory Interface Technology) devices have rendered such programmability largely impractical, confining DDRX controllers to fixed-function hardware. Pardis is the first programmable memory controller that can meet these challenges and thus satisfy the performance requirements of a high-speed ddrx interface.", "paper_title": "PROGRAMMABLE DDRX CONTROLLERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000320014900013"}
