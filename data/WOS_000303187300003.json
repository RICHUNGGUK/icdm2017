Most OSNs currently impose restrictions on the number of social links that a user can have, in order to reduce strain on the OSN infrastructure and to prevent spammers from linking to large number of users indiscriminately. However, such restrictions are increasingly being criticized for being too prohibitive for socially active and popular users. Hence there is a growing need for the OSN authorities to design restrictions that fulfill their objectives while minimizing user-dissatisfaction; this is evident from the innovative 'soft' cut-off imposed in Twitter instead of the traditional 'hard' cut-offs in other OSNs. In this scenario, the goal of the current work is to develop an analytical framework, taking the restriction in Twitter as a case-study, to aid the design of restrictions which balance the two conflicting objectives of controlling system-load and minimizing user-dissatisfaction. We consequently define a simple utility function for restrictions considering the two objectives, and find that Twitter's policy well balances both. However, we find that the imposed restriction has limited effectiveness in controlling the linking activity of spammers. From a Complex Network Theoretical perspective, this is the first analysis of 'soft' cut-offs in any sort of network, to the best of our knowledge. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
