It is shown that the synchronization conditions of complex dynamical networks on time scales are different from those derived for conventional continuous or discrete complex networks. Moreover, the presented results of this paper indicate that the globally synchronization problems with both discrete time case and continuous time case can be addressed in a unified framework.
