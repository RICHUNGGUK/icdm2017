Numerical data are normally used to quantify the effects of erosion. This paper examines the case of an olive grove where there is clear evidence of the progress of erosion. Software is programmed to calculate the 3D field movements and also represents them graphically, allowing their integration into a GIS. This makes it possible to interrelate information from different sources stored in the database in order to perform advanced queries and make appropriate decisions to prevent risk situations.
