Achieving such performance with high energy efficiency is now a main goal in the research community. This work combines knowledge of LDPC decoder message statistics, provided by density evolution, with knowledge of the physical implementation of decoders to predict switching activity in the decoder interconnect. In this work we provide results for the switching activity on the interconnect for fully parallel decoders. However, our model can be applied to partially parallel and serial implementations, and is not limited to interconnect. It is shown that switching activity can vary by as much as 300%, depending on several hardware design choices. Results of this work validate the usefulness of the presented model for providing designers with an understanding of how their decoder implementation choices affect power consumption for any size of LDPC code. This knowledge can be used for making design choices that minimize decoder power consumption very early in the hardware design process.", "paper_title": "Switching Activity Minimization in Iterative LDPC Decoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000303383800005"}
