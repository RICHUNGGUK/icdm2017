Singular value decomposition can simply obtain the hidden information of data. In this paper, we propose a new detection approach of transient disturbances, which combines wavelet packet, Tsallis entropy and singular value decomposition. Through the introduction of Tsallis entropy and wavelet packet, the definition of wavelet packet Tsallis entropy (WPTSE) and calculation method are given. The key parameters during the course of detection, including wavelet decomposition levels, window width, and nonextensive parameter of Tsallis entropy, are respectively discussed in detail. The detection plan of transient disturbances with WPTSE is proposed. The experimental results show that the precision of proposed detection approach is high. It owns the anti-noise ability, and the influences of the disturbance parameters are very small. In the end, the comparisons show that the detection performance of WPTSE is better than that of wavelet transform and EEMD (ensemble empirical mode decomposition). The PSCAD/EMTDC and real-life signals also demonstrate its feasibility and validity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
