Lagrange's equation is used to derive the dynamic model of the manipulator system. Flexible intermediate links are modeled as Euler-Bernoulli beams with pinned-pinned boundary conditions. Dynamic equations of motion of a 3-PRR parallel manipulator with three flexible links are developed by adopting the assumed mode method. The effect of concentrated rotational inertia at both ends of intermediate links is included in this model. Numerical simulations of vibration responses, coupling forces and inertial forces are presented. The corresponding frequency spectra analysis is performed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Experimental modal tests are performed to validate the theoretical model through comparison and analysis of modal characteristics of the flexible manipulator system.", "paper_title": "Dynamic modeling and experimental validation of a 3-PRR parallel manipulator with flexible intermediate links", "paper_id": "WOS:000251394100002"}
