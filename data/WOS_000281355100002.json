However, even with the use of SCORM, the creation of a simulation-based eLearning course is still a hard task. An instructor can neither easily obtain source code from existing learning objects repositories nor reuse and adapt existing simulations to suit the instructor's needs. We describe an experimental reusable JAVA class repository that embeds itself in a SCORM run-time environment to support software reuse and the cooperative creation of simulation-based courses. Finally, we provide advice on how to promote software reuse and assure the quality of simulation-based eLearning courses.
