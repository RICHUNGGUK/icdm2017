In the method, standard addition was adopted. The data of the pure standard, sample, and spiked sample were used in the calculation. By performing principal component analysis on the data aligned with the measured signals of the sample and standard, the standardized signal that is orthogonal to the signals of interferences in the sample can be extracted. Then, the signal of spiked sample was projected to the standardized signal. The concentration ratio of the target analyte in the sample and spiked sample can be obtained. Finally, the concentration of the target analyte in the sample can be calculated with the added concentration in the spiked sample. Both simulated and experimental data were investigated with the proposed approach, compared with rank annihilation factor analysis. The recoveries of standard addition were found in a range of 99-105%, and the relative standard deviations obtained in three repeated measurements were less than 3%. Results show that the method can accurately estimate the quantitative information of analytes of interest in the presence of interferents and can be applied more widely compared with rank annihilation factor analysis.
