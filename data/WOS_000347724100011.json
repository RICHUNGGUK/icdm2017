It is of prime importance to give students that are learning system-software concepts a solid base of knowledge without any unnecessary details. To make the subject easy to understand we designed a simulator for a hypothetical computer that is already used in several courses on system software. In the paper, we describe the simulator's behavior as well as its design and implementation. Additionally, we present three case studies of using a simulator in teaching and describe our experience of its use in a course on system software. From the experience of using the simulator in a pedagogical process we conclude that it decreases the time invested by the students to comprehend the topic, and at the same time it enables in depth understanding.
