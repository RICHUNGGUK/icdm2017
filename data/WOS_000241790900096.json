To provide a unified evaluative measure, the derivation of each rule is depicted by the reduced attributes with a layered manner. Therefore, the inconsistency is divided into two primary categories in terms of the reduced attributes. We introduce the notion of joint membership function wrt. the effectual joint attributes, and a classification method extended from the default decision generation framework is proposed to handle the inconsistency.", "paper_title": "Reduced attribute oriented inconsistency handling in decision generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900096"}
