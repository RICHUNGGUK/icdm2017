A mixed binary integer programming model was developed for the problem and was validated. Due to its NP nature, a co-evolution genetic algorithm with variants of the cheapest insertion method was proposed to speed up the solution procedure. Since there were no existing benchmarks, this study generated some test problems which revised from the well-known Solomon's benchmark for Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). From the comparison with the results of Cplex software and the basic genetic algorithm, the proposed algorithm showed that it can provide better solutions within a comparatively shorter period of time.
