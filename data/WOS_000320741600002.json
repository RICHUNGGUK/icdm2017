It is proved that the Hausdorff distance of any two polynomial-time computable curves is a left-Sigma(P)(2) real number. Conversely, for any tally set A in Sigma(P)(2), there exist two polynomial-time computable curves such that set A is computable in polynomial time relative to the Hausdorff distance of these two curves. More generally, we show that, for any set A in Sigma(P)(2), there exist two polynomial-time computable curves such that set A is computable in polynomial time relative to the Hausdorff distances of subcurves of these two curves.
