In this paper we aim to explore this issue by analyzing the occurrence of citations in the top-ranked journals in the areas of Finance, Management, and Marketing. We put forward a modified version of the model of science as a network, proposed by Klamer and Van Dalen (J Econ Methodol 9(2):289-315, 2002), and conclude that Finance is a 'Relatively autonomous, organized and settled field of research', whereas Management and (to a larger extent) Marketing are relatively non-autonomous and hybrid fields of research'. Complementary analysis based on sub-discipline rankings using the recursive methodology of Liebowitz and Palmer (J Econ Lit 22:77-88, 1984) confirms the results. In conclusions we briefly discuss the pertinence of Whitley's (The intellectual and social organization of the sciences, 1984) theory for explaining cultural differences across these sub-disciplines based on its dimensions of scholarly practices, 'mutual dependency' and 'task uncertainty'.", "paper_title": "Are finance, management, and marketing autonomous fields of scientific research?
