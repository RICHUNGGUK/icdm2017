In this algorithm, the terrain is divided and organized by quad-tree structure. Each terrain patch is assigned a certain time according to the total rendering time given in advance. The multi-resolution levels rendered are determined by visual apperception. To solve the T-junction and popping, an approach of stitching the level boundaries and geomorphing are respectively performed on GPU. The algorithm guarantees that each frame is rendered in preset time independent of the terrain or the eye position. The slow or jerky phenomena during roaming, which are usually caused by unstable rendering frame rate, can be successfully avoided. This terrain rendering algorithm is demonstrated in a massive terrain flyover application. The experiment proves that this algorithm is feasible and efficient.", "paper_title": "A time-controlling terrain rendering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900036"}
