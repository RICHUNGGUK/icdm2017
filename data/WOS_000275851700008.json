BPV statistical modeling of NMOS and PMOS devices is, for the first time, coupled by including self-consistent modeling of ring oscillator gate delays. Parasitic capacitances are included in the analysis. The proposed technique is validated using Monte-Carlo simulations and by comparison to experimental data from two technologies.", "paper_title": "Statistical Modeling With the PSP MOSFET Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000275851700008"}
