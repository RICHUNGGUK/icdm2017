Determining the distribution for the maximum number of customers in orbit is reduced to computation of certain absorption probabilities. By reducing to the single-server case we arrive at a closed analytic formula. For the multi-server case we develop an efficient algorithmic procedure for computation of this distribution by exploiting the special block-tridiagonal structure of the system. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the method and reveal interesting facts concerning the behavior of the M/M/c retrial queue.", "paper_title": "Algorithmic analysis of the maximum queue length in a busy period for the M/M/c retrial queue", "paper_id": "WOS:000248670800013"}
