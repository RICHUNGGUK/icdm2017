Two of these parameters are the normality measure N(E-N) and the correlation measure C-k(E-N) of order k, which focus on different combinatorial aspects of E-N. In their work, amongst others, Mauduit and Sarkozy investigated the minimal possible value of these parameters.", "paper_title": "Measures of pseudorandomness for finite sequences: Minimal values", "paper_id": "WOS:000234867800001"}
