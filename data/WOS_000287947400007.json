This work is motivated by the previously known three-phase multiple access (TPMA) scheme of Hou and Tsai [2] which is the suitable MAC protocol for clustering multi-hop ad hoc networks owing to its beneficial attributes such as easy collision detectible, anonymous acknowledgment (ACK), and simple signaling format for the broadcast-natured networks. The new TPMA-CCR is designed to let all contending nodes participate in contentions for a medium access more aggressively than the original TPMA and with continual resolving procedures as well. Through the systematical performance analysis of the suggested protocol, it is also shown that the maximum throughput of the new protocol is not only superior to the original TPMA, but also improves on the conventional slotted carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) under certain circumstances. Thus, in terms of performance, TPMA-CCR can provide an attractive alternative to other contention-based MAC protocols for multi-hop ad hoc networks.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Three-Phase Multiple Access with Continual Contention Resolution (TPMA-CCR) for Wireless Multi-Hop Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287947400007"}
