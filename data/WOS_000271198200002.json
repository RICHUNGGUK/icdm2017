It is a common belief that experimentation in mobile robotics has not yet reached a level of maturity comparable with that reached in science, for example in physics, considered as the paradigm of a mature, stable, and well-founded scientific discipline. In this paper, starting from a representative sample of the current state of the art, we identify some basic issues of experiments in mobile robot localization and mapping. These issues, when viewed in the context of some general principles about experiments in science and engineering, lead us to derive some insightful considerations on the role of experiments in mobile robotics. Reflecting the background of the authors, the paper has an interdisciplinary nature at the meeting point of mobile robotics and philosophy of science.", "paper_title": "An insightful comparison between experiments in mobile robotics and in science", "paper_id": "WOS:000271198200002"}
