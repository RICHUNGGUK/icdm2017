Interestingly, the dynamics of two distinct models need not necessarily be different, which might hint at either only non-functional characteristics distinguishing the models or at different possible implementations for the same behaviour. Here, we study the conditions allowing for such effects by analysing classes of dynamically equivalent models and both structurally maximal and minimal representatives of such classes. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm that constructs a minimal representative of the respective class of a given multi-valued model.", "paper_title": "Minimization and equivalence in multi-valued logical models of regulatory networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000365183600006"}
