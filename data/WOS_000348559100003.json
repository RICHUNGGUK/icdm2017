In the terminology of Everitt and Giertz, E is said to be separated in L-2 (M) if for u is an element of L-2 (M) such that Eu is an element of L-2 (M), we have bi partial derivative(2)u/(partial derivative x)i(2) and qu is an element of L-2 (M). We give sufficient conditions for E to be separated in L-2 (M).", "paper_title": "Separation Problem for Second Order Elliptic Differential Operators on Riemannian Manifolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000348559100003"}
