In this paper, we present a quasi-static gait transition control method for a quadruped walking robot. It is based on the observation on the locomotion behaviors of quadruped animals, which show a sudden and discrete changes of gait patterns depending on the speed. The method predefines gait transition patterns, and gait sequences are determined according to the current and desired leg postures. It can be useful because the applicable to any type of walking controller. In this study, we implement the proposed method on a self-contained quadruped walking robot, called Artificial Digitigrade for Natural Environment Version III (AiDIN-III), and its effectiveness is experimentally validated.", "paper_title": "Biologically inspired gait transition control for a quadruped walking robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000357652400004"}
