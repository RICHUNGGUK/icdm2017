Node mobility causes network topologies to change dynamically over time, which complicated important tasks such as routing. In this paper, a novel link stability estimation model based on received signal strength indication is proposed. We have integrated this model into MAODV and present a stability-based multicast routing protocol termed as SMR. SMR can discover more available stable routes and better adapt to network topology changes. Simulation results show the superiority of SMR over the existing methods in terms of packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay and routing packet overhead. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
