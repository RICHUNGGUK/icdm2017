The proposed chip-level receiver for FH-OCDMA consists of an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG), and photo-detector (PD) for each mark chip, and uses the principles of the chip-level receiver. We analyze the error rate performance of the FH-OCDMA system with the proposed chip-level receiver with treating APD noise, thermal noise, and multi-user interference (MUI) using a Gaussian approximation. We compare the performance of the proposed chip-level receiver to that of the conventional correlation receiver. We show that the proposed chip-level receiver has a better bit error probability and can accommodate more users than the conventional correlation receiver.", "paper_title": "Chip-level detection in optical frequency hopping code division multiple access", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961400023"}
