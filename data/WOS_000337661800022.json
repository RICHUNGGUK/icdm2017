Facing the main difficulties caused by the existence of occlusion in single-camera scenario and the occurrence of transition in cross-camera scenario, we propose a unified framework formulated in graph matching with affinity constraints for both single and cross-camera tracking tasks. To our knowledge, our work is the first to unify two kinds of tracking problems with the same framework by graph matching. The proposed method consists of two steps, tracklet generation and tracklet association. First, we implement the modified part-based human detector and the Tracking-Modeling-Detection (TMD) method for tracklet generation. Then we propose to associate tracklets by graph matching which is mathematically formulated into the Rayleigh Quotients Maximization. The comparison experiments show that the proposed method can produce the competing results with the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
