The OPF problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming optimization problem using multiobjective framework wherein the total generation fuel cost and active power losses are considered as objective functions of the optimization problem. In the proposed approach, firstly, the total fuel cost generation and active power losses are optimized individually in order to obtain the fuzzy membership functions of the objectives, and then, the multi-objective problem is reformulated as a new standard nonlinear problem using the fuzzy sets theory and max-min operator. Finally, it is solved by nonlinear programming by means of discontinuous derivatives method. The simulation results of the IEEE 30-bus test system show the performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "FUZZY MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMAL POWER FLOW CONSIDERING UPFC", "paper_id": "WOS:000301026100010"}
