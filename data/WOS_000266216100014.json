Traditionally, clustering techniques do not consider the semantic relationships between words, such as synonymy and hypernymy. To exploit semantic relationships, ontologies such as WordNet have been used to improve clustering results. However, WordNet-based clustering methods mostly rely on single-term analysis of text; they do not perform any phrase-based analysis. In addition, these methods utilize synonymy to identify concepts and only explore hypernymy to calculate concept frequencies, without considering other semantic relationships such as hyponymy. To address these issues, we combine detection of noun phrases with the use of WordNet as background knowledge to explore better ways of representing documents semantically for clustering. First, based on noun phrases as well as single-term analysis, we exploit different document representation methods to analyze the effectiveness of hypernymy, hyponymy, holonymy, and metonymy. Second, we choose the most effective method and compare it with the WordNet-based clustering method proposed by others. The experimental results show the effectiveness of semantic relationships for clustering are (from highest to lowest): hypernymy, hyponymy, metonymy, and holonymy. Moreover, we found that noun phrase analysis improves the WordNet-based clustering method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
