In this paper, a novel run-to-run control methodology is developed for nonlinear multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) MTMP semiconductor processes. The methodology is based on the integration of two methods: the kernel support vector machine (KSVM) and the partial least squares (PLS). PLS is used to transform the original variables to latent variables and the use of KSVM is to relate one latent input variable to one latent output variable. The nonlinear relationship of input and output variables is obtained by mapping the latent variables using a kernel function into a feature space where linear regression is done. In the proposed methodology, referred to as kernel support vector machine and partial least squares (KSVM-PLS) algorithm, a control law is derived for each pair of latent input and output variables. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the KSVM-PLS method, it is applied to a chemical-mechanical polishing process in semiconductor manufacturing.", "paper_title": "CONTEXT-KSVM-PLS BASED RUN-TO-RUN CONTROL FOR NONLINEAR MIMO PROCESSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626900004"}
