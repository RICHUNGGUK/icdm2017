In resonant-type wireless power transfer, energy is transferred via LC resonant circuits. However, system performance is dependent on the circuit components. To transfer power efficiently and safely, information, such as frequency, required power and element values, need to be transmitted reliably in the system. This paper investigates data communication using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation in resonant-type wireless power transfer systems. The equivalent circuit used in the transmitting and receiving antennas is a band pass filter (BPF) and its bandwidth is evaluated through circuit simulations and experimental measurements. Numerical results obtained through computer simulation show that the bit error rate (BER) performance is affected by the splitting resonant frequency.", "paper_title": "Reliable Data Transmission for Resonant-Type Wireless Power Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000314080500038"}
