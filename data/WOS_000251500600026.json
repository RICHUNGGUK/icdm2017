The operation of a neuronal circuit formed of electronic neurons based on Hindmarsh-Rose neuron dynamics and first order chemical synapses is modeled. The controller is based on a standard 0.25 mu m CMOS process with 2 V supply voltage. In order to achieve low power consumption, CMOS subthreshold circuit techniques are used. The controller generates an excellent replica of the walking motor program and allows switching between walking in different directions in response to different command inputs. The simulated power consumption is 4.8 mW and die size including I/O pads is 2.2 mm by 2.2 mm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design can generate adaptive walking motor programs to control the legs of autonomous robots. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
