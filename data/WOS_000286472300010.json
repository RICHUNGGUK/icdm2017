This paper proposes a system for semi-automatically creating video remixes of good expressive quality. Given multiple original video clips, audio clips, and transition effects as the input, the proposed system generates a video remix by five processes: I) video clip sequence generation, II) audio clip selection, III) audio boundary extraction, IV) video segment extraction, and V) transition effect selection, based on the spatial and temporal structural patterns automatically learned from professionally created video remix examples. Experiments using movie trailers of action genre as video remix examples not only demonstrate that video remixing by professionals can be imitated based on examples but also reveal that the video clip sequence generation and audio clip selection are the most important processes to improve the perceived expressive quality of video remixes.", "paper_title": "Example-based video remixing", "paper_id": "WOS:000286472300010"}
