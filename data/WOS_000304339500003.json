We give efficient algorithms for several interesting shapes. This is in strong contrast to finding the maximum weight region that is the union of elementary shapes for the corresponding cases-a problem that we prove to be NP-hard. We implemented one of the algorithms and demonstrate its applicability for image segmentation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
