In this paper, we explore a theoretical approach to cross-layer optimization between multimedia and wireless networks by means of a quality criterion termed \"visual throughput\" for downlink video transmission using a layered coding algorithm. We obtain the optimal loading ratio of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) subcarriers through an optimization problem balancing the tradeoff relationship between inter-cell interference (ICI) and channel throughput. Through numerical link capacity analysis, we show that the upper bounds of the visual throughput gain at the cell boundary is obtained at about 27%.", "paper_title": "Optimal Carrier Loading Control for the Enhancement of Visual Quality over OFDMA Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000260862600020"}
