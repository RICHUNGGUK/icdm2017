Do we have evidence that such functions are hard, for example, if TFNP is computable in polynomial-time does this imply the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses? By computing a multivalued function in deterministic polynomial-time we mean on every input producing one of the possible values of the function on that input. We give a relativized negative answer to this question by exhibiting an oracle under which TFNP functions are easy to compute but the polynomial-time hierarchy is infinite. We also show that relative to this same oracle, P not equal UP and TFNP(NP) functions are not computable in polynomial-time with an NP oracle.", "paper_title": "Does the Polynomial Hierarchy Collapse if Onto Functions are Invertible?", "paper_id": "WOS:000272912800009"}
