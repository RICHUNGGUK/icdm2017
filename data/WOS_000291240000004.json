For the electronic minimization needed to achieve the ground state using an implementation of the blocked Davidson iteration scheme (EDDAV), speed-ups of up to 3.39 on S1070 devices or 6.97 on a C2050 device were observed when calculating an ion-conductor system of actual research interest. Concerning the CPU specialty - memory throughput - the low double-precision performance forms the bottleneck on the S1070, whereas on Fermi cards the code reaches 61.7% efficiency while not suffering from any accuracy losses compared to well-established calculations performed on a central processing unit (CPU). The algorithmic bottleneck was found to be the multiplication of rectangular matrices. An initial idea to solve this problem is given. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
