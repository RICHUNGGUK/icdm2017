For realizing the intelligent pitch controller, self-organizing fuzzy sliding mode control, which combines fuzzy sliding mode control and self-organizing modifier, is proposed. In order to verify the proposed concept experimentally, a full-scale test rig of the hydraulic pitch control system of a 2MW wind turbine blades, including a novel mechanism of pitch control, a variable-speed hydraulic pump-controlled system, a disturbance system and a PC-Based control system, are designed and set up. The variable-speed pump-controlled hydraulic servo system contains an AC servo motor and a constant displacement hydraulic piston pump. In order to compare the control performance, the pitch control experiments by fuzzy sliding mode control and by self-organizing fuzzy sliding mode control are implemented respectively for different path profiles and different disturbance torque. Finally, the experimental results clarify that the pitch control controlled by self-organizing fuzzy sliding mode control can perform better than that controlled by fuzzy sliding mode control.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Pitch Control for a 2MW Wind Turbine", "paper_id": "WOS:000303277700009"}
