Scientific workflow requires detailed design of data sets and systematic description of interaction between activities and data sets, for it is more data-initiative than business workflow. Furthermore, scientific workflow needs high-performance computing facilities that are often scattered in distributed environments. As a result, distributed workflow enactment can enhance the performance and efficiency of scientific problem-solving. This research proposed a methodology of distributed process enactment for data-initiative scientific workflow. This methodology extracts an activity-based process model for general workflow systems, and then decomposes the model to distributed workflow processes and choreographs them with process interoperability messages. This research will facilitate to design complicated data-initiative workflow models and realize distributed workflow enactment for scientific problem-solving.", "paper_title": "Process decomposition and choreography for distributed scientific workflow enactment", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900103"}
