This paper proposes a new index compression and reversible data hiding scheme based on side-match vector quantization (SMVQ) and search order coding (SOC). In this proposed scheme, the confidential data are embedded into the transformed index table of a cover image. During the extracting phase, simple steps are employed to extract the confidential data and reconstruct the original cover image. The experimental results show that with a codebook size of 256, the average compression rate of the proposed scheme is 0.325 bpp, which is superior to that of the methods proposed by Chen and Huang (0.426 bpp) and Chang et al. (0.429 bpp). Additionally, the embedding and extracting times of our scheme are 5.491 s and 0.352 s, respectively, demonstrating that the execution time of the proposed scheme is much faster than that of the methods of Chen and Huang and Chang et al. Moreover, our scheme achieves better performance than other selected reversible data hiding schemes with respect to the data embedding and data compression rates. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
