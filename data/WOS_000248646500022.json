Separate CoMFA and CoMSIA models were developed from our data set for the KDR, cKit and Tie-2 inhibitors. These models showed excellent internal predictability and consistency, and validation using test-set compounds yielded a good predictive power for the pIC(50) value. The field contour maps (CoMFA and CoMSIA) corresponding to the KDR, cKit and Tie-2 kinase subtypes reflected the characteristic similarities and differences between these types. These maps provided valuable information to facilitate structural modifications of the inhibitor to increase selectivity for the KDR over cKit and Tie-2. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
