In order to characterize the structures of communication topologies, the concept of \" pre-leader-fol lower\" decomposition is introduced. Then, a necessary and sufficient condition for state consensus is established. By this method, consensus problems in networks with a single time-delay, as well as with multiple time-delays, are studied, and some necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability of consensus problems are obtained.", "paper_title": "A new approach to consensus problems in discrete-time multiagent systems with time-delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000249266300010"}
