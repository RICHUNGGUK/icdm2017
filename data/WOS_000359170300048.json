However, for some petrochemical processes, such as ethylene cracking furnace, the process is time varying as the coking in the furnace tubes. To solve this problem, this study proposes a multiple model recursive monitoring method. A computational intelligence-based cluster algorithm is employed to separate different operating modes. Then, recursive kernel principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimension of the time-varying process data and extract the nonlinear principal components recursively. Furthermore, support vector data description is utilized to build models because the process data are non-Gaussian, Finally, the corresponding statistics are constructed to detect the process fault. The performance of this method is evaluated through a case study of ethylene cracking in a petrochemical plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
