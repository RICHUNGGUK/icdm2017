Such applications require high performance occasionally and very little energy consumption during most of the time to extend battery lifetime. In addition, they require real-time guarantees. Caches have been shown to be the most critical blocks in these systems due to their high energy/area consumption and hard-to-predict behavior. New, simple, hybrid-voltage operation (high V-cc and ultralow V-cc), single-V-cc domain L1 cache architectures based on replacing energy-hungry bitcells (e.g., 10T) by more energy-efficient and smaller cells (e.g., 8T) enhanced with error detection and correction codes have been recently proposed. Such designs provide significant energy and area efficiency without jeopardizing reliability levels to still provide strong performance guarantees. In this brief, we analyze the efficiency of these designs during ultralow voltage operation. We identify the limits of such approaches by finding an energy-optimal voltage region through experimental models. The experimental results show that area efficiency is always achieved in the range 200-400 mV, whereas both energy and area gains occur above 250 mV, i.e., in near-threshold regime.", "paper_title": "Analyzing the Efficiency of L1 Caches for Reliable Hybrid-Voltage Operation Using EDC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000343014100016"}
