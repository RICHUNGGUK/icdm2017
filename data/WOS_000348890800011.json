Mitigating coastal erosion requires the improved knowledge and capability of modeling the motion of sediment particles in flows with shear and oscillations. A mathematical model, Virtual Identity Particles, was used in this paper to simulate sediment particles motion in shear and oscillatory flows. By combining the advantages of Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches, this model is capable of simulating the motion of each individual particle grain as well as a bulk of numerous grains in a fluid. Therefore, this model maintains an excellent balance between accuracy and efficiency in modeling particle-fluid flows via its economical considerations in the formulation. The collisions among particles and with walls were simulated with Speed Proportional Collisions. Simulation results demonstrate that this model is promising for investigating viscous particulate flows with shear and oscillation.
