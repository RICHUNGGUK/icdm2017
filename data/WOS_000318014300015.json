Enhancement plays a significant role in digital image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition. We present an automatic transformation technique that improves the brightness of dimmed images via the gamma correction and probability distribution of luminance pixels. To enhance video, the proposed image-enhancement method uses temporal information regarding the differences between each frame to reduce computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces enhanced images of comparable or higher quality than those produced using previous state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Efficient Contrast Enhancement Using Adaptive Gamma Correction With Weighting Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000318014300015"}
