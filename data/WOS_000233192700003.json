We trace the challenge to a requirement on constraint decomposition algorithms or decomposition-recombination (DR) planners used by most variational constraint solvers, formalize the feature hierarchy incorporation problem for DR-planners, clarify its relationship to other problems, and provide an efficient algorithmic solution. The new algorithms have been implemented in the general, 2D and 3D opensource geometric constraint solver FRONTIER developed at the University of Florida. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
