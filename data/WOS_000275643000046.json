Hyperspectral features were extracted based on subspace learning approaches, in order to reduce the redundancy of spectral space and extract the characteristic images for the further object-oriented classification. In this paper, three kinds of spectral feature extraction (FE) methods were utilized to obtain the subspace of airborne hyperspectral data: (I) unsupervised FE, such as PCA (principal component analysis), ICA (independent component analysis) and MNF (maximum noise fraction): (2) supervised FE, e.g. DBFE (decision boundary feature extraction), DAFE (discriminant analysis feature extraction) and NWFE (nonparametric weighted feature extraction): and (3) linear Mixture analysis. Afterwards, the extracted subspace features were fed into the object-based classification system. The FNEA (fractal net evolution approach) was utilized to extract objects from the subspace images and SVM (support vector machines) was then used to classify the object-based features. Experiments were conducted on two airborne hyperspectral datasets: (I) the AVIRIS dataset over the northwest Indiana's Pine with 220 spectral bands (agricultural region), and (2) the ROSIS dataset over Pavia University, northern of Italy with 102 spectral bands (urban region). Results revealed that the proposed object-based approach could give significantly higher accuracies than the traditional pixel-based subspace classification. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
