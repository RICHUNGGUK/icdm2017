In this paper, control synthesis for such a class of systems with actuator saturation is well investigated in the continuous-time and discrete-time cases. Based on the time-dependent switching signals and multiple Lyapunov function method, stabilization conditions are established in terms of LMIs. To obtain an attractive region as large as possible, the optimization problems are formulated. As the applications, the asynchronously switched control and intermittent control under actuator saturation are discussed. Numerical examples and simulations are presented to illustrate the feasibility and values of the proposed results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
