In order to extract a clean image u from a degraded version f = Ku + n (where f is the observation, K is a blurring operator and n represents additive noise), we impose a standard regularization penalty Phi(u) = integral phi(vertical bar Du vertical bar)dx < infinity on u, where phi is positive, increasing and has at most linear growth at infinity. However, on the residual f - Ku we impose a dual penalty Phi*(f - Ku) < infinity, instead of the more standard parallel to f - Ku parallel to(2)(L2) fidelity term. In particular, when phi is convex, homogeneous of degree one, and with linear growth (for instance the total variation of u), we recover the (BV, BV*) decomposition of the data f, as suggested by Y. Meyer (Oscillating Patterns in Image Processing and Nonlinear Evolution Equations, University Lecture Series, vol. 22, Am. Math. Soc., Providence, 2001). Practical minimization methods are presented, together with theoretical, experimental results and comparisons to illustrate the validity of the proposed models. Moreover, we also show that by a slight modification of the associated Euler-Lagrange equations, we obtain well-behaved approximations and improved results.", "paper_title": "(Phi, Phi*) Image Decomposition Models and Minimization Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000263146200003"}
