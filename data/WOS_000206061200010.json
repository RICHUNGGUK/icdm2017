OGPR is an efficient, stateless, and scalable routing protocol that inherits the best of the three well-known techniques for routing in ad-hoc networks, viz., greedy forwarding, reactive route discovery, and source routing. In OGPR protocol, source nodes utilize the geographic-topology information obtained during the location request phase to establish geographic paths to their respective destinations. Geographic paths decouple node ID's from the paths and are immune to changes in the network topology. Further, they help nodes avoid dead-ends due to greedy for-warding. To utilize geographic paths even in sparser networks, OGPR uses a path-healing mechanism that helps geographic paths adapt according to the network topology. We present extensions to OGPR protocol to cope with networks containing unidirectional links. Further, we present results from an extensive simulation study using GloMoSim. Simulation results show that OGPR achieves higher percentage packet delivery and lower control overhead, compared to a combination of GPSR+GLS protocols, AODV, and DSR under a wide range of network scenarios.
