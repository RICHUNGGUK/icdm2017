In this paper, we propose a novel measurement algorithm for blocking artifacts. Computer simulation results indicate that the proposed method accurately measures the blocking artifacts without using the original image. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be easily implemented in both pixel and DCT domains.", "paper_title": "Fast blind measurement of blocking artifacts in both pixel and DCT domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000250379300006"}
