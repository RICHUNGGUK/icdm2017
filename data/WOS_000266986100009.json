Many of these applications require the creation of expressive overview video clips capturing the human motion, however sufficient attention has not been given to this problem. In this paper, we present a technique that generates an overview video based on the analysis of motion capture data. Our method is targeted for applications of 3D character based animations, automating, for example, the action summary and gameplay overview in simulations and computer games. We base our method on quantum annealing optimization with an objective function that respects the analysis of the character motion and the camera movement constraints. It automatically generates a smooth camera control path, splitting it to several shots if required. To evaluate our method, we introduce a novel camera placement metric which is evaluated against previous work and conduct a user study comparing our results with the various systems.", "paper_title": "Motion Overview of Human Actions", "paper_id": "WOS:000266986100009"}
