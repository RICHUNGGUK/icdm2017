Validating a retinal model proposed by VanRullen and Thorpe, we observe that on average only up to 70% of the available information can be retrieved from rank-order encoded images. We propose a biologically inspired treatment to reduce losses due to a high correlation of adjacent basis vectors and introduce a filter-overlap correction algorithm (FoCal) based on the lateral inhibition technique used by sensory neurons to deal with data redundancy. We observe a more than 10% increase in perceptually important information recovery. Subsequently, we present a model of the primate retinal ganglion cell layout corresponding to the foveal-pit. We observe that information recovery using the foveal-pit model is possible only if FoCal is used in tandem. Furthermore, information recovery is similar for both the foveal-pit model and VanRullen and Thorpe's retinal model when used with FoCal. This is in spite of the fact that the foveal-pit model has four ganglion cell layers as in biology while VanRullen and Thorpe's retinal model has a 16-layer structure.", "paper_title": "Biologically Inspired Means for Rank-Order Encoding Images: A Quantitative Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000281973300005"}
