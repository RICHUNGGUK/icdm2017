It tells how to adjust the control periods to fulfill the workload constraints. However, it is not directly linked to the quality-of-control (QoC) management, the ultimate goal of a control system. As a result, it does not tell how to make the best use of the system resources to maximize the QoC improvement. To fill in this gap, a new feedback scheduling framework, which we refer to as QoC elastic scheduling, is developed in this paper for real-time process control systems. It addresses the QoC directly through embedding both the QoC management and workload adaptation into a constrained optimization problem. The resulting solution for period adjustment is in a closed-form expressed in QoC measurements, enabling closed-loop feedback of the QoC to the task scheduler. Whenever the QoC elastic scheduler is activated, it improves the QoC the most while still meeting the system constraints. Examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the QoC elastic scheduling.", "paper_title": "QoC elastic scheduling for real-time control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000295793000002"}
