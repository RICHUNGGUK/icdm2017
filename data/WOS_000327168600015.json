It is challenging because of the large within-class variations due to the changeable body appearance and environment and the small between-class differences arising from the possibly similar body shape and clothes style. A novel method named \"Bi-level Relative Information Analysis\" is proposed in this paper for the issue by treating it as a set-based ranking problem. It creatively designs a relative dissimilarity using set-level neighborhood information, called \"Set-level Common-Near-Neighbor Modeling\", complementary to the sample-level relative feature \"Third-Party Collaborative Representation\" which has recently been proven to be quite effective for multiple-shot person re-identification. Experiments implemented on several public benchmark datasets show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Bi-level Relative Information Analysis for Multiple-Shot Person Re-Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000327168600015"}
