Design tasks for function generation and motion transmission are addressed in the current study. The basic idea of the present approach is to provide a computational framework for design synthesis by imitating the common design method of reviewing past designs to obtain solution concepts for a new design problem. A notion of virtual junction generators is introduced to conceptualize and represent underlying design concepts contained in existing mechanisms. Virtual function generators are derived from previous designs, and serve as new conceptual building blocks for conceptual synthesis of mechanisms. Feasible design alternatives are generated by combining virtual function generators using some adaptation rules. The reuse of prior design concepts is accomplished via virtual function generators within the framework of case-based reasoning. The approach is demonstrated through an application.
