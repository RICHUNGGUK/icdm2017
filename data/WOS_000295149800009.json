In this paper, we present an improved reversible data hiding scheme that can recover original VQ indices after data extraction. As with Chang et al.'s scheme, our proposed scheme also depends on the locally adaptive coding scheme. However, experimental results confirm that the hiding capacity of our proposed scheme is around 1.36 bpi in most digital images, which is typically higher than that of Chang et al.'s [17]. Moreover, the average compression rate that can be achieved with our proposed scheme is 0.49 bpp, which outperforms both Lin and Chang's scheme (0.50 bpp), Tsai (0.50 bpp), Chang et al.'s scheme (0.53 bpp), and Yang and Lin's scheme (0.53 bpp).
