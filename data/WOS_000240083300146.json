Pattern rule induction is one kind of main methods to do information extraction. Manually constructing pattern rules is tedious and error prone. In this paper, we present GRID-CoTrain, a weakly supervised paradigm by bootstrapping GRID (a supervised rule induction system) with cotraining and active learning. We also utilize external knowledge resource such as WordNet and existing ontology knowledge to optimize the learned pattern rules.", "paper_title": "A two-view CoTraining rule induction system for information extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300146"}
