It is assumed that for each individual local data stream, either there are no local changes, or there is a big local change that is larger than a pre-specified lower bound. Two different types of scenarios are studied: one is the sparse post-change case when the unknown number of affected data streams is much smaller than the total number of data streams, and the other is when all local data streams are affected simultaneously although not necessarily identically. We propose a systematic approach to develop efficient global monitoring schemes for quickest change detection by combining hard thresholding with linear shrinkage estimators to estimating all post-change parameters simultaneously. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the shrinkage estimation can balance the tradeoff between the first-order and second-order terms of the asymptotic expression on the detection delays, and our numerical simulation studies illustrate the usefulness of shrinkage estimation and the challenge of Monte Carlo simulation of the average run length to false alarm in the context of online monitoring large-scale data streams.", "paper_title": "Large-Scale Multi-Stream Quickest Change Detection via Shrinkage Post-Change Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000368420200033"}
