So far, this particular dynamic has been found in a semiconductor laser with optoelectronic feedback. Here, we show that the same phenomenology occurs also in light-emitting diodes, which are ideal candidates for the implementation of a complex network on a chip. In particular, we study the appearance of both stochastic incoherence (SI) and stochastic coherence (SC) in a single unit, as well as in two coupled units. We demonstrate experimentally and explore numerically the enhancement of SC and worsening of SI induced by coupling systems in array.", "paper_title": "Noise Effects on Excitable Chaotic Attractors in Coupled Light-Emitting Diodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000308020800021"}
