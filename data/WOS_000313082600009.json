We propose a semiparametric profile least squares estimation procedure to estimate the single index. Then we develop a global weighted least squares estimation procedure for parameters of linear regression models via the varying coefficient models. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. The results combined with consistent estimators for the asymptotic variance can be employed to test whether the targeted parameters in the single index and linear regression models are significant. Finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators is assessed by simulation experiments. The proposed methods are also applied to a dataset from a Pima Indian diabetes data study.
