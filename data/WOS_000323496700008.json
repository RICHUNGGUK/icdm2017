Models for operation timing, customer satisfaction and customer robot interaction are presented, based on which a simulation developed to estimate fan-out and robot team performance. Techniques for managing interaction flow and operator task assignment are introduced. In simulation, the effectiveness of different techniques and factors related to team performance are studied. A case study on deploying multiple robots in a shopping mall is then presented to demonstrate the usefulness of our study in helping the design and implementation of social robots in real-world settings.", "paper_title": "Designing and Implementing a Human-Robot Team for Social Interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000323496700008"}
