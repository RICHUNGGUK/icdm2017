Based on the observation that various biological systems have developed mechanisms to overcome these issues, BiSNET follows certain biological principles such as decentralization, food gathering/storage and natural selection to design MWSN applications. In BiSNET, each application consists of multiple software agents, which operate on the BiSNET middleware platform in individual sensor nodes, and each agent exploits certain biologically-inspired mechanisms such as energy exchange, pheromone emission, replication, migration and death. This is analogous to a bee colony (application) consisting of multiple bees (agents). This paper describes the biologically-inspired mechanisms in BiSNET, and evaluates their impacts on the autonomy, scalability, adaptability, self-healing and simplicity of MWSNs. Simulation results show that BiSNET allows sensor nodes (agents and platforms) to be scalable with respect to network size, autonomously adapt their steep periods for power efficiency and responsiveness of data collection, adaptively aggregate data from different types of sensor nodes, and collectively self-heal (i.e., detect and eliminate) false positive sensor data. The BiSNET platform is implemented simple in its design and lightweight in its memory footprint. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
