The flow is modelled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations spatially discretized with the aid of the stabilized finite element method. The motion of the computational domain is treated with the aid of Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method. The structure motion is described by an equivalent system with two degrees of freedom governed by a system of ordinary differential equations and discretized in time with the aid of an implicit multistep method and strongly coupled with the flow model. The influence of inlet/outlet boundary conditions is studied. The numerical analysis is performed and compared to the related results from literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
