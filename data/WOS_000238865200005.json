They vary mainly according to different working set selections. Existing implementations and analysis usually consider some specific selection rules. This paper studies sequential minimal optimization type decomposition methods under a general and flexible way of choosing the two-element working set. The main results include: 1) a simple asymptotic convergence proof, 2) a general explanation of the shrinking and caching techniques, and 3) the linear convergence of the methods. Extensions to some support vector machine variants are also discussed.", "paper_title": "A study on SMO-type decomposition methods for support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000238865200005"}
