The latter, should be able to efficiently adapt resource provisioning to the dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) demands of such applications. To this direction, in this paper we present a monitoring system that facilitates on-the-fly self-configuration in terms of both the monitoring time intervals and the monitoring parameters. The proposed approach forms a multi-layered monitoring framework for measuring QoS at both application and infrastructure levels targeting trigger events for runtime adaptability of resource provisioning estimation and decision making. Besides, we demonstrate the operation of the implemented mechanism and evaluate its effectiveness using a real-world application scenario, namely Film Post Production. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
