Our experimental results prove that a Gate-Generated Functional Weight Classifier post-aggregation serves to get this objective, both in situations in which data are available everywhere and when some features are missing for the post-aggregation task - a case which is relevant for distributed classification problems. Post-aggregation techniques can be especially useful for massive (integrated by many learners) ensembles - such as most the committees, which do not allow trainable first aggregations - and for human decision fusion, because it is unclear what features are considered in this kind of processes.
