In this paper, an agent-based multi-mode interaction middleware model and its supporting system for software services were proposed. This model includes an interaction feature decomposition and configuration model to enable interaction programming, an agent-based middleware model, and a programmable coordination media based on reflection technology. The decomposition and configuration model for interaction features can assist programmers in interaction programming by analyzing and synthesizing interaction features. The agent-based middleware model provides a runtime framework for service multi-mode interaction. The programmable coordination media is able to effectively support software service coordination based on multi-mode interaction. To verify feasibility and efficiency of the above method, the design, implementation and performance analysis of Artemis-M3C, a multi-mode interaction middleware for software services, were introduced. The result shows that the above method is feasible and that the Artemis-M3C system is practical and effective in multi-mode interaction.", "paper_title": "Multi-mode interaction middleware for software services", "paper_id": "WOS:000257394000001"}
