Its implementation in food quality control for the food industry has been highlighted by several authors that have focused on different applications designed specifically for this task. This is especially true in the case of taking into account the reasoning process, expressed in linguistic terms, of operators and experts. Nevertheless, applications are still limited and few reviews on this topic are available. Consequently, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the application of fuzzy concepts to the control of the product quality in the food industry over the past 10 years. Future interesting developments and trends in this area are also emphasized. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
