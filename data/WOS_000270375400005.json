These findings are normally evaluated by an expert using visual subjective analysis. In this work, we present a computational semi-automated method to quantify these pathologies. We also present a validation study of the method using a subset of 39 cases randomly extracted from a set of more than 2000 cases (perforations and tympanosclerosis) of the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre. The validation was performed using Ground Truth images, generated by experts, and has shown promising results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
