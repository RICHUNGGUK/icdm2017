S. and China. To confront this situation there is a wide variety of courses for learning Spanish. However, specific initiatives combining proven teaching methods in university classroom experiences with the creation of new multidisciplinary content displayed on 3D virtual sets have not been detected. This study proposes the establishment of a learner's role-play to improve learner's skills. Foreign languages' learning is the focus of the report because can serve as an appropriate context to analyze self-directed learning strategies and the culture of Lifelong Learning. The goal of this research is the creation of an integrated Massively Multiuser Online Learning (MMOL) platform that enables the creation, development and deployment of contents and activities for teaching Spanish in an ad hoc educational virtual world named SLRoute. Such environment promotes an immersive, creative and collaborative experience in the process of learning a foreign language. In order to assess the validity and reliability of this technology we used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The ultimate intention is to measure the acceptability of MMOL platforms for educational issues.", "paper_title": "Language Learning in Educational Virtual Worlds - a TAM Based Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000327375100007"}
