We investigate decision problems like reachability of a configuration, boundedness (finiteness of the state space), and coverability (verification of safety properties). Our analysis is aimed at understanding the expressive power of rules that dynamically modify the structure of a membrane.", "paper_title": "On the verification of membrane systems with dynamic structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000286534400002"}
