The modified particle swarm optimizer is used to both single-objective and multi-objective optimization problems of interior ballistic charge design for a guided projectile. The solution results show that the modified particle swarm optimizer has a better convergence rate and accuracy than the original particle swarm optimizer and other ever used optimization methods. Combined with deterred propellant technique, the interior ballistic charge design for a guided projectile is optimized by the modified particle swarm optimizer. The optimization results improve the interior ballistic performance and launch safety and provide theoretical direction for the interior ballistic charge design of guided projectile.", "paper_title": "Interior ballistic charge design based on a modified particle swarm optimizer", "paper_id": "WOS:000305987000010"}
