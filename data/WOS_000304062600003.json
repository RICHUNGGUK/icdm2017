The unique challenge of pervasive sensor applications that we address is the need for adjusting resource allocation in response to the changing application requirements and evolving sensor network conditions. We use two market mechanisms: auctions at individual sensor nodes to optimize routing, and switch options to optimize dynamic selection of sensor network services as well as switching between modes of operation in pervasive security applications. We also present scenarios of transient congestion management and home security system to motivate the proposed techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
