These operators come from the discretization of groundwater flow problems modeled by the linear Darcy equation, where the permeability field is highly heterogeneous and randomly generated. To be computationally efficient, a low-rank approximation of the Aitken's formula is computed from the singular value decomposition of successive iterated solutions on subdomains interfaces. Numerical results explore the efficiency of the solver with respect to the random distribution parameters, and specific implementations of the acceleration are compared for large scale 3D problems. These results confirm the numerical behavior of the methodology obtained on 2D Darcy problems (Tromeur-Dervout D. Meshfree adaptive Aitken-Schwarz domain decomposition with application to Darcy flow.
