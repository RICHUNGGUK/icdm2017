More specifically, assuming the presence of Nakagami-m faded multiple co-channel interferers at the source/destination terminals, the closed-form approximate expression for the outage probability is derived by using moment-based estimators attaining the appropriate Nakagami-m fading parameter. Simulation results demonstrate that our analytical result is in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation.", "paper_title": "Outage Performance for DF Two-Way Relaying with Co-Channel Interference over Nakagami-m Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399500012"}
