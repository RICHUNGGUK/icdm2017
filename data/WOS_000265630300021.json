Three useful weights measurements are introduced within the operation window to re duce false decisions on the basis of the LCID algorithm. The WIS algorithm has a simple weight-evaluating structure with low complexity. which therefore makes it easy to implement in hardware. Experimental Lilts demonstrated that the WIS algorithm performs better than previous techniques.", "paper_title": "Weighted Interpolation Scheme for Robust Video Deinterlacing", "paper_id": "WOS:000265630300021"}
