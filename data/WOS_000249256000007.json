The package allows inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering observables to be calculated, allowing comparison with experimental data produced at large scale facilities. Various simplification schemes are presented for analyzing displacement vectors, which are otherwise too complicated to understand in very large systems.", "paper_title": "NMscatt: a program for calculating inelastic scattering from large biomolecular systems using classical force-field simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000249256000007"}
