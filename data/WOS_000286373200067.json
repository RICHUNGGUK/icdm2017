To address these problems, this paper explores a novel advanced encoding scheme, which reduces both memory demand and execution time, and provides improved performance. The novel advanced encoding scheme known as the engine encoding, have been implemented in a multi-classifier, which combines the scaled probabilities, configuration information, and the discriminating abilities of the associated component classifiers. The problems of overloading and saturation experienced by traditional networks are solved by training the base classifiers on differing sub-sets of the required pattern classes and allowing the combiner classifier to derive a solution. Current Multi-classifier Systems are easily biased when trained on one class more often than another class, when patterns representing a class are very large compared to the rest, or when the multi-classifier depends on a certain fixed order of arrangement of pattern classes. A unique statistical arrangement method is hereby presented which aims to solve the bias problem. This statistical arrangement method also enhances independence of component classifiers. The system is demonstrated on the exemplar of fingerprint identification and utilizes a Weightless Neural System called the Enhanced Probabilistic Convergent Neural Network (EPCN) in a Multi-classifier System.
