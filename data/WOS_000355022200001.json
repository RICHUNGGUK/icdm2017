The adding of supporting structures slows down the speed of fabrication and introduces artifacts onto the finished surface. We present an orientation-driven shape optimizer to slim down the supporting structures used in single material-based AM. The optimizer can be employed as a tool to help designers to optimize the original model to achieve a more self-supported shape, which can be used as a reference for their further design. The model to be optimized is first enclosed in a volumetric mesh, which is employed as the domain of computation. The optimizer is driven by the operations of reorientation taken on tetrahedra with 'facing-down' surface facets. We formulate the demand on minimizing shape variation as global rigidity energy. The local optimization problem for determining a minimal rotation is analyzed on the Gauss sphere, which leads to a closed-form solution. Moreover, we also extend our approach to create the functions of controlling the deformation and searching for optimal printing directions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
