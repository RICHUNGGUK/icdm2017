In this paper, the axon P systems are used as number generators and language generators. As a language generator, the relationships of the families of languages generated by axon P systems with finite and context-free languages are considered. As a number generator, a characterization of the family of finite sets can be obtained by axon P systems with only one node. The relationships of sets of numbers generated by axon P systems with semilinear sets of numbers are also investigated. This paper partially answers some open problems formulated by H. Chen, T.-O. Ishdorj and Gh. Paun.", "paper_title": "A Note on the Generative Power of Axon P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262821700009"}
