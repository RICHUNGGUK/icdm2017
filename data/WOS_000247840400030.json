An unbiased generalization error estimator called the subspace information criterion (SIC) is shown to be useful for model selection, but its range of application is limited to linear learning methods. In this paper, we extend SIC to be applicable to non-linear learning.", "paper_title": "Generalization error estimation for non-linear learning methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840400030"}
