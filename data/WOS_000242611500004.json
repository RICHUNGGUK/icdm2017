A current feedback mixer, and a mixer with a folded input, were designed in order to test benefits obtainable from the use of equally fast PNP- and NPN-transistors. The target was to improve linearity and to increase output compression point (OP-1dB) of the mixers. A +5 dBm output compression point @2 GHz was measured while drawing 43 mA from 5 V voltage supply.", "paper_title": "Up-conversion mixers in a complementary 0.4 mu m SiGe process", "paper_id": "WOS:000242611500004"}
