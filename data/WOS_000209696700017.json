Relying on efficient approximations proposed elsewhere in the literature for the sum of Gamma random variables (RVs), and based on a new, accurate approximation for the product of two Nakagami-m RVs, tight closed-form approximate expressions for the outage probability and throughput are derived. Representative numerical results show the accuracy of the proposed approximations.", "paper_title": "Performance of Block-Markov Full Duplex Relaying with Self Interference in Nakagami-m Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696700017"}
