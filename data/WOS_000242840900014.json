One main difficulty in applying PSO to real-world applications is that PSO usually need a large number of fitness evaluations before a satisfying result can be obtained. This paper introduces a new \"fast particle swarm optimization\" (FPSO) that does not evaluate all new positions owning a fitness and associated reliability value of each particle of the swarm and the reliability value is only evaluated using the true fitness function if the reliability value is below a threshold. Moreover, applying random. evaluation, reliability value update and self-adaptive threshold strategies to the FPSO further enhances the performance of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "A fast particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000242840900014"}
