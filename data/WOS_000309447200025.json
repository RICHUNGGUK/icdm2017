Motivated by the interpolation-based abstraction refinement technique, we apply the interpolation theorem to synthesize predicates implicitly implied by program texts. Our technique is able to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the learning-based loop invariant inference algorithm of Jung, Kong, Wang and Yi (2010).
