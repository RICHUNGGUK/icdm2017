The web ontology language (OWL) and the semantic web rule language (SWRL) in the Semantic Web are employed to construct the product information model. The traditional modeling language called EXPRESS is discussed. The representation methodology for EXPRESS-driven product information model is then proposed. The key of the representation methodology is mapping from EXPRESS to OWL/SWRL Some illustrated examples are presented. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
