Such services can go well beyond what is possible for a mobile phone acting alone. In essense, access to diverse resources such as raw computational power, social networking relationships, or sensor readings across a set of different devices calls for distributed task execution. In this paper, we discuss the SCAMPI architecture designed to support distributed task execution in opportunistic pervasive networks. The key elements of the architecture include leveraging human social behavior for efficient opportunistic interaction between a variety of sensors, personal communication devices and resources embedded in the local environment. The SCAMPI architecture abstracts resources as service components following a service-oriented model. This enables composing rich applications that utilize a collection of service components available in the environment.", "paper_title": "SCAMPI: Service Platform for Social Aware Mobile and Pervasive Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000309217600080"}
