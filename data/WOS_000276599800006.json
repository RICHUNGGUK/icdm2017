Before two nodes agree to interact, they must trust that each will satisfy the security and privacy requirements of the other. In this paper, using the cognition inspired method from the brain informatics (BI), we present a novel approach to improving the search efficiency and scalability of MANETs by clustering nodes based on cognitive trust mechanism. The trust relationship is formed by evaluating the level of trust using Bayesian statistic analysis, and clusters can be formed and maintained autonomously by nodes with only partial knowledge. Simulation experiments show that each node can form and join proper clusters, which improve the interaction performance of the entire network. The essence of the underlying reason is analyzed through the theory of complex networks, revealing great scalability of this method.", "paper_title": "Bayesian cognitive trust model based self-clustering algorithm for MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000276599800006"}
