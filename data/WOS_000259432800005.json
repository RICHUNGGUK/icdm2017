The method is based on combining the Cholesky decomposition method for complete data VARMA evaluation and the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. Potential saving for pure VAR processes is discussed and formulae for the estimation of missing values and shocks are provided. A theorem on the determinant of a low rank update is proved. Matlab implementation of the algorithm is in a companion article.", "paper_title": "Evaluating exact VARMA likelihood and its gradient when data are incomplete", "paper_id": "WOS:000259432800005"}
