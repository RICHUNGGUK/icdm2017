Current data storage schemes (row-store and column-store) cannot efficiently answer ad-hoc aggregate query on massive data sets in cloud computing. A new data storage structure (bit vector storage structure, bit-store for short) is proposed in this paper. The paper focuses on proposing ad-hoc aggregate query algorithms based on bit-store. Firstly, the storage model of bit-store including its attribute encoding schemes and bit file organization is introduced. Secondly, different aggregate operations for query processing are presented based on different encoding schemes. Thirdly, cost analysis for different aggregate operations is presented. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms is showed by the analytical and experimental results. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
