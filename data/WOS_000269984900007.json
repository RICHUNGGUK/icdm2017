In many instances where a set of combinatorial objects carries the order structure of a lattice, this characterization yields a slick proof of distributivity or UL-distributivity. This is exemplified by proving a distributive lattice structure on Delta-bonds with invariant circular flow-difference. This instance generalizes several previously studied lattice structures, in particular, c-orientations (Propp), alpha-orientations of planar graphs (Felsner, resp. de Mendez) and planar flows (Khuller, Naor and Klein). The characterization also applies to other instances, e.g., to chip-firing games.", "paper_title": "ULD-Lattices and Delta-Bonds", "paper_id": "WOS:000269984900007"}
