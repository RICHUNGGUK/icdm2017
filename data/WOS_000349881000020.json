For this purpose, three fuzzy logic controllers were developed and tested to maintain indoor parameters (temperature, humidity, CO2 and NH3) at desired values using LabVIEW software. The results showed that the fuzzy controller provides better response for temperature and humidity. For fuzzy controller, the percent of working time in which temperature and relative humidity were maintained in less than +/-1 degrees C and +/-5% from the set points were found to be 78.76% and 96.83%, respectively. These percentages for on/off controller were calculated as 31.36% and 68.35%. Results showed that the mean value of CO2 concentration with on/off controller (1124.64 ppm) was lower than that of fuzzy controller (2582 ppm). However, NH3 concentration was the same for both controllers. It was found that the maximum energy consumption was for heating the poultry house. The mean value of total power consumption by the actuators for fuzzy system was found to be 389.59 kJ/h which is 42% lower than that of on/off controller (664.49 kJ/h). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
