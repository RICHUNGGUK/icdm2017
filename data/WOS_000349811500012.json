Vertical planes, reconstructed from coplanar vertical lines, are robust high-level features if compared with point features or line features. Firstly, the error models of vertical lines and vertical planes are built, where maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is employed to estimate all vertical planes from coplanar vertical lines. Then, the closed-form representation of camera location error variance is derived. Finally, the minimum variance camera pose estimation is formulated into a convex optimization problem, and the weight for each vertical plane is obtained by solving this well-studied problem. Experiments are carried out and the results show that the proposed localization method has an accuracy of about 2 meters, at par with commercial GPS operating in open environments.", "paper_title": "Error aware multiple vertical planes based visual localization for mobile robots in urban environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000349811500012"}
