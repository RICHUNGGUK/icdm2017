From this variety of meanings in which it is employed, the notion of orchestration emerges as the appropriation and integration of the different available technologies in classroom practice. This paper introduces the role of patterns (i.e., recurrent solutions to common problems) and other researcher artifacts (e.g., representations of orchestration) in developing both new educational technologies and interventions that are easier to appropriate/integrate. We also discuss other open questions around orchestration, which are still being discussed in the TEL community. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
