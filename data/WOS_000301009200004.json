Linear graph embedding (LGE) is a general framework for subspace learning. In this paper, we propose a structured sparse extension to LGE (SSLGE) by introducing a structured sparsity-inducing norm into LGE. Specifically, SSLGE casts the projection bases learning into a regression-type optimization problem, and then the structured sparsity regularization is applied to the regression coefficients. The regularization selects a subset of features and meanwhile encodes high-order information reflecting a priori structure information of the data. The SSLGE technique provides a unified framework for discovering structured sparse subspace. Computationally, by using a variational equality and the Procrustes transformation, SSLGE is efficiently solved with closed-form updates. Experimental results on face image show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
