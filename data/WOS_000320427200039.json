To predict the behaviors of thruster plume quantitatively, a numerical analysis with a parallel Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method using unstructured three-dimensional meshes is conducted. The interaction between the exhausted plumes from four monopropellant hydrazine thrusters and the satellite components, such as an S-band antenna, a launch vehicle adapter ring and solar arrays, are investigated. The analysis results verify that the exhausted thruster plumes provide the negligible influences of disturbance force/torque and thermal loading on the present LEO satellite configuration when compared with their values of nominal thrust/torque and solar heating. Also, the chemical species deposition of the thruster plume has no serious contamination due to its high surface temperature while only a large amount of H-2 molecules is observed on the S-band antenna cone. From this study, the design configuration of the present LEO satellite is verified sufficiently by the numerical simulation of the plume interaction effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
