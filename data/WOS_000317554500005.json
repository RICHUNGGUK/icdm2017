Current research on this topic has shifted from holistic approaches to representations of individual object parts linked by structural information. Along this line of research, this paper presents a novel part-based approach for automatic object detection using 2D images. The approach encodes the visual structures of the object to be detected and the image by a 2D combinatorial map and a combinatorial pyramid, respectively. Within this framework, we propose to perform the searching of the object as an error-tolerant submap isomorphism that will be conducted at the different layers of the pyramid. The approach has been applied to the detection of visual landmarks for mobile robotics self-localization. Experimental results show the good performance and robustness of the approach in the presence of partial occlusions, uneven illumination and 3-dimensional rotations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
