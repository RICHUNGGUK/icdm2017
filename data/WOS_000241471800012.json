The problem is that there are some agents who are in charge of their transmissions and each of them is selfish to minimize its own transmission cost without considering the overall performance of the network. But the embarrassment in wireless mesh networks is that the selfish agents perhaps may cause interference for the non-cooperation. We think that the game theoretic tools are helpful for the selfish agents to make feasible choices. We yield a sufficient condition of the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium in our Strong Transmission Game and prove it in this paper. Some simulations reveal the feasibility of our game theoretic approach.", "paper_title": "Interference-aware selfish routing in multi-ratio multi-channel wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800012"}
