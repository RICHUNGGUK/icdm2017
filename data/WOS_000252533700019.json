As a result, there is a pressing need to investigate lightpath provisioning in multidomain DWDM networks. Although inter-domain provisioning has been well-studied for packet/cell-switching networks, the wavelength dimension (along with wavelength conversion) presents many added challenges. To address these concerns, a detailed GMPLS-based hierarchical routing framework for provisioning transparent/translucent/opaque multi-domain DWDM networks is presented. The scheme adapts topology abstraction to hide internal domain state so as to resolve routing scalability and security issues. Specifically a novel full-mesh topology abstraction scheme is developed for full wavelength conversion domains, i.e., to disseminate additional wavelength converter state. Related inter-domain lightpath RWA and signaling schemes are also tabled. Performance analysis results are then presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms along with directions for future research work. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
