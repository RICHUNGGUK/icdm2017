We propose a unique approach of using a power gating switch (PGS) in ultra-low V-dd regimes. Unlike the conventional manner of using PGSs, our optimization suggests using minimal-sized PGSs with a slightly higher V-dd to compensate for voltage drop across the PGS. In SPICE simulations, this reduces total energy consumption by similar to 125 x compared to conventional approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization is also confirmed by measurements taken from an ultra-low power microprocessor. Additionally, the feasibility of using minimal PGSs in ultra-low V-dd regimes is investigated using SPICE simulations and silicon measurements.", "paper_title": "Sleep Mode Analysis and Optimization With Minimal-Sized Power Gating Switch for Ultra-Low V-dd Operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000302085300003"}
