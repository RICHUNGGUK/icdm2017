Considering the due date of AGVs requiring for material handling among shops in a jobshop layout, their earliness and tardiness are significant in satisfying the expected cycle time and from an economic view point. Earliness results in AGVs waiting and tardiness causes temporary part storages in the shop floor. Therefore, we propose a mathematical program to minimize the penalized earliness and tardiness. Since the mathematical program is difficult to solve with a conventional method, an optimization method in two stages, namely searching the solution space and finding optimal solutions are proposed. The performance of the proposed mathematical model is tested in a numerical example and compared with several methods in the current literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
