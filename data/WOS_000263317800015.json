Cheptea, C. Martin-Vide, V. Mitrana, A new operation on words suggested by DNA biochemistry: Hairpin completion, in: Proc. Transgressive Computing, 2006, pp. 216-228] with motivations coming from DNA biochemistry and hairpin reduction as the inverse operation of the hairpin completion. Both operations are viewed here as formal operations on words and languages. We settle the closure properties of the classes of regular and linear context-free languages under hairpin completion in comparison with hairpin reduction. While the class of linear context-free languages is exactly the weak-code image of the class of the hairpin completion of regular languages, rather surprisingly, the weak-code image of the class of the hairpin completion of linear context-free languages is a class of mildly context-sensitive languages. The closure properties with respect to the hairpin reduction of some time and space complexity classes are also Studied. We show that the factors found in the general cases are not necessary for regular and context-free languages. This part of the paper completes the results given in the earlier paper, where a similar investigation was made for hairpin completion. Finally, we briefly discuss the iterated variants of these operations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
