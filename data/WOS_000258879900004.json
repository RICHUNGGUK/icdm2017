This happens, for example, when samples of interest for the application at hand are present together with several noisy samples. In this paper we present a graph-based algorithm for cluster detection that is particularly suited for detecting clusters of any size and shape, without the need of specifying either the actual number of clusters or the other parameters. The algorithm has been tested on data coming from two different computer vision applications. A comparison with other four state-of-the-art graph-based algorithms was also provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A graph-based algorithm for cluster detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000258879900004"}
