However, energy efficiency is being recently considered as important as raw performance and has become a critical aspect to the development of scalable systems. These strict energy constraints guided the development of a new class of so-called light-weight manycore processors. This study evaluates the computing and energy performance of two well-known irregular NP-hard problems - the Traveling-Salesman Problem (TSP) and K-Means clustering - and a numerical seismic wave propagation simulation kernel - Ondes3D - on multicore, NUMA, and manycore platforms. First, we concentrate on the nontrivial task of adapting these applications to a manycore, specifically the novel MPPA-256 manycore processor. Then, we analyze their performance and energy consumption on those different machines. Our results show that applications able to fully use the resources of a manycore can have better performance and may consume from 3.8x to 13x less energy when compared to low-power and general-purpose multicore processors, respectively.
