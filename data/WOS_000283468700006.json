In order to achieve the accurate fatigue damage evolution results, the accurate stress analysis should be performed ahead. The global finite element model should be updated with the help of identified modal parameters and the cable forces. The results show that the updated finite element model can represent the global dynamic and static characteristics in good agreement with the measured ones. However, for the local fatigue damage regions, the stress analysis of global finite element model may not suitable for the stress concentration analysis. A detailed finite element model of local bridge deck is incorporated in the global FE model and the standard truck loads were applied to the multi-scale FE model. With the help of monitored traffic loading, the fatigue damage evolution of bridge deck would be performed and provides basis for the safety assessment of the steel bridge.", "paper_title": "FATIGUE DAMAGE EVOLUTION OF STEEL BRIDGES BASED ON MULTI-SCALE FINITE ELEMENT MODELING", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468700006"}
