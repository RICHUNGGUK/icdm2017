A mixed H-2/H-infinity formulation of the SFDC problem using dynamic observer is presented. In essence, a single unit called detector/controller is designed where the detector is a dynamic observer and the controller is a state feedback controller based on the dynamic observer. Hence, the detector/controller unit produces two signals, i.e., the detection and control signals. It is shown that the dynamic observer can be used effectively to tackle the drawbacks of the existing methods of SFDC design. Indeed, the idea presented in this paper is based on applying the advantages of dynamic observers, which leads to some sufficient conditions for solvability of the SFDC problem in terms of LMI feasibility conditions. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design technique.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL SIMULTANEOUS FAULT DETECTION AND CONTROL APPROACH BASED ON DYNAMIC OBSERVER", "paper_id": "WOS:000306679500031"}
