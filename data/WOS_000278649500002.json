The cognitive radio (CR) technology has been introduced to address this problem, but this technique might increase the interference to primary users. In this paper, we consider the distributed CR network scenarios, analyze the performance of a Cognitive MAC Protocol where CR nodes sense channel that is in idle state to send cooperative information, and propose an alternative Cognitive Mac Protocol based on CR nodes send cooperative information when they sense the channel that is in busy state. Comparing the performance between previous protocol and our proposed protocol, we find that the latter can reduce the interference since misjudge obviously with more CR nodes, and eliminates the phenomenon of false detection completely to make full use of spectral efficiency without the influence of white noise.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of A Busy Cognitive Multi-Channel MAC Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000278649500002"}
