This problem apart from being a classic for directed graphs, is to the best of our knowledge a wide open aspect for the field of dynamic graph algorithms. Our contributions include results on the hardness of updates, a dynamic algorithm for updating a DMST, and detailed experimental analysis of the proposed algorithm exhibiting a speedup factor of at least 2 in comparison with the static practice.", "paper_title": "Updating directed minimum cost spanning trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000238121700027"}
