In this paper, we present an energy-efficiency enhanced virtual machine (VM) scheduling policy, namely Share-Reclaiming with Collective I/O (SRC-I/O), with aiming at reducing the energy-efficiency losses caused by I/O virtualization. The proposed SRC-I/O scheduler allows VMs to reclaim extra CPU shares in certain conditions so as to increase CPU utilization. Meanwhile, it separates I/O-intensive VMs from CPU-intensive ones and schedules them in a collective manner, so as to reduce. the context-switching cost when scheduling mixed workloads. Extensive experiments are conducted on various platforms to investigate the performance of the proposed scheduler. The results indicate that when the system is in presence of mixed workloads, SRC-I/O scheduler outperforms many existing VM schedulers in terms of energy-efficiency and I/O responsiveness.
