The underlined policy ensures delay-related quality of service (QoS) requirements with reduced interference to the primary user. In this work we also take into account the peak and average transmit power constraints for the secondary user. An optimization problem associated with the power control policy is formulated based on a cross-layer framework, where the queue on data link layer is serviced by the power control policy at the physical layer. A recursive algorithm under the power constraints is developed to solve for the optimal solution. It is shown that the reduction of average interference to the primary user is related closely to the QoS requirements. The analysis derives the average interference power limits to the primary user in fading channels with guaranteed QoS requirements for the secondary user. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed power control policy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
