We present an ant colony system hybridized with local search for solving the OVRP (ACS-OVRP). Additionally, a Post-Optimization procedure is incorporated in the proposed algorithm to further improve the best-found solutions. The computational results of ACS-OVRP compared to those of other algorithms are reported, which indicate that the ACS-OVRP is another efficient algorithm for solving the OVRP.", "paper_title": "An ant colony system for the open vehicle routing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100033"}
