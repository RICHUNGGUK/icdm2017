We present a collection of new results for the UFP both in the offline (all requests are given from the beginning) and the online (requests arrive at the system one after the other) setting. A fundamental ingredient of our analysis is the introduction of a new graph parameter, the flow number, that aims to capture global communication properties of the network. With the help of the flow number we develop a general method for transforming arbitrary multicommodity flow solutions into solutions that use short paths only. This generalizes a well-known theorem of Leighton and Rao [J. ACM 46 (6) (1,999) 787-832] that applies to uniform flows only. Both the parameter and the method may therefore be of independent interest. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.
