This line of research was left dormant for several decades until relatively recently, when a paper of Andersen, Louveaux, Weismantel and Wolsey generated renewed interest in the corner polyhedron and intersection cuts. Recent developments rely on tools drawn from convex analysis, geometry and number theory, and constitute an elegant bridge between these areas and integer programming. We survey these results and highlight recent breakthroughs in this area.", "paper_title": "A geometric approach to cut-generating functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000354623300007"}
