Also, the complexity of such a structure grows exponentially with the number of combined random sets, making it quickly intractable for computations. In this paper, we propose a simple guaranteed consonant outer approximation of this structure. The complexity of this outer approximation does not increase with the number of marginal random sets (i.e., of dimensions), making it easier to handle in uncertainty propagation. Features and advantages of this outer approximation are then discussed, with the help of some illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "A CONSONANT APPROXIMATION OF THE PRODUCT OF INDEPENDENT CONSONANT RANDOM SETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272250800001"}
