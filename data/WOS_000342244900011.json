An accurate enough resolution of such a layer can take most computational time. The situation even becomes worse for unsteady problems. To avoid time-consuming computations, a new approach is developed, which is based on a non-overlapping domain decomposition. The boundary condition of Robin type at the interface boundary is achieved via transfer of the boundary condition from the wall. For the first time interface boundary conditions of Robin type are derived for a model nonstationary equation which simulates the key terms of the unsteady boundary layer equations. In the case of stationary solutions the approach is automatically reduced to the technique earlier developed for the steady problems. The considered test cases demonstrate that unsteady effects can be significant for near-wall domain decomposition. In particular, they can be important in the case of the wall-function-based approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
