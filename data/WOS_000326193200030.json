The helical propensities of syPrP HA and huPrP HA are very high under both pH conditions, which implies that HA is barely involved in the helix-to-beta transition. The SyPrP HB chain has a strong tendency to adopt an extended conformation, which is possibly involved in the mechanism of infectious prion diseases in Syrian hamster. HuPrP HC has more of a preference for the extended conformation than huPrP HA and huPrP HB do, which leads to the conjecture that it is more likely to be the source of beta-rich structure for human prion protein. We also noticed that the presence of salt bridges is not correlated with helical propensity, indicating that salt bridges do not stabilize helices.", "paper_title": "The intrinsic helical propensities of the helical fragments in prion protein under neutral and low pH conditions: a replica exchange molecular dynamics study", "paper_id": "WOS:000326193200030"}
