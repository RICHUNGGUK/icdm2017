It is driven by a haptic interface, which enables the user to interact with an image in a virtual reality application, through the sense of touch. Thus, it is a hybrid dynamic system, which contains subsystems with continuous dynamics and subsystems with discrete dynamics that interact with each other. This paper develops a hybrid dynamic system model of the system, which takes into account the different sampling periods of the desired regulation, and the interaction between continuous, switching and discrete subsystems. It is interesting when very short electrical transients coexist with very long mechanical ones. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
