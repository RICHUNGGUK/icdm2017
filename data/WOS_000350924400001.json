We give two complete axiomatizations of the equational theories of the real numbers with respect to these signatures. In the first case, we extend the axiomatization of zero-totalized fields by a single axiom scheme expressing formal realness; the second axiomatization presupposes an ordering. We apply these completeness results in order to obtain complete axiomatizations of the complex numbers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
