The proposed schemes use the hardness of the Trace-discrete logarithmic like problem. We also show that the deterministic version of the proposed scheme is a one-way trapdoor, and the probabilistic version of the proposed scheme is semantically secure. Moreover, we discuss the efficiency of the proposed schemes by comparing with effective and compact subgroup schemes.
