The coupling of the two models is achieved based on a general framework for multiscale modeling - the heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) We derive an explicit coupling condition at the atomistic/continuum interface Application to the dynamics of brittle cracks under various loading conditions is presented as test examples (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "A multiscale coupling method for the modeling of dynamics of solids with application to brittle cracks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276784300022"}
