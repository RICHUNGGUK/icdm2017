Six testing criteria are considered for the generation of testing requirements: four control-flow and two data-flow based. The main reason to work at a lower level is that, even when there is no source code, structural testing requirements can still be derived and used to assess the quality of a given test set. It can be used, for instance, to perform structural testing on third-party Java components. In addition, the bytecode can be seen as an intermediate language, so the analysis performed at this level can be mapped back to the original high-level language that generated the bytecode. To support the application of the testing criteria, we have implemented a tool named JaBUTi (Java Bytecode Understanding and Testing). JaBUTi is used to illustrate the application of the ideas developed in this paper.
