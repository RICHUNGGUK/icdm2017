In this paper, an induced intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet (IFC) integral operator is proposed for the multiple criteria decision making. Some of its properties are investigated. Furthermore, an induced generalized IFC integral operator is introduced. It is worth mentioning that most of the existing intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators are special cases of this induced aggregation operator. A decision procedure based on the proposed induced aggregation operator is developed for solving the multicriteria decision-making problem in which all the decision information is represented by intuitionistic fuzzy values. An illustrative example is given for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed decision procedure.
