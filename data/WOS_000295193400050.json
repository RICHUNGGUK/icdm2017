The three-phase load flow analysis is executed to obtain the sensitivity of feeder loss with variations in power loading, conductor length, and total capacity of distribution transformers. Through this, the data set for neural network training is prepared to derive the ANN-based simplified power loss models. The power loss of each distribution feeder can be easily derived from the key factors of hourly loading, feeder length, and transformer capacity. By integrating the power loss of all feeders, the power loss of the entire distribution system can thus be obtained to estimate the operation efficiency of the Taipower system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
