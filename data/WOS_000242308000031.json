Kikuchi approximations of probability distributions follow an approach to approximate the free energy of statistical systems. In this paper, we introduce the mixture of Kikuchi approximations as a probability model. We present an algorithm for learning Kikuchi approximations from data based on the expectation-maximization (EM) paradigm. The proposal is tested in the approximation of probability distributions that arise in evolutionary computation.", "paper_title": "Mixtures of Kikuchi approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000242308000031"}
