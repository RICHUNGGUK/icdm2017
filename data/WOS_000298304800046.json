Conventional methods tend to fail in flicker parameters estimation due to the effects of moving objects. Our proposed method firstly utilizes an adaptive Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based method to detect the moving objects in the film sequences, and combines the detected results with the histogram-matched frames to generate reference frames for flicker parameters estimation. Then, on the basis of a linear flicker model, the proposed method uses an M-estimator with the reference frames to estimate the flicker parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of flicker parameters estimation when the moving objects are present in the film sequences.", "paper_title": "Flicker Parameters Estimation in Old Film Sequences Containing Moving Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304800046"}
