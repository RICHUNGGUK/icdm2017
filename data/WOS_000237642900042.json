This paper proposes a novel Boolean operations algorithm for point-sampled models based on implicit function transforming. In the algorithm, the point models are converted to implicit surfaces at first, and then Boolean operations for implicit surface are used to the point models. The simple forms of Boolean operations for implicit surfaces are presented. The method of RBF variational interpolation based on scattered points is used to convert the point models into implicit surfaces. Using this algorithm, complex point model can be constructed from several point models. This Boolean operations algorithm for point models is also suitable for Boolean operations for mesh models. It can implement the editing process of Cut-and-Paste for mesh models.", "paper_title": "Practical boolean operations on point-sampled models", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900042"}
