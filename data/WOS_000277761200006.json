Yet it still remains a challenge for existing strategies to deal with dynamically-evolving networks that contain community structures, though they are ubiquitous in the real world. In this paper, we examine the performances of an autonomy-oriented distributed search strategy for tackling such networks. The strategy is based on the ideas of self-organization and positive feedback from Autonomy-Oriented Computing (AOC). Our experimental results have shown that autonomous entities in this strategy can collectively find and immunize most highly connected nodes in a dynamic, community- based network within a few steps.", "paper_title": "Autonomy-Oriented Search in Dynamic Community Networks: A Case Study in Decentralized Network Immunization", "paper_id": "WOS:000277761200006"}
