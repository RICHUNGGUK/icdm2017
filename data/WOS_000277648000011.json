However, TDMA lacks flexibility and exhibits low efficiency in dynamic environments such as wireless LANs. On the other hand, contention-based MAC protocols such as the IEEE 802.11 DCF are adaptive to network dynamics but are generally inefficient in heavily loaded or large networks. To take advantage of the both types of protocols, a D-CVDMA protocol is proposed. It is based on the k-round elimination contention (k-EC) scheme, which provides fast contention resolution for Wireless LANs. D-CVDMA uses a contention mechanism to achieve TDMA-like collision-free data transmissions, which does not need to reserve time slots for forthcoming transmissions. These features make the D-CVDMA robust and adaptive to network dynamics such as node leaving and joining, changes in packet size and arrival rate, which, in turn, make it suitable for the delivery of hybrid traffic including multimedia and data content. D-CVDMA is designed for single-hop wireless ad hoc networks. Analyses and simulations demonstrate that D-CVDMA outperforms the IEEE 802.11 DCF and k-EC in terms of network throughput, delay, jitter, and fairness.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Contention Vector Division Multiple Access (D-CVDMA) Protocol for Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000277648000011"}
