Limitations of capital, manpower, energy, etc., have led managers to seek ways for optimally using such resources. In fact, being informed of the performance of the units under the supervision of a manager is the most important task with regard to making sensible decisions for managing them. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) suggests an appropriate method for evaluating the efficiency of homogeneous units with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. DEA models classify decision making units (DMUs) into efficient and inefficient ones. However, in most cases, managers and researchers are interested in ranking the units and selecting the best DMU. Various scientific models have been proposed by researchers for ranking DMUs. Each of these models has some weakness(es), which makes it difficult to select the appropriate ranking model. This paper presents a method for ranking efficient DMUs by the voting analytic hierarchy process (VAHP). The paper reviews some ranking models in DEA and discusses their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we provide the method for ranking efficient DMUs by VAHP. Finally we give an example to illustrate our approach and then the new method is employed to rank efficient units in a real world problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
