The algorithm extends the method introduced in [5] for the acoustic surface scattering to the fully elastic case. In our algorithm, high-order accuracy is achieved through the use of the partition of unity and a semi-classical treatment of relevant singular integrals. The computational efficiency associated with the nonsingular integrals is attained by the method of equivalent source representations on a Cartesian grid and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The resulting algorithm computes one matrix-vector product associated with the discretization of the integral equation with O (N-4/3 log N) operations, and it shows algebraic convergence. Several numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
