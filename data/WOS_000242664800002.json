In order to define this fuzzy set, we need to introduce a number of other new concepts, such as the relative satisfiability degree, the least and the largest interpretations, and the average validity degree of a formula. One of the main results proved in this paper is that all the membership degrees of this fuzzy set form a dense subset of [0, 1]. This new intrinsic fuzzy set will be used to develop a kind of fuzzy deductive reasoning of Pavelka's type. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
