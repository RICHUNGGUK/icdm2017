Two experiments corresponding to four different filtering policies were designed. In the first experiment three filtering policies based on Irregular Degree were compared. In the second experiment, the filtering policy achieving the best task performance in the first experiment was selected to compare with other filtering policies. The results of the first experiment indicate that the stability of state updates per second is a more important impact factor than Irregular Degree on the task performance. The results of the second experiment indicate that corresponding to different state updates per second, the filtering policies can achieve different task performance.", "paper_title": "Effects of filtering policies on task performance in a desktop CVE system", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300155"}
