The concept of monitoring certain Points of Interest (Pals) instead of the whole sensor field helps in reducing the costs of the deployment and improving the performance in terms of coverage. However, the problems of multiple PoI discovery, coverage and data report are still solved separately and there are no works that combine the aforementioned problems into a single deployment scheme. In this work, we present a novel approach for mobile sensor deployment, where we combine multiple PoI discovery and coverage with network connectivity preservation in order to capture the dynamics of the monitored area. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for circular movement parameters and examine the performance of our approach through extensive simulation campaigns. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
