Many critics have been posed to the procedures, the most remarkable one being their lack of connectivity with the values of the absolute flows behind the coefficients. In our approach, we define the importance of a technical coefficient as a fuzzy concept, and the grade of importance takes into account those absolute flows. This grade can be considered as a membership function, which is used to define a fuzzy graph associated to the I-O matrix. We apply this new procedure to the Spanish 2000 I-O matrix and compare our results to those reached by classical methods.", "paper_title": "I-O COEFFICIENTS IMPORTANCE: A FUZZY LOGIC APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000297519100006"}
