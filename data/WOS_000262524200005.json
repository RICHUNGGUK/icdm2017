In this paper, we discuss two data structures being used in these two kinds of CIC protocols, and their different roles in helping the checkpointing algorithms to enforce Z-cycle Free (ZCF) property. Then, we present our Fully Informed aNd Efficient (FINE) communication-induced checkpointing algorithm, which not only has less checkpointing overhead than the well-known Fully Informed (FI) CIC protocol proposed by Helary et al. but also has less message overhead. Performance evaluation indicates that our protocol performs better than many of the other existing CIC protocols. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
