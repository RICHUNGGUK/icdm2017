Our result also implies that Approximate Graph Isomorphism is not robust and is, in fact, 1 - epsilon versus epsilon hard assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. Then, we present an O(root n)-approximation algorithm for the problem based on rounding of the linear programming relaxation often used in state-of-the-art exact algorithms.", "paper_title": "Maximum Quadratic Assignment Problem: Reduction from Maximum Label Cover and LP-based Approximation Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000343962200002"}
