Legal opinion is that information availability and use play a key role in its safety. A multidisciplinary project investigated the information-seeking behaviour of online investors, with possible further regulation in mind. The mixed-methods approach included a survey, with 520 responses providing frequency counts about investment activity and information seeking. Individual interviews with 26 participants, selected to represent the survey respondents, provided in-depth perspectives. Analysis identified themes, categories, and related quotations. The survey indicated that the Internet was the major provider of information, with websites of online investors particularly widely used. Other important information sources were traditional newspapers and journals, and the electronic media. The qualitative component indicated that key sources were important because of convenience, content, speed of delivery, and accuracy/reliability. Other important issues included information overload, risk taking in relation to systematic analysis using information, and use of interpersonal information sources. The discussion highlights the unexplored issue of the impact of the structure of Web sources on knowledge building of online investors. From the legal perspective, the study provides grounds for optimism because online investor participants appeared to be relatively engaged with information and amenable to investor education.", "paper_title": "Empowered or Vulnerable?
