Automated generation of spatial design intends to bridge the gap between graphical design and geographical information systems. We propose a new method that generates spatial plans with a high level of detail and realism. A simple set of rules is derived by the modeler from a landscape type that serves as a reference. These rules are implemented by spatial functions with a landscape type specific objective. In a multi-objective optimization algorithm a landscape plan is generated for a specific lot that meets the objectives. The modeler controls the plan generation process through an objective task list which determines the priority of the objectives. Examples show that the landscape generator is capable of generating plausible spatial plans in reasonable computing time. More specifically, they show that the landscape generator performs best with low configurationally structured reference projects and performs less with high configurationally structured reference projects. The manual construction of the objective task list could be further improved by pre-structured objectives dependent on landscape designer's preference. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
