In this context, we characterize the asymptotically optimal sample allocation that maximizes the rate at which the probability of false selection tends to zero. Since the optimal allocation is the result of a concave maximization problem, its solution is particularly easy to obtain in contexts where the underlying distributions are known or can be assumed. We provide a consistent estimator for the optimal allocation and a corresponding sequential algorithm fit for implementation. Various numerical examples demonstrate how the proposed allocation differs from competing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Optimal Sampling Laws for Stochastically Constrained Simulation Optimization on Finite Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000322424000012"}
