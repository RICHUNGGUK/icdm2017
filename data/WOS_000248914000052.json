Unfortunately, for better performance many cloth solvers disregard this fact. We propose a method to obtain very low strain along the warp and weft direction using Constrained Lagrangian Mechanics and a novel fast projection method. The resulting algorithm acts as a velocity filter that easily integrates into existing simulation code.", "paper_title": "Efficient simulation of inextensible cloth", "paper_id": "WOS:000248914000052"}
