By simulating the human visual system, we take the variance of the visual sensitive coefficients into account to measure a distorted image. The computational complexity of the proposed method is much lower compared with some existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate its advantages in terms of correlation coefficient, outlier ratio, transmitted information, and CPU cost. Moreover, it is also illustrated that the proposed method has a good accordance with human subjective perception.", "paper_title": "A wavelet-based image quality assessment method", "paper_id": "WOS:000258297300003"}
