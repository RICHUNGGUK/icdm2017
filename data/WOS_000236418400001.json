Using dynamic programming, we derive a procedure for selecting the knots at which an oracle provides the function value and one supergradient. The procedure is adaptive in that the choice of a knot is dependent on the choice of the previous knots. It is also optimal in that the approximation error, in the integral sense, is minimized in the worst case.", "paper_title": "An optimal adaptive algorithm for the approximation of concave functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000236418400001"}
