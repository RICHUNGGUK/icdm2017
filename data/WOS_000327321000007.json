In this work we address a study on the feasibility of W-band passive radiometers in nano-scale CMOS technology for imaging applications. In particular, this study takes into account some of the most relevant aspects regarding the system-on-a-chip implementation, from system to circuit and technology limitations, with emphasis on the impact of the non-idealities of the detector on the overall system performances. Excluding the hardware differences between the investigated receiver architectures and their substantial implications, especially in case of array systems, the investigation shows how there is no a clear evidence to identify a priori the best performance receiver architecture, but it depends on the circuits, as well as operating frequency and technology.", "paper_title": "Analyses and design of 95-GHz SoC CMOS radiometers for passive body imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000327321000007"}
