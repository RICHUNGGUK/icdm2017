The DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficients of original image plus watermarks are first clipped to binary value and then transformed through 3(rd)- and 4(th)-order cumulant operation, the result is compared with that obtained with the same procedure on the received image through a cumulant-based similarity estimator. Experimental results prove its robustness to anti-Gaussian noise and anti-rotation attacks, and better detection probability will also be expected.", "paper_title": "A HOS-BASED WATERMARK DETECTOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000263795500005"}
