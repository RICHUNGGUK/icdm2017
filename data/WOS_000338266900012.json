Let U be a set with three or more elements, let W be the set of weak orderings of U, let L be the set of linear orderings of U, and let f be an n-ary function mapping W-n to W. By Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, if f satisfies Arrow's Condition P (\"Pareto\") and Condition 3 (\"independence of irrelevant alternatives\") then f violates Arrow's condition of non-dictatorship, which implies that the restriction of f to linear orderings is a projection function, i.e., there is some k is an element of {1, ... , n} such that f (R-1, ... , R-n) = R-k for all linear orderings R-1, ... , R-n is an element of L. Thus Arrow's Theorem provides a characterization of projection functions on linear orderings as those that satisfy two conditions that clearly hold for projection functions, but which are sufficient (by Arrow's Theorem) to imply a function is a projection function. We prove a similar characterization in Theorem 3 and use it to derive Arrow's characterization for projection functions on linear orderings. Arrow's Theorem does not characterize projection functions on weak orderings, but Theorem 3 does characterize projection functions on a strictly larger class than the weak orderings, namely the transitive co-transitive relations. Along the way we prove, as a consequence of Theorem 2, that if a transitive-valued multivariate relational function f satisfies relational versions of Arrow's Conditions P and 3, and maps equivalence relations on U to transitive relations on U, then for some D-0 subset of {1, ... , n}, f (R-1, ... , R-n) is just the intersection of all R-i for i is an element of D-0.
