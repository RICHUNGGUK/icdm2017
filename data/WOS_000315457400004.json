In the framework of the applied pi-calculus, as in similar languages based on equational logics, knowledge is typically expressed by two relations: deducibility and static equivalence. Several decision procedures have been proposed for these relations under a variety of equational theories. However, each theory has its particular algorithm, and none has been implemented so far. We provide a generic procedure for deducibility and static equivalence that takes as input any convergent rewrite system. We show that our algorithm covers most of the existing decision procedures for convergent theories. We also provide an efficient implementation and compare it briefly with the tools ProVerif and KiSs.", "paper_title": "YAPA: A Generic Tool for Computing Intruder Knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000315457400004"}
