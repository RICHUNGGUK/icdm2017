To collect frequent data, the system is designed to maximize the chance of measure and minimize the variation of measuring. The system is based on the DirectX technology adopting white balance correction, lip segmentation, point-tracking techniques. The degree and pattern of asymmetry is estimated by tracking the bi-lateral lip points. Tracking performance is tuned up by changing the configuration of tracking compared to previous study. All data are able to be sent via FTP and reviewed by clinician. DirectX technology makes it measure anywhere. White balance correction is effective in restoring color distortion and lip segmentation by region growing is effective in finding bi-lateral lip points but not in all environments. Point-tracking is a good method to provide the temporal movement of lip. A larger searching window of tracking points shows an improved performance in point of variation and robustness at fast movements. Transferring via Internet makes monitor the patient frequently. PC-based analyzing system is able to use not just in clinic but also at home. The system makes it possible to measure frequently and objectively and leads to diagnose exact conditions of patient.
