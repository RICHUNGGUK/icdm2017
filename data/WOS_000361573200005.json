One scheme is for straight boundaries, with the boundary points locating at any distance from the lattice nodes, and has second-order accuracy. The other is for curved boundaries, has only first-order accuracy and is much simpler than the existing schemes. Unlike those in the literature, our schemes involve only the current lattice node. Such a \"single-node\" boundary schemes are highly desirable for problems with complex geometries. The two schemes are validated numerically with a number of examples. The numerical results show the utility of the constructed schemes and very well support our theoretical predications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
