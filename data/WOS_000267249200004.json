The proposed algorithm is applied to parameter identification of concrete dam-foundation systems. To verify the performance of HSABCA, it is compared with the basic ABCA and a real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) on two examples: a gravity dam and an arc dam. Results show that the proposed algorithm is an efficient tool for inverse analysis and it performs much better than ABCA and RCGA on such problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
