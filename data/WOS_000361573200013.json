A conjugate gradient method driven by both pressure and distributed Lagrange multiplier, called one-shot method, has been developed to solve the discrete Stokes problem while enforcing the rigid body motion within the region occupied by the particle. The methodology is validated by comparing the numerical results of a neutrally buoyant particle of either a circular or elliptic shape with the associated Jeffery's solutions. We have successively combined the above methodology with an immersed boundary (IB) method and an elastic membrane modeled by a spring network to simulate the dynamics of a compound vesicle. In simple shear flow under creeping flow condition, the results are consistent with those obtained in literature. In Poiseuille flow, the compound vesicle motion is dominated by the motion of the vesicle membrane as expected and stays in the central region of the channel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
