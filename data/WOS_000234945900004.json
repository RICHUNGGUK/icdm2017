The primitives defined in the modeling paradigm are expressive enough to represent the knowledge needed by planning, coordination, and reactive control of a multi-robot control system. At the same time, it provides a well-founded tool to represent in a compact way the data interpretations needed to reason effectively about what is happening in the world and what is desired to happen. This modeling paradigm makes the design of behavior, planning, and coordination modules easy, since its primitives are simple and expressive. Moreover, it provides a sound framework to deal with uncertainty in sensing and world modeling. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
