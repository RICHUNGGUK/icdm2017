The objective is to get a model reference based output feedback tracking control law. The control scheme is based on a PDC structure, a fuzzy observer and a H-infinity performance to attenuate the external disturbances. The stability of the whole closed-loop model is investigated using the well-known quadratic Lyapunov function. The key point of the proposed approaches is to achieve conditions under a LMI (linear matrix inequalities) formulation in the case of an uncertain and disturbed T-S fuzzy model. This formulation facilitates obtaining solutions through interior point optimization methods for some nonlinear output tracking control problems. Finally, a simulation is provided on the well-known inverted pendulum testbed to show the efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
