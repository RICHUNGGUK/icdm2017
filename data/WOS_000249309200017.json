Positive-real BT (PRBT) is a particular BT procedure that preserves passivity and stability and imposes no structural constraints on the original state space. However, PRBT requires solving two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs), whose computational complexity limits its practical use in large-scale systems. This paper introduces a novel quadratic extension of the alternating direction implicit (ADI) iteration, which is called quadratic ADI (QADI), that efficiently solves an ARE. A Cholesky factor version of QADI, which is called CFQADI, exploits low-rank matrices and further accelerates PRBT.", "paper_title": "Fast positive-real balanced truncation via quadratic alternating direction implicit iteration", "paper_id": "WOS:000249309200017"}
