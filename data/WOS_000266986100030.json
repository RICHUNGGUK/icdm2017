A known drawback to constrained parameterization is visual distortion that arises when the 3D geometry is mismatched to highly textured image regions. This paper introduces an approach to reduce visual distortion by expanding image regions via texture synthesis to better fit the 3D geometry. The result is a new amended texture that maintains the essence of the input texture image but exhibits significantly less distortion when mapped onto the 3D model.", "paper_title": "Texture Amendment: Reducing Texture Distortion in Constrained Parameterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000266986100030"}
