By applying H-infinity theory of linear systems, delay-independent and -dependent conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are both derived to ensure consensus of the multi-agent system with a prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation index, and the undetermined feedback matrix of the proposed protocol is further solved accordingly. A simulation example is included to validate the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "H-infinity consensus control for multi-agent systems with linear coupling dynamics and communication delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000296974800006"}
