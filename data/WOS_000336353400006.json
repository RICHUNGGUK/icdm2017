Methods: A series of linkages with varying amounts of available information were per, formed on two simulated datasets derived from Multiyear motor vehitle crash (MVC) and hospital databases, where true matches were known. Distributions of high probability and imputed matched sets were compared against the true match population for occupant age, MVC county, and MVC hour. Re: gression models were fit to simulated log hospital charges and hospitalization status. Results: High probability and imputed : matched sets were not significantly different from occupant age, MVC County, and MVC hour in high information settings (p >0,999). In low information settings, high probability matched sets were Significantly different from octupaht age and MVC county (p <0.002), but imputed matched sets were not (p >0:493). High information settings saw no significant differences in inference of simulated log hospital charges and hospitalization status between the two methods. High probability and imputed matched sets were significantly different from the outcomes in low information settings; however, imputed matched sets were more robust. Conclusions: The level of information available to a linkage is an important consideration. High probability matched Sets are suitable for high to moderate information settings and for situations involving case, specific analysis. Conversely, imputed matched sets are preferable for low information Settings when conducting population based analyses.", "paper_title": "The Utility of Imputed Matched Sets Analyzing Probabilistically Linked Databases in a Low Information Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000336353400006"}
