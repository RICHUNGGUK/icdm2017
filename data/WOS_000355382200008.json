MFD choses its particles to be small molecules which may be connected by harmonic springs to represent larger molecular entities in order to maintain a comparatively accurate representation of covalent bonding and molecular characteristics. For this study the MFD approach is extended to accomplish long-term simulation (up to the microsecond scale) of large (representing millions of atoms) containing phospholipid membranes, peptides, and proteins. For peptides and proteins a generally applicable fragmentation scheme is introduced in combination with specific backbone forces that keep native spatial shapes with adequate levels of flexibility or rigidity. The new approach is demonstrated by MFD simulations of the formation and characteristics of phospholipid membranes and vesicles, vesicle membrane fusion, the backbone force dependency of the overall structural flexibility of dumbbell-shaped Calmodulin, the stability of subunit-aggregation of tetrameric hemoglobin, and the collaborative interaction of Kalata B1 cyclotides with a phospholipid membrane. All findings are in reasonable agreement with experimental as well as alternative simulation results. Thus, the extended MFD approach may become a new tool for biomolecular system studies to allow for comparatively fast simulative investigations in combination with a comparatively high chemical granularity.", "paper_title": "Mesoscopic Simulation of Phospholipid Membranes, Peptides, and Proteins with Molecular Fragment Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000355382200008"}
