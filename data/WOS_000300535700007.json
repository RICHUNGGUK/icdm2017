The wireless sensor network is usually modeled by a unit disk graph (UDG), where two vertices are connected in UDG G(R) if their Euclidean distance is not more than a given constant R in the field. The previous works have predicated the necessary conditions for the existence of DBMST on UDG. Given that sub-graphs G(R/2) and G(R/root 3) can keep connected, there exist degree-3 or degree-4 spanning trees for UDG G(R). In this paper, we design two algorithms to construct the degree-3 and degree-4 spanning trees for UDG respectively. The more relaxed conditions are explored for the existence of DBMST for unit disk graphs according to the proposed algorithms. That is, given that sub-graphs G(R/1.81) and G(R/root 2) keep connected, the existence of degree-3 and degree-4 spanning trees is guaranteed for UDG G(R). The theoretical analyses show that the performances of constructed degree-3 and degree-4 spanning trees are at most (4+root 6(alpha)) and (1+root 2(alpha)) times as that of minimum spanning tree (MST) respectively, where alpha >= 2 is a constant. The simulation results show the high efficiency of two proposed algorithms. For example, total link weights of degree-3 and degree 4 spanning trees are about 1.05 and 1.01 times as that of MST where alpha is 2. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
