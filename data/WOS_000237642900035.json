Many fast mode decision algorithms have been proposed to reduce the computational complexity of mode decision. In this paper, two algorithms are proposed for reduction of mode decision in H.264/AVC, fast reference frame selection and selective intra prediction mode decision. Fast reference frame selection is efficient for inter predication, and selective intra prediction mode decision can effectively reduce excessive calculation load of intra prediction mode decision. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed two methods applied together could reduce the encoding time of the overall sequences by an average of 44.63%, without any noticeable degradation in coding efficiency.", "paper_title": "Reduction of mode decision complexity in H.264/AVC using adaptive selection of reference frame and intra prediction mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900035"}
