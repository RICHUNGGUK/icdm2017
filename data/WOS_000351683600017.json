We propose a novel algorithm based on the new properties of CUDA surface memory optimized for 2D spatial locality and compare it with 3D stencil computations carried out via shared memory, which is currently considered to be the best approach. A case study was performed for the extensive generation of a time series of 3D grids of arbitrary size used in the computation of collisions between heavy nuclei in terms of relativistic hydrodynamics. It proved that implementation based on surface memory is as much as 23% faster than an equivalent implementation using shared memory.
