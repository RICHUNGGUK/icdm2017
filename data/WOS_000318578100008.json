The algorithm is suitable for sorting image sequences, such as images in matrix form. Zero padding is used in the stem of image matrices for images with different sizes in the image sequence. As a result, all images adopt the same size. Based on phase correlation, the position relationship between two images is determined. The approach used is extended, and an auto-sorting algorithm is applied on image sequences with different sizes. Experimental results show that the algorithm can be implemented effectively without manual intervention. It can overcome the size limitation of images and can be applied in image stitching.", "paper_title": "AN AUTO-SORTING ALGORITHM FOR IMAGE SEQUENCES WITH DIFFERENT SIZES IN IMAGE STITCHING", "paper_id": "WOS:000318578100008"}
