A B2BUA (Back-to-Back User Agent) does not have any improvisation for wireless part of an enterprise network, since the QoS parameters in B2BUA primarily focus on the wired network which is deployed with enough bandwidth. This paper presents the B2BSIP server architecture to induce the quality of service for the wireless network by developing a new rate adaptation scheme that changes the video rate in two ways: short-term adaption and long-term adaptation. For short-term adaptation, base stations trigger to drop the P or B frames of a video, thus saving the bandwidth. For long-term adaptation, based on measurement from the wireless link layer, the B2BUA server that lies near the wireless base station in the enterprise adapts the video rate to the wireless bandwidth fluctuation by changing the group-of-picture (GoP) size. Our work is verified to work well through the ns-2 simulator that emulates the access link of mobile WiMAX systems.", "paper_title": "Enterprise Solution of Video Rate Adaptation for Wireless Bandwidth Fluctuation", "paper_id": "WOS:000365933900014"}
