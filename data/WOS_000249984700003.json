Thus, despite their mathematical tractability, traditional Markov models are not appropriate for this purpose, since their memoryless nature contradicts the burstiness of transmitted packets. However, it is desirable to find a similarly tractable model which is, at the same time, rigorous at capturing the features of network traffic. This work presents discrete-time heavy-tailed chains, a tractable approach to characterize network traffic as a superposition of discrete-time \"on/off\" sources. This is a particular case of the generic \"on/off\" heavy-tailed model, thus shows the same statistical features as the former, particularly self-similarity and long-range dependence, when the number of aggregated sources approaches infinity. The model is then applicable to characterize a number of discrete-time communication systems, for instance, ATM and optical packet switching, to further derive meaningful performance metrics such as average burst duration and the number of active sources in a random instant.", "paper_title": "Discrete-time heavy-tailed chains, and their properties in modeling network traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000249984700003"}
