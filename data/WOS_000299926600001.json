Creation of monitoring solutions on a per-service basis becomes time-consuming and misses opportunities to reuse existing logic. Ideally the deployment of monitoring solutions would be simple. Simplicity could be achieved by freeing monitoring solutions from domain dependencies, promoting the ability to use automatically generated monitoring code and support for the automated deployment of monitoring components. Work is presented here that progresses these ambitions by providing a generic, distributed monitoring and evaluation framework based on Metric Collector (MeCo) components. MeCo components form part of a unified monitoring framework which can interpret Service Level Agreements to automatically provide tailored service monitoring. Once deployed, these components can gather measurement data across a range of service technologies as used within E-Commerce services, with minimal impact upon observed service environments.
