Available intervention actions include prophylactic surgeries and breast screening, which vary significantly in cost, cancer prevention, and in resulting death from other causes. We present a model designed to yield optimal intervention strategies for mutation carriers between the ages of 30 and 65 and any prior intervention history. Methods: A Markov decision process (MDP) model is developed that considers yearly state transitions for the mutation carriers and state dependent intervention actions. State is defined as a vector comprising mutation type, health states, prior intervention actions, and age. A discounted value iteration algorithm is used to obtain optimal strategies from the MDP model using both cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as rewards. Results: The results from MDP model show that for 30-year-old women with BRCA1 mutation and no prior intervention history, the cost-optimal strategy is a combination of prophylactic mastectomy (PM) and prophylactic oophorectomy (PO) at age 30 with no screening afterwards. Whereas, the QALYs-optimal strategy suggests PO at age 30 and PM at age 50 with screening afterwards. For BRCA2 mutation carriers at age 30, the cost-optimal strategy is PO at age 30, PM at age 40, and yearly screening only after age 56. Corresponding QALYs-optimal strategy is PM at age 40 with screening. Strategies for all other ages (31 to 65) are obtained and presented. It is also demonstrated that the cost-optimal strategies offer near maximum survival rate and near minimum cancer incidence rates by age 70, when compared to other ad hoc strategies.", "paper_title": "A MDP Model for Breast and Ovarian Cancer Intervention Strategies for BRCA1/2 Mutation Carriers", "paper_id": "WOS:000351091200034"}
