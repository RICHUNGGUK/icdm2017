The problem lies in two aspects: map consistency and computational complexity. A novel method to finish such a task is proposed. The system employs a special designed 3D laser range finder, which is built on the basis of a 2D laser scanner, as the environment-perceiving sensor. The registration of 3D range images is realized by localization on a so-called ceiling map, which is the set of intersecting lines between the ceiling and the walls in the room. By matching the calculated local ceiling map with the global one, accurate sampling positions without suffering from accumulative errors can be obtained. A consistent 3D map can then be built on the basis of it. The experimental results demonstrate our success.", "paper_title": "3D map building for mobile robots using a 3D laser range finder", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300092"}
