These two properties make NCC outperform the previous differential coordinates in many mesh processing jobs. We develop an implicit editing algorithm based on NCC, which is efficient by subtly using vertex normals. In addition, by exploring the relationship between NCC and the normals of triangular faces, we present a linear method based on NCC to reconstruct a mesh from predefined face normals. It provides another convenient way that users can operate face normals to edit models. Experiments show that NCC perform better than the previous differential coordinates in both effectiveness and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Normal-controlled coordinates based feature-preserving mesh editing", "paper_id": "WOS:000338317400013"}
