As disk capacities increase and multiple drives are combined in one system the probability of multiple disk failures increases. Through the adoption of RAID 6 the capability to recover from up to two simultaneous disk failures becomes available. In this article, we present three different RAID 6 implementations each tailored to support different target applications and optimized to reduce overall hardware resource utilization. We present an optimal Reed-Solomon-based RAID 6 implementation for arrays of four disks. We also present the smallest in terms of hardware resource utilization as well having the highest throughput RAID 6 hardware solution for disk arrays of up to 15 drives. Finally, we present an implementation supporting up to 255 disks in a single array.", "paper_title": "RAID 6 Hardware Acceleration", "paper_id": "WOS:000297636300005"}
