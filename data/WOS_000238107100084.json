HLA-Speaking Service is responsible for execution of an application code on the site it resides and manages multiple federate processes. The design of the architecture is based on the OGSA concept that allows for modularity and compatibility with Grid Services already being developed. We present the functionality of the Service with an example of N-body simulation of dense stellar system.", "paper_title": "A Grid service for management of multiple HLA federate processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100084"}
