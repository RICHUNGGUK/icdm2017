A b-nested common (resp. conserved) interval I of size vertical bar I vertical bar is either an interval of size 1 or a common (resp. conserved) interval that contains another b-nested common (resp. conserved) interval of size at least vertical bar I vertical bar -b. When b = 1, this corresponds to the classical notion of nested interval. We exhibit two simple algorithms to output all b-nested common or conserved intervals between K permutations in O(Kn + nocc) time, where nocc is the total number of such intervals. We also explain how to count all b-nested intervals in O(Kn) time. New properties of the family of conserved intervals are proposed to do so.", "paper_title": "Easy Identification of Generalized Common and Conserved Nested Intervals", "paper_id": "WOS:000338984100004"}
