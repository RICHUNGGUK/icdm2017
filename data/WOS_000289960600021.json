Methods This systematic review aimed to assess the evidence of the impact of CPOE on medical-imaging services and patient outcomes. Results Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, most of which (10/14) used a pre-/postintervention comparison design. Eight studies demonstrated benefits, such as decreased test utilization, associated with decision-support systems promoting adherence to test ordering guidelines. Three studies evaluating medical-imaging ordering and reporting times showed statistically significant decreases in turnaround times. Conclusions The findings reveal the potential for CPOE to contribute to significant efficiency and effectiveness gains in imaging services. The diversity and scope of the research evidence can be strengthened through increased attention to the circumstances and mechanisms that contribute to the success (or otherwise) of CPOE and its contribution to the enhancement of patient care delivery.", "paper_title": "The impact of computerized provider order entry systems on medical-imaging services: a systematic review", "paper_id": "WOS:000289960600021"}
