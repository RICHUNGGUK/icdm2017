Compressive strength is the most important engineering property of concrete. This paper presents a numerical procedure to predict the development of compressive strength of slag blended concrete. This numerical procedure starts with a kinetic hydration model for cement-slag blends by considering the production of calcium hydroxide in cement hydration and its consumption in slag reactions. Reaction degrees of cement slag are obtained as accompanied results from the hydration model. Gel-space ratio of hardening slag blended concrete is determined using reaction degrees of cement and slag, mixing proportions of concrete, and volume stoichiometries of cement hydration and slag reaction. Furthermore, the development of compressive strength is evaluated through Powers' gel-space ratio theory considering the contributions of cement hydration and slag reaction. The proposed model is verified through experimental data on concrete with different water-to-binder ratios and slag substitution ratios.", "paper_title": "Prediction of compressive strength of slag concrete using a blended cement hydration model", "paper_id": "WOS:000344577900003"}
