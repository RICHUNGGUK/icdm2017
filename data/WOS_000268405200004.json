In response, 3D modeling and interface design communities have begun to develop systems based on traditional artistic techniques, particularly sketching. Collectively this growing field of research has come to be known as sketch-based modeling, however the name belies a diversity of promising techniques and unique approaches. This paper presents a survey of current research in sketch-based modeling, including a basic introduction to the topic, the challenges of sketch-based input, and an examination of a number of popular approaches, including representative examples and a general analysis of the benefits and challenges inherent to each.
