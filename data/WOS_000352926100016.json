At the same time, the mobile users tend to experience unexpected delay and disruption due to content retrieval from inappropriate location and frequent handover. To address the problems, this paper introduces an application scenario of Information Centric Networking (ICN) named CATT (Cache Aware Target idenTification), more specifically ICN-enabled IEEE 802.11 wireless access points as nano data centers. We describe its design tenet and implementation, and current deployment over the virtualization platform of JGN-X in Japan. The synergy between ICN supporting mobility as the norm and widely deployed broadband IEEE 802.11 wireless access points makes this proposal attractive as a potential application scenario for ICN.
