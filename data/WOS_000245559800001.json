In particular, many multicast applications require not only multicast capability but also predictable communication performance, such as guaranteed multicast latency and bandwidth, called quality-of-service (QoS). In this paper, we consider scheduling in multicast interconnects, which aims to minimize the multicast latency for a set of multicast requests. Unfortunately, such a problem has been proved to be NP-Complete, which means that it is unlikely to find a fast exact algorithm for the multicast scheduling problem. We then turn to propose a simple, fast greedy multicast scheduling algorithm and derive a lower bound and an upper bound on the performance of the algorithm. As can be seen, while a lower bound is fairly straightforward, the upper bound is much more difficult to obtain. By translating the multicast scheduling problem into a graph theory problem and employing a random graph approach, we are able to obtain a probabilistic upper bound on the performance of the multicast scheduling algorithm. Our analytical and simulation results show that the performance of the proposed multicast scheduling algorithm is quite close to the lower bound and is statistically guaranteed by the probabilistic upper bound.", "paper_title": "Scheduling and performance analysis of multicast interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000245559800001"}
