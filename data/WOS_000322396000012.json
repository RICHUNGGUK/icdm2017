Recently, it has been found that the finger-knuckle-print (FKP), which refers to the texture pattern produced by the finger knuckle bending, is highly unique and can be used as a biometric identifier. In this paper, we present an effective FKP recognition scheme for personal identification and identity verification. This method is a new encoding scheme based on local binary pattern (LBP). Each image first is decomposed in several blocks, each block is convolved with a bank of Gabor filters and then, the LBPs histograms are extracted from the convolved images. Finally, a BioHashing approach is applied on the obtained fixed-length feature vectors. Extensive experiments conducted over the Poly-U FKP database demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "FINGER-KNUCKLE-PRINT RECOGNITION VIA ENCODING LOCAL-BINARY-PATTERN", "paper_id": "WOS:000322396000012"}
