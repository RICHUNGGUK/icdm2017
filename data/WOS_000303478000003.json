Both bisimulation and simulation can be obtained as completions of partitions and preorders, viewed as abstract domains, w.r.t. a pair of concrete functions that encode a PLTS. This approach provides a general framework for designing algorithms that compute bisimulation and simulation on PLTSs. Notably, (i) we show that the standard bisimulation algorithm by Baier et al. (2000) can be viewed as an instance of such a framework and (ii) we design a new efficient simulation algorithm that improves the state of the art.", "paper_title": "Bisimulation and simulation algorithms on probabilistic transition systems by abstract interpretation", "paper_id": "WOS:000303478000003"}
