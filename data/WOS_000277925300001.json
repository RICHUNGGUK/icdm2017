The algorithm we present for this language decides whether a given set of constraints is consistent in time that is quadratic in the input size. We also prove that (unlike Ord-Horn) the constraint satisfaction problem of this language cannot be solved by Datalog or by establishing local consistency.", "paper_title": "A Fast Algorithm and Datalog Inexpressibility for Temporal Reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000277925300001"}
