Through employing the reciprocal convex technique, some previously ignored terms can be reconsidered when estimating the time difference of LKF and the criteria are presented via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), whose solvability heavily depends on the information of addressed systems. Finally, three numerical examples are provided to show that the achieved conditions can be less conservative than some existing ones based on comparing results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
