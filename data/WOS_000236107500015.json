In this paper, we discuss and introduce some new insights in the relationship between unconditionally secure authentication codes (A-code) and unconditionally secure encryption schemes through observing the mechanisms of chaffing-and-winnowing. Particularly, we show through chaffing-and-winnowing that an A-code with a security level considerably low stands equivalently for an encryption scheme with perfect secrecy, and a fully secure authentication scheme implies both perfect secrecy and non-malleability for an encryption scheme in the unconditionally secure setting.", "paper_title": "Unconditionally secure chaffing-and-winnowing: A relationship between encryption and authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000236107500015"}
