All delay differences between X-axis phases and Y-axis phases (based on 2-D definition) can be used, rather than only the diagonal line. The large latency time inherited from Vernier structure is therefore dramatically reduced. The TDC is implemented in a 90 nm CMOS process and consumes 1.8 mA from 1.2 V. The measured input range can safely cover a full period of a 50 MHz sampling signal. With the same delay elements, the latency time is less than 1/6 of that needed in a standard Vernier TDC.", "paper_title": "A 2-D GRO Vernier time-to-digital converter with large input range and small latency", "paper_id": "WOS:000322451700004"}
