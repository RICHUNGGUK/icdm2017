The power consumption of the RF block of a PED is mostly dominated by the programmable PLLs which are widely used in the design of these devices. Therefore to reduce the overall power consumption in a portable device and to increase the battery life time, low-voltage and low-power are the two key requirements for the PLL design. In this work an improved programmable fractional frequency divider has been incorporated to enhance the overall performance of the PLL that includes lower operating supply voltage and lower power consumption compared to the state-of-art. The. proposed programmable fractional PLL has an operating frequency in the range of 1.7-2.5 GHz, and a frequency resolution of 2.5 MHz. Measurement results reveal that the proposed programmable PLL can operate at 2.4 GHz with a 1.46 V power supply voltage and only 10 mW of power consumption.", "paper_title": "A low-voltage low-power programmable fractional PLL in 0.18-mu m CMOS process", "paper_id": "WOS:000282012800004"}
