Of particular interest to us is the situation where sampling from the conditional distribution of the continuous component given the discrete component is infeasible. In this context, we advance Carlin & Chib's pseudo-prior method as an alternative way of infering mixture models and discuss and compare different algorithms based on this scheme. We propose a novel algorithm, the Frozen Carlin & Chib sampler, which is computationally less demanding than any Metropolised Carlin & Chib-type algorithm. The significant gain of computational efficiency is however obtained at the cost of some asymptotic variance. The performance of the algorithm vis-A -vis alternative schemes is, using some recent results obtained in Maire et al.
