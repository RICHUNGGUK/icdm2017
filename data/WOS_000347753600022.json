Subsequently, the image is required to be segmented to get fingerprints of individual fingers. The paper proposes a novel and efficient technique to extract individual fingerprints. It applies a divide and conquer strategy by using force field and heuristics. The technique has been tested on two slap image databases viz. IITK-4Slap-Rural and IITK-4Slap-Student and has achieved high segmentation accuracy (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
