However, the introduction and modification of features may result in undesired behaviors, and this effect is known as feature interaction-FI. After a brief review of FI detection principles, we propose an interaction resolution adviser, consisting of two phases. The first phase implements an initial selection, by filtering the features that satisfy a set of formulas. We describe several strategies according to the nodes that participate in the FI resolution. The second phase selects the feature for execution, and adapts parameters, according to user policies. The interaction resolution adviser is distributed, scalable and independent of the applications and their features. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
