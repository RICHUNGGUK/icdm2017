In order to remove/reduce interpolation artifacts such as image blur and the checkerboard effect (ringing), EASE tries to amend the interpolation error by employing the classical interpolation error theorem in an edge-adaptive fashion. EASE is applied for image zooming by both integer and noninteger magnification factors. The new interpolation scheme has proved to result in high-resolution images having clearer and sharper edges than linear interpolation methods, for all synthetic and natural images we have tested. EASE can be implemented with ease; it turns out to be similarly efficient as cubic interpolation schemes.", "paper_title": "The error-amended sharp edge (EASE) scheme for image zooming", "paper_id": "WOS:000246641600002"}
