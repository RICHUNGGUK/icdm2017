We introduce a new interactive approach, easing the creation of procedural representations of \"stochastic\" volumetric details by using a single example photograph. Instead of attempting to reconstruct an accurate geometric representation from the photograph, we use a stochastic multi-scale approach that fits parameters of a multi-layered noise-based 3D deformation model, using a multi-resolution filter banks error metric. Once computed, visually similar details can be applied to arbitrary objects with a high degree of visual realism, since lighting and parallax effects are naturally taken into account. Our approach is inspired by image-based techniques. In practice, the user supplies a photograph of an object covered by noisy details, provides a corresponding coarse approximation of the shape of this object as well as an estimated lighting condition (generally a light source direction). Our system then determines the corresponding noise-based representation as well as some diffuse, ambient, specular and semi-transparency reflectance parameters. The resulting details are fully procedural and, as such, have the advantage of extreme compactness, while they can be infinitely extended without repetition in order to cover huge surfaces.", "paper_title": "An Image-Based Approach for Stochastic Volumetric and Procedural Details", "paper_id": "WOS:000281286100019"}
