A vertex set S subset of V is a restrained dominating set if every vertex not in S is adjacent to a vertex in S and to a vertex in V - S. In this paper, we investigate the NP-completeness of the restrained domination problem in planar graphs and split graphs. Meanwhile, it is proved that the restrained domination problem is APX-complete for bounded-degree graphs. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.
