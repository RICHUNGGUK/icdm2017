We propose the integration of a generic and adaptable intelligent tutoring system (PEGASE). The aim is to instruct the learner, and to assist the instructor. The multi-agent system emits a set of knowledge (actions carried out by the learner, knowledge of the field, etc.) used by an artificial intelligence to make pedagogical decisions. Our study focuses on the representation of knowledge about the environment, and on the adaptable pedagogical agent providing instructive assistance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
