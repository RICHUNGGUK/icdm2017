Our integration approach presents a mechanism to validate and verify MAP requirements against B-SCP requirements and vice versa. MAP has an inbuilt Gap Analysis process which saves the overhead of inventing a new approach to deal with requirements evolution. In addition, MAP extends B-SCP's capability by the addition of non-deterministic process modelling. Our solution is evaluated on an exemplar case study which looks at a system built for Seven Eleven Japan. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
