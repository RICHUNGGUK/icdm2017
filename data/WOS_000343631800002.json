The existing analysis tools for ReaxFF MD lack the capability of capturing chemical reactions directly by analyzing the simulation trajectory, which is critical in exploring reaction mechanisms. This paper presents the algorithms, implementation strategies, features, and applications of VARxMD, a tool for Visualization and Analysis of Reactive Molecular Dynamics. VARxMD is dedicated to detailed chemical reaction analysis and visualization from the trajectories obtained in ReaxFF MD simulations. The interrelationships among the atoms, bonds, fragments, species and reactions are analyzed directly from the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates and bond orders of the atoms in a trajectory, which are accomplished by determination of atomic connectivity for recognizing connected molecular fragments, perception of bond types in the connected fragments for molecules or radicals, indexing of all these molecules or radicals (chemical species) based on their 3D coordinates and recognition of bond breaking or forming in the chemical species for reactions. Consequently, detailed chemical reactions taking place between two sampled frames can be generated automatically. VARxMD is the first tool specialized for reaction analysis and visualization in ReaxFF MD simulations. Applications of VARxMD in ReaxFF MD simulations of coal and HDPE (high-density polyethylene) pyrolysis show that VARxMD provides the capabilities in exploring the reaction mechanism in large systems with complex chemical reactions involved that are difficult to access manually.
