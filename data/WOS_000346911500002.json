It is intriguing and beautiful. The spiral pattern is found extensively in nature, encoded into plants, animals, weather phenomena, the earth, and galaxies around us. The paper starts with a mathematical representation of the spiral phenomena. Next, 2-dimensional and n-dimensional Spiral Dynamics Optimization (SpDO) algorithms are presented followed by their variants such as adaptive SpDO and hybrid SpDO. Finally, applications to engineering problems are reviewed including a flexible robot manipulator system, training of artificial neural networks, the Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch (CEED) optimization problem in power system operations, and clustering in data mining.", "paper_title": "Spiral Dynamics Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000346911500002"}
