The number of molecular descriptors is tremendously increased in the last decades, due to their fundamental role in modelling and understanding the relationships between chemicals and physico-chemical properties, biological activities, toxicological behaviour, environmental impact, analytical measurements. A free web-based database, named the MOLE db - Molecular Descriptors Database (http://michem.disat.unimib.it/mole_db/) was recently implemented; it is comprised of 1124 molecular descriptors calculated on 234773 molecules derived from the NCI database. This database is intended as a research and teaching tool, allowing to search for a specific group of molecules and analyse the corresponding values of molecular descriptors. Basically, the database allows the user to search for a specific group of molecules, view the corresponding values of selected molecular descriptors, and save in an output file the values of a set of molecular descriptors.", "paper_title": "Introduction to MOLE DB - on-line Molecular Descriptors Database", "paper_id": "WOS:000266748900013"}
