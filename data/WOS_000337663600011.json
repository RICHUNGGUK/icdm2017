Using irrelevant features in classification or clustering tasks could deteriorate the performance. Thus, designing efficient feature selection algorithms to remove the irrelevant features is a possible way to improve the classification or clustering performance. With the successful usage of sparse models in image and video classification and understanding, imposing structural sparsity in feature selection has been widely investigated during the past years. Motivated by the merit of sparse models, in this paper we propose a novel feature selection method using a sparse model. Different from the state of the art, our method is built upon l(2,p)-norm and simultaneously considers both the global and local (GLocal) structures of data distribution. Our method is more flexible in selecting the discriminating features as it is able to control the degree of sparseness. Moreover, considering both global and local structures of data distribution makes our feature selection process more effective. An efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the l(2,p)-norm joint sparsity optimization problem in this paper. Experimental results performed on real-world image and video datasets show the effectiveness of our feature selection method compared to several state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
