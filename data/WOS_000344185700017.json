However, CMS focuses on the administration and development of websites, while LMS is mainly focused on the management of training through the use of learning objects. CMS and LMS have features that can be used in conjunction in order to create educational environments which enhance the teaching-learning process in classrooms. This article presents a hybrid management system called Athena for multi-device educational content providing a set of Web-based interfaces for managing, presenting, and generating PHP-based applications with educational content, reducing both the time and effort invested during the development process of this type of software. Athena borrows the main features of both CMS and LMS in order to manage and reuse educational content. Athena allows the user to develop platform-independent multi-device educational software using existing educational content. Athena aims to provide new forms of accessibility to educational content, envisioning a better future for online education. To demonstrate Athena's capabilities, we have presented a case study for generating a multi-device physics course to emphasize our contribution.(c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
