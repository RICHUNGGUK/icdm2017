In this paper, we propose a novel constrained nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm, called the graph regularized discriminative non-negative matrix factorization (GDNMF), to incorporate into the NMF model both intrinsic geometrical structure and discriminative information which have been essentially ignored in prior works. Specifically, both the graph Laplacian and supervised label information are jointly utilized to learn the projection matrix in the new model. Further we provide the corresponding multiplicative update solutions for the optimization framework, together with the convergence proof. A series of experiments are conducted over several benchmark face datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed GDNMF.", "paper_title": "Graph regularized discriminative non-negative matrix factorization for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000340550300027"}
