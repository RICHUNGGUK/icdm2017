To avoid high dimensional facial shape regression, we propose a hierarchical pose regression approach, estimating the head rotation, face components, and facial landmarks hierarchically. The regression process works in a unified cascaded fern framework with binary patterns. We present generalized gradient boosted ferns (GBFs) for the regression framework, which give better performance than ferns. The framework also achieves real time performance. We verify our method on the latest benchmark datasets and show that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
