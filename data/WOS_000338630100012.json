The aim is to evaluate two models for turbomachinery flows. The first model is a simple algebraic model developed by Straka and Prihoda and the second one is the three-equation k - k(L) - omega model of Walters and Cokljat. Both models were tested for shear flows over the flat plate (ERCOFTAC T3A, T3B, and T3A- cases) for natural and bypass transition, over two airfoils in a tandem for the transition due to incoming wake and finally for the flow through a subsonic turbine blade cascade. Both models are compared to available experimental data.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of transitional flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000338630100012"}
