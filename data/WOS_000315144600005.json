Since, in some cases, the results provided by these operators may be questionable, we introduce functions that also generalize both operators and characterize those satisfying a condition imposed to maintain the relationship among the weights.", "paper_title": "An Analysis of Some Functions That Generalizes Weighted Means and OWA Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000315144600005"}
