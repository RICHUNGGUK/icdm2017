Thirty-three chemicals were profiled using the OECD and OASIS profilers, enabling the applicability domain of six structural alerts to be defined, the alerts being: epoxides, lactones, nitrosos, nitros, aldehydes and ketones. Analysis of the experimental data showed the applicability domains for the epoxide, nitroso, aldehyde and ketone structural alerts to be well defined. In contrast, the data showed the applicability domains for the lactone and nitro structural alerts needed modifying. The accurate definition of the applicability domain for structural alerts within in silico profilers is important due to their use in the chemical category in predictive and regulatory toxicology. This study highlights the importance of utilizing multiple profilers in category formation.", "paper_title": "Experimental verification, and domain definition, of structural alerts for protein binding: epoxides, lactones, nitroso, nitros, aldehydes and ketones", "paper_id": "WOS:000322946400001"}
