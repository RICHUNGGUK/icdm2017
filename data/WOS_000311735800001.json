In this paper, decision problem of components substitution is regarded as decision problem of services substitution through a service-oriented architecture of CPS. Further, a reliability assurance method for CPS service substitution is proposed, which comprises two parts. The first one is a qualitative judgment method for CPS service substitution according to the relationship between service compatibility and substitution based on time-space p-calculus with time and space operators. The other one is consisted of substitution processes from above judgment results based on service management theory. Finally, a case study is performed to show how to apply this method to ensure CPS components reliable substitution. The experimental result shows that this method is reasonable and feasible.", "paper_title": "A Novel Reliability Assurance Method for Cyberphysical System Components Substitution", "paper_id": "WOS:000311735800001"}
