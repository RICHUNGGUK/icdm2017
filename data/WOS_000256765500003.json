To cope with the problem of the conventional time-domain canceller, which does not work in deep fades, simple repetition (de)coding and modulation order increasing techniques are exploited in our proposal. The approximated repetition decoding provides reliable symbols in the regeneration operation, and the increased modulation order maintains the spectral efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method using 16QAM significantly improves the BER performance compared with the conventional method using QPSK, while the spectral efficiency is maintained. Moreover, the proposed method using 64QAM concurrently improves both the BER performance and the spectral efficiency.", "paper_title": "A robust and secure time-domain ICI canceller for OFDM based ubiquitous systems in time-varying multipath channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000256765500003"}
