It exploits the fact that certain geometrically meaningful, isolated points in scale space provide unambiguous motion evidence, and the fact that such evidence narrows down the space of admissible motion fields. The paradigm combines the strengths of multiscale and variational frameworks. Besides spatial velocity, two additional degrees of freedom are taken into account, viz. a temporal and an isotropic spatial scale component. The first one is conventionally set to unity (\"temporal gauge\"), but may in general account for creation or annihilation of structures over time. The second one pertains to changes in the image that can be attributed to a sharpening or blurring of structures over time. This paper serves to introduce the new generalized motion paradigm de-emphasizing performance issues. We focus on the conceptual idea and provide recommendations for future directions.", "paper_title": "Towards a new paradigm for motion extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700068"}
