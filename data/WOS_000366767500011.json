Both problems are NP-complete. The problems are closely related to a number of well-studied problems, including the problems SUBGRAPH ISOMORPHISM, TREE EDITING, and GRAPH PACKING. It is shown that the problems CTSS and CTSP are fixed-parameter tractable. Thorough development of parameterized algorithms and kernelization algorithms for these problems are presented.
