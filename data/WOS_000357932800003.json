Let A(k)(n) be the maximum value of A(k)(G, H) over n-element structures. We prove the strictness of the quantifier alternation hierarchy of FO2 in a strong quantitative form, namely A(2)(n) > n/8 - 2, which is tight up to a constant factor. For each k =>= 2, it holds that A(k)(n) > log(k+1) n - 2 even over colored trees, which is also tight up to a constant factor if k >= 3. For k >= 3, the last lower bound holds also over uncolored trees, whereas the alternation hierarchy of FO2 collapses even over all uncolored graphs. We also show examples of colored graphs G and H on n vertices that can be distinguished in FO2 much more succinctly if the alternation number is increased just by one: Whereas in Sigma(i) it is possible to distinguish G from H with bounded quantifier depth, in Pi(i) this requires quantifier depth Omega(n(2)). The quadratic lower bound is best possible here because, if G and H can be distinguished in FOk with i quantifier alternations, this can be done with quantifier depth n(2k-2) + 1 and the same number of alternations.", "paper_title": "Bounds for the Quantifier Depth in Finite-Variable Logics: Alternation Hierarchy", "paper_id": "WOS:000357932800003"}
