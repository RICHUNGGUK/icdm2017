Services in such an environment should be ubiquitous, adaptive, and robust with respect to access and delivery. Many different techniques exist for selecting services in smart environments, for example, dynamic programming, genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic. However, existing approaches to service selection fail to address the dynamic nature of the services and the requirement of considering the user context and user satisfaction. We address this issue by proposing an ant-inspired service selection framework based on dynamic user preferences and satisfaction. This ant-inspired approach is robust to failures and adaptive to dynamic context. The proposed framework enables different categories of residents (e.g., elderly people, fathers with children, mothers, and so on) to access various media services in such a way that their experiences are optimized with regard to their surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of the proposed framework.", "paper_title": "Ant-based service selection framework for a smart home monitoring environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000323435800006"}
