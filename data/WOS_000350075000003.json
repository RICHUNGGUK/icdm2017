While testbeds are invaluable tools for realistic network and protocol evaluation, these results are generally obtained after cumbersome system implementation and debugging. On the other hand, realistic simulation models can reduce the time and effort for concept testing of ideas. To this end, we develop BOWLsim PITY layer models-propagation, frame detection, and frame error models-based on extensive measurements in the Berlin Open Wireless Lab indoor and outdoor testbeds. Our models are integrated into the ns-3 simulator. We run an extensive measurement and simulation study, which illustrates that BOWLsim models represent network conditions at the physical (PHY) layer and transport layer accurately.", "paper_title": "Site-Specific Models for Realistic Wireless Network Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000350075000003"}
