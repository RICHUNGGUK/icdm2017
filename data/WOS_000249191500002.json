The proposed model represents developable surfaces using triangle meshes. A novel algorithm is proposed to introduce the Hamilton principle into these meshes such that the resulting developable model is dynamic. i.e.. it can offer a time-dependent continuous path to deform the model. Applications with examples are presented; these show that the proposed technique can model buckled developable surfaces well, and can offer physically-realistic animations of deformed developable surfaces.
