In this paper, we investigate the achievable data collection capacity of realistic distributed asynchronous WSNs. Our main contributions include five aspects. First, to avoid data transmission interference, we derive an R-0-proper carrier-sensing range (R-0 - PCR) under the generalized physical interference model, where R-0 is the satisfied threshold of data receiving rate. Taking R-0 - PCR as its carrier-sensing range, any sensor node can initiate a data transmission with a guaranteed data receiving rate. Second, based on R-0 - PCR, we propose a Distributed Data Collection (DDC) algorithm with fairness consideration. Theoretical analysis of DDC surprisingly shows that its achievable network capacity is order-optimal and independent of network size. Thus, DDC is scalable. Third, we discuss how to apply R-0 - PCR to the distributed data aggregation problem and propose a Distributed Data Aggregation (DDA) algorithm. The delay performance of DDA is also analyzed. Fourth, to be more general, we study the delay and capacity of DDC and DDA under the Poisson node distribution model. The analysis demonstrates that DDC is also scalable and order-optimal under the Poisson distribution model. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to validate the performance of DDC and DDA.", "paper_title": "Distributed Data Collection in Large-Scale Asynchronous Wireless Sensor Networks Under the Generalized Physical Interference Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000323513000019"}
