In order to characterize the approximate two-thirds simulation, we propose the definition of a two-thirds simulation index which expresses the degree to which a binary relation between processes is two-thirds simulation. lambda-two-thirds simulation and its substitutivity laws are given in this paper. And, based on lambda-two-thirds simulation, we present a measure model for describing the degree of approximation between processes. In particular, we give the modal logical characterization of lambda-two-thirds simulation.", "paper_title": "Two-thirds simulation indexes and modal logic characterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000297646300009"}
