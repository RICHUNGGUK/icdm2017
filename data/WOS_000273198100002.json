However, this also raises significant concerns about how to protect sensitive multimedia data from being illegally copied and unauthorized modifications. Thus, this paper proposes a fragile watermarking method to detect illegitimate alterations of the watermarked data. The proposed method embeds a grayscale watermark image into a grayscale cover image in a block-by-block manner by using discrete Fourier transform. Experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully and exactly detect and localize any tampered regions of the watermarked image.", "paper_title": "An Image Authentication Based on Discrete Fourier Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000273198100002"}
