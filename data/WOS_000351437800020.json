Effective mapping benefits many scientific and engineering tasks that involve the modeling and processing of correlated geometric or image data. We model mapping computation as an optimization problem with certain geometric constraints and go through its general solving pipeline. Different mapping algorithms are discussed and compared according to their formulations of objective functions, constraints, and optimization strategies.", "paper_title": "On Computing Mapping of 3D Objects: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000351437800020"}
