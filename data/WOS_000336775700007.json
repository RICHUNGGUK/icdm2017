It is based on a Poisson solver that combines two components: the immersed interface method to enforce the boundary condition on each inner boundary and the James-Lackner algorithm to compute the outer boundary condition consistent with the unbounded domain solution. The algorithm is here based on second order finite differences and it requires solely 1-D stencil corrections; this makes the immersed interface part of the present method easily extendable to higher dimensional problems. The treatment of the outer boundaries requires an iterative boundary potential method. The algorithm is validated, by means of grid convergence studies, on the flow past multiple bodies. The results confirm the second order accuracy everywhere. The algorithm is also self consistent as \"all is clone on the grid\" (thus without using a vortex panel boundary element method in addition to the grid). For cusped airfoils, a consistent way to enforce the Kutta-Joukowsky condition is also presented. The present algorithm constitutes a crucial building block towards an immersed interface-enabled vortex particle-mesh method for the computation of unsteady viscous flows, with boundary layers, detached shear layers and wakes. A possible extension to 3-D problems is also briefly discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
