A partial periodic pattern consists of some periodic and non-periodic events in a specific period length, and is repeated with high frequency in an event sequence. In the past, a max-subpattern hit set algorithm was developed to discover partial periodic patterns, but its drawback is spending a large amount of time in calculating frequency counts from the redundant candidate nodes. In this study, we thus adopt an efficient encoding strategy to speed up the efficiency of processing period segments in an event sequence, and combined with the projection method to quickly find the partial periodic patterns in the recursive process. Finally, the experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
