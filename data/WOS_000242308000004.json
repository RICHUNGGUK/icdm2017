In this context, many applications require the calculation of similarities between tree pairs. The most studied distance is likely the tree edit distance (ED) for which improvements in terms of complexity have been achieved during the last decade. However, this classic ED usually uses a priori fixed edit costs which are often difficult to tune, that leaves little room for tackling complex problems. In this paper, we focus on the learning of a stochastic tree ED. We use an adaptation of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for learning the primitive edit costs. We carried out series of experiments that confirm the interest to learn a tree ED rather than a priori imposing edit costs.", "paper_title": "Learning stochastic tree edit distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000242308000004"}
