The model errors in the present study are defined as deviations of a test sample from the assumptions made in the numerical model, namely, assumptions about lamination angle, plate flatness and uniform thickness. To improve an accuracy of the error functional coming from the physical tests, an influence of measurement errors on the modal parameters has been investigated additionally. The proposed practical solution makes the results of inverse problems more accurate and reliable and the identification process more effective. This new methodology has been successfully applied for the non-destructive material properties characterisation of carbon/epoxy prepreg (SEAL Texipreg HS 160 RM) panels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
