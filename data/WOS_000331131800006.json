The PROPER INTERVAL COMPLETION problem finds applications in molecular biology and genomic research. This problem is known to be FPT (Kaplan, Tarjan and Shamir, FOCS'94), but no polynomial kernel was known to exist. We settle this question by proving that PROPER INTERVAL COMPLETION admits a kernel with (k(3)) vertices. Moreover, we prove that a related problem, the so-called BIPARTITE CHAIN DELETION problem, admits a kernel with O(k(2)) vertices, completing a previous result of Guo (ISAAC'07).
