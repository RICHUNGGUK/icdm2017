This paper studies how to develop a robust schedule for berth allocation that incorporates a degree of anticipation of uncertainty (e.g., vessels' arrival time and operation time) during the schedule's execution. This study proposes a bi-objective optimization model for minimizing cost and maximizing robustness of schedules. A heuristic is also developed for solving the hi-objective model in large-scale problem cases. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and method. Managerial implications are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
