Service and content provisioning platforms have to address several ubiquity challenges such as mobility, multimodality, context-awareness and content adaptation. However, current solutions fail to comprehensively face ubiquity challenges as they lack a unified approach and provide only limited sets of features. We claim that an integrated ubiquity support can stem from a simplicity principle: our middleware approach pushes the logic to face ubiquity issues outside the core layer, by keeping only management and coordination responsibilities. That succeeds in making the middleware design clearer and neater. This article(1) presents the key architectural aspects of our platform for ubiquitous dynamic context-driven service provisioning and reconfiguration. To practically show the viability of our approach, we also provide implementation details and description of typical use cases. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
