Compared to previous charge-recovery circuitry, EBL achieves increased gate overdrive, resulting in low latency overhead over static CMOS design. The EBL-based FIR has been designed with only 1.5 cycles of additional latency over its static CMOS counterpart, while consuming 21% less energy per cycle, based on post-layout simulations of the two designs. The test-chip has been fabricated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process with a fully-integrated 3 nH inductor. Correct function has been validated in the 365-600 MHz range. At its resonant frequency of 466 MHz, the test-chip dissipates 39.1 mW with a 93.6 nW/MHz/Tap/InBit/CoeffBit figure of merit, recovering 45% of the energy supplied to it every cycle.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Low-Latency 600 MHz FIR With High-Overdrive Charge-Recovery Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000304102000001"}
