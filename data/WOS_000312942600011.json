We describe a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a K-i,K-j-free graph G and a nonnegative integer k, constructs a graph H (the \"kernel\") and an integer k' such that (1) G has a dominating set of size at most k if and only if H has a dominating set of size at most k', (2) H has O((j + 1)(i)+(1)k(i2)) vertices, and (3) k' = O((j + 1)(i)+1k(i2)). Since d-degenerate graphs do not have K-d+1,K-d+1 as a subgraph, this immediately yields a polynomial kernel on O((d+ 2)(d)+(2)k(d+ 1)(2)) vertices for the k-DOMINATING SET problem on d-degenerate graphs, solving an open problem posed by Alon and Gutner [Alon and Gutner 2008; Gutner 2009]. The most general class of graphs for which a polynomial kernel was previously known for k-DOMINATING SET is the class of K-h-topological-minor-free graphs [utner 2009]. Graphs of bounded degeneracy are the most general class of graphs for which an FPT algorithm was previously known for this problem. Kh-topologicalminor-free graphs are K-i,K-j -free for suitable values of i, j (but not vice-versa), and so our results show that k-DOMINATING SET has both FPT algorithms and polynomial kernels in strictly more general classes of graphs. Using the same techniques, we also obtain an O (jk(i)) vertex-kernel for the k-INDEPENDENT DOMINATING SET problem on K-i,K-j-free graphs.", "paper_title": "Polynomial Kernels for Dominating Set in Graphs of Bounded Degeneracy and Beyond", "paper_id": "WOS:000312942600011"}
