The communication overhead incurred in the network is minimised by clustering sensor measurements and merging clusters before sending a compact description of the clusters to other nodes. An evaluation on several real and synthetic datasets demonstrates that the distributed hyperspherical cluster-based scheme achieves comparable detection accuracy with a significant reduction in communication overhead compared to a centralised scheme, where all the sensor node measurements are communicated to a central node for processing.
