Nodes communicate amongst each other using wireless radios and operate by following a peer-to-peer network model. In this article we investigate authentication in a layered approach, which results to multiple lines of defense for mobile ad hoc networks. The layered security approach is described and design criteria for creating secure ad hoc network using multiple authentication protocols are analyzed. The performance of several such known protocols, which are based on challenge-response techniques, is presented through simulation results. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
