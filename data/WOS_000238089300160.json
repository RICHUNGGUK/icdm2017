Compared to traditional geometry based modeling method, it is not only realized easily, but also can provide better effects of navigation. Based on the previous research experience, this paper mainly introduces the application of TIP for digitization of Culture Heritage by using relative depth calculation and cubic panorama. Finally, by using a hybrid NPR/TIP approach, we provide stylized interactive and real-time scenes walkthrough so as to convey a kind of specific cultural spirits.", "paper_title": "Digitization of culture heritage based on tour into the picture", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300160"}
