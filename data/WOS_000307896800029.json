Currently, one of the challenges faced by 3-D applications is the shortage of 3-D resources. To solve this problem, many 3-D modeling methods are proposed to directly recover 3-D geometry from 2-D images. However, these methods on single view modeling either require intensive user interaction, or are restricted to a specific kind of object. In this paper, we propose a novel 3-D modeling approach to recover 3-D geometry from a single image of a symmetric object with minimal user interaction. Symmetry is one of the most common properties of natural or manmade objects. Given a single view of a symmetric object, the user marks some symmetric lines and depth discontinuity regions on the image. Our algorithm first finds a set of planes to approximately fit to the object, and then a rough 3-D point cloud is generated by an optimization procedure. The occluded part of the object is further recovered using symmetry information. Experimental results on various indoor and outdoor objects show that the proposed system can obtain 3-D models from single images with only a little user interaction.", "paper_title": "3-D Modeling from a Single View of a Symmetric Object", "paper_id": "WOS:000307896800029"}
