This issue is formulated as a non-linear equality and inequality constrained optimization problem with an objective function incorporating power loss. A new evolutionary algorithm known as Bacteria Foraging is applied for solving, the optimum location and the amount of series injected voltage for the UPFC, and the best values of the taps present in the system. The same problem is also solved with Interior Point Successive Linearization technique using the LINPROG command of MATLAB, A comparison between the two suggests the superiority of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Transmission loss reduction based on FACTS and bacteria foraging algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400023"}
