A one-lattice lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) implementation with vector data structure combined with even fluid node partitioning domain decomposition and fully-optimized data transfer layout is presented. It is found to provide nearly-optimal workload balance, lower memory usage and better computational performance than classical slice decomposition techniques using sparse matrix data structures. Predictive memory usage and parallel performance models are also established and observed to be in very good agreement with data corresponding to numerical fluid flow simulations performed through 3-dimensional packings of cylinders and polydisperse spheres.
