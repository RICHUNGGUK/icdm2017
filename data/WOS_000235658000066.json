However, CF becomes less effective when users have multiple interests, because users have similar taste in one aspect may behave quite different in other aspects. Information got from social bookmarking websites not only tells what a user likes, but also why he or she likes it. This paper proposes a division algorithm and a CubeSVD algorithm to analysis this information, distill the interrelations between different users' various interests, and make better personalized recommendation based on them. Experiment reveals the superiority of our method over traditional CF methods.", "paper_title": "Cubic analysis of social bookmarking for personalized recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000066"}
