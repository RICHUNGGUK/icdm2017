Though diagnostic ambiguity Spurs research, the quest for molecular Markers that distinguish benign from malignant thyroid tumor classes remains unfulfilled. That eight subtypes (four per class) define thyroid tumors introduces a degree of heterogeneity that presents the major analytic impediment. A novel query-based comparison approach can, however, reliably distinguish benign from malignant lesions by examining subtype relations in class-specific gene expression. We introduce this approach through microarray analysis of thyroid tumor subtypes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
