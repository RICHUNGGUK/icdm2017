To be able to detect problematic specifications, realizability criteria have been identified, such as non-local choice. In this work we develop a formal framework to study realizability of compositional MSC [GMP03]. We use it to derive a complete classification of criteria that is closely related to the criteria for MSC from [MGR05]. Comparing specifications and implementations is usually complicated, because different formalisms are used. We treat both of them in terms of a single formalism. Therefore we extend the partial order semantics of [Pra86, KL98] with a way to model deadlocks and with a more sophisticated way to address communication.", "paper_title": "Realizability criteria for compositional MSC", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425400020"}
