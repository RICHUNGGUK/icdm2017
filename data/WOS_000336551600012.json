One major limitation of this approach is that its complexity grows rapidly as we increase the number of objectives. This work proposes a computational framework to reduce the dimensionality of multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems that identifies and eliminates in a systematic manner redundant criteria from the mathematical model. The method proposed builds on a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation introduced in a previous work by the authors. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach by its application to two case studies: the design of supply chains for hydrogen production and the multi-objective optimization of metabolic networks. Numerical examples show that our method outperforms other existing algorithms for dimensionality reduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
