UWSNs are a class of emerging networks that experience variable and high propagation delays and limited available bandwidth. There are comprehensive applications in this area such as oceanographic data collection, pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, assisted navigation and so on. Due to the different environment under the ocean, routing protocols in UWSNs should be re-designed to fit for the surroundings. In particular, routing protocols in UWSNs should ensure the reliability of message transmission, not just decrease the delay. In this paper, we propose a novel routing protocol named Location-Aware Routing Protocol (LARP) for UWSNs, where the location information of nodes is used to help the transmission of the message. Simulation results show that the proposed LARP outperforms the existing routing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio and normalized routing overhead. We expect LARP to be of greater value than other existing solutions in underwater environment.", "paper_title": "A Novel Routing Protocol Providing Good Transmission Reliability in Underwater Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000349067000017"}
