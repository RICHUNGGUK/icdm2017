Simulations are parallelized using a dynamic load-balancing approach and multiple parallel mergers. Checkpointing is used to improve reliability and to enable incremental results merging from partial results. A model is proposed to analyze the behavior of the proposed framework and help tune its parameters. Experimental results obtained on a production grid infrastructure show that the model fits the real makespan with a relative error of maximum 10%, that using multiple parallel mergers reduces the makespan by 40% on average, that checkpointing enables the completion of very long simulations and that it can be used without penalizing the makespan.
