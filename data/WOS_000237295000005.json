Then, based on this approximation method, a new teaming algorithm of a fully fuzzified neural network was developed in which the L-R fuzzy numbers were considered as the fuzzy signals. While the forward operations of fuzzy signals were based on the proposed three-parameter fuzzy arithmetic approximation method, the backward teaming adopted a back-propagation teaming procedure with a measurable error function. The teaming algorithm was illustrated by an example of the recognition of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. The simulation result showed that the proposed approximation method used in such teaming model was efficient and accurate.", "paper_title": "Three-parameter fuzzy arithmetic approximation of L-R fuzzy numbers for fuzzy neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237295000005"}
