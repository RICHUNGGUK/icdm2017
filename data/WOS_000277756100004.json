However, most systems run with purely position control not allowing voluntary active movements of the subject. The lack of intelligent control strategies for variable gait patterns has been a clinical concern of such kind exoskeleton man-machine systems. In this work, we establish a 5-link model for the usual 4-DOF gait rehabilitation exoskeleton type man-machine system and propose a gait trajectory adaption control strategy. A 4-DOF gait rehabilitation exoskeleton prototype is developed as a platform for the evaluation of design concepts and control strategies in the view of improved physical human-robot interaction. The experimental results with eight healthy volunteers and three stroke patients are encouraging. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
