It is shown that certain types of vector spaces can be characterized in terms of learnability properties: V-infinity/V is behaviourally correct learnable from text iff V is finite-dimensional, V-infinity/V is behaviourally correct learnable from switching the type of information iff V is finite-dimensional, 0-thin or 1-thin. On the other hand, learnability from an informant does not correspond to similar algebraic properties of a given space. There are 0-thin spaces W-1 and W-2 such that W-1 is not explanatorily learnable from an informant, and the infinite product (W-1)(infinity) is not behaviourally correct learnable from an informant, while both W-2 and the infinite product (W-2)(infinity) are explanatorily learnable from an informant.
