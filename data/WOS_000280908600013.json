These structures are very complex and difficult to analyze visually when they are presented with traditional rendering techniques. In this paper, we describe a visualization application based on illustrative techniques for rendering porous structures. We provide various interactive pore selection mechanisms and visualization styles that allow users to better perceive the connectivity between pores and how they are distributed by radii throughout the structure. The application also shows simulations of fluid intrusion or extrusion through the structure, and it allows users to navigate inside. We describe our application and discuss the experimental results with phantom models, BioCAD scaffolds, implants and rock samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
