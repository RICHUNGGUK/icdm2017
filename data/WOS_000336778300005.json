Evolution of rivers and deltas is important for geologists when interpreting the stratigraphy of the subsurface, in particular for hydrocarbon exploration. We illustratively visualize mountains, basins, lakes, rivers and deltas, and how they change the morphology of a terrain during their evolution. We present a compact representation of the model and a novel rendering algorithm that allows us to obtain an interactive and illustrative layercake visualization. A user study has been performed to evaluate our method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
