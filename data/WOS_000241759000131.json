A RTOS system-level power optimization approach based on hardware-software partitioning (RTOS-Power partitioning) can significantly minimize the energy consumption of a SoC. This paper presents a new model for RTOS-Power partitioning, which helps in understanding the essence of the RTOS-Power partitioning techniques. A discrete Hopfield neural network approach for implementing the RTOS-Power partitioning is proposed, where a novel energy function, operating equation and coefficients of the neural network are redefined. Simulations are carried out with comparison to other optimization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve higher energy savings up to 60% at relatively low costs.", "paper_title": "Neurocomputing for minimizing energy consumption of real-time operating system in the system-on-a-chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000131"}
