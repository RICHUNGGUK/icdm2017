The CBS is essentially a fractional time-stepping algorithm based on an original finite difference velocity-projection scheme where the convective terms are treated using the idea of the Characteristic-Galerkin method. In this work, the semi-implicit version of the CBS with global time-stepping is used for incompressible problems whereas the fully-explicit version is used for compressible flows. At the other end, the MPE is a vector extrapolation method that transforms the original sequence into another sequence converging to the same limit faster then the original one without the explicit knowledge of the sequence generator. The developed algorithm, tested on two-dimensional benchmark problems, demonstrates the new computational features arising from the introduction of the extrapolation procedure to the CBS scheme. In particular, the results show a remarkable reduction of the computational cost of the simulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
