The density-based empirical likelihood approach improves the performance of these tests for goodness-of-fit, forming them into approximate likelihood ratios. This method is extended to develop two-sample empirical likelihood approximations to optimal parametric likelihood ratios, resulting in an efficient test based on samples entropy. The proposed and examined distribution-free two-sample test is shown to be very competitive with well-known nonparametric tests. For example, the new test has high and stable power detecting a nonconstant shift in the two-sample problem, when Wilcoxon's test may break down completely. This is partly due to the inherent structure developed within Neyman-Pearson type lemmas. The outputs of an extensive Monte Carlo analysis and real data example support our theoretical results. The Monte Carlo simulation study indicates that the proposed test compares favorably with the standard procedures, for a wide range of null and alternative distributions.", "paper_title": "A two-sample empirical likelihood ratio test based on samples entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000293782700015"}
