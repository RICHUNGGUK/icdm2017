Each node that has a specified amount of demands can be connected to one of p hubs. The uncapacitated single allocation p-hub maximal covering problem is to maximize the logistics covered, where the logistics of demand is said to be covered if the distance between two nodes is less than or equal to the specified range in consideration of the distance savings between hubs. The aim of our model is to locate the hub, and to allocate non-hub nodes to the located hub nodes; the hub can maximize the demand covered by deadline traveling time. It is presented an integer programming formulation for the new hub covering model, and a computational study based on several instances derived from the CAB (Civil Aeronautics Board) data set. Two heuristics, distance based allocation and volume based allocation methods, are suggested with a computational experiment on the CAB data set. Performances of heuristics are evaluated, and it is shown that good solutions are found in a relatively reasonable computation time for most of instances. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
