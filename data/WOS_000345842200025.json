The proposed ADC is based on the error-feedback structure and it does not require any extra capacitor compared to the main SAR ADC and just by employing an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA), a first-order noise-shaping is provided. The closed-loop configuration of the OTA is similar to the flip-around scheme in which the dummy capacitor also acts as the sampling capacitor. In this configuration, the quantization noise of the ADC is sampled and transferred via the dummy capacitor without any charge sharing or capacitor interleaving, and so, the capacitors mismatch is alleviated in the feedback path. The proposed ADC is realized by employing a few number of capacitors and switches compared to the conventional SAR ADC. As a design example, the proposed noise-shaping SAR ADC is simulated in a 90 nm CMOS technology by employing a 3-bit SAR ADC. Simulation results with Spectre-RF shows 11.1-bit effective resolution in 1 MHz input bandwidth and 128 MHz sampling rate while consuming 208 mu W power. The achieved figure of merit is 46.4 fJ/conv-step.", "paper_title": "An error-feedback noise-shaping SAR ADC in 90 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000345842200025"}
