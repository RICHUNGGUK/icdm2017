To move to another floor, a mobile robot should recognize various objects related to an elevator, e.g., elevator control, call buttons, and LED displays. To this end, we propose a neural network based retrainable framework for object recognition, which consists of four components-preprocessing, binary classification, object identification, and outlier rejection. The binary classifier, a key component of our system, is a neural network that can be retrained, the motivation of which is to adapt to varying environments, especially with illuminations. Without incurring any extra process to prepare new training samples for retraining, they are freely obtained as a result of the outlier rejection component, being extracted on-line. To realize a practical system, we adopt a parallel architecture integrating both recognition and retraining processes for seamless object recognition, and furthermore detect and cope with the deterioration of a retrained neural network to ensure high reliability. We demonstrate the positive effect of retraining on the object recognition performance by conducting experiments over hundreds of images obtained in daytime and nighttime.", "paper_title": "A neural network based retrainable framework for robust object recognition with application to mobile robotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000294689900003"}
