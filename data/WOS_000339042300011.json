However, the reliability of this approach is limited by several factors that affect the CT intensity distributions in the lung. This work presents a novel method for emphysema quantification, based on parametric modeling of intensity distributions and a hidden Markov measure field model to segment emphysematous regions. The framework adapts to the characteristics of an image to ensure a robust quantification of emphysema under varying CT imaging protocols, and differences in parenchymal intensity distributions due to factors such as inspiration level. Compared to standard approaches, the presented model involves a larger number of parameters, most of which can be estimated from data, to handle the variability encountered in lung CT scans. The method was applied on a longitudinal data set with 87 subjects and a total of 365 scans acquired with varying imaging protocols. The resulting emphysema estimates had very high intra-subject correlation values. By reducing sensitivity to changes in imaging protocol, the method provides a more robust estimate than standard approaches. The generated emphysema delineations promise advantages for regional analysis of emphysema extent and progression.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Quantification and Longitudinal Analysis of Pulmonary Emphysema With a Hidden Markov Measure Field Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000339042300011"}
