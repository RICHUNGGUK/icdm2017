The algorithm controls the starting of BFS (Breadth-First Search) by recognizing the addition of invalid nodes, monitoring the network structure dynamically. The definition, 'Communication Quality', is proposed to measure the quality of communications link. Only after network partitioning happens does PMD (Proactive Maintaining Algorithm for Dynamic Topology Control) start the link rebuilding mechanism to maintain the topology. The algorithm restrains isolated nodes generation and makes the energy be used efficiently. The results show that PMD (Proactive Maintaining Algorithm for Dynamic Topology Control) not only improves the efficiency of the energy, but also constructs a robust topology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
