The LC network consists of four unit cells of CRL LC resonator stacked in series, and two pairs of cross-coupled transistors are used to compensate for the loss of LC resonator. Varactors are used as the control to switch on/off the high- or low-frequency bands. In the fundamental mode, the RSWO operates at the high-frequency band. In the harmonic mode, the oscillator provides low-frequency band outputs. The dual-band function exploits the multiple oscillation modes of the CRL RSWO. The proposed RSWO has been implemented with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited (TSMC) 0.18-m SiGe BiCMOS technology. It can generate differential signals in the high-band frequency range of 6.73-8.60 GHz and in the low-band frequency range of 3.68-3.73 GHz. The die area of the RSWO is 1.123 x 1.123 mm(2).
