For two copies of x(1)(n) is an element of C-n, this function gives the minimum number of steps one has to slide one copy of x(1)(n) to get a match with the other one. For ergodic positive entropy processes, Saussol and coauthors proved the almost sure convergence of T-n/n. We compute the large deviation properties of this function. We prove that this limit is related to the Renyi entropy function, which is also proved to exist. Our results hold under a condition easy to check which defines a large class of processes. We provide some examples.", "paper_title": "Renyi Entropies and Large Deviations for the First Match Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000351470800008"}
