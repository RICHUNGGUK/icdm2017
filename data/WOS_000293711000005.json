The efficiency and correctness of most graph pattern miners relies critically on this property. We study the case where frequent subgraphs have to be found in one graph. Vanetik et al. (Data Min Knowl Disc 13(2):243-260, 2006) already gave sufficient and necessary conditions for anti-monotonicity of graph measures depending only on the edge-overlaps between the instances of the pattern in a labeled graph. We extend these results to homomorphisms, isomorphisms and homeomorphisms on both labeled and unlabeled, directed and undirected graphs, for vertex- and edge-overlap. We show a set of reductions between the different morphisms that preserve overlap. As a secondary contribution, we prove that the popular maximum independent set measure assigns the minimal possible normalized frequency and we introduce a new measure based on the minimum clique partition that assigns the maximum possible normalized frequency. In that way, we obtain that all normalized anti-monotonic overlap graph measures are bounded from above and below. We also introduce a new measure sandwiched between the former two based on the polynomial time computable Lovasz theta-function.", "paper_title": "All normalized anti-monotonic overlap graph measures are bounded", "paper_id": "WOS:000293711000005"}
