In this paper, an efficient markerless registration algorithm is presented for both outdoor and indoor AR system. This algorithm first calculates the correspondences among frames using fixed region tracking, and then estimates the motion parameters on projective transformation following the homography of the tracked region. To achieve the illumination insensitive tracking, the illumination parameters are solved jointly with motion parameters in each step. Based on the perspective motion parameters of the tracked region, the 3D registration, the camera's pose and position, can be calculated with calibrated intrinsic parameters. A marker-less AR system is described using this algorithm, and the system architecture and working flow are also proposed. Experimental results with comparison quantitatively demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the robustness of the registration algorithm.", "paper_title": "Marker-less registration based on template tracking for augmented reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000261958500004"}
