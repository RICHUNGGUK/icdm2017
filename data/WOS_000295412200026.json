Despite this need, very few entity normalization systems are publicly available as source code or web services for biomedical text mining. Here we present the GNAT Java library for text retrieval, named entity recognition, and normalization of gene and protein mentions in biomedical text. The library can be used as a component to be integrated with other text-mining systems, as a framework to add user-specific extensions, and as an efficient stand-alone application for the identification of gene and protein names for data analysis. On the BioCreative III test data, the current version of GNAT achieves a Tap-20 score of 0.1987.", "paper_title": "The GNAT library for local and remote gene mention normalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000295412200026"}
