One of the main problems of algorithmic self-assembly is the minimum tile set problem, which in the extended formulation we consider, here referred to as MTSP, asks for a collection of types of elementary objects (called tiles) to be found for the self-assembly of an object having a pre-established shape. Such a collection is to be as concise as possible, thus minimizing supply diversity, while satisfying a set of stringent constraints having to do with important properties of the self-assembly process from its tile types. We present a study of what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first practical approach to MTSP. Our study starts with the introduction of an evolutionary heuristic to tackle MTSP and includes selected results from extensive experimentation with the heuristic on the self-assembly of simple objects in two and three dimensions, including the possibility of tile rotation. The heuristic we introduce combines classic elements from the field of evolutionary computation with a problem-specific variant of Pareto dominance into a multi-objective approach to MTSP.", "paper_title": "Optimization of supply diversity for the self-assembly of simple objects in two and three dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000288255800033"}
