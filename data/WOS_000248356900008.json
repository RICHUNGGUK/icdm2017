By introduction of consistency property over a logic program, they proposed a class of logic programs, FC-normal programs, each of which has at least one stable model. However, it is not clear how to choose one appropriate consistency property for deciding whether or not a logic program is FC-normal. In this paper, we firstly discover that, for any finite logic program II, there exists the least consistency property LCon(II) over II, which just depends on II itself, such that, II is FC-normal if and only if II is FC-normal with respect to (w.r.t.) LCon(II). Actually, in order to determine the FC-normality of a logic program, it is sufficient to check the monotonic closed sets in LCon(II) for all non-monotonic rules, that is LFC(II). Secondly, we present an algorithm for computing LFC(II). Finally, we reveal that the brave reasoning task and cautious reasoning task for FC-normal logic programs are of the same difficulty as that of normal logic programs.", "paper_title": "Consistency property of finite FC-normal logic programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000248356900008"}
