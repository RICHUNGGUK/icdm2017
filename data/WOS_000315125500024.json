In our model, a team is created with a defined potential (ability) which is updated during the tournament according to the results of previous games. The updated potential modifies a team future winning/losing probabilities. We show that this evolutionary game is able to reproduce the statistical properties of final standings of actual editions of the Brazilian tournament (Brasileirao) if the starting potential is the same for all teams. Other leagues such as the Italian (Calcio) and the Spanish (La Liga) tournaments have notoriously non-Gaussian traces and cannot be straightforwardly reproduced by this evolutionary non-Markovian model with simple initial conditions. However, we show that by setting the initial abilities based on data from previous tournaments, our model is able to capture the stylized statistical features of double round robin system (DRRS) tournaments in general. A complete understanding of these phenomena deserves much more attention, but we suggest a simple explanation based on data collected in Brazil: here several teams have been crowned champion in previous editions corroborating that the champion typically emerges from random fluctuations that partly preserve the Gaussian traces during the tournament. On the other hand, in the Italian and Spanish cases, only a few teams in recent history have won their league tournaments. These leagues are based on more robust and hierarchical structures established even before the beginning of the tournament. For the sake of completeness, we also elaborate a totally Gaussian model (which equalizes the winning, drawing, and losing probabilities) and we show that the scores of the Brazilian tournament \"Brasileirao\" cannot be reproduced. This shows that the evolutionary aspects are not superfluous and play an important role which must be considered in other alternative models. Finally, we analyze the distortions of our model in situations where a large number of teams is considered, showing the existence of a transition from a single to a double peaked histogram of the final classification scores. An interesting scaling is presented for different sized tournaments. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
