In the subthreshold regime, the electrostatics of the device is dominated by the capacitive coupling between the electrodes, which is analyzed by conformal mapping techniques. In the strong inversion regime, the device behavior is dominated by the inversion charge, allowing a I D analysis. The models are verified by comparison with numerical device simulations. The electrostatic properties of the DG and GAA are compared, demonstrating the superior short-channel behavior of the GAA design. (C) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
