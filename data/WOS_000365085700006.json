Convergence of the strategy is proved for both cases using appropriate state transformations and Lyapunov functions. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated via its application to a representative power-grid model recently presented in the literature.", "paper_title": "Distributed PID Control for Consensus of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000365085700006"}
