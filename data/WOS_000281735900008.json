Their testing becomes more complicated due to the increased number of RF paths. This increases the overall test cost of these devices both in terms of test time and instrumentation cost. In this paper, we demonstrate a low cost MIMO test solution which targets critical specifications that are fundamental to the MIMO system operation, such as gain, IIP(3), and phase imbalances between the RF paths. Our test methodology measures these parameters with a single test setup that enables the calculation of these performance parameters. Using the proposed test method, RF MIMO systems can be tested using a mixed signal tester, and on-board circuitry within a reasonable accuracy. Both simulation and measurement results confirm the high accuracy and repeatability of our test technique.", "paper_title": "Low Cost MIMO Testing for RF Integrated Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000281735900008"}
