The process is conceived as a service chain that delivers services to customers by a glow that links a set of organizations. This concept implies a wider view of performance. The model includes all the performances that increase overall competitiveness (i.e. classic cost and efficiency indicators are integrated by effectiveness indicators, that measure service level and quality). Second, the model considers the different stakeholders involved in a process: management, customers and operators. The model maps the performance indicators on these perspectives. This multiple perspective can be used in benchmarking and diagnosis to evaluate an existing process or to design a new process.", "paper_title": "Design processes for sustainable performances: A model and a method", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100032"}
