An arbitrary number of terms for the series solution in each of the regions behind the main shock - the expansion region, the nearly uniform region outside the main expansion and the region between the contact surface and the main shock, have been generated and matched across the boundaries. We then study the convergence of the solution by using Pade approximation. It constitutes a genuine analytic solution for a moderately strong explosion, which, however, does not involve a secondary shock. The pressure distribution behind the shock however shows some significant changes in the location of the tail of the rarefaction and the interface, in comparison to the planar problem. The theory developed for the spherical blasts is also extended to cylindrical blasts. The results are compared with the numerical solution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
