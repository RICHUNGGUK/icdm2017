Such revalidation algorithms have applications in schema evolution, query processing, XML-based programming languages, and other domains. We describe how knowledge of conformance to an XML Schema may be used to determine conformance to another XML Schema efficiently. We examine both the situation where an XML document is modified before it is revalidated and the situation where it is unmodified.", "paper_title": "Efficient revalidation of XML documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000244332000009"}
