We present and compare mathematical programming formulations for this problem and we study different relaxations: Lagrangean relaxations, linear programming relaxations, and partial relaxations of the integrality constraints. In particular, we show that the Lagrangean bound obtained by relaxing the flow conservation equations is tighter than the linear programming relaxation bound. We present computational results on a large set of randomly generated instances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
