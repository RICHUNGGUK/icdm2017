The collaborative annotating technique is based on collaborative annotations made by peers while the data mining technique is used to identify the learning bottlenecks suffered by most students on a formative assessment. The ASIFA system combines these two techniques, deemed as scaffolding learning, to furnish students with adequate annotations to clarify their confused concepts on formative assessments and to further improve their learning achievements on summative assessments. Finally, some experiments are conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system and investigate the effects of the students' behaviors of inputting and reviewing annotations on learning achievements.
