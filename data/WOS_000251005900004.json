Design/methodology/approach - A mm-wave FET is modeled as three active-coupled transmission lines, and the developed wave approach is applied to this model to calculate both signal and noise performances of the device. Findings - The measurements show a good match with the calculated data from the point of view of both signal and noise performances of the device. Originality/value - This CAD-oriented analysis and modeling can be easily applied to the nim-wave simulators to improve the simultaneous signal and noise optimization, modeling and analysis of mm-wave devices, especially for traveling wave transistors in which the distributed model seems to be more exact than the usual lumped models. Also the proposed routine compared to the admittance approach is conceptually more compatible with scattering representations of active and passive circuits. The developed algorithm has been applied successfully to mm-wave MESFETs and HEMTs.", "paper_title": "CAD-oriented signal and noise modeling of mm-wave FETs: a wave approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000251005900004"}
