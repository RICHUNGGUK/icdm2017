The considered model is derived from mass balances and an algebraic equilibrium equation identified using titration experiments. The catalyst quality requires that three variables are controlled during the production process: pH, volume and concentration. A global control structure enabling to simultaneously control the three considered variables is given. The pH controller adjusts a reactive base flow rate while the volume and concentration controllers act on water and reactive acid flow rates, respectively. The process model is used to derive control laws that impose asymptotically stable dynamics. Representative experimental results are presented to prove the relevance of the proposed approach.
