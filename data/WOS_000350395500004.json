To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose an application-layer throughput optimization model based on parallel stream number prediction. This new model extends our two previous models (Partial C-order and Full Second-order) to achieve higher accuracy and lower overhead predictions. Our new model, called Full C-order, outperforms both of our previous models as well as the three most relevant models by others (the Partial Second-order, Hacker et al., and Altman et al. models) in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. We test and compare these six models on emulated testbeds and on production environments using a wide variety of data set sizes, RTT, and bandwidth combinations. Our comprehensive experiments confirm the superiority of our new model to the other five models.", "paper_title": "A highly-accurate and low-overhead prediction model for transfer throughput optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000350395500004"}
