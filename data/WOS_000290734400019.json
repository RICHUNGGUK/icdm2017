The fuzzy ratio switching type-1 FCs (FC(FRST1)s) are designed to be a fuzzy combination of the possible-leftmost and possible-rightmost type-1 FCs. The fuzzy ratio switching type-1 fuzzy control technique is applied with the sliding control technique to realize the hybrid fuzzy ratio switching type-1 fuzzy sliding controllers (HFSC(FRST1)s) for the double-pendulum-and-cart system. The simulation results and comparisons with other approaches are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HFSC(FRST1)s.", "paper_title": "An Approximation of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Controllers Using Fuzzy Ratio Switching Type-1 Fuzzy Controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000290734400019"}
