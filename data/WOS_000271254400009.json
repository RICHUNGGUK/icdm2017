The purpose of this research is to look for the optimal experimental conditions We started by applying a supersaturated experimental design to screen for important factors among a list of 31 potentially influential factors in 18 experiments. Thus, we constructed a two-level supersaturated design as a half fraction of a 36-experiment Hadamard matrix and used it for this screening purpose. Multiple regression methods namely stepwise selection procedure. ridge regression and all-subset regressions were used to analyze the supersaturated design results according to a four step procedure. Results indicated that six factors, namely, molar ratio SO(3)/ester, amidation time, amide addition rate, alkali reagent, alkali concentration and amidation, temperature. were very influential factors. Three other factors were moderately influential. neutralization temperature. sodium methanoate amount, and methanol amount In future research. these factors will be further studied in order to perform robustness tests of the process.
