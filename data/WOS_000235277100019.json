It is a companion library of the R package 'ape', which provides additional functions for reading, plotting, manipulating phylogenetic trees and for connecting to public phylogenetic tree databases. One strength of the package is to include appropriate corrections of classical shape statistics as well as new tests based on the statistical theory of likelihood ratios.", "paper_title": "apTreeshape: statistical analysis of phylogenetic tree shape", "paper_id": "WOS:000235277100019"}
