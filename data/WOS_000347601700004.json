In distributed computing alone, PageRank vector, or more generally random walk based quantities have been used for several different applications ranging from determining important nodes, load balancing, search, and identifying connectivity structures. Surprisingly, however, there has been little work towards designing provably efficient fully-distributed algorithms for computing PageRank. The difficulty is that traditional matrix-vector multiplication style iterative methods may not always adapt well to the distributed setting owing to communication bandwidth restrictions and convergence rates. In this paper, we present fast random walk-based distributed algorithms for computing PageRanks in general graphs and prove strong bounds on the round complexity. We first present a distributed algorithm that takes O (log n/epsilon) rounds with high probability on any graph (directed or undirected), where n is the network size and E is the reset probability used in the PageRank computation (typically epsilon is a fixed constant). We then present a faster algorithm that takes O (root log n/epsilon) rounds in undirected graphs. Both of the above algorithms are scalable, as each node sends only small (polylog n) number of bits over each edge per round. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first fully distributed algorithms for computing PageRank vector with provably efficient running time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
