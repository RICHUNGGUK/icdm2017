In order to account for deep uncertainty surrounding future conditions, a new optimal scheduling approach is introduced in this paper, which consists of three stages. Firstly, a portfolio of diverse sequences that are optimal under a range of plausible future conditions is generated. Next, global sensitivity analysis is used to assess the robustness of these sequences and to determine the relative contribution of future uncertain variables to this robustness. Finally, an optimal sequence is selected for implementation. The approach is applied to the optimal sequencing of additional potential water supply sources, such as desalinated-, storm- and rain-water, for the southern Adelaide water supply system, over a 40 year planning horizon at 10-year intervals. The results indicate that the proposed approach is useful in identifying optimal sequences under deep uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
