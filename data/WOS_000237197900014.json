The synchronization time obtained by Jiang is O(Delta(3)) where Delta is the maximum communication delay between two cells. Mazoyer (Synchronization of a line of finite automata with non uniform delays, 1990, unpublished] proved an O(D-2) synchronization time where D is the sum of the communication delays of the degree <= k connected graph (together with an O(D log D) synchronization time in case the graph has only two cells). In this paper, we prove (cf. Theorem 23) that for any m >= 2 one can synchronize in time D [log, (D)] all lines of total communication delay > m(9) (shorter lines being synchronized in time 4D). A result which extends to bounded degree connected graphs using Rosensthiel's technique (P. Rosenstiehl, Existence d'automates capables de s'accorder bien qu'arbitrairement connectes et nombreux, Internat. Comput. Center Bull. 5 (1966) 245-261, P. Rosenstiehl, J.R. Fiksel, A. Holliger, Intelligent graphs: networks of finite automata capable of solving graph problems, in: R.C. Read (Ed.), Graph Theory and Computing, Academic Press, New York, 1972, pp. 219-265]. As shown by Vivien [Cellular Automata: A Geometrical Approach, to appear], this result is already optimal for lines of two cells with arbitrary communication delay. The method relies heavily on Jiang technique of circuit with revolving information. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
