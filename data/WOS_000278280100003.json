These systems allow the analysis of corporate data. As OLAP and data warehousing evolve, more and more complex data is being used. XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a flexible text format allowing the interchange and the representation of complex data. Finding an appropriate model for an XML data warehouse tends to become complicated as more and more solutions appear. Hence, in this survey paper we present an overview of the different proposals that use XML within data warehousing technology. These proposals range from using XML data sources for regular warehouses to those using full XML warehousing solutions. Some researches merely focus on document storage facilities while others present adaptations of XML technology for OLAP. Even though there are a growing number of researches on the subject, many issues still remain unsolved. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
