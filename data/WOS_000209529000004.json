Good load balancing makes cloud computing more efficient and improves user satisfaction. This article introduces a better load balance model for the public cloud based on the cloud partitioning concept with a switch mechanism to choose different strategies for different situations. The algorithm applies the game theory to the load balancing strategy to improve the efficiency in the public cloud environment.", "paper_title": "A Load Balancing Model Based on Cloud Partitioning for the Public Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000209529000004"}
