It is a modification of the original proxy cryptosystem introduced by Mambo et al: [8] in which a ciphertext transformation by the original decryptor is necessary, and also a modification of the delegated decryption system proposed by Mu et al. [10]. In both systems proposed in [8] and [10], the original decryptors have to trust their proxies completely. The AL-TFP system allows the proxy decryptor to do decryption directly without any ciphertext transformation from the original decryptor, so that it can release the original decryptor more efficiently from a large amount of decrypting operations. Moreover, the original decryptor's privacy can be protected efficiently because the authority of proxy decryptor is limited to his duty and valid period. An active identity-based and a directory-based AL-TFP systems from pairings are proposed. Furthermore, an application of directory-based AL-TFP system to electronic commerce is also described. The securities of our schemes introduced are based on the BDH assumption.", "paper_title": "Authorization-limited transformation-free proxy cryptosystems and their security analyses", "paper_id": "WOS:000234948500014"}
