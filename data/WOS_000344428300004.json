In this paper, we present an efficient background subtraction algorithm based on the fusion of multiple region-based classifiers that processes depth and color data provided by RGB-D cameras. Foreground objects are detected by combining a region-based foreground prediction (based on depth data) with different background models (based on a Mixture of Gaussian algorithm) providing color and depth descriptions of the scene at pixel and region level. The information given by these modules is fused in a mixture of experts fashion to improve the foreground detection accuracy. The main contributions of the paper are the region-based models of both background and foreground, built from the depth and color data. The obtained results using different database sequences demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to a higher detection accuracy with respect to existing state-of-the-art techniques.
