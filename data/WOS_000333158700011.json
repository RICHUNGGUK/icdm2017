By using the value function of the lower level program, we reformulate the bilevel program as a single level optimization problem with a nonsmooth inequality constraint and a convex set constraint. To deal with such a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem, we design a smoothing projected gradient algorithm for a general optimization problem with a nonsmooth inequality constraint and a convex set constraint. We show that, if the sequence of penalty parameters is bounded then any accumulation point is a stationary point of the nonsmooth optimization problem and, if the generated sequence is convergent and the extended Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification holds at the limit then the limit point is a stationary point of the nonsmooth optimization problem. We apply the smoothing projected gradient algorithm to the bilevel program if a calmness condition holds and to an approximate bilevel program otherwise. Preliminary numerical experiments show that the algorithm is efficient for solving the simple bilevel program.", "paper_title": "On solving simple bilevel programs with a nonconvex lower level program", "paper_id": "WOS:000333158700011"}
