The whole road network was regarded as a large-scale system, and the subsystems were the intersections. Multiphase intelligent signal controller that controlled its own traffic and cooperated with its neighbors was installed at each intersection. By exchanging information collected from its social vehicle detectors and the bus detection and location devices, and cooperating with adjacent signal controllers, social vehicle coordination and bus priority in the whole road network were realized. Bus priority module, green observation module, and phase switch module comprised the hard core of the controller. In each module, the fuzzy rule base system was designed in detail. To improve the control system's robusticity, the fuzzy relations of the three modules were implemented by one neural network. The target of this proposed method was to maximize the possibility for vehicles to depart from the upstream intersection, and the traveling bus nearby the local intersection to pass the local intersection without stoppage while the utility efficiency of the green signal time was at a relatively high level. The actual application shows that the proposed method can decrease the average vehicle delay and average travel time effectively.", "paper_title": "Study on Road Network Traffic Coordination Control Technique With Bus Priority", "paper_id": "WOS:000265437300007"}
