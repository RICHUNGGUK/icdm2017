In mobile wireless sensor networks, mobile nodes collect data and send data to a sink station. When the sink station employs directional antennas to send and receive data, its communication capability can increase. Using directional antennas implies the transmitters must know the direction or location of the receiver. It is necessary to predict a mobile receiver's movement to keep the transmitter's antenna pointing to the right direction. A mobility prediction algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is based on the knowledge extracted from real vehicles traces. The validation experiments indicate that the prediction accuracy rate of the algorithm is 96.5 % and the communication using directional antenna with movement prediction saves about 92.6 % energy consumption with a suitable beam-width and shakehand interval.", "paper_title": "Directional communication with movement prediction in mobile wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344812200014"}
