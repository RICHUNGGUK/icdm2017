We propose to improve the performance of a baseline Information Retrieval system by using a learning ranking algorithm which operates on scores computed from document elements and from their local structural context. This model is trained to optimize a Ranking Loss criterion using a training set of annotated examples composed of queries and relevance judgments on a subset of the document elements. The model can produce a ranked list of documents elements which fulfills a given information need expressed in the query. We analyze the performance of our algorithm on the INEX collection and compare it to a baseline model which is an adaptation of Okapi to Structured Information Retrieval.", "paper_title": "Machine learning ranking for structured information retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000238083200030"}
