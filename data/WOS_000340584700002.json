A taxonomy is proposed which integrates the most relevant LVQ approaches to date. The main concepts associated with modern LVQ approaches are defined. A comparison is made among eleven LVQ classifiers using one real-world and two artificial datasets.", "paper_title": "A review of learning vector quantization classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700002"}
