Our formulation uses the surface area of each child node to compute the TO. In this metric, we give a traversal priority to the child node with the larger surface area to quickly find occluders. Our algorithm reduces the pre-processing overhead significantly, and is much faster than other metrics. Overall, the SATO is useful for ray tracing large and complex dynamic scenes (e. g. a few million triangles) with shadows.", "paper_title": "SATO: Surface Area Traversal Order for Shadow Ray Tracing", "paper_id": "WOS:000342802200012"}
