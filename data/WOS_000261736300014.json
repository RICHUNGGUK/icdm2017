A modification of the Godin's algorithms is proposed. Considering attribute hierarchies, an algorithm are presented for computerized adaptive testing (CAT) with cognitive diagnosis (CD). Both of algorithms are studied experimentally, and the algorithm for CD-CAT is Studied theoretically. Algorithmic complexity of the algorithms for CD-CAT is Studied theoretically (time complexity is studied in the best case and the worst case). With eight attributes, the test results are generated for both algorithms. With 10 attributes, quadratic regression is given for CPU time for the algorithm of CD-CAT. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
