The paper considers how previous studies have modeled the role of policing in their specifications of inputs and output. In particular, the multiple-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique is presented and then applied to measure the relative efficiency of police-work-related data for eleven Police Directorates (PDs) in 2010 and also compared with the efficiency scores in 2005. The data obtained from the police databases is analyzed through the Frontier Analyst 4.0 and SPSS 19.0 statistical package software. The results show that the technical efficiency varies significantly across the police directorates and across the selected years, even when we allow for environmental factors and control for these non-discretionary inputs. Most police directorates in Slovenia could attain a higher output if they were fully efficient. Indeed, all of the inefficient police directorates can learn how to ensure a \"good\" performance from the efficient ones (i.e. the Maribor PD and the Novo mesto PD) by observing how they are processing their inputs and outputs. Finally, the empirical results of the paper are important indicators of the relative efficiency (or inefficiency) of police directorates that can serve as a guide to the General Police Directorate when further investigating how to enhance the performance efficiency of the various units.
