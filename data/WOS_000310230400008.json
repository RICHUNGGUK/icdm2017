Several tools are developed in order to enable university managers to define the value system according to which their university shall be compared to others. We apply this methodology to French universities and illustrate it using the reference classes of the best ranked universities according to several value systems.", "paper_title": "Reference classes: a tool for benchmarking universities' research", "paper_id": "WOS:000310230400008"}
