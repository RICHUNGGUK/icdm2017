This loose-coupled object interconnection demands improvements in the control and data planes for an optimum coordination between distributed services in mobile devices. There are several coordination challenges in these environments related to the interaction between services through communication channels, the support of node and link disconnections and the transmission of events at runtime. This paper defines a coordination model and proposes solutions to these challenges by developing a cooperative service execution model for mobile environments, integrating the publish/subscribe paradigm for communicating event messages and improving its performance by using a gossip-based solution. Subsequently, we evaluate this model and analyse the improvements of the designed optimisation mechanisms over the message queue telemetry transport protocol and the ns-3 network simulator.", "paper_title": "Resolving coordination challenges in distributed mobile service executions", "paper_id": "WOS:000334070200003"}
