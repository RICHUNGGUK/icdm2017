This tool is fed with descriptions of services provided by ubiquitous environments and web services. Its main goal is to assist service designers to create abstract specifications of the services for the Egoki adaptive system. Egoki automatically generates user interfaces adapted to the different needs and abilities of people with disabilities in order to provide access to services offered in ubiquitous environments. Therefore, SPA4USXML is intended to complement the Egoki system in order to provide a better user experience for disabled users and to enhance their autonomy and safety in their daily routines.", "paper_title": "A graphical tool to create user interface models for ubiquitous interaction satisfying accessibility requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000326299200006"}
