It has provision for different user priorities. In this letter, we present an analytical model to estimate the saturation throughput of this protocol considering a heterogeneous network comprised of multiple priorities of users. Numerical results are produced where the predictions from the model are validated by simulation.", "paper_title": "Saturation Throughput Analysis of IEEE 802.15.6 Slotted Aloha in Heterogeneous Conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681300005"}
