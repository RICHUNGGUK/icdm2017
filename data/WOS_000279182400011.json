Since human beings' eyes are highly sensitive to smooth images, changes in smooth cause great distortion and attract the attention of interceptors. Hence, this study proposes a data embedding scheme for embedding secret data into edge blocks and non-sufficiently smooth blocks. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme improves the quality of the stego-image and the embedding capacity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
