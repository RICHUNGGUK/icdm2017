In fact, it is a challenging issue for identity recognition solely by the lips. In the first stage of the proposed system, a fast box filtering is proposed to generate a noise-free source with high processing efficiency. Afterward, five various mouth corners are detected through the proposed system, in which it is also able to resist shadow, beard, and rotation problems. For the feature extraction, two geometric ratios and ten parabolic-related parameters are adopted for further recognition through the support vector machine. Experimental results demonstrate that, when the number of subjects is fewer or equal to 29, the correct accept rate (CAR) is greater than 98%, and the false accept rate (FAR) is smaller than 0.066% (CAR > 95.02%, FAR < 0.095%|# Subjects <= 57). Moreover, the processing speed of the overall system achieves 34.43 frames per second, which meets the real-time requirement. Thus, the proposed system can be an effective candidate for facial biometrics applications when other facial organs are covered or when it is applied for an access control system.", "paper_title": "Impact of the Lips for Biometrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000304159800016"}
