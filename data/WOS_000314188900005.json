It is thus effective to carry out incremental updating approximations by utilizing previous data structures. This paper focuses on a new incremental method for updating approximations of VPRS while objects in the information system dynamically alter. It discusses properties of information granulation and approximations under the dynamic environment while objects in the universe evolve over time. The variation of an attribute's domain is also considered to perform incremental updating for approximations under VPRS. Finally, an extensive experimental evaluation validates the efficiency of the proposed method for dynamic maintenance of VPRS approximations.", "paper_title": "A Rough-Set-Based Incremental Approach for Updating Approximations under Dynamic Maintenance Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000314188900005"}
