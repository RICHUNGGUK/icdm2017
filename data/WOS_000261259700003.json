While recovery by Basis Pursuit has recently been studied by several authors, we provide theoretical results on the success probability of reconstruction via Thresholding and OMP for both a continuous and a discrete probability model for the sampling points. We present numerical experiments, which indicate that usually Basis Pursuit is significantly slower than greedy algorithms, while the recovery rates are very similar.", "paper_title": "Random Sampling of Sparse Trigonometric Polynomials, II.
