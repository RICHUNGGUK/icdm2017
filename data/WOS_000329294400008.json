This paper proposes a differential memetic algorithm (DMA). To this end, first we propose a differential bidirectional random search as a local search algorithm. Then, a randomized blending crossover (RBleX) is proposed which aimed to scatter the new born offspring more diversely in the whole search space. We devise our proposed DMA, by using the RBleX crossover in the GA, and including the DBRS local search algorithm. A comparison of the performance of the DMA and those of seven other evolutionary/memetic or hybrid algorithms reported in two different papers on numerous bechmark functions demonstrates better performance of proposed DMA algorithm in most of the cases.", "paper_title": "A differential memetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000329294400008"}
