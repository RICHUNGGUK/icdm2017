Interest based negotiation allows negotiators to discuss the concerns behind the negotiation issues so that a mutually acceptable win-win solution is more likely to be reached. This paper, for the first time, proposes a computational model for interest based negotiation automation which enables the automation of the fundamental elements of negotiation. Based on the model, algorithms are designated to automate the fundamental elements with practical computational complexity. This model provides not only a theoretical foundation for software agent based negotiation automation, but also a practical approach.", "paper_title": "Interest based negotiation automation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400023"}
