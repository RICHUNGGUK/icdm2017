However, in normal DCF algorithm, a failed user increases its contention window (CW) exponentially, thus it reduces the success probability of exposed terminal nodes. That is, these problems will cause burst data transmissions frequently in a particular node which already was successful in packet transmission, because the probability of successful packet transmission rate would be increased. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose an efficient contention window control (ECWC) scheme to increase TCP performance in wireless multi-hop network. The proposed ECWC scheme is suggested to reduce the hidden and exposed terminal problems of wireless multi-hop network. That is, the proposed scheme increases the number of backoff retransmissions to increase the successful probability rate of MAC transmission, and fixes the contention window at a predetermined value.", "paper_title": "Performance improvement of TCP with an efficient contention window control mechanism (ECWC) in IEEE 802.11 based multi-hop wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240073200030"}
