However this is time-consuming and has large inter-observer error. To overcome these problems a software program (CDCOM) is available to automatically read CDMAM images and can be used to predict the threshold contrast for a typical observer. The results of threshold contrast determination by a panel of 3 human observers was compared in this study to predicted human readings for different types of digital mammography system to determine whether this provides a viable method of automated quality control and comparison with existing European Guidelines.", "paper_title": "Automated and human determination of threshold contrast for digital mammography systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900037"}
