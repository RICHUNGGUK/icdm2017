Its main degree of freedom is the choice of the noise shaping between low-pass and high-pass. Thanks to this reconfiguration parameter, the converter takes full advantage of both noise shapings and employs the most suited architecture depending on the received standard. Moreover, the low-pass/high-pass reconfiguration makes the analog-to-digital converter compliant for both the low-IF and the zero-IF receiver architectures. The paper also presents a novel reconfigurable dynamic element matching technique which efficiently addresses the digital to analog converter mismatch for both the high-pass and the low-pass delta sigma modulators. The sampling frequency and the quantizer number of bits are likewise adjustable. A GSM/UMTS compliant delta sigma analog to digital converter including reconfigurable decimator has been designed in a 1.2 V 65 nm CMOS process. The high-pass modulator is employed in a low-IF receiver for the GSM mode to profit from its robustness against offset and 1/f noise. For the UMTS mode, the low-pass modulator is employed in a zero-IF receiver because of its lower sensitivity to clock jitter.", "paper_title": "A reconfigurable low-pass/high-pass ADC suited for a zero-IF/low-IF receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000335157500006"}
