The piston and the electric contact are moving. Since the boundary is moving, it is difficult for the ordinary finite difference (FD) method or the finite element (FE) method to compute the solution. For the purpose of numerical simplicity and efficiency, we introduced an upwind meshfree scheme which is an excellent scheme for the time varying domain. Despite the low coding and computational cost, the numerical simulation is successfully conducted. Our method is even more efficient when considering a three-dimensional computation with a moving boundary. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
