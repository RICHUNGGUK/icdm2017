For this purpose Bornemann and Marz (J Math Imaging Vision, 28:259-278, 2007) introduced a very efficient method, called image inpainting based on coherence transport, that fills the missing region by advecting the image information along integral curves of a coherence vector field from the boundary toward the interior of the hole. The mathematical model behind this method is a first-order functional advection partial differential equation posed on a compact domain with all inflow boundaries. We show that this problem is well posed under certain conditions.", "paper_title": "A Well-Posedness Framework for Inpainting Based on Coherence Transport", "paper_id": "WOS:000358262500005"}
