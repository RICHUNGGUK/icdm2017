The compensator adaptively compensates for interconnections between subsystems as well as mismatched errors, while the H-infinity controller suppresses the effect of external disturbances. Based upon the combination of fuzzy inference systems, a state observer, H-infinity tracking technique and the strictly positive real condition, the proposed overall observer-based decentralised algorithm guarantees not only asymptotical tracking of reference trajectories but also an arbitrary small attenuation level of the unmodelled error dynamics including the disturbances on the tracking control. Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Decentralised indirect adaptive output feedback fuzzy H-infinity tracking design for a class of large-scale nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000296974800017"}
