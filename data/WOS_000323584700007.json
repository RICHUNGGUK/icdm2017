However, existing studies of query-based HIE system usage have addressed a limited number of settings. Our goal was to quantify the breadth and depth of usage of a query-based HIE system implemented across multiple communities with diverse care settings and patient populations. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study in three communities in New York State using system access log files from January 2009 to May 2011 to measure usage patterns of a query-based HIE web portal system with respect to practice sites, users, patients, and data. Results: System access occurred from 60% (n=200) of practice sites registered to use the system in Community A, 59% (n=156) in Community B, and 82% (n=28) in Community C. In Communities A and B, users were primarily non-clinical staff in outpatient settings, while in Community C inpatient physicians were the main users. Across communities, proportions of patients whose data were accessed varied with 5% (n=11,263) in Community A, 60% (n=212,586) in Community B, and 1% (n=1107) in Community C. In Community B, users updated patient consent through the HIE portal, whereas in the other communities, users updated patient consent through a separate system. Across communities, users most frequently accessed only patient summary data displayed by default followed by detailed laboratory and radiology data. Conclusions: This study is among the first to illustrate large-scale usage of a query-based HIE system implemented across multiple communities. Patient summary data displayed by default may be an important feature of query-based HIE systems. User role, practice site type, and patient consent workflow may affect patterns of query-based HIE web portal system usage in the communities studied and elsewhere. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
