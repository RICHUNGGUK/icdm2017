The purpose of this paper is to enhance our collective understanding of the factors affecting knowledge sharing behaviors of knowledge workers in the organizational context. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing from multiple streams of research including social psychology, organizational learning, knowledge management, information systems and so forth, this research developed an integrated theoretical model. The Theory of Planned Behavior model, motivation theory, social exchange theory, economic exchange theory and self determination theory were employed here. In total, 180 responses from ten companies in China were collected. Findings - The theoretical model was validated within the context of a single empirical study. The findings provided significant statistical support for the research model, accounting for about 60 percent of the variance in the behavioral intention to share knowledge and 41 percent variance in the actual knowledge sharing behavior. In total, 11 of the 12 hypothesized relationships were supported. Originality/value - This exploratory research attempted to fill the void in the integrative research by investigating the most crucial factors that influence the knowledge sharing behaviors of knowledge workers.", "paper_title": "An integrated theoretical model for determinants of knowledge sharing behaviours (Retracted article.
