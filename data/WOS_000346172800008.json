The main idea proposed in this work is the sequential tuning of parameters for an increasingly more complex strategy in order to sequentially accomplish more complex tasks: upright stable flight, straight vertical flight, and stable hovering with altitude and position control. Each term of the resulting multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) controller has a physical intuitive meaning and the control structure is relatively simple such that it could potentially be applied to other kinds of flapping-wing robots.", "paper_title": "Model-Free Control of a Hovering Flapping-Wing Microrobot The Design Process of a Stabilizing Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output Controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000346172800008"}
