The method is based on: (1) multipoint approximations of the objective and constraint functions, (2) a multiquadric radial basis function (RBF) for the zeroth-order function approximation and a new RBF plus polynomial-based moving least-squares approximation for the first-order enhanced function approximation, and (3) a pattern search algorithm to impose a descent condition and applied adaptive subregion management strategy. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method for both function approximation and design optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method, it is applied to obtain optimum designs of a microelectronic packaging system. A two-stage optimization approach is proposed for the design optimization. The material properties of microelectronic packaging system and the shape parameters of solder ball are selected as design variables. Through design optimization, significant improvements of durability performances are obtained using the proposed hybrid optimization method.", "paper_title": "A hybrid surrogate and pattern search optimization method and application to microelectronics", "paper_id": "WOS:000239957600006"}
