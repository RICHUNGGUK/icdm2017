The matrix involved is large and cannot be factored, and hence techniques based on matrix-vector products must be applied. A variant of the restarted refined Arnoldi method is proposed, which does not involve Ritz value computations. Numerical examples illustrate the performance and convergence behavior of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "An Arnoldi-type algorithm for computing page rank", "paper_id": "WOS:000242498500005"}
