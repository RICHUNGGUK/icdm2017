Component architecture for the design of engineering systems (CADES) framework, previously described, is presented here with extended features. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is subject to further usage for optimization of AD (also named algorithmic differentiation) which is a powerful technique that computes derivatives of functions described as computer programs in a programming language like C/C++, FORTRAN. Findings - Indeed, analytical modeling is well suited regarding optimization procedure, but the modeling of complex devices needs sometimes numerical formulations. This paper then reviews the concepts implemented in CA-DES which aim to manage the interactions of analytical and numerical modeling inside of gradient-based optimization procedure. Finally, the paper shows that AD has no limit for the input program complexity, or gradients accuracy, in the context of constrained optimization of an electromagnetic actuator. Originality/value - AD is employed for a large and complex numerical code computing multidimensional integrals of functions. Thus, the paper intends to prove the AD capabilities in the context of electromagnetic device sizing by means of gradient optimization. The code complexity as also as the implications of AD usage may stand as a good reference for the researchers in this field area.", "paper_title": "Automatic differentiation for electromagnetic models used in optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000270210500020"}
