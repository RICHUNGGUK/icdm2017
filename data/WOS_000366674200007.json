This paper proposes a fuzzy rule-based classification algorithm based on a quantum ant optimization algorithm. A method of generating the hierarchical rules with different granularity hybridization is used to generate the initial rule set. This method can obtain an original rule set with a smaller number of rules. The modified quantum ant optimization algorithm is used to generate the optimal individual. Compared to other similar algorithms, the algorithm proposed in this paper demonstrates higher classification accuracy and a higher convergence rate. The algorithm is proved to be convergent on theory. Some experiments have been conducted on the algorithm, and the results proved that the algorithm is feasible.", "paper_title": "Rule-based fuzzy classifier based on quantum ant optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200007"}
