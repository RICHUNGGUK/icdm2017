Most algorithmic approaches to this problem share a common preprocessing step, in which the input graph is reduced to a tree by repeatedly contracting its cycles. Although this reduction is valid from an algorithmic perspective, the assignment of directions to the edges of the contracted cycles becomes arbitrary and, consequently, the connecting source-target paths may be arbitrarily long. In the context of biological networks, the connection of vertex pairs via shortest paths is highly motivated, leading to the following variant: Given an undirected graph and a collection of source-target vertex pairs, assign directions to the edges so as to maximize the number of pairs that are connected by a shortest (in the original graph) directed path. Here we study this variant, provide strong inapproximability results for it, and propose approximation algorithms for the problem, as well as for relaxations where the connecting paths need only be approximately shortest.", "paper_title": "The Approximability of Shortest Path-Based Graph Orientations of Protein-Protein Interaction Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327218500001"}
