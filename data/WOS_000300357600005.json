This involves a simultaneous multi-channel measurement of a time interval with low complexity TDC of varying low resolutions. The coarse outputs of each converter are digitally post-processed to obtain an output whose precision is much better than that of the individual converters. Three post-processing algorithms are proposed and their limitations in presence of converter non-idealities are analyzed. A prototype system with 8 channels is implemented in 90 nm CMOS. 40MS/s output of each channel is algorithmically combined to obtain over 2.2-3X measured improvement in the resolution in 4/6/8 channel modes, validating the system principle. The chip occupies 0.3 mm(2) and draws up to a maximum of 4 mA from a 1.2 V supply.", "paper_title": "Spatially oversampled TDC with digital resolution enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000300357600005"}
