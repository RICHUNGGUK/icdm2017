A detailed description of the wideband low noise amplifier, the mixer, the synthesizer and the ADC, which are the most challenging components of a receiver, are carried out. Requirements relative to frequency range, sensitivity, noise figure, linearity, phase noise gain and dynamic range are discussed. The LNA uses a cascode configuration, combining a resistive loaded LNA with a conventional resistive Shunt-feedback, in order to achieve a low power, low noise and wide bandwidth. The mixer uses a classical Gilbert cell configuration. The VCO employs techniques like emitter degeneration, capacitor divider, and optimum bias for minimum noise to improve phase noise requirements and oscillation amplitude. There are two ADC structures, one of which is a delta sigma ADC. The blocks are implemented in a AMS 0.35 mu m BiCMOS process.", "paper_title": "RF and mixed signal circuits for a DVB-H receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000282012800001"}
