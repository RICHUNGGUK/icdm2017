Different cultural characteristics of users of computing systems become significant issues. Studies on cultural differences from various perspectives such as cultural dimensions, presentation, and cognition provide useful information. However, we have not yet succeeded in making computing systems into a very usable environment supporting users with different cultural backgrounds. This paper provides an overview and a comprehensive appraisal of past literatures for cross-cultural effects on computing systems. Cultural dimensions in Hofstede's cultural model and Hall's cultural model are introduced. Then the cross-cultural effects on human-computer interaction are discussed from three perspectives: perceptual, cognitive, and affective, respectively. Finally, cross-cultural challenges in new technologies are discussed in order to throw light onto the future of computing.", "paper_title": "Good computing systems for everyone - how on earth?
