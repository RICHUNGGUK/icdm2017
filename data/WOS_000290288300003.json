One way of achieving successful alignment is the development of an IT system which meets business expectations. This is only possible if IT analysts take the organizational environment into account prior to implementing the system. This paper presents an organizational goal-oriented requirements elicitation approach which will allow the IT department to better understand the business goals of the organization to enable them to develop an IT system which will meet business expectations. It also describes what kind of goal modelling and human input is required in order to implement the \"automatic modelling IT infrastructure\" methodology. A process of order management in an automobile company has been used as a case study to validate the approach.", "paper_title": "MODELING BUSINESS GOAL FOR BUSINESS/IT ALIGNMENT USING REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000290288300003"}
