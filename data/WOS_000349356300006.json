They have been recently investigated for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. This is a normal \"knowledge diffusion\" process, when methodologies developed for multimedia mining penetrate a new application area. The latter brings its own specificities requiring an adjustment of methodologies on the basis of domain knowledge. In this paper, we develop an automatic classification framework for AD recognition in structural Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). The main contribution of this work consists in considering visual features from the most involved region in AD (hippocampal area) and in using a late fusion to increase precision results. Our approach has been first evaluated on the baseline MR images of 218 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and then tested on a 3T weighted contrast MRI obtained from a subsample of a large French epidemiological study: \"Bordeaux dataset\". The experimental results show that our classification of patients with AD versus NC (Normal Control) subjects achieves the accuracies of 87 % and 85 % for ADNI subset and \"Bordeaux dataset\" respectively. For the most challenging group of subjects with the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), we reach accuracies of 78.22 % and 72.23 % for MCI versus NC and MCI versus AD respectively on ADNI. The late fusion scheme improves classification results by 9 % in average for these three categories. Results demonstrate very promising classification performance and simplicity compared to the state-of-the-art volumetric AD diagnosis methods.", "paper_title": "Classification of Alzheimer's disease subjects from MRI using hippocampal visual features", "paper_id": "WOS:000349356300006"}
