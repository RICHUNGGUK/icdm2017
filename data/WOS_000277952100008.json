Much research has been presented to model and evaluate context information-inherent aspect of QoC by quantifying QoC-parameters. However, only a few context processing infrastructures support QoC control and management. Moreover, when these quality models are deployed into a complex environment, the performance penalty on QoC evolution, context reasoning and inconsistency checking will render most of the presented infrastructures untenable. Furthermore, in a complex world, different applications of the same scenario usually have different criterions for the same context; and context trustworthiness will alter when the environment shifts. Nevertheless, these influences are not mentioned or not well considered on presented QoC models since it is more relevant to QoC management infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a distributed and loosely coupled infrastructure for context processing and QoC management. In this infrastructure, Context processing is separated into several stages that can be performed in parallel by pipelining on different services. These services are designed to cooperate as a flexible and scalable network of distributed machines. In addition, a novel context quality model based on Web Ontology Language Description Logics (OWL-DL), which supports application and situation related QoC evaluation is suggested. Finally, we measure the performance of our prototype by several simulated experiments, and demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through a storeroom scenario and a case study of a context file system application with the help of a Pioneer III-AT mobile robot and a FUSE-based Context file system.", "paper_title": "A context quality management infrastructure for complex ubiquitous environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000277952100008"}
