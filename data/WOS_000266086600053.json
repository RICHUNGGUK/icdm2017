This investigation explores the challenges of multi-class text categorization using one-against-one fuzzy support vector machine with Reuter's news as the example data. The performances of four different membership functions on one-against-one fuzzy support vector machine are measured using the macro-average performance indices. Analytical results indicate that the proposed method achieves a comparable or better performance than the one-against-one support vector machine. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
