AND anti-collusion codes can be used to construct fingerprints resistant to collusion attacks on multimedia contents. In this paper, we first investigate AND anti-collusion codes and related detection algorithms from a combinatorial viewpoint, and then introduce a new concept of logical anti-collusion code to improve the traceability of multimedia fingerprinting. It reveals that frameproof codes have traceability for multimedia contents. Relationships among anti-collusion codes and other structures related to fingerprinting are discussed, and constructions for both AND anti-collusion codes and logical anti-collusion codes are provided.", "paper_title": "On Anti-Collusion Codes and Detection Algorithms for Multimedia Fingerprinting", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500061"}
