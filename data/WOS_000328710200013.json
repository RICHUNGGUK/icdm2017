Assume that the models of following agents in the considered systems are unknown, and the state of the leader agent is not completely measurable for each follower. By employing Lyapunov approach, a dynamic neural network is established to approximate the systems of the following agents. Based on the dynamic neural network, a state feedback control law is designed guaranteeing the following agents can asymptotically track the reference generated by an exosystem. The exosystem is regarded as the active leaders in the multi-agent systems. A numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
