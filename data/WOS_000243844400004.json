The model is a free boundary problem of a system of partial differential equations. It contains one nonlinear first-order equation describing the distribution of live tumor cells, and two nonlinear reaction diffusion equations describing the evolution of nutrient concentration and drug concentration, respectively. By using the method of characteristics for first-order equations, the LP-theory for parabolic equations, the Banach fixed point theorem and the extension method, we prove that this problem has a unique global solution.
