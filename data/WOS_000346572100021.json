Existing research on such novel circuits focuses mainly on the integration between CMOS and non-CMOS, fabrication techniques, and reliability improvement. However, research on (manufacturing) test for yield and quality improvement is still in its infancy stage. This paper presents fault analysis and modeling for open defects based on electrical simulation, introduces fault models, and proposes test approaches for RRAMs. The fault analysis reveals that unique faults occur in addition to some conventional memory faults, and the detection of such unique faults cannot be guaranteed with just the application of traditional march tests. The paper also presents a new Design-for-Testability (DfT) concept to facilitate the detection of the unique faults. Two DfT schemes are developed by exploiting the access time duration and supply voltage level of the RRAM cells, and their simulation results show that the fault coverage can be increased with minor circuit modification. As the fault behavior may vary due to process variations, the DfT schemes are extended to be programmable to track the changes and further improve the fault/defect coverage.", "paper_title": "Testing Open Defects in Memristor-Based Memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000346572100021"}
