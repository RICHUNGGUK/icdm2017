We argue that two stage (say linear) stochastic programming problems can be solved with a reasonable accuracy by Monte Carlo sampling techniques while there are indications that complexity of multistage programs grows fast with increase of the number of stages. We discuss an extension of coherent risk measures to a multistage setting and, in particular, dynamic programming equations for such problems.", "paper_title": "Stochastic programming approach to optimization under uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000248189900008"}
