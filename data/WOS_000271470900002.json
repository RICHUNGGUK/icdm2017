We study also infinite words satisfying a stronger property P epsilon : every palindrome of u has exactly one palindromic extension in u. For binary words, the properties P and P epsilon coincide and these properties characterize Sturmian words, i.e., words with the complexity C(n) = n + 1 for any n is an element of N. In this paper, we focus on ternary infinite words with the language closed under reversal. For such words u, we prove that if C(n) = 2n + 1 for any n is an element of N, then u satisfies the property P and moreover u is rich in palindromes. Also a sufficient condition for the property P epsilon is given. We construct a word demonstrating that P on a ternary alphabet does not imply P epsilon.", "paper_title": "PALINDROMES IN INFINITE TERNARY WORDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271470900002"}
