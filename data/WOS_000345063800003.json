I apply an evolutionary-historical analysis, a variation of historical analysis, to the emergence of humans' major information processing capabilities to trace the development of information systems to establish the propositions. I identify some research questions directly arising from the three propositions and advance a case that these propositions are potentially a sufficient conceptual foundation for IS research.", "paper_title": "A Personal Perspective on a Conceptual Foundation for Information Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000345063800003"}
