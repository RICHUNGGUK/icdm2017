Let P be a path such that vertical bar R vertical bar vertices of P are red and vertical bar B vertical bar vertices of P are blue. We study the problem of computing a crossing-free drawing of P such that each blue vertex is represented as a point of B and each red vertex of P is represented as a point of R. We show that such a drawing can always be realized by using at most one bend per edge.", "paper_title": "How to embed a path onto two sets of points", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300011"}
