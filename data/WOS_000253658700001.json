However these studies did not consider moderating variables. We investigated four potential moderating variables - perceived risk, technology type, user experience, and gender - in users' technology adoption. Their moderating effects were tested in an empirical study of 161 subjects. Results showed that perceived risk, technology type, and gender were significant moderating variables. However the effects of user experience were marginal after the variance of errors was removed.
