Traditional bit-plane coding in FGS algorithm suffers from poor coding efficiency and subjective quality. To improve coding efficiency, our CABIC constructs context models based on both the energy distribution in a block and the spatial correlations in the adjacent blocks. Moreover, it exploits the context across bit-planes to save side information. To improve subjective quality, our SBR reorders the coefficient bits by their estimated rate-distortion performance. Particularly, we model transform coefficients with Laplacian distributions and incorporate them into the context probability models for content-aware parameter estimation. Moreover, our SBR is implemented with a dynamic priority management that uses a low-complexity dynamic memory organization. Experimental results show that our CABIC improves the PSNR by 0.5 similar to 1.0 dB at medium and high bit rates. While maintaining similar or even higher coding efficiency, our SBR improves the subjective quality.", "paper_title": "A context adaptive bit-plane coder with maximum-likelihood-based stochastic bit-reshuffling technique for scalable video coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000239420300002"}
