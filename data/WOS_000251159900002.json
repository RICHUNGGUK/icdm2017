This paper describes the problem, its subtleties, and challenges, and outlines a computerized approach to solving it. With the newly developed methods, it is now possible to produce fully labeled maps and charts with a quality that approaches that achievable only by an expert cartographer and to do so in tiny fraction of the time required when done manually.
