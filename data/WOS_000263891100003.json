We answer the open question concerning the maximum number of distinct elements permissible in an order n MHM by proving the existence of an order n MHM with n elements of distinct absolute value for all n. We also define multidimensional MHMs and prove an analogous existence result.", "paper_title": "Multilevel and multidimensional Hadamard matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000263891100003"}
