When recognition is exemplar-based, feature correspondence is one-to-one. However, segmentation errors, articulation, scale difference, and within-class deformation can yield image and model features which don't match one-to-one but rather many-to-many. Adopting a graph-based representation of a set of features, we present a matching algorithm that establishes many-to-many correspondences between the nodes of two noisy, vertex-labeled weighted graphs. Our approach reduces the problem of many-to-many matching of weighted graphs to that of many-to-many matching of weighted point sets in a normed vector space. This is accomplished by embedding the initial weighted graphs into a normed vector space with low distortion using a novel embedding technique based on a spherical encoding of graph structure. Many-to-many vector correspondences established by the Earth Mover's Distance framework are mapped back into many-to-many correspondences between graph nodes. Empirical evaluation of the algorithm on an extensive set of recognition trials, including a comparison with two competing graph matching approaches, demonstrates both the robustness and efficacy of the overall approach.", "paper_title": "Object recognition as many-to-many feature matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000239162400003"}
