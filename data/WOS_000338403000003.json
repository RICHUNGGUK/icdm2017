In this paper we describe the design of an adaptable decision support system and its integration with a wireless sensor/actuator network (WSAN) to implement autonomous closed-loop zone-specific irrigation. Using an ontology for defining the application logic emphasizes system flexibility and adaptability and supports the application of automatic inferential and validation mechanisms. Furthermore, a machine learning process has been applied for inducing new rules by analyzing logged datasets for extracting new knowledge and extending the system ontology in order to cope, for example, with a sensor type failure or to improve the accuracy of a plant state diagnosis. A deployment of the system is presented for zone specific irrigation control in a greenhouse setting. Evaluation of the developed system was performed in terms of derivation of new rules by the machine learning process, WSN performance and mote lifetime. The effectiveness of the developed system was validated by comparing its agronomic performance to traditional agricultural practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
