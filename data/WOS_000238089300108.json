In contrast to the existing work in the area, it offers much fast speed through efficient computations. By applying the method to a wide variety of texture samples, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the method through the results and discussions. In addition, we have also applied this texture synthesis method to cube mapping for the fast viewing of surfaces decorated by textures.", "paper_title": "Texture synthesis using incremental patches", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300108"}
