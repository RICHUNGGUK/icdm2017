By introducing the extended links to mimic the weak interactions between the nodes in different local-worlds, the model yields scale-free behavior as well as the small-world property, as confirmed in many real networks. With the increase of the local information, the generated network undergoes a transition from assortative to disassortative, meanwhile the small-world property is preserved. It indicates that the small-world property is a universal characteristic in our model. The numerical simulation results are in good agreement with the analytical expressions.", "paper_title": "DYNAMICS BEHAVIORS OF WEIGHTED LOCAL-WORLD EVOLVING NETWORKS WITH EXTENDED LINKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272468000003"}
