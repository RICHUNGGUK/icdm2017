Therefore we define an even smaller fragment D*-Horn and show that over finite successor structures it captures the complexity class P of all sets decidable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we show that the open D*-Horn-formulae correspond to the negative fragment of SO there exists-Horn.", "paper_title": "A FRAGMENT OF DEPENDENCE LOGIC CAPTURING POLYNOMIAL TIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000347714800004"}
