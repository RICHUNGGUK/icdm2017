However, most existing work mainly focuses on the static sleep scheduling, which cannot guarantee the desired delay when the network conditions change dynamically. In many applications with user-specified end-to-end delay requirements, the duty cycle of every node should be tuned individually at runtime based on the network conditions to achieve the desired end-to-end delay guarantees and energy efficiency. In this article, we propose DutyCon, a control theory-based dynamic duty-cycle control approach. DutyCon decomposes the end-to-end delay guarantee problem into a set of single-hop delay guarantee problems along each data flow in the network. We then formulate the single-hop delay guarantee problem as a dynamic feedback control problem and design the controller rigorously, based on feedback control theory, for analytic assurance of control accuracy and system stability. DutyCon also features a queuing delay adaptation scheme that adapts the duty cycle of each node to unpredictable incoming packet rates, as well as a novel energy-balancing approach that extends the network lifetime by dynamically adjusting the delay requirement allocated to each hop. Our empirical results on a hardware testbed demonstrate that DutyCon can effectively achieve the desired trade-off between end-to-end delay and energy conservation. Extensive simulation results also show that DutyCon outperforms two baseline sleep scheduling protocols by having more energy savings while meeting the end-to-end delay requirements.", "paper_title": "DutyCon: A Dynamic Duty-Cycle Control Approach to End-to-End Delay Guarantees in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322740200006"}
