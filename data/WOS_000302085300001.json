As the feature size keeps shrinking, this effect becomes a key reliability concern. Hence, in this paper, we focus on wiring topology generation for avoiding EM at the routing stage. Prior works tended towards heuristics; on the contrary, we first claim this problem belongs to class P instead of class NP-hard. Our breakthrough is, via the proof of the greedy-choice property, we successfully model this problem on a multi-source multi-sink flow network and then solve it by a strongly polynomial time algorithm. Experimental results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "WiT: Optimal Wiring Topology for Electromigration Avoidance", "paper_id": "WOS:000302085300001"}
