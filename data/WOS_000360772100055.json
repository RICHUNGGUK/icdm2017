The system is served by a hoist for transporting jobs among machines. Jobs to be processed randomly arrive at the input station. When new jobs come, the system should be rescheduled so as to minimize the makespan. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is developed to generate an optimal reschedule, which improves an existing model in the literature from several dimensions. The proposed model is solved by commercial software CPLEX. Computational results are reported to evaluate the proposed MIP model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
