However, it may cause P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) in people with immune deficiency, affecting mainly premature babies, cancer patients and transplant recipients, and people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In the latter group, PCP occurs in approximately 80% of patients, a major cause of death. Currently, there are many available therapies to treat PCP patients, including P. carinii dihydrofolate reductase (PcDHFR) inhibitors, such as trimetrexate (TMX), piritrexim (PTX), trimethoprim (TMP), and pyrimethamine (PMT). Nevertheless, the high percentage of adverse side effects and the limited therapeutic success of the current drug therapy justify the search for new drugs rationally planned against PCP. This work focuses on the study of pyrimidine inhibitors of PcDHFR, using both CoMFA and CoMSIA 3D-QSAR methods.", "paper_title": "CoMFA/CoMSIA 3D-QSAR of pyrimidine inhibitors of Pneumocystis carinii dihydrofolate reductase", "paper_id": "WOS:000308114000007"}
