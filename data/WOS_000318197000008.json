The former is the most classic model for mobile processes and the latter is well known for its nested structure. However, the relationship between these two models deserves further investigation. In this paper, we reinvestigate this problem thoroughly. We first give the strengthened encoding criteria. Then we propose the encoding of the synchronous pi-calculus into the safe ambients calculus. The encoding scheme is a generalization and improvement of Levi and Sangiorgi's work when moving from the asynchronous pi-calculus to the synchronous pi-calculus. We show the merits of the encoding by checking the mentioned criteria.", "paper_title": "How faithfully can pi be interpreted in SA?", "paper_id": "WOS:000318197000008"}
