The approximations are based on scaling a single server M/GI/1 + GI queue. For problems involving deterministic and exponential abandon times distributions, we suggest a practical way to compute the waiting time distributions and their moments using the Laplace transform of the workload density function. Our first contribution is numerically computing the workload density function in the M/GI/1 + GI queue when the abandon times follow general distributions different from the deterministic and exponential distributions. Then we compute the waiting time distributions and their moments. Next, we scale-up the M/GI/1 + GI queue giving rise to our approximations to capture the behavior of the multi-server system. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to test the speed and performance of the approximations, which prove the accuracy of their predictions.", "paper_title": "Approximations for the M/GI/N plus GI type call center", "paper_id": "WOS:000254303100004"}
