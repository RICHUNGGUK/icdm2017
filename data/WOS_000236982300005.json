In this paper, we tackle the problem by mining the decisive feature patterns (DFPs). Intuitively, a decisive feature pattern is a combination of low-level feature values that are unique and significant for describing a semantic concept. Interesting algorithms are developed to mine the decisive feature patterns and construct a rule base to automatically recognize semantic concepts in images. A systematic performance study on large image databases containing many semantic concepts shows that our method is more effective than some previously proposed methods. Importantly, our method can be generally applied to any domain of semantic concepts and low-level features.", "paper_title": "Extracting semantic concepts from images: a decisive feature pattern mining approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000236982300005"}
