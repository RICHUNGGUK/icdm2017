Tanaka and K. Asai in their 1973 article 121 which was published in English in 1974 131. These two researchers developed many fundamental theories and methods including novel concepts of fuzzy operations research 141 with their collaborators. They went beyond the original proposal for fuzzy optimization set forth by Bellman/Zadeh. They are important founders of fuzzy optimization. This paper gives an overview of their great contributions to fuzzy optimization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Foundational contributions of K. Asai and H.
