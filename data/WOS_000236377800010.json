Given the context of human-computer interaction, and a commitment to the model of design space exploration, we identify two axes that help position efforts to realize this model: the spectrum of strengths and needs that stretches from the machine to the human, and the time scale of events in design. Considering a section of each reveals a landscape that prefers certain activities and gives rise to particular emphases. This paper places the other authors in this Special Issue upon this map, and argues the value of typed feature structures and information orderings to the endeavor of realizing design space explorers.", "paper_title": "A typology of design space explorers", "paper_id": "WOS:000236377800010"}
