This paper reviews basic models and results in the field of opinion dynamics, focusing on the starting points and the modeling principles. The influence of network structure on the dynamical result is discussed. The comparison of models and results with empirical data on the Internet is emphasized. By employing the particularities of the Internet, we propose several future research issues in the area.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Opinion Dynamics on the Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000285732400014"}
