Current discovery solutions were developed in the context of automatic service composition. Thus, the \"client\" of the discovery procedure is an automated computer program rather than a human, with little, if any, tolerance to inexact results. However, in the real world, services which might be semantically distanced from each other are glued together using manual coding. In this article, we propose a new retrieval model for semantic Web services, with the objective of simplifying service discovery for human users. The model relies on simple and extensible keyword-based query language and enables efficient retrieval of approximate results, including approximate service compositions. Since representing all possible compositions and all approximate concept references can result in an exponentially-sized index, we investigate clustering methods to provide a scalable mechanism for service indexing. Results of experiments, designed to evaluate our indexing and query methods, show that satisfactory approximate search is feasible with efficient processing time.", "paper_title": "A semantic approach to approximate service retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000255557600002"}
