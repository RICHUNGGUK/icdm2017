Design/methodology/approach - The Von-Karman's equilibrium equation is solved exactly to obtain the buckling loads and deflection modes for the struts. The investigation is then extended to an initial post-buckling study with the assumption that the deflected form immediately after the buckling is the same as that obtained for the buckling. Through the solution of the Von-Karman's compatibility equation, the in-plane displacement functions are developed in terms of the unknown coefficient. These in-plane and out-of-plane deflected functions are then substituted in the total strain energy expressions and the theorem of minimum total potential energy is applied to solve for the unknown coefficient. Findings - The F-a FSM is applied to analyze the buckling and initial post-buckling behavior of some representative box sections for which the results were also obtained through the application of a semi-energy finite strip method (S-e FSM). For a given degree of accuracy in the results, however, the F-a FSM analysis requires less computational effort. Research limitations/implications - In the present F-a FSM, only one of the calculated deflection modes is used for the initial post-buckling study Practical implications - A very useful and computationally economical methodology is developed for the initial design of struts which encounter post-buckling. Originality/value - The originality of the paper is the fact that by incorporating a rigorous buckling solution into the Von-Karman's compatibility equation, and solving it, a fairly efficient method for post-buckling stiffness calculation is achieved.", "paper_title": "Exact post-buckling stiffness calculation of box section struts", "paper_id": "WOS:000272105500008"}
