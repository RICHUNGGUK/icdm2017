When migrating to modern languages, the data model must adhere to strict structuring rules. such as those associated with an object oriented data model, supporting classes, class attributes and inter-class relationships. In this paper, we deal with the problem of automatically transforming a data model which lacks structure and relies on the explicit layout of variables in memory as defined by programmers. We introduce an abstract syntax and a set of abstract rewrite rules to describe the proposed approach in a language neutral formalism. Then, we instantiate the approach for the proprietary programming language that was used to develop a large legacy system we are migrating to Java. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
