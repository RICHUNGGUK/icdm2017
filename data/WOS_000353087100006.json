The risk evaluation of CHD is a widely used method for preventing the disease in ubiquitous healthcare and helping diagnosing in clinical reception. However, the traditional risk evaluation methods are neither accurate nor dynamic because they stick to the statistical data and neglect the important temporal effects of the vital signs. This paper proposes a new linear time-invariant model-based CHD evaluation method, which allows evaluating the CHD development dynamically over the whole lifetime. Currently identified model can give the dynamic evaluation of 43-77 years with about 5% errors in comparison with the clinical gold standard, the SYNTAX score. In addition, the model also gives a quantitative weight to each risk factor, which is also helpful for risk control in both clinics and ubiquitous healthcare. Current application of this approach in clinics has proved its efficiency in the pre-diagnosing and post-clinical ubiquitous health management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
