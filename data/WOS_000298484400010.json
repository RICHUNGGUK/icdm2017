Output tracking control can find many applications in industry. In order to reduce the conservativeness and achieve better performance, the designed state feedback controller is dependent on available sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator delays. Then, the formulated closed-loop system is a special jump linear system governed by interdependent parameters of Markov chains and the condition for stochastic stability is proposed. By generalization of the H-2 norm definition, new relation of the H-2 norm for the special system is derived in terms of state space form. The condition of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with nonconvex constraints is given to solve the H-2 output tracking control problem. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.
