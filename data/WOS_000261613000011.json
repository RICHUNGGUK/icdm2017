DLA supports intuitive adaptation to physically different agents and simple expansion of their capacities via addition of new modules. DLA works by combining the responses of different deliberative and reactive algorithms through the interaction of freely distributed processes in an asynchronous way. This architecture provides transparency to the user through a high simplicity and portability.", "paper_title": "Distributed intelligent navigation architecture for robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000261613000011"}
