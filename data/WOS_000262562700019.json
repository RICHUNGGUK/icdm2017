The algorithm is intrinsically robust, since it does not require any internal geometrical representation or self-localization capabilities. Experimental results, performed with both simulated and real robots, validate the proposed theoretical approach.", "paper_title": "Robust Navigation in an Unknown Environment With Minimal Sensing and Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000262562700019"}
