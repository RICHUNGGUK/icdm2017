The implication of this sequential strategy may result in design of processing systems which are very hard to control. This paper presents a discussion on drivers for an integrated approach and outlines the challenges in formulation of such a multi-objective synthesis problem. This discussion is viewed in relation to some of the changing trends in the industry. Significant results have been published which in different ways seek to handle the integrated problem. Further, advancements in control algorithms and software have widened the range of feasible operation and control for strongly interconnected production systems. In light of these advances in different areas of the field, recommendations for further research and initiatives for development of an integrated approach are given with focus on how new results on the short term can improve industrial practice.
