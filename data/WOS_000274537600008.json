We consider constructing an inverter with AND gates and OR gates and a few NOT gates. Beals, Nishino and Tanaka have given a construction of an inverter which has size O(n log n) and depth O(log n) and uses inverted right perpendicularlog(n + 1)inverted left perpendicular NOT gates. In this paper we give a construction of an inverter which has size O(n) and depth log(1+o(1)) n and uses log(1+o(1)) n NOT gates. This is the first negation-limited inverter of linear size using only o(n) NOT gates. We also discuss implications of our construction for negation-limited circuit complexity.", "paper_title": "Negation-Limited Inverters of Linear Size", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537600008"}
