In the multiple testing problems involving these experiments, it is more powerful and more reasonable to control false discovery rate (FDR) or positive FDR (pFDR) instead of type I error, e.g. family-wise error rate (FWER). When controlling FDR, the traditional approach of estimating sample size by controlling type I error is no longer applicable. Results: Our proposed method applies to controlling FDR. The sample size calculation is straightforward and requires minimal computation, as illustrated with two sample t-tests and F-tests. Based on simulation with the resultant sample size, the power is shown to be achievable by the q-value procedure.", "paper_title": "Quick calculation for sample size while controlling false discovery rate with application to microarray analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000245511800012"}
