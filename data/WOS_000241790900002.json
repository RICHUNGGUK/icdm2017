Correlation analysis of intuitionistic fuzzy sets is an important research topic in the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory and has great practical potential in a variety of areas, such as engineering, decision making, medical diagnosis, pattern recognition, etc. In this paper, we propose a new method for deriving the correlation coefficients of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, which has some advantages over the existing methods. Furthermore, we extend the developed method to the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set theory, and show its application in medical diagnosis.", "paper_title": "On correlation measures of intuitionistic fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900002"}
