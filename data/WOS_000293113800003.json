Contrary to earlier studies, this paper introduces material blending through multiple features with different heterogeneous material composition. Feature-based method is used to represent and design heterogeneous objects with multi-directional material composition. The Voronoi diagram of multiple curves is constructed to generate bisector of the geometric domain. Then, metamorphosis from the bounding curve to multiple internal curves is performed using dynamic programming based optimization approach in two steps. First, optimum curve matching between internal curves and enclosing Voronoi cells is obtained. Then, an optimum ruling line alignment and insertion technique between the Voronoi diagram and the bounding curve is developed. Metamorphosis through complex concavities is also achieved. Finally, multi-directional material composition is mapped based on a set of relations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
