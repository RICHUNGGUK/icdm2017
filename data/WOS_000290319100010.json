Approximate model method is a kind of direct linearization approach that is derived based on the approximation of the plant's input-output model via Taylor expansion. RBF networks are used to identify the plant to implement the approximate model control law. In order to improve the performance of the approximate model controller, RBF networks weights are adjusted online using BP algorithms with an adaptive learning rate. Several simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller for team valving control.", "paper_title": "RBF networks-based adaptive approximate model controller for steam valving control", "paper_id": "WOS:000290319100010"}
