The adopted control scheme is based on a Modified Smith Predictor, where the delay estimation is implemented using a multi-model scheme in combination with a Pattern Search Method. Thus, the problem of delay estimation is reduced to an optimization problem whose solution is implemented by Pattern Search Techniques. Simulation examples show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in practice, being able to deal with constant and time-varying delays for which an excellent behaviour is obtained.
