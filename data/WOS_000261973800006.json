In this investigation, the objective function and constraint functions include not only the conventional design indexes of structure but also the vibration control indexes and the feedback control variables. The structural design variables are optimized simultaneously with the vibration control system. The sensitivity relations for the control-structure optimization model are derived by using a new method, and the sequential linear programming algorithm is used to solve this kind of optimization problem. The numerical examples given in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of methods and the program.", "paper_title": "Control-structural design optimization for vibration of piezoelectric intelligent truss structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000261973800006"}
