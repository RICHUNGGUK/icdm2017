Nonlinearity is achieved by specifying different transformation matrices at different locations of the latent space and smoothing the transformation using a Markov random field type prior. The computation is made feasible by the recent advances in sampling from von Mises-Fisher distributions. The computational properties of the algorithm are illustrated through simulations as well as an application to handwritten digits data.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis Using Random Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000263396100014"}
