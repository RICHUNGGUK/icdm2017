The system for all Exp+Res operates in two stages: it expands all universal variables through conjunctions and refutes the result by propositional resolution. This approach contrasts with the Q-resolution calculus, which enables refuting QBFs by rules similar to propositional resolution. In practice, Q-resolution enables producing proofs from conflict-driven DPLL-based QBF solvers. The system for all Exp+Res can on the other hand certify certain expansion-based solvers. So a natural question is to ask which of the systems, Q-resolution and for all Exp+Res, is more powerful? The article gives several partial responses to this question. On the positive side, we show that for all Exp+Res can p-simulate tree Q-resolution. On the negative side, we show that for all Exp+Res does not p-simulate unrestricted Q-resolution. In the favor of for all Exp+Res we show that for all Exp+Res is more powerful than a certain fragment of Q-resolution, which is important for DPLL-based QBF solving. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
