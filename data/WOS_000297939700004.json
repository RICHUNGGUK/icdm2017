According to different time intervals between the adjacent pulses, two important dynamical decoupling schemes: periodic dynamical decoupling (PDD) and Uhrig dynamical decoupling (UDD) are analyzed. Based on the comparison between PDD and UDD, we propose our optimized dynamical decoupling scheme with different time intervals between adjacent pulses which follow a normal distribution. At last numerical simulations are carried out in a three-level atom in Xi-configuration, we select the non-diagonal element of density matrix as a reference index to compare the performances of suppressing the decoherence of these three strategies, and the results indicate that dynamical decoupling strategy proposed has better performances than that of PDD and UDD have under some low range of the loss of the quantum coherence.", "paper_title": "AN OPTIMIZED DYNAMICAL DECOUPLING STRATEGY TO SUPPRESS DECOHERENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000297939700004"}
