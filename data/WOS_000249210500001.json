This method uses new absorbing interface conditions in place of the Neumann interface conditions defined in the classical FETI method. The optimal convergence properties of the classical FETI method and of its variant are first demonstrated, both in the case of homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Secondly, novel and efficient absorbing interface conditions, which avoid rigid body motions, are investigated and analysed. Numerical experiments illustrate the dependence of the proposed method upon several parameters, and confirm the robustness and efficiency of this method when equipped with such absorbing interface conditions.
