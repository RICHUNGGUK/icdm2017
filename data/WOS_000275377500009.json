A hierarchical methodology is proposed that consists of three fault detection and isolation ( FDI) approaches, namely (i) a \"low-level'' FDI scheme, (ii) a \"high-level'' FDI scheme, and (iii) an \"integrated'' FDI scheme. Based on the data from the electrical circuit of the PPTs, the proposed \"low-level'' FDI scheme can detect and isolate faults in the PPT actuators with a good level of accuracy, however the precision level is poor and below expectations with the misclassification rates as expressed by False Healthy and False Faulty parameters being too high. The proposed \"high-level'' FDI scheme utilizes data from the relative attitudes of the FF mission. This scheme has good detection capabilities, however its isolation capabilities are not adequate. Finally, the proposed \"integrated'' FDI scheme takes advantage of the strengths of each of the above two schemes while reducing their individual weaknesses. The results demonstrate a high level of accuracy (99.79%) and precision (99.94%) with a misclassification rates that are quite negligible (less than 1%). Furthermore, the proposed \"integrated'' FDI scheme provides additional and interesting information related to the effects of faults in the thrust production levels that would not have been available from simply using the low or the high level schemes alone.
