This multi-classifier has been tested in three problems: HIV-protease; recognition of T-cell epitopes; predictive vaccinology. We propose a multi-classifier that combines a classifier that approaches the problem as a two-class pattern recognition problem and a method based on a one-class classifier. Several classifiers combined with the \"sum rule\" enables us to obtain an improvement performance over the best results previously published in the literature.", "paper_title": "Machine learning multi-classifiers for peptide classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000263062200009"}
