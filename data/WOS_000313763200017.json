Although some recently proposed methods provide query suggestions by mining query patterns from search logs, none of them models the immediately preceding queries as context systematically, and uses context information effectively in query suggestions. Context-aware query suggestion is challenging in both modeling context and scaling up query suggestion using context. In this article, we propose a novel context-aware query suggestion approach. To tackle the challenges, our approach consists of two stages. In the first, offline model-learning stage, to address data sparseness, queries are summarized into concepts by clustering a click-through bipartite. A concept sequence suffix tree is then constructed from session data as a context-aware query suggestion model. In the second, online query suggestion stage, a user's search context is captured by mapping the query sequence submitted by the user to a sequence of concepts. By looking up the context in the concept sequence suffix tree, we suggest to the user context-aware queries. We test our approach on large-scale search logs of a commercial search engine containing 4.0 billion Web queries, 5.9 billion clicks, and 1.87 billion search sessions. The experimental results clearly show that our approach outperforms three baseline methods in both coverage and quality of suggestions.", "paper_title": "Mining Concept Sequences from Large-Scale Search Logs for Context-Aware Query Suggestion", "paper_id": "WOS:000313763200017"}
