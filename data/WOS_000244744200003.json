The effectiveness of the harmonic wavelets for capturing the temporal evolution of the frequency content of strong ground motions is demonstrated. In this regard, a detailed study of important earthquake accelerograms is undertaken and smooth joint time-frequency spectra are provided for two near-field and two far-field records; inherent in this analysis is the concept of the mean instantaneous frequency. Furthermore, as a paradigm of usefulness for aseismic structural purposes, a similar analysis is conducted for the response of a 20-story steel frame benchmark building considering one of the four accelerograms scaled by appropriate factors as the excitation to simulate undamaged and severely damaged conditions for the structure. The resulting joint time-frequency representation of the response time histories captures the influence of nonlinearity on the variation of the effective natural frequencies of a structural system during the evolution of a seismic event. In this context, the potential of the harmonic wavelet transform as a detection tool for global structural damage is explored in conjunction with the concept of monitoring the mean instantaneous frequency of records of critical structural responses.", "paper_title": "Numerical treatment of seismic accelerograms and of inelastic seismic structural responses using harmonic wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000244744200003"}
