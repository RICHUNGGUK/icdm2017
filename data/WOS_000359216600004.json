Each algorithm seeks the optimum of a global cost function based on the Bhattacharyya measure, a convenient alternative to other matching measures such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our functionals are not directly amenable to graph cut optimization as they contain non-linear functions of fractional terms, which make the ensuing optimization problems challenging. We first derive a family of parametric bounds of the Bhattacharyya measure by introducing an auxiliary labeling. Then, we show that these bounds are auxiliary functions of the Bhattacharyya measure, a result which allows us to solve each problem efficiently via graph cuts. We show that the proposed optimization procedures converge within very few graph cut iterations. Comprehensive and various experiments, including quantitative and comparative evaluations over two databases, demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms over related works in regard to optimality, computational load, accuracy and flexibility.", "paper_title": "Distribution Matching with the Bhattacharyya Similarity: A Bound Optimization Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000359216600004"}
