Its efficiency depends on the spectral radius-in [0,1)- of a certain matrix in the definition of the preconditioner. Spectral radius close to 1 degrade the performance of the approach. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, to show that a separable quadratic regularization term in the objective reduces the spectral radius, significantly improving the overall performance in some classes of instances. Second, to consider a regularization term which decreases with the barrier function, thus with no need for an extra parameter. Computational experience with some primal block-angular problems confirms the efficiency of the regularized approach. In particular, for some difficult problems, the solution time is reduced by a factor of two to ten by the regularization term, outperforming state-of-the-art commercial solvers.", "paper_title": "Quadratic regularizations in an interior-point method for primal block-angular problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000297130400006"}
