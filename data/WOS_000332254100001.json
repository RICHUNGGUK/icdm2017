Energy efficiency is an important criterion for many applications since the sensor nodes are generally budgeted by limited battery. In this paper, we are concerned with the node scheduling problem to provide the required services for the service-oriented wireless sensor network. We firstly propose an Energy-aware Centralized Heuristic Scheme (ECHS) for the problem in which an energy-aware benefit function is used to determine active sensor nodes and rotate sensor nodes by periodically reconstructing the scheduling scheme. We also present an Energy-aware Distributed Heuristic Scheme (EDHS) as the distributed version. Extensive simulation is performed to evaluate the proposed schemes, and the results show that the two schemes have better performance compared with related works.", "paper_title": "Service-Oriented Node Scheduling Schemes with Energy Efficiency in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000332254100001"}
