Periodic solutions are analytically verified and consequently the relationship between the natural frequency and the initial amplitude is obtained in an analytical form. A comparison of the period of oscillation and obtained solutions with the exact results illustrates that the Hamiltonian approach is very effective and quite accurate for nonlinear equations.
