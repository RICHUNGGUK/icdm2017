When the parameters are unknown, independent training samples are taken from the populations. We consider the construction of confidence intervals for the conditional error rate. The cases of two populations and three populations are studied in detail. We propose the conditional jackknife confidence interval and the conditional bootstrap confidence intervals of the conditional error rate. A Monte Carlo study is conducted to compare the confidence intervals. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
