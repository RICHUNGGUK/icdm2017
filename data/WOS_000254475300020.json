The extension and the first construction, called CMC, of this notion to tweakable enciphering schemes which can handle variable length messages was given by Halevi-Rogaway at Crypto 2003. In this paper, we present HCH, which is a new construction of such a scheme. The construction uses two universal hash computations with a counter mode of encryption in-between. This approach was first proposed by McGrew-Viega to build a scheme called XCB and later used by Wang-Feng-Wu, to obtain a scheme called HCTR. A unique feature of HCH compared to all known tweakable enciphering schemes is that HCH uses a single key, can handle arbitrary length messages, and has a quadratic security bound. An important application of a tweakable enciphering scheme is disk encryption. HCH is well suited for this application. We also describe a variant, which can utilize precomputation and makes one less block cipher call. This compares favorably to other hash-encrypt-hash-type constructions, supports better key agility and requires less key material.", "paper_title": "HCH: A new tweakable enciphering scheme using the hash-counter-hash approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000254475300020"}
