In such cases, we are dealing with the so-called imbalanced data sets. This scenario has significant interest since standard classifiers are often biased towards the majority classes, whereas the minority ones tend to have a higher reward as they usually define the concepts of interest from the learning point of view. The aim of this paper is to analyse the performance of (CORBFN)-R-2, a evolutionary cooperative-competitive model for the design of radial-basis function networks applied to classification problems on imbalanced domains, and to study its cooperation with a well-known pre-processing method, the \"synthetic minority over-sampling technique\". The good performance of (CORBFN)-R-2 is shown through an experimental study carried out on a large collection of imbalanced data sets where we compare, by means of a proper statistical study, the behaviour of our model with many representative neural networks algorithms, the C4.5 decision tree and a hierarchical fuzzy rule-based classification system.
