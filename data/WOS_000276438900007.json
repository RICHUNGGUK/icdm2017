The technical constraints for this kind of application are very limited space for the actuators and high performance in terms of torque and angular reach The first solution classically consists in a 2 d o f structure steered by two pairs of antagonist shape memory alloy (SMA) wires. The sizing and preload determination for those actuators follow an original analytical approach. The second solution consists in a multi-d.o.f. structure actuated by thin NiTi springs mounted in an antagonist configuration and directly integrated in the structure of the endoscope The geometry of the springs is obtained by optimization through genetic algorithms and finite elements method. Experiments show good adequacy between real behaviour and numerical model and also validate the approach This study is also enhanced by a control scheme specifically developed for SMA actuators in an antagonist configuration. It is based on a first order sliding mode scheme, which has the advantage of a great structural simplicity. The experimental results show that this solution can reach a good compromise between the dynamic behaviour of the actuator, its energy consumption and the structural lifetime of the endoscope (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "A practical approach to the design and control of active endoscopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000276438900007"}
