If all non-3-colorable graphs can be constructed in polynomial steps by the calculus, then NP = co-NP holds. Up to date, however, it remains open whether there exists a family of graphs that cannot be generated in polynomial steps. To attack this problem, we propose two graph calculi PHC and PHC that generate non-3-colorable planar graphs, where intermediate graphs in the calculi are also restricted to be planar. Then we prove that PHC and PHC are sound and complete. We also show that PHC can polynomially simulate PHC.", "paper_title": "New graph calculi for planar non-3-colorable graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000259767300005"}
