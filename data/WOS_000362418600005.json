At first, the CPS structure is presented, which acquires the characteristics of general CPS and enables \"simulation-based planning and control\" to achieve high level intelligent assembly. Then the paper puts forward data fusion estimation algorithm under synchronous and asynchronous sampling, respectively. The experiment shows that global optimal distributed fusion estimation under synchronized sampling proves to be closer to the actual value compared with ordinary weighted estimation, and multi-scale distributed fusion estimation algorithm of wavelet under asynchronous sampling does not need time registration, it can also directly link to data, and the error is smaller. This paper presents hybrid control strategy under the circumstance of joint action of the inner and outer loop to address the problems caused by the less controllable feature of the parallel mechanism when undertaking online process simulation and control. A robust adaptive sliding mode controller is designed based on disturbance observer to restrain inner interference and maintain robustness. At the same time, an outer collaborative trajectory planning is also designed. All the experiment results show the feasibility of above proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Data fusion and simulation-based planning and control in cyber physical system for digital assembly of aeroplane", "paper_id": "WOS:000362418600005"}
