A hierarchical configuration context (HCC) organization scheme is proposed to reduce the implementation overhead and the energy dissipation spent on fast reconfiguration. The proposed RPU is integrated into two system-on-a-chips (SoCs), targeting multiple-standard video decoding. The high-performance chip, comprising two RPU processors (named REMUS_HPP), can decode 1920 X 1080 H.264 video streams at 30 frames per second (fps) under 200 MHz. REMUS_HPP achieves a 25% performance gain over the XPP-III reconfigurable processor with only 280 mW power consumption, resulting in a 14.3 x improvement on energy efficiency. The other chip (named REMUS_LPP), targeting low power applications, integrates only one RPU processor. REMUS_LPP can decode 720 x 480 H.264 video streams at 35fps with 24.5 mW under 75 MHz, achieving a 76% reduction in power dissipation and a 3.96x improvement on energy efficiency compared with the ADRES reconfigurable processor.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Efficient Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Processing Unit for Multiple-Standard Video Decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000361685400003"}
