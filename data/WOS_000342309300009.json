But some examples show the inefficiency of the comprehensive evaluation model. In order to process these problems, in this paper, we introduce two concepts of standardized fuzzy set and normalized fuzzy set, propose a novel method to improve the comprehensive evaluation model and its algorithm. Finally, we use three numerical examples to illustrate our proposed model reasonable and point out that our proposed method can avoid some inefficiencies in applications.", "paper_title": "An improved comprehensive evaluation model and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000342309300009"}
