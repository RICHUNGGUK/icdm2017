We consider conjunctive views and rewritings, with or without aggregation; in each rewriting, only one view contributes to computing the aggregated query output. We look at query rewriting using existing views and at view selection. In the query-rewriting problem, we give sufficient and necessary conditions for a rewriting to exist. For view selection, we prove complexity results. Finally, we give algorithms for obtaining rewritings and selecting views. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
