This method can solve the problem of edge preserving in interpolating the input image which has many irregularly-distributed unfilled pixels. Three concepts of weighting have been considered in the proposed edge-preserving interpolation process: (1) inverse-distance weighting; (2) pixel-count weighting; and (3) region-wise weighting. Good experimental results showing the effectiveness of edge preserving and its superiority to other methods are also included. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
