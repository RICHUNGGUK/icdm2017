The function fills a gap in the presently available subset selection software, which typically searches over a range of subset sizes, restricts the types of objective functions considered, or does not include freely available code. The new function is demonstrated on two types of problem where a fixed-size subset search is desirable: design of environmental monitoring networks, and D-optimal design of experiments. Additionally, the performance is evaluated on a class of constructed test problems with a novel design that is interesting in its own right.", "paper_title": "A Genetic Algorithm for Selection of Fixed-Size Subsets with Application to Design Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000366015100001"}
