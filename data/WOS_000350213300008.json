However, its computational complexity is high since a large amount of returned reference frames need to be handled by some reference clip reconstruction methods. In addition, dense frame sampling strategies generally used for improving copy localization precision not only further aggravate the computational efficiency but also lead to much more false alarms due to the content redundancy among frames. To alleviate the above problems, a new scheme is proposed for improving the performance of the frame fusion based video copy detection in both efficiency and effectiveness. In particular, the continuous similarity property among neighbor frames is learned for guiding the design of smart frame filtering method so as to greatly reduce the redundancy among frames. Then, two effective path verification schemes, which utilize cross-clip verification strategy, are studied for removing false alarms. The extensive experiments show that the proposed scheme remarkably improves the detection accuracy of the baseline frame fusion scheme and gives a comparable localization accuracy.", "paper_title": "Redundancy filtering and fusion verification for video copy detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000350213300008"}
