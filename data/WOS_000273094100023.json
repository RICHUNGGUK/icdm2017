In this paper, we propose a variant of the k-means algorithm and prove that it is more efficient than standard k-means algorithms. An important contribution of this paper is the establishment of a relation between the number of clusters and the size of the clusters in a dataset through the analysis of our algorithm. We also demonstrate that the integration of this algorithm as a pre-processing step in classification algorithms reduces their running-time complexity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
