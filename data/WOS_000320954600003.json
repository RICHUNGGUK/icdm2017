It is mathematically demonstrated and computationally verified that, within the framework of non-relativistic and time-independent quantum mechanics, like the size-extensive spin-contamination to which it relates, half-metallicity is nothing else than a methodological artefact, due to a too approximate treatment of electron correlation in the electronic ground state.", "paper_title": "Half-metallicity of graphene nanoribbons and related systems: a new quantum mechanical El Dorado for nanotechnologies aEuro broken vertical bar or a hype for materials scientists?", "paper_id": "WOS:000320954600003"}
