If instead we count the number of pairs of edges that intersect an odd number of times, we obtain the odd crossing number. We show that there is a graph for which these two concepts differ, answering a well-known open question on crossing numbers. To derive the result we study drawings of maps (graphs with rotation systems).", "paper_title": "Odd crossing number is not crossing number", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300035"}
