In that work we described how control can be specified in terms of cycle theories, which define declaratively the possible alternative behaviours of agents, depending on their internal state and (their perception of) the external environment in which they are situated. This form of control has been adopted for logic-based KGP agents [8,2]. In this paper we show how using this form of control specification we can specify different profiles of agents, how they would vary the behaviour of agents and what advantages they have with respect to factors in the application and in the environment, such as time-criticality.", "paper_title": "Variety of behaviours through profiles in logic-based agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000237506800012"}
