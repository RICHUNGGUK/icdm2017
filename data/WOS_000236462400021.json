Using this approach, we approximate the Pareto optimal front by first identifying TS models with different structures (i.e., different number of rules and input variables), and then performing a local optimization of these models using an ANFIS learning approach. The results obtained allow determining a posteriori the optimal TS system for the specific application. Main features of our approach are selection of the input variables and automatic determination of the number of rules.", "paper_title": "Identification of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems based on multi-objective genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000236462400021"}
