This study proposes a two-stage mechanism, called PSBA, to process the operations of packet scheduling and bandwidth allocation based on channel quality information. The proposed approach is adaptive for dynamic channel conditions to improve system throughput and to reduce packet delay in mobile WiMAX. The service flow simulations in the IEEE 802.16e system indicate that PSBA achieved a lower delay time and a higher throughput among multiple users. For the purpose of performance evaluation, a Markov chain with bulk service was built to analyze the WiMAX Point-to-Multipoint (PMP) network based on channel quality by using the bandwidth request message (BW-REQ).
