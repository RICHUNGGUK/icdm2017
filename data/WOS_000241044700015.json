We present an analog very large scale integration (VLSI) implementation of a building block for a multi-chip neuromorphic hardware model of selective attention. We describe the chip's architecture underlining the similarity between the circuits and biological neurons and synapses. We present experimental results showing the system's behavior as a function of its bias settings. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
