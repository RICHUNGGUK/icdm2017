However, clear design guidelines and techniques for the support of scalable IMS-based deployment, especially for data-intensive services such as mobility management, presence, and instant messaging, are still missing. That could block or at least relevantly slow down IMS acceptance by network operators and application providers. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels. The reported experimental results point out that our solution can significantly increase intradomain scalability with very limited costs.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Intradomain Scalability of IMS-Based Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000326501400008"}
