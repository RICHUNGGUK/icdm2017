Standard classification methods may not be sufficient for such data, and this provides motivation for nonstandard learning settings. One such new learning methodology is called learning through contradiction or Universum-support vector machine (U-SVM). Recent studies have shown U-SVM to be quite effective for sparse highdimensional data sets. However, all these earlier studies have used balanced data sets with equal misclassification costs. This paper extends the U-SVM formulation to problems with different misclassification costs, and presents practical conditions for the effectiveness of this cost-sensitive U-SVM. Several empirical comparisons are presented to validate the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Development and Evaluation of Cost-Sensitive Universum-SVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000351467400017"}
