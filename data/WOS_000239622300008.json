The advent of easily accessible biological web databases such as NCBI databases and associated tools such as BLAST are key components to this development. However, with the growing number of these web based biological research tools and data sources, the time necessary to invest in becoming a domain expert is immense. Therefore, it is important to allow for easy user deployment of the wealthy of available data sources and tools necessary to conduct biological research. In this paper we discuss an approach to create and maintain a robust ontology knowledge base that serves as the core for SIBIOS, a workflow based integration system for bioinformatics tools and data sources. Further, deployment of the ontology in various components of SIMS is discussed.", "paper_title": "SIBIOS ontology: A robust package for the integration and pipelining of bioinformatics services", "paper_id": "WOS:000239622300008"}
