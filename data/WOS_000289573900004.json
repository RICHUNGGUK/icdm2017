In this paper, assuming that an optimal global scheduler is adopted within each cluster, we investigate the worst-case utilization bounds for cluster scheduling with different task allocation/partitioning heuristics. First, we develop a lower limit on the utilization bounds for cluster scheduling with any reasonable task allocation scheme. Then, the lower limit is shown to be the exact utilization bound for cluster scheduling with the worst-fit task allocation scheme. For other task allocation heuristics (such as first-fit, best-fit, first-fit decreasing, best-fit decreasing and worst-fit decreasing), higher utilization bounds are derived for systems with both homogeneous clusters (where each cluster has the same number of processors) and heterogeneous clusters (where clusters have different number of processors). In addition, focusing on an efficient optimal global scheduler, namely the boundary-fair (Bfair) algorithm, we propose a period-aware task allocation heuristic with the goal of reducing the scheduling overhead (e.g., the number of scheduling points, context switches and task migrations). Simulation results indicate that the percentage of task sets that can be scheduled is significantly improved under cluster scheduling even for small-size clusters, compared to that of the partitioned scheduling. Moreover, when comparing to the simple generic task allocation scheme (e.g., first-fit), the proposed period-aware task allocation heuristic markedly reduces the scheduling overhead of cluster scheduling with the Bfair scheduler.", "paper_title": "Cluster scheduling for real-time systems: utilization bounds and run-time overhead", "paper_id": "WOS:000289573900004"}
