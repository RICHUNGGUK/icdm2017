This limits their applicability in stand-alone analyses of these data, mainly owing to inaccurate representation or mediocre data compression. CODOC is a novel data format and comprehensive application programming interface for efficient representation, access and analysis of DOC data. CODOC compresses these data similar to 4-32x better than the best current comparable method by exploiting specific data characteristics while at the same time enabling more-exact signal recovery for lossy compression and very fast query answering times.", "paper_title": "CODOC: efficient access, analysis and compression of depth of coverage signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000342913000024"}
