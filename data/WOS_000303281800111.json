The latter, acting in an interoperable and information-rich Web environment, will efficiently satisfy their users' requests in a variety of real-life applications. Much work has been done on SW information agents for Web-based query answering; a variety of multi-agent platforms and Web language standards has been proposed. However, the platform- and language-bridging interoperation across multi-agent systems has been neglected so far, although it will be vital for large-scale agent deployment and wide-spread adoption of agent technology by human users. This article defines the space of possible interoperation methods for heterogeneous multi-agent systems based on the communication type, namely symmetric or asymmetric, and the MASs status, namely open or closed systems. It presents how heterogeneous multi-agent systems can use one of these methods to interoperate and, eventually, automate collaboration across communities. The method is exemplified with two SW-enabled multi-agent systems. EMERALD and Rule Responder, which assist communities of users based on declarative SW and multi-agent standards such as RDF, OWL. RuleML, and FIPA. This interoperation employs a declarative, knowledge-based approach, which enables information agents to make smart and consistent decisions, relying on high-quality facts and rules. Multi-step interaction use cases between agents from both communities are presented, demonstrating the added value of interoperation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
