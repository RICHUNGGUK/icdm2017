Unlike traditional edge-based active contours that use gradient to detect edges, our model derives the neighborhood distribution and edge information with two different region-based operators: a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based intensity distribution estimator and the Hueckel operator. We propose the local distribution fitting model for more accurate segmentation, which incorporates the operator outcomes into the recent local binary fitting (LBF) model. The GMM and the Hueckel model parameters are estimated before contour evolution, which enables the use of the proposed model without the need for initial contour selection, i.e., the level set function is initialized with a random constant instead of a distance map. Thus our model essentially alleviates the initialization sensitivity problem of most active contours. Experiments on synthetic and real images show the improved performance of our approach over the LBF model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
