Using Kramers-Kroning relations, the branch selecting problem which is the challenge of effective media parameters retrieval methods could be simply removed. To demonstrate the validity of the method, first, the constitutive parameters of a homogeneous chiral media are retrieved in the excellent agreement with the supposed parameters. Second validation is achieved by extracting the effective parameters of two well-known CMM structures whose effective parameters have been reported in the literature. The results are in excellent agreement with the reports of the previous works. Finally, a new type of CMMs called windmill structure is suggested, and its effective parameters are then extracted using the proposed method. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
