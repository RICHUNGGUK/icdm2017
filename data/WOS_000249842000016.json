The MPEG-4 fine-granularity scalability video coding technique can adapt to bandwidth variation and random packet errors. In this paper, to explore the impacts of cellular channel characteristics on the tolerance of buffer performance and quality of service, a novel statistical model-based adaptive media playout (AMP) is proposed by utilizing the statistical assumptions of both arrival and departure processes for a better decision on the dynamic threshold adjustment an frame-rate adjustment. Based on third-generation cellular transmission environment, simulation results will demonstrate that as compared to other AMP schemes, the proposed AMP control provides better visual quality with lower complexity.", "paper_title": "Content-aware adaptive media playout controls for wireless video streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000249842000016"}
