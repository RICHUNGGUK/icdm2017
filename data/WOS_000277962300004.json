Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a key technique in CR systems to implement dynamic spectrum change and can be easily implemented by changing the transmitted pulse shape in a C-UWB communication system. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal expansion based pulse shaping method to implement DSA and to compensate for antenna distortion, which uses the orthogonal Hermite functions as the orthogonal basis. In order to eliminate the direct current (DC) component existing in even orthogonal Hermite functions and to reduce the computational complexity, two modified methods and a simplification procedure are also proposed. Our results indicate that the proposed orthogonal expansion based pulse shaping methods have a much lower computational complexity than the semi-definite programming (SDP) method, while achieving a high power efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the distortion caused by the antenna effects can also be compensated during the pulse shaping process and a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can thus be achieved. Therefore, the proposed method is very suitable for practical application in C-UWB communications, in which the spectrum environment changes rapidly.
