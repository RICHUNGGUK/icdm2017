To this end, popularity-based schemes have recently attracted attention aimed at increasing search efficiency using content popularity ranking; however, these methods suffer from high cost and overhead, or inappropriate level of accuracy in specifying the popularity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme to make a tradeoff between cost and accuracy. This scheme relies on exchanging File Index Table (FIT) between peers in a local neighborhood using a Gossip Exchange Method (GEM). The proposed Hybrid Adaptive Search According to Gossip Exchange Method (HAS-A-GEM) is based on smart unstructured peer to peer overlays. We apply a hybrid overlay that efficiently combines topology-aware and interest-based links instead of random or DHT invoked connections. An analytical model as well as a simulation framework is developed to illustrate the performance of this scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated under various conditions. Simulation results reveal that HAS-A-GEM performs well for large-scale networks, exploiting local content popularity when each local area contains enough number of peers.", "paper_title": "A popularity-based query scheme in P2P networks using adaptive gossip sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000313413100006"}
