This process generalizes in a more realistic way the infinite source Poisson model which has been used for modeling teletraffic for a long time. At each Poisson point Gamma(j), a flow of packets is initiated which is modeled as a partial iid sum process Gamma(j) + Sigma(k)(i=1) X-ji, k <= K-j, with a random limit K-j which is independent of (X-ji ) and the underlying Poisson points (Gamma(j) ). We study the covariance structure of the increment process of N. In particular, the covariance function of the increment process is not summable if the right tail P(K-j > x) is regularly varying with index alpha is an element of (1, 2), the distribution of the X-ji's being irrelevant. This means that the increment process exhibits long-range dependence. If var(K-j) < infinity long-range dependence is excluded. We study the asymptotic behavior of the process (N(t)) (t >= 0) and give conditions on the distribution of K-j and X-ji under which the random sums Sigma(Kj)(i=1) X-ji have a regularly varying tail. Using the form of the distribution of the interarrival times of the process N under the Palm distribution, we also conduct an exploratory statistical analysis of simulated data and of Internet packet arrivals to a server. We illustrate how the theoretical results can be used to detect distribution al characteristics of K-j, X-ji , and of the Poisson process.", "paper_title": "Modeling teletraffic arrivals by a Poisson cluster process", "paper_id": "WOS:000240913500004"}
