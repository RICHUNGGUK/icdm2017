We focus in particular on source terms for modeling highway entries and exits or local changes of the traffic flow due to inhomogeneities of the road. Rigorous well-posedness results and numerical investigations are presented. We show in particular how real phenomena (e.g. the formation of a queue) that are not captured by models based on systems of conservation laws are instead observable with our models.
