The primary motivating observation of the project is that a simulation/model's source code plus the configuration parameters required for a model run are a compact representation of the dataset generated when the model is executed. The end goal of the project is a convergence of models and data where both resources are accessed uniformly from a single registry. In this paper we review the current metadata landscape of the climate modeling community, present our work on developing a metadata formalism for describing climate models, and reflect on technical challenges we have faced that require new research in the area of Earth Science Informatics.", "paper_title": "Earth system curator: metadata infrastructure for climate modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000207785500003"}
