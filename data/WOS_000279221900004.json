In this process towards a fully transactional platform, several projects have made their contribution. Regretfully, current solutions unveils some drawbacks regarding interoperability and accessibility issues. In this context, this paper proposes a semantic approach to fulfill holistic services in the domain. Semantics is called to play a role of first importance as a tool for interoperability. LifeEvents and AdministrativeServices are artifacts defined within this technology. Using these, an entire software architecture is derived and, eventually implemented by means of a software platform also described in this paper. Finally, some conclusions are presented.", "paper_title": "A HOLISTIC SEMANTIC FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES IN THE DOMAIN OF eGOVERNMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000279221900004"}
