J. Wan, L. W. Liu, Y. Yang, Optimal routing based on the super-topology in Hypercube WDM networks, 4999, pp. 142-149] and [Y. R. Leu, S. Y. Kuo, A fault-tolerant tree communication scheme for hypercube systems, IEEE Trans. Comput. 45(6) (1996) 643-650] have many advantages: they support parallel computing, provide disjoint paths, and tolerate faults. If devices with computing capabilities can be linked as a Hypercube by taking advantage of Bluetooth radio's features, then an efficient communication and high-performance computing environment can be established by applying currently used algorithms. A Bluetooth device randomly searches for and connects with other devices, using time-consuming inquiry/inquiry scan and page/page scan operation and hence, results in an uncontrolled scatternet topology and inefficient communications. The present work proposes a three-stage distributed construction protocol for rapidly organizing a Hypercube computing environment that was constructed from Bluetooth devices. The proposed protocol governs the construction of links, the assigning of roles and the formation of the scatternet in order to efficiently construct a Hypercube structure. The constructed scatternet easily enables Bluetooth devices to establish a routing path, tolerate faults and create disjoint paths, and thus, achieves parallel and distributed computing in a Bluetooth wireless environment. Experimental results reveal that the proposed protocol can set up a scatternet that is appropriate for parallel computing and communications. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
