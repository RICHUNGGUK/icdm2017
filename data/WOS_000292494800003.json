The time-to-failure and the reboot time are assumed to be exponentially distributed. The repair time of the service station and the time-to-repair of component are assumed to be generally distributed. A consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of availability of such a repairable system is developed. Based on this estimator, interval estimation and testing hypothesis are performed by using logit transformation. To implement the simulation inference for the system availability, two repair-time distributions, lognormal and Weibull distributions, are used. Three Weibull distributions characterized by distinct shape parameters are considered. Finally, all simulation results are displayed as appropriate tables and curves to reveal the performance of the statistical inference procedures. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
