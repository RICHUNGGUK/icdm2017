Reliability gains more importance in high-capacity networks where IP and optical technologies have converged toward a common control plane, such as GMPLS. In most previous research works, survivability aspects were mainly limited to a single fiber failure and a few considered the differentiated reliability concepts when routing new connection requests. In this article, a novel survivable multicast routing mechanism under SRLG constraints is proposed. We first formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model that is shown NP-Complete. We then propose a heuristic algorithm that alleviates the problem's complexity by decomposing it into two sub-problems resolved separately. Compared with another algorithm proposed in the literature, our algorithm allows for higher acceptance rates even for stringent reliability requirements.", "paper_title": "A survivable multicast routing mechanism in WDM optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270743400008"}
