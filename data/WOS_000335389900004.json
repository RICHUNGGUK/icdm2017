In this paper we propose to use the Fisher information-based geodesic distance on the space of multivariate normal distributions as an intrinsic distance metric. An efficient and numerically robust shooting method is developed for computing the minimum geodesic distance between two normal distributions, together with an efficient graph-clustering algorithm for segmentation. Extensive experimental results involving both synthetic data and real DT-MRI images demonstrate that in many cases our method leads to more accurate and intuitively plausible segmentation results vis-A -vis existing methods.", "paper_title": "DTI Segmentation and Fiber Tracking Using Metrics on Multivariate Normal Distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000335389900004"}
