Joint CB-LBWH is based on the notion that target representation employs both feature saliency and confidence to form a compound weighted histogram criterion. As the more prominent and confident features mean more significant for tracking the target, the tuned histogram by joint CB-LBWH can reduce the interference of background in target localization effectively. Comparative experimental results show that the proposed joint CB-LBWH scheme can significantly improve the efficiency and robustness of MS tracker when heavy occlusions and complex scenes exist.", "paper_title": "Efficient Mean-Shift Tracking Using an Improved Weighted Histogram Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000338846200009"}
