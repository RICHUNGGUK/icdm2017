To reduce the decision-making time of selecting appropriate resources for special clients and to improve the quality of service (QoS) in MGrid, the evaluation indices library is established, which includes the general evaluation indices, the special evaluation indices and the individual evaluation indices. The notion of agent-based resource optimal selection evaluation is proposed in the MGrid and the architecture model and the particular algorithm are presented. The experimental results show that the model and the algorithm are feasible and effective for solving the problem of resource optimal selection in the MGrid system.", "paper_title": "Modelling and application of optimal-selection evaluation for manufacturing grid resource", "paper_id": "WOS:000252335700005"}
