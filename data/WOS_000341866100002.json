Service is given in batches, where the batch sizes are unlimited and the service time of a batch does not depend on its size. After completing service, the next queue to be visited by the server is the one with the most senior customer. In this paper, we study the Israeli queue with retrials, where the system is comprised of a \"main\" queue and an orbit queue. The main queue consists of at most M groups, where a new arrival enters the main queue either by joining one of the existing groups, or by creating a new group. If an arrival cannot join one of the groups in the main queue, he goes to a retrial (orbit) queue. The orbit queue dispatches orbiting customers back to the main queue at a constant rate. We analyze the system via both probability generating functions and matrix geometric methods, and calculate analytically various performance measures and present numerical results.", "paper_title": "The Israeli queue with retrials", "paper_id": "WOS:000341866100002"}
