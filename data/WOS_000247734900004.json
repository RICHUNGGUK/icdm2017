To accomplish these targets, difficulties come from (1) an architectural project is usually composed of a series of related drawings, (2) 3D information of structural objects may be expressed in 2D drawings, annotations, tables, or the composites of above expressions, and (3) a large number of disturbing graphical primitives in architectural drawings complicate the recognition processes. In this paper, we propose new methods to recognize typical structural objects and architectural symbols. Then the recognized results on the same floor and drawings of different floors will be integrated automatically for accurate 3D reconstruction.", "paper_title": "Automatic analysis and integration of architectural drawings", "paper_id": "WOS:000247734900004"}
