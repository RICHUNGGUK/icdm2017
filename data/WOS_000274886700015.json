By obstacle, we mean that the tour may not cross between the interior and exterior of either polygon. We also consider the problem's extension to higher dimensions, proving that, if P not equal NP, constructing a shortest TSP tour on the vertices of two non-intersecting polytopes is NP-hard if the polytopes are similarly viewed as obstacles.
