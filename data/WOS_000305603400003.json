Our method creates schematic drawings and has been designed to take aesthetic quality, efficiency, and effectiveness into account. This is achieved by a routing algorithm, which links elements that are part of the same set by constructing minimum cost paths over a tangent visibility graph. There are two styles of Kelp Diagrams to depict overlapping sets, a nested and a striped style, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. We compare Kelp Diagrams with two existing methods and show that our approach provides a more consistent and clear depiction of both element locations and their set relations.", "paper_title": "Kelp Diagrams: Point Set Membership Visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000305603400003"}
