In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to evaluate the performance of the beaconless routing algorithm (BLR). We also propose a new forwarding strategy named distance-aware forwarding (DAF) and compare the performance of DAF with that of the traditional strategy referred to as most forwarding within radius (MFR). BLR can efficiently reduce redundancy in its transmissions for flooding. When a node receives a packet, a time variable referred to as deferring time is calculated using the positions of the sender, receiver, and final destination of the packet. Each node forwards the packet after this deferring time unless it notices that another node forwards the same packet during the deferring time. As a result, only the node that is assigned the shortest deferring time forwards the packet. It is important to make this deferring time as short as possible to reduce the total deferring time in a multi-hop transmission. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy reduces the total deferring time in a multi-hop transmission, although the number of hops slightly increases. We also make a performance analysis considering packet collisions and suggest an implementation guideline of the transmission range. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
