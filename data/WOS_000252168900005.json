Although many authors provide high-level arguments to show that in principle models in their formalism can be learned from data, most of the proposed learning algorithms have not yet been studied in detail. We introduce an algorithm, generalized ordering-search, to learn both structure and conditional probability distributions (CPDs) of directed probabilistic logical models. The algorithm is based on the ordering-search algorithm for Bayesian networks. We use relational probability trees as a representation for the CPDs. We present experiments on a genetics domain, blocks world domains and the Cora dataset.", "paper_title": "Generalized ordering-search for learning directed probabilistic logical models", "paper_id": "WOS:000252168900005"}
