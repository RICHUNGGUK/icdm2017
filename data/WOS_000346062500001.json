How to allocate total profit fairly in an uncertain environment, however, is an important factor affecting the stability of the strategic alliance. To handle this problem, this paper proposes a new interval number ranking method based on synthesis effect function in which four basic principles to construct an appropriate synthesis effect function are developed. Using the new interval number ranking method, this paper defines a new concept of interval core. The necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee that the interval core is nonempty is also discussed and addressed using a special kind of additive synthesis effect function. A relatively optimal interval core model and an algorithm are developed to solve the proposed fuzzy allocation problem. Finally, a case study is presented to validate the proposed model and algorithm. Data analysis shows that we can obtain the only fuzzy allocation result by choosing an appropriate desirability function. The result indicates that our model has better operability and interpretability than existing methods, and thus can serve as a guideline for developing different fuzzy allocation methods.", "paper_title": "A Desirability Function-Based Relatively Optimal Interval Core Model and an Algorithm for Fuzzy Profit Allocation Problems of Enterprise Strategy Alliance", "paper_id": "WOS:000346062500001"}
