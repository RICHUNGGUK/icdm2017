Because all stabilizer states are equivalent to graph states by local unitary transformations, these conditions constitute a classical algorithm for the determination of SLOCC-equivalence of pure states and stabilizer states. This algorithm provides a distinct advantage over the direct solution of the SLOCC-equivalence condition vertical bar psi > = S vertical bar g > for an unknown invertible local operator S, as it usually allows for easy detection of states that are not SLOCC-equivalent to graph states.", "paper_title": "TESTING EQUIVALENCE OF PURE QUANTUM STATES AND GRAPH STATES UNDER SLOCC", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194600015"}
