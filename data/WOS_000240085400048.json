One of the important areas for application of the pattern classification is the protein secondary structure prediction, an important topic in the field of bioinformatics. In this work, we develop a parallel algorithm for protein secondary structure prediction, based on the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor method, that uses evolutionary profile obtained from PSI-BLAST (Position Specific Iterative Basic Local Sequence Alignment Tool) as the feature vectors.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy k-nearest neighbor method for protein secondary structure prediction and its parallel implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400048"}
