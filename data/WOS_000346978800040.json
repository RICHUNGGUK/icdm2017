This high uncertainty has affected most of the grid operation strategies including the optimal management of DGs. One significant source of uncertainty is the forecast error in the modeling of the future active and reactive load values. In order to deal with this problem, this paper suggests a new stochastic framework based on the scenario generation process and roulette wheel mechanism. This method converts the stochastic problem into a number of deterministic problems with different probabilities. Since the problem investigated is a complex nonlinear optimization problem, a sufficient optimization algorithm based on the bio-inspired krill herd algorithm is proposed to solve the problem effectively. The satisfying performance of the proposed method is examined on the IEEE standard test system.", "paper_title": "A sufficient stochastic framework to capture the uncertainty of load models in the management of distributed generations in power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000346978800040"}
