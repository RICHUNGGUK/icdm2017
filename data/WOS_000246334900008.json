Firstly, an ellipsoid decomposition algorithm is introduced to approximate given models by ellipsoids. After that, a blobby implicit surface employing ellipsoidal blobs is modelled to fit the sampling points on the given mesh. Finally, the reconstructed ellipsoidal blobby model is applied in two applications: the geometry data reduction and the target shape controlled cloud animation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
