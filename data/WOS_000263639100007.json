Multiple-criteria ranking aims to help a decision maker (DM) assess a finite set of alternatives according to several criteria, usually conflicting, in order to rank the full set. The relation of benchmarks to multiple-criteria decision analysis is investigated systematically, and then, an approach based on distance from a benchmark is designed to incorporate information about a DM's judgements so as to produce a full ranking. The procedure is applied to rank 81.
