The work addresses a number of challenges, including the definition of a novel system-oriented Model of Computation (MoC), capturing the essential aspects of the structure of a parallel software application related to the optimization and translation process, a key element to enable automated design space exploration. The paper also presents an analytical optimization model based on Integer Linear Programming, as well as innovative techniques for early hardware cost prediction used to speed up the design space exploration process. The methodology is supported by a set of ad hoc tools, including a custom OpenMP compiler and a hardware cost estimator, interacting with an existing ILP solver and a hardware high-level synthesis engine. The resulting prototypical environment demonstrates an innovative design flow that can extend the spectrum of ESL design to high-level multi-threaded applications, successfully meeting the current trends in complex embedded systems design. The work also presents a case-study to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with a real-world application. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
