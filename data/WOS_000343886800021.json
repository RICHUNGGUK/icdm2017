Pairing computation on such curves is slightly slower than on Weierstrass curves. However, in some pairing-based cryptosystems, they might require a number of scalar multiplications which is time-consuming operation and this can be advantageous to use Edwards in this scenario. In this paper, we present a variant of Miller's algorithm for pairing computation on Edwards curves. Our approach is generic, it is able to compute both Weil and Tate pairings on pairing-friendly Edwards curves of any embedding degree. Our analysis shows that the new algorithm is faster than the previous algorithms for odd embedding degree and as fast as for even embedding degree. Hence, the new algorithm is suitable for computing optimal pairings and in situations where the denominators elimination technique is not possible.", "paper_title": "Improved Miller's Algorithm for Computing Pairings on Edwards Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000343886800021"}
