An elastic brace is manufactured by warping a planar elastic fabric pattern. With a specified material, different shapes of planar patterns for producing a brace will generate different biomechanical effects on the joint. As an assistive medical device, an elastic brace is often requested to provide certain normal pressures at certain specific locations on the joint. Traditionally the planar pattern of a brace respecting the prescribed normal pressure requirement is designed through empirical tests by trial-and-error. We develop a woven fitting based method in this paper to automate this geometric design process. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
