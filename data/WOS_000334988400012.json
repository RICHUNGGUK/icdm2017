The model pile group consisted of two well instrumented steel piles and was installed in a large soil tank with a close spacing of three-pile diameters on centers. The test results revealed that the eccentricity of lateral loads had limited effect on the overall performances of the 1 x 2 pile group, but significantly contributed to the unevenness of internal forces of the individual piles. The coupling effect between the lateral deflection and torque gave rise to the substantial increase in the torsional resistance of individual piles within the group, comparing to that of a torsionally loaded single pile. The contribution provided by the torsional resistances of individual piles in resisting the external torque continually decreased when the applied lateral load increased. In addition, a three-dimensional finite-element analysis for the pile group was performed and the simulated response was found to be in good agreement with the measured test results. Based on the same model, more cases with different loading conditions were further analyzed. It could be concluded from the analyses that the layout of individual piles within the group obviously affected the behavior of the 1 x 2 pile group under eccentric lateral loads.
