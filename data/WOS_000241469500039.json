To tolerate the volatility of the nodes, the system should be self-healing, that is continuously adapt to additions, removals, and failures of nodes. We present the self-healing architecture of the Vigne Grid Operating System through three of its services: system membership, application management, and volatile data management. The experimental results obtained show that our approach is feasible.", "paper_title": "Vigne: Towards a self-healing Grid Operating System", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500039"}
