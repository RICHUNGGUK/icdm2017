The distance calculation from point to hyperbola is calculated from the time difference. This calculation makes the parameter learning feasible. The neural network can calculate the total error for distance from point to patterns. The parameter learning rule is derived by gradient descent method to minimize the total error. Experimental results show that line and hyperbola can be detected in both simulated and real seismic data. The network can get a fast convergence. The detection results can improve the seismic interpretation.", "paper_title": "Hough transform neural network for seismic pattern detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100007"}
