This method adopts some known attractors in the state space and integrates both appearance and motion-transition information for visual tracking. A probability propagation model based on these two types of information is derived from a Bayesian formulation, and a particle filtering framework is developed to realize it. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for high degree-of-freedom visual tracking problems, such as articulated hand tracking and lip-contour tracking.", "paper_title": "Visual tracking in high-dimensional state space by appearance-guided particle filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000256885700011"}
