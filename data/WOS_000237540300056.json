We prove the feasibility of our approach with a set of prototypes supporting basic interoperability with CORBA and ZeroC ICE. In some cases, the resulting embedded prototypes are two orders of magnitude smaller than previous implementations of small objects. They are suitable for embedding into the smallest inicrocontrollers in the market, or in the tiniest embedded Java virtual machines, or even in a low-end FPGA.", "paper_title": "Embedding a middleware for networked hardware and software objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300056"}
