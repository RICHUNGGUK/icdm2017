In this paper, we study the problem of sensor redistribution to build a ring-based shape for mobile sensor networks. We first give the theoretical analysis on what is optimal sensor movement with the given random deployment. Then, we propose a fully distributed movement control algorithm to achieve ring-based shape for mobile sensor networks. We formally prove that our algorithm can achieve a ring-based distribution within finite time. We also present the procedures of applying our algorithm to form multiring-based distribution. Finally, we present extensive simulations to verify that our approach outperforms other schemes in terms of both the moving distance and convergence time.", "paper_title": "Distributed Movement Control for Building a Ring in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333266600001"}
