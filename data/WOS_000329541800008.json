From higher contrast to better temporal resolution or more accurate color reproduction, modern displays are capable of showing images which are much closer to reality. In addition to this trend, we have recently seen the resurrection of stereo technology, which in turn fostered further interest on automultiscopic displays. These advances share the common objective of improving the viewing experience by means of a better reconstruction of the plenoptic function along any of its dimensions. In addition, one usual strategy is to leverage known aspects of the human visual system (HVS) to provide apparent enhancements, beyond the physical limits of the display. In this survey, we analyze these advances, categorize them along the dimensions of the plenoptic function, and present the relevant aspects of human perception on which they rely.
