As opposed to methods based on geometric idea, the algorithm is more suitable for CAD models, e.g. rapid prediction of blank shape in sheet metal forming for auto-body panels. Benefiting from proper preprocessing steps, rapid simulation of sheet metal forming and optimal initial solution guess, the proposed algorithm flattens meshes onto a plane with lower area distortion and minimizes the angular distortion. Some numerical examples of results generated by the new parameterization method are provided, and the corresponding analyses are given as well, such as distributions of strain, stress, thickness distribution and formability, etc. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
