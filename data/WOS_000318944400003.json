A comparison of GP-based classification with classical classifiers including support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, and random forest is conducted. In addition, the use of GP in discovering small knowledge-preserving subsets of features in high-dimensional datasets of haptic-based signatures is investigated and several approaches are explored. Subsets of features extracted from GP-generated models (analytic functions) are also exploited to determine the importance and relevance of different haptic data types (e.g., force, position, torque, and orientation) in user identity verification. The results revealed that GP classifiers compare favorably with the classical methods and use a much fewer number of attributes (with simple function sets).", "paper_title": "Identity Verification Based on Handwritten Signatures with Haptic Information Using Genetic Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000318944400003"}
