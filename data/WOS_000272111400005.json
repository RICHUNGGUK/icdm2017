Based on these properties, the L-2-stability of the fuzzy control systems, in which the proportional T-S fuzzy controller is utilized, is analyzed by using the well-known circle criterion. A sufficient condition with elegant graphical explanation in the frequency domain is next derived to guarantee the L-2-stability of the fuzzy control systems. Finally, the proposed sufficient condition is examined with two numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "L-2-STABILITY ANALYSIS OF PROPORTIONAL TAKAGI-SUGENO FUZZY CONTROLLER BASED CONTROL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272111400005"}
