The upper bound is met with equality only in some special cases. In this paper, we study a special case of the general wiretap channel with noiseless feedback (called non-degraded wiretap channel with noiseless feedback). Inner and outer bounds on the capacity-equivocation region of this special model are provided. The outer bound is achievable if the main channel is more capable than the wiretap channel. The inner bound is constructed especially for the case that the wiretap channel is more capable than the main channel. The results of this paper are further explained via binary and Gaussian examples. Compared with the capacity results for the non-degraded wiretap channel, we find that the security is enhanced by using the noiseless feedback.", "paper_title": "Capacity-Equivocation Region of a Special Case of Wiretap Channel with Noiseless Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000351478800003"}
