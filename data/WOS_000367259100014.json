Compared to existing memory simulators, NVMain 2.0 features a flexible user interface with compelling simulation speed and the capability of providing sub-array-level parallelism, fine-grained refresh, MLC and data encoder modeling, and distributed energy profiling.", "paper_title": "NVMain 2.0: A User-Friendly Memory Simulator to Model (Non-) Volatile Memory Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000367259100014"}
