The choices of the source community i and the destination one j are proportional to some power of the population of i (k(i)(alpha)) and j (k(j)(beta)), respectively. Both analytical calculation and numerical simulation show that the population distribution of communities in stationary states is determined by the parameters alpha and beta. The distribution is widely homogeneous with a characteristic size if alpha > beta. Whereas, for alpha < beta, the distribution is highly heterogeneous with the emergence of condensing phenomenon. Between the two regimes, alpha = beta, the distribution gradually shifts from the nonmonotonous (alpha < 0) to scale-free (alpha > 0).", "paper_title": "EXACT SOLUTION OF POPULATION REDISTRIBUTIONS IN A MIGRATION MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000324541100002"}
