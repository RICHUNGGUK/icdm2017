For example, blur variation is due to refractive index mismatch in three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy or due to atmospheric turbulence in astrophysical images. In this work, the space variant point spread function (PSF) is approximated by a convex combination of a set of space invariant blurring functions. The latter is jointly estimated with the image by optimizing a given criterion including l(1) and l(2) norms for regularizing the image and the PSFs. We prove, in the continuous setting, the existence of a solution to this optimization problem. We then propose an alternating optimization algorithm based on a scaled gradient projection method. We show the efficiency of the proposed method on simulated and real optical images.", "paper_title": "Space Variant Blind Image Restoration", "paper_id": "WOS:000346854900011"}
