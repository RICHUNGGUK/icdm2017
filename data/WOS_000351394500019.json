In this paper, based on improved quantization index modulation (IQIM) and improved difference expansion (IDE), a combined reversible watermarking scheme is proposed for 2-D CAD engineering graphics. The proposed scheme can solve the embedding-limitation problem existing in IQIM technique and increase the watermark embedding capacity greatly. Theoretical analysis and experimental results also show that the proposed scheme has good imperceptibility and robustness.", "paper_title": "A high capacity combined reversible watermarking scheme for 2-D CAD engineering graphics", "paper_id": "WOS:000351394500019"}
