In this paper, two different parity-preserving reversible error coding and detection circuits are studied. First we propose two new reversible Hamming code generator circuits. One of them is parity-preserve. We also propose a new parity-preserving reversible Hamming code error detector circuit. The proposed parity-preserving reversible Hamming code generator (PPHCG) and error detector circuits provide single error correction-double error detection (SEC-DED). The designs are better than the existing counterparts in terms of quantum cost (QC), number of constant inputs, and number of garbage outputs. Then we propose parity-preserving reversible cyclic code encoder/decoder circuits for the first time. A parity-preserving reversible D flip-flop is also proposed. Equivalent quantum representation of two parity-preserving 4*4 reversible gates, IG, and PPHCG, are also proposed. We show for the first time that IG has a QC of only 7 and PPHCG has a QC of only 6.", "paper_title": "NOVEL REVERSIBLE FAULT TOLERANT ERROR CODING AND DETECTION CIRCUITS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290857800008"}
