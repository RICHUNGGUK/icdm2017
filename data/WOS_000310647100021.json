It has been reported that the modeling accuracy is of 2nd-order when the conventional (2M)th-order space domain FD and the 2nd-order time domain FD stencils are directly used to solve the acoustic wave equation. Under the same discretization, the present version of time-space domain dispersion-relation-based FD method can improve the accuracy from 2nd-order to (2M) th-order along eight directions for the 2D acoustic wave equation. To increase the accuracy further, we propose a new FD stencil for 2D acoustic wave equation modeling. This new time-space domain dispersion-relation-based FD stencil can reach the same arbitrary even-order accuracy along all directions, and is more accurate and more stable than the conventional one for the same M. Dispersion analysis and modeling examples demonstrate its advantages. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
