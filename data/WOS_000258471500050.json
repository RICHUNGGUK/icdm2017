How well the underlying genetic architecture can be inferred by statistical methods such as mapping and association studies are active research areas. ForSim is a flexible forward evolutionary simulation tool for exploring the consequences of evolution by phenotype, whereby demographic, chance, behavioral and selective effects mold genetic architecture. Simulation is useful for exploring these issues as well as the choice of study design inferential methods.", "paper_title": "ForSim: a tool for exploring the genetic architecture of complex traits with controlled truth", "paper_id": "WOS:000258471500050"}
