Instead of considering AMC at the physical layer and ARQ at the data link layer separately, we propose a cross-layer design that combines these two layers judiciously to maximize either spectral efficiency or throughput. With ARQ correcting occasional packet errors at the data link layer, the stringent error control requirement is alleviated for the AMC at the physical layer. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed AMC-HARQ design outperforms either application of AMC only at the physical layer or incorporation of ARQ with fixed modulation and coding scheme.", "paper_title": "A Cross-Layer Design Combining of AMC with HARQ for DSRC Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000327648100001"}
