The interpolant is expressed in a closed form with three free parameters, which are computed based on minimizing the rotations of the normal plane vectors around the tangent and on controlling the length of the curve. The proposed choice of parameters is supported with the asymptotic analysis. The approximation error is of order four and the Euler-Rodrigues frame differs from the ideal rotation minimizing frame with the order three. The scheme is used for rigid body motions and swept surface construction. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
