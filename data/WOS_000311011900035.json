It can appropriately remove a periodic noise from an observed signal. The proposed adaptive comb filter uses a simple LMS algorithm to update the notch gain coefficient for removing the noise and preserving a desired signal, simultaneously. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed comb filter.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Comb Filter with Flexible Notch Gain", "paper_id": "WOS:000311011900035"}
