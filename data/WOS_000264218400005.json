We illustrate the use of the algorithm by developing belief function representations of the Following categorical relationships: \"AND.\" \"OR,\" \"exclusive OR (EOR)\" and \"not exclusive OR (NEOR),\" and \"AND-NEOR\" and of the following uncertain relationships: \"discounted AND,\" \"conditional OR:'and \"weighted average.\" Such representations tire needed to fully model and analyze a problem with a network Of interrelated variables under Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions. In addition, we compare our belief-function representation of the \"weighted average\" relationship with the \"weighted average\" representation developed and used by Shenoy and Shenoy (in Belief Functions in Business Decisions, edited by R. P. Srivastava and T. Mocks Heidelberg, Germany: Physica-Verlag; 2002; pp 316-332). We find that Shenoy and Shenoy representation of the weighted average relationship is an approximation and yields significantly different values Under certain conditions.
