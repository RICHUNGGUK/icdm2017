While many algorithms use the -norm as a convex relaxation of the ideal sparsifying function, we approach the problem with a smoothed -quasi-norm and present pROST, a method for robust online subspace tracking. The algorithm is based on alternating minimization on manifolds. Implemented on a graphics processing unit, it achieves realtime performance at a resolution of . Experimental results on a state-of-the-art benchmark for background subtraction on real-world video data indicate that the method succeeds at a broad variety of background subtraction scenarios, and it outperforms competing approaches when video quality is deteriorated by camera jitter.", "paper_title": "pROST: a smoothed l(p)-norm robust online subspace tracking method for background subtraction in video", "paper_id": "WOS:000337091200010"}
