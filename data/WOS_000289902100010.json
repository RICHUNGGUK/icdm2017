The difficulty of this approach to estimate the hybrid state of the semi-ballistic reentry vehicle (SBRV) is model-set design. This paper proposes a quasi-Monte Carlo model set that can ensure the estimator near-optimal in the sense of minimum mean square error (MMSE). The SBRV has a high nonlinearity and its mode is spanned by multiple parameters with known bounds. The design methods and characteristics of the quasi-Monte Carlo model set are given. The proposed model set has a higher accuracy than the model-set generated by the Monte Carlo method. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show the effectiveness and reasonability of the newly designed model set.", "paper_title": "Hybrid state estimation and model-set design of invariable-structure semi-ballistic reentry vehicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000289902100010"}
