However, most of them are not suitable for on-the-fly P2P systems and the most typical ones (IP based, shared secret and threshold cryptography) have several security and performance drawbacks. From the deficiencies of the existing schemes, in this paper we present a new decentralized certification scheme for on-the-fly P2P systems which is based on the recently published Internet Attribute Certificate Profile for Authorization. Our proposal greatly improves the security and flexibility of IP based and shared secret schemes with no infrastructure cost and with a minimal performance charge. Also, it achieves a similar level of security than threshold cryptography while highly reducing its computational and communicational cost. All these facts position our certification proposal as a users' admission alternative for on-the-fly P2P systems in non very hostile environments where performance and security are key factors.", "paper_title": "Decentralized certification scheme for secure admission in on-the-fly peer-to-peer systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000301870600001"}
