In this work, we present a semi-supervised support vector classifier that is designed using quasi-Newton method for nonsmooth convex functions. The proposed algorithm is suitable in dealing with very large number of examples and features. Numerical experiments on various benchmark datasets showed that the proposed algorithm is fast and gives improved generalization performance over the existing methods. Further, a non-linear semi-supervised SVM has been proposed based on a multiple label switching scheme. This non-linear semi-supervised SVM is found to converge faster and it is found to improve generalization performance on several benchmark datasets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
