This paper proposes nonsystematic M-ary codes capable of correcting these errors. The code is defined as a set of codewords that satisfy three conditions required to correct substitution, deletion/insertion, and adjacent-symbol-transposition errors. Since symbol-substitution errors in data entry systems are usually asymmetric, this paper also presents asymmetric-symbol-substitution error correcting codes capable of correcting deletion, insertion, and adjacent-symbol-transposition errors. For asymmetric-symbol-substitution error correction, we employ a mapping derived from the vertex coloring in an error directionality graph. The evaluation shows that the asymmetric codes have three to five times larger number of codewords than the symmetric codes.", "paper_title": "M-Ary Substitution/Deletion/Insertion/Adjacent-Symbol-Transposition Error Correcting Codes for Data Entry Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506600016"}
