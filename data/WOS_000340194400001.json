With reasonable loss of image quality, the proposed method can defeat existing forensic detectors that attempt to identify traces of the image JPEG compression history or JPEG anti-forensic processing. In our framework, first because of a total variation-based deblocking operation, the partly recovered DCT information is thereafter used to build an adaptive local dithering signal model, which is able to bring the DCT histogram of the processed image close to that of the original one. Then, a perceptual DCT histogram smoothing is carried out by solving a simplified assignment problem, where the cost function is established as the total perceptual quality loss due to the DCT coefficient modification. The second-round deblocking and decalibration operations successfully bring the image statistics that are used by the JPEG forensic detectors to the normal status. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in a better tradeoff between the JPEG forensic undetectability and the visual quality of processed images. Moreover, the application of the proposed anti-forensic method in disguising double JPEG compression artifacts is proven to be feasible by experiments.", "paper_title": "JPEG Anti-Forensics With Improved Tradeoff Between Forensic Undetectability and Image Quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000340194400001"}
