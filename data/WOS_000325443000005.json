However, they assumed that highly complex mathematical functions might generate the time-courses of all of the reactants of this pioneering enzyme-catalyzed reaction; however, this is a problem that has not been solved since its original publication in 1913. Their classic work on invertase-reaction dynamics was recently revisited anew using H-1 NMR spectroscopy, although despite Michaelis-Menten's vision of the possibility of mathematical solutions to describe the authentic (i.e. uninterrupted) invertase-reaction system, no-one has faced this challenge over this last century. Hence, the closed-form solutions of genuine invertase-reaction dynamics are now presented in this report.", "paper_title": "'Die Kinetik der Invertinwirkung' of L.
