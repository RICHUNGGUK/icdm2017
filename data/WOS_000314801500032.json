The proposed algorithms are extended to solve two-dimensional high even-order differential equations. The key to the efficiency of these algorithms is to construct compact combinations of Chebyshev polynomials of the third and fourth kinds as basis functions. The algorithms lead to linear systems with specially structured matrices that can be efficiently inverted. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed algorithms, and some comparisons with some other methods are made. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
