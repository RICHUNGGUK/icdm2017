It is found that the centroid formulae provided by the above paper are incorrect and have led to some misapplications. In this paper we present the Correct centroid formulae for fuzzy numbers and justify them from the viewpoint of analytical geometry. A numerical example demonstrates that Cheng's formulae can significantly alter the result of the ranking procedure. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
