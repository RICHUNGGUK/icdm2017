One strategy is concurrent engineering (CE) that focuses on improving the product development process, by the consideration of various factors associated with the life cycle of the product from the early stages. Design for manufacturing (DFM) has proven to be an effective approach to implement CE concept. Recently, an important DFM concept in product quality has drawn much attention from both academia and industry. This is because intense domestic and international competition has put more emphasis on quality. This study investigates the feasibility of integrating Ethernet-based vision system and assembly robot for the purpose of remote quality control. The accuracy and repeatability of the system were tested and verified over the Internet, prior to the quality inspection. The web-enabled quality check and robotic operations present many benefits, such as ubiquitous access, remote control/programming/ monitoring capability, and integration of production equipment into information networks for improved efficiency and product quality within the framework of CE and DFM.", "paper_title": "Remote control of quality using Ethernet vision and web-enabled robotic system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240563400004"}
