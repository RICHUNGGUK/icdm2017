We present a number of policies that can be applied to multi-use clusters where computers are shared between interactive users and high-throughput computing. We evaluate policies by trace-driven simulations to determine the effects on power consumed by the high-throughput workload and impact on high-throughput users. We further evaluate these policies for higher workloads by synthetically generating workloads based around the profiled workload observed through our system. We demonstrate that these policies could save 55% of the currently used energy for our high-throughput jobs over our current cluster policies without affecting the high-throughput users' experience.
