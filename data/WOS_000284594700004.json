Employing an abstract formulation of differential equations on function spaces, our framework includes Schrodinger equations in the semi-classical regime as well as parabolic initial-boundary value problems with high spatial gradients. We illustrate the general mechanism on the basis of the first-order Lie splitting and the second-order Strang splitting method. Further, we specify the local error representation for a fourth-order splitting scheme by Yoshida. From the given error estimate it is concluded that higher-order exponential operator splitting methods are favourable for the time-integration of linear Schrodinger equations in the semi-classical regime with critical parameter 0 < epsilon << 1, provided that the time stepsize h is sufficiently smaller than p root epsilon, where p denotes the order of the splitting method.", "paper_title": "An exact local error representation of exponential operator splitting methods for evolutionary problems and applications to linear Schrodinger equations in the semi-classical regime", "paper_id": "WOS:000284594700004"}
