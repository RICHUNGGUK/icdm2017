In the software engineering field, there are currently numerous capability and maturity models for assessing a set of specific software processes, but very few product maturity models for those interested in assessing the quality of software products. This paper presents a maturity model designed to directly assess the quality of a software product, i.e. the Software Product Quality Maturity Model (SPQ(MM)). This model is based on the six-sigma view of product quality and handles - in submodels - the three views of quality specified in ISO 9126, that is, the Software Product Internal Quality Maturity Model (SPIQ(MM)), the Software Product External Quality Maturity Model (SPEQ(MM)), and the Software Product Quality-in-Use Maturity Model (SPQiU(MM)).", "paper_title": "A Maturity Model of Software Product Quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000209183000003"}
