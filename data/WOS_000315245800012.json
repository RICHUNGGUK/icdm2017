It is assumed that the estimator can only receive the transmitted sequence of finite coded signals via a limited digital communication channel with missing measurements. Coder-decoder procedures are proposed for both continuous and discrete singular systems, in which compensation terms are introduced to meet the compatible requirement. Sufficient detection conditions involving the size of coding alphabet, the sampling period and data packet dropout rate are obtained. Finally, two examples are presented to illustrate the design procedures and effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
