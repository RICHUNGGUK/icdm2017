To this end, we extract detailed and intuitive descriptions of each participant's body movements, posture and behavior towards his interlocutor, and speech information. We apply a Gaussian Mixture Model-based approach which computes a mapping from a set of observed audio-visual cues to an underlying emotional state. We obtain promising results for tracking trends of participants' activation and dominance values, which outperform other regression-based approaches used in the literature. Additionally, we shed light into the way expressive body language is modulated by underlying emotional states in the context of dyadic interactions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
