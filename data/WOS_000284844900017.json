Because RAP is an NP-hard problem, and exact methods are only applicable to small instances, various heuristic and meta-heuristic methods have been proposed to solve it. In the literature, most studies on RAPs have been conducted for single-level systems. However, real-world engineering systems usually contain multiple levels. In this paper, the RAP on multi-level systems is investigated. A novel memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed to solve this problem. Two genetic operators, namely breadth-first crossover and breadth-first mutation, and a local search method are designed for the MA. Comprehensive experimental studies have shown that the proposed MA outperformed the state-of-the-art approach significantly on two representative examples.", "paper_title": "A Memetic Algorithm for Multi-Level Redundancy Allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000284844900017"}
