The proposed controller is robust and tuned by satisfying the multiple H 1 performance criteria to stabilize the system at multiple operating conditions. The design problem has been converted into a constrained nonlinear optimization problem with the time domain-based objective function which is solved by an augmented Lagrangian particle swarm optimization (ALPSO) algorithm. The proposed control scheme has been implemented on two nonlinear test systems. The nonlinear simulation results clearly verify that the designed controller with proposed model improves the dynamic stability of the case studies, particularly when the operating loadings changes.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF PWMSC CONTROLLER USING AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000341242600006"}
