Crest lines and their subsets have numerous applications in image analysis, face recognition, analysis and registration of anatomical structures, surface segmentation and non-photorealistic rendering. In this paper, a method is proposed for robust detection of crest lines. The proposed method is based on contextual information, the attributes of neighboring points. So it provides a basis of robustly detecting salient crest lines corresponding to potentially important features. Consequently, the algorithm is immune to noisy mesh and textured mesh with repeated bumps. Comparative results indicate that our algorithm yields favorable detection results and is effective.", "paper_title": "Robust detection of perceptually salient features on 3D meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000263099200008"}
