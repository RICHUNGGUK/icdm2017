For this purpose, complex machine tools equipped with machining components, such as multiple spindles and turrets have been developed by leading machine tool builders. The efficiency of complex machine tools is largely dependent on how the machining components are utilized. The main thrust of this paper is twofold: (1) Proposition of a nonlinear process planning based on the STEP-NC (STEP-compliant data interface for numerical controls) paradigm whose data model is formalized as ISO 14649, and (2) Development of an optimal Solution algorithm for process planning for complex machining. The developed algorithm is based on the branch-and-bound approach and heuristics derived from engineering insights. The developed process planning method and optimization algorithm were implemented and tested via the TurnSTEP system developed by our research team. Through the experiments, we are convinced that the new process planning and algorithm can be used as a fundamental means for implementing the third type of STEP-NC [Suh S.
