Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are employed to approximate the unknown continuous functions. Under some appropriate assumptions, it is proven that if the designed parameters in the controller and adaptive laws are suitably chosen, then all the signals (i.e., the system state, the parameter estimations and the control input) in the closed-loop system are bounded and the system state can converge to the origin in finite time. Effectiveness of the developed scheme is illustrated by a simulation example. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
