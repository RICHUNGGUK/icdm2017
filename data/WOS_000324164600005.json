Almost strictly total positivity is stronger, which could determine the positive minors while the other is zero. In this paper, a geometrical approach is proposed to prove the collection matrices of NUAT B-spline basis are almost strictly totally positive. In this paper, knot insertion algorithm combined with coefficient variation of NUAT B-spline function, we put forward an intuitive and geometrical method.", "paper_title": "Almost strictly total positivity of NUAT B-spline basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000324164600005"}
