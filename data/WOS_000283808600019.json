We pose the following question how does the self-sustainability of a swarm vary as a function of content popularity the service capacity of the users and the size of the file? We present a model to answer the posed question We then propose efficient solution methods to compute self-sustainability The accuracy of our estimates is validated against simulations Finally, we also provide closed-form expressions for the fraction of time that a given number of blocks is collectively held by peers (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Estimating self-sustainability in peer-to-peer swarming systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283808600019"}
