Then HLO is applied to solve the well-known 5.100 and 10.100 multi-dimensional knapsack problems from the OR-library and the performance of HLO is compared with that of other meta-heuristics collected from the recent literature. The experimental results show that the presented HLO achieves the best performance in comparison with other meta-heuristics, which demonstrates that HLO is a promising optimization tool.
