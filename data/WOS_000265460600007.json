The dispersion-relation-preserving compact scheme has been rigorously developed within the three-stencil point framework through the dispersion and dissipation analyses. To verify the proposed method, several problems that are amenable to the exact and benchmark solutions will be investigated. The results with good rates of convergence are demonstrated for all the investigated problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
