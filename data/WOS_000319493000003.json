The commonly used method is a nonparametric approach based on the Poisson regression, which however could be unduly affected by the dependence among test statistics and perform very poorly under strong dependence. In this paper, we explore a finite mixture model based geometric modeling approach to empirical null distribution estimation and multiple hypothesis testing. Through simulations and applications to two public microarray data, we will illustrate its competitive performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
