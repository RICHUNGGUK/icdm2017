It has been employed to cope with numerous challenging tasks. Inspired by the idea of Pareto-dominance-based ranking, in this paper, we propose a modified HS method for solving the constrained optimization problems. A few nonlinear functions and three engineering design problems are also used to demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of our new HS method.", "paper_title": "A MODIFIED HARMONY SEARCH METHOD IN CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000281745700029"}
