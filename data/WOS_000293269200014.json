The model takes into account the compressibility of both phases (liquid and vapour) and use a barotropic equation of state which relates pressure and density to calculate the growth of cavitation. Furthermore, turbulence effects have been introduced using a RNG k-epsilon model. The comparison of both fuels in a real diesel injector nozzle has been performed in terms of mass flow, momentum flux, effective velocity at the outlet and cavitation appearance. The decrease of injection velocity and cavitation intensity for the biodiesel noticed by numerical simulation at different injection conditions, predict a worse air-fuel mixing process.
