We use some recent results on the achievable rates of finite-length codes to analyze the system performance. With codewords of finite length, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities of INR HARQ and study the throughput in the cases with variable-length coding. Moreover, we evaluate the effect of feedback delay on the throughput and derive sufficient conditions for the usefulness of the HARQ protocols, in terms of power-limited throughput. The results show that, for a large range of HARQ feedback delays, the throughput is increased by finite-length coding INR HARQ, if the sub-codeword lengths are properly adapted.", "paper_title": "Finite Block-Length Analysis of the Incremental Redundancy HARQ", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681600021"}
