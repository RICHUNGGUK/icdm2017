In this paper we derive this distribution. The key building blocks in the derivation of the distribution are the classical ballot theorem and its generalized forms.", "paper_title": "The distribution of the number of arrivals in a subinterval of a busy period of a single server queue", "paper_id": "WOS:000238277600001"}
