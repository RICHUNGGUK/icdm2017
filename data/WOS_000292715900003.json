The proposed model is used to minimize the step response overshoots considering the stator and rotor tooth geometry. Design/methodology/approach - A strongly coupled field-circuit model considering magnetic nonlinearity of the stepper motor is presented. As the main contribution, the Nelder-Mead method of the motor geometry optimization that minimize the step response overshoots and positioning error is proposed. Findings - The proposed method can be applied to obtain the optimal tooth/pole geometry of the stepper motor which is efficient to perform the possibly accurate positioning. Originality/value - The paper examines the application of the presented optimization method to minimize the positioning error of the four-phased variable reluctance stepper motor.", "paper_title": "Step response optimization method of switched reluctance motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000292715900003"}
