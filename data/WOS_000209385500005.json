The archive comprises all the public data currently available (revolutions 0026-1079, i.e., December 2002-August 2011). INTEGRAL data are downloaded from the ISDC Data Centre for Astrophysics, Geneva, on a regular basis as they become public and a customized analysis using the OSA 9.0 software package is routinely performed on the IBIS/ISGRI data. The scientific products include individual pointing images and the associated detected source lists in the 17-30, 30-50, 17-50 and 50-100 key energy bands, as well as light-curves binned over 100 s in the 17-30 key band for sources of interest. Dedicated scripts to handle such vast datasets and results have been developed. We make the analysis tools to build such an archive publicly available. The whole database (raw data and products) enables an easy access to the hard X-ray long-term behaviour of a large sample of sources. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
