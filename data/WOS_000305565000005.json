The subspace is not necessarily (and actually is usually not) the same for different clusters within one clustering solution. In this article, the problems motivating subspace clustering are sketched, different definitions and usages of subspaces for clustering are described, and exemplary algorithmic solutions are discussed. Finally, we sketch current research directions. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "Subspace clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000305565000005"}
