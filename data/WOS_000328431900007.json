The proposed methodology is applied to a 40 nm Carry Look Ahead Adder (CIA). The CIA is implemented mainly using GDI full-swing F1 and F2 gates, which are the counterparts of standard CMOS NAND and NOR gates. A 16-bit GDI CIA was designed in a 40 nm low power TSMC process. The CIA, implemented according to the proposed methodology, presents full functionality and robustness under global and local process variations at wide range of supply voltages. Simulation results show 2 x area reduction, 5 x improvement in dynamic energy dissipation and 4 x decrease in leakage, with a slight (24%) degradation in performance, when compared to the CMOS CIA. Advanced design metrics of GDI cells, such as minimum energy point (MEP) operation and minimum leakage vector (MLV), are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
