We show that if v is an involutory antimorphism of A*, then the right and left v-palindromic closures of any factor of v-standard word are also factors of some v-standard word. We also introduce the class of pseudostandard words with \"seed\", obtained by iterated pseudopalindrome closure starting from a nonempty word. We show that pseudostandard words with seed are morphic images of standard episturmian words. Moreover, we prove that for any given pseudostandard word s with seed, all sufficiently long left special factors of s are prefixes of it.", "paper_title": "ON SOME PROBLEMS RELATED TO PALINDROME CLOSURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000260796400004"}
