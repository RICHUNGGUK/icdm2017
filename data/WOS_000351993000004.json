Because of high computational cost and slow convergence of iterative reconstruction algorithms, these methods are not widely used in practice. In this paper, we propose a hybrid iterative algorithm by combining multigrid method, Tikhonov regularization and Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) for reconstruction of the computed tomography image that reduces this drawback. To do so, we reduce the time and the volume of computations considerably by finding astable and appropriate starting point. The experimental results indicate that the proposed iterative algorithm has more rapid convergence and reconstructs high quality images in short computational time than the classical ones.", "paper_title": "A HYBRID ITERATIVE ALGORITHM FOR RECONSTRUCTION OF X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY", "paper_id": "WOS:000351993000004"}
