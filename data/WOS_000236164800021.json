We show from Bayesian decision theory that D-LDA is actually a special case of LDA by directly taking the linear space of class means as the LDA solution. The pooled covariance estimate is completely ignored. Furthermore, we demonstrate that D-LDA is not equivalent to traditional subspace-based LDA in dealing with the Small Sample Size problem. As a result, D-LDA may impose a significant performance limitation in general applications. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
