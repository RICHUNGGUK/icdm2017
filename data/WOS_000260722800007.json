More and more applications are featuring data streams, rather than finite stored data sets, which are a challenge for traditional classification algorithms. Concept drifts and skewed distributions, two common properties of data stream applications, make the task of learning in streams difficult. The authors aim to develop a new approach to classify skewed data streams that uses an ensemble of models to match the distribution over under-samples of negatives and repeated samples of positives.", "paper_title": "Classifying Data Streams with Skewed Class Distributions and Concept Drifts", "paper_id": "WOS:000260722800007"}
