Burst-mode receivers (BMRs) are critical components in the design of the optical line terminal in PONs. Here we investigate multigigabit per second, differentiator-based, edge detection by simulation and experiment. The main features include: differentiator resistance-capacitance (RC) constant, comparator holding time, channel bandwidth, and the impact of consecutive identical digits. Our experimental results show excellent functionality in the PON environment with commercially available optical and electronic components. Differentiator edge-detection results compare favorably with the alternative ac- and dc-coupled methods at gigabit data rates. Finally, RC edge detection provides a greatly enhanced clock signal, thus mitigating the well-known BMR synchronization problem.
