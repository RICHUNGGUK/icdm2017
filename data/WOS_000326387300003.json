In traditional channel assignment strategy of MAC layer, nodes do not consider the demands to channel resources of other nodes, which hinders improving the network performance. Practically, in the network based on competitive MAC protocol, each node tries to maximize its payoff, while this interferes with the behavior of other nodes at the same time. Game theory is an effective tool to solve problems of distributed resources, which can be used effectively in channel assignment. In this paper, we propose a new protocol, namely, DGPCI-DCA (Dynamic Game with Perfect and Complete Information based Dynamic Channel Assignment). When all the nodes are rational and greedy, each node selects channels dynamically by backward induction according to strategies of other nodes, thus Nash equilibrium can finally be achieved. Experiments show that the network performance is effectively improved, i.e., the throughput and saturation throughput can be increased, and the packet loss rate and network delay can be reduced.", "paper_title": "Dynamic game with perfect and complete information based dynamic channel assignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000326387300003"}
