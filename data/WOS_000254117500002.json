Recently, several research groups have presented promising preliminary results on the benefit of extending the cognitive process at the system level, capable of perceiving current network conditions and then acting according to end-to-end goals. System optimization however implies some challenging tasks: (1) Current network state information has to be known at all transmitters. This dramatically increases the amount of overhead as the number of parameters becomes large; (2) System optimization is often a non-linear problem with inter-parameter dependencies; (3) The optimization process should also support a dynamic quality of service (QoS) management scheme depending on the available network resources. In this paper, we invoke genetic algorithms (GAs) for iteratively finding the optimum parameters based on the acknowledgment (ACK) signal only. Neither network state information nor channel estimation is required. The set of accurate objective functions that we derive in our GA implementation control the optimization process at the system level toward any QoS. Simulation results show that our implementation achieves comparable performance to an exhaustive search over the whole set of parameters for which perfect network state information at the transmitter is assumed. It also outperforms the conventional scheme for which parameters are optimized at each layer separately. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
