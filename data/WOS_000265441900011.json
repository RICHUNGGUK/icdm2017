The interesting case of such interactions was observed as a coupling across an intramolecular hydrogen bond in 8-bromo-2',3'-O- isopropylideneadenosine between the -CH2OH (at 5 '' proton) group and the nitrogen atom of adenine. In this paper we report theoretical investigations on the (4h)J(NH) coupling across the H ''-C-O-H center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bond in adenosine derivatives in various solvent models.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study of spin-spin coupling across the hydrogen (O-H center dot center dot center dot N) bond in adenosine derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000265441900011"}
