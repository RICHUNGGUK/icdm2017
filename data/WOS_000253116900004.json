Thus, early stages of the new product development process involve both technical activities, e.g. product platform definition and commercial activities, e.g. bidding for contracts. This paper introduces a bidding-based product conceptualization and partner selection (PCPS) system to help companies coordinate the two aspects. For product platform generation and eliciting bidding criteria, a well-established requirement acquisition technique known as general sorting was adapted and employed. In this regard, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network was used to select preferred design options for bidding purpose. To effectively select partners participating in a collaborative design and bidding process, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique was subsequently employed for finalizing the product concept and supply chain. A case study on cellular phone design was then applied for illustrating the proposed prototype system. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
