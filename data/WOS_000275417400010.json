Its definition refers to \"page co-link analysis\", as links are provided by URLs or pages. This paper presents a new methodological approach, a \"site co-link analysis\", to investigate relations in small networks. The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation institutes were used as a case study. The results indicate that the number of co-links provided by sites led to an increase of 133% in the sample analyzed. In a cluster analysis, three clusters were formed mainly for thematic reasons and four institutes remained isolated.", "paper_title": "Site co-link analysis applied to small networks: a new methodological approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000275417400010"}
