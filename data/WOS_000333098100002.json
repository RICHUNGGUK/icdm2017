The reliable detection of image forgeries requires, therefore, a battery of complementary tools that exploit different image properties. Techniques based on the photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU) noise are among the most valuable such tools, since they do not detect the inserted object but rather the absence of the camera PRNU, a sort of camera fingerprint, dealing successfully with forgeries that elude most other detection strategies. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect image forgeries using sensor pattern noise. Casting the problem in terms of Bayesian estimation, we use a suitable Markov random field prior to model the strong spatial dependences of the source, and take decisions jointly on the whole image rather than individually for each pixel. Modern convex optimization techniques are then adopted to achieve a globally optimal solution and the PRNU estimation is improved by resorting to nonlocal denoising. Large-scale experiments on simulated and real forgeries show that the proposed technique largely improves upon the current state of the art, and that it can be applied with success to a wide range of practical situations.", "paper_title": "A Bayesian-MRF Approach for PRNU-Based Image Forgery Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000333098100002"}
