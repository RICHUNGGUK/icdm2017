The time-delay is unknown and time-varying with known bounds. Based on Lyapunov functional approach combined with LMIs techniques, the delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the existence of the non-fragile observer-based H-infinity controller are given. Under the control of the non-fragile observer-based H-infinity controller, the resulting closed-loop system not only is robust stochastic exponential stable in the mean square but also satisfies the H-infinity performance level. A numerical example with simulation is given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Non-fragile observer-based H-infinity control for neutral stochastic hybrid systems with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000300280100004"}
