The main contents include parallel computer system which is the hardware platform of parallel computing, parallel algorithm which is the theoretical base of parallel computing, parallel programming which is the software support of parallel computing. After that, we also introduce some parallel applications and enabling technologies. We argue that parallel computing research should form an integrated methodology of \"architecture-algorithm-programming-application\". Only in this way, parallel computing research becomes continuous development and more realistic.", "paper_title": "Study on parallel computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240962200005"}
