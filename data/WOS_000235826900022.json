In particular, we study the effect of changing the finite field basis on the minimal polynomials, and thus on the linear complexity, of sequences defined over GF(2(n)) but given in their binary representation. Let a = {a(i)} be a sequence over GF(2(n)). Then a(i) can be represented by a(i) = Sigma(n-1)(j=0) a(ij)alpha(j), a(ij) is an element of GF(2), where a is the root of the irreducible polynomial defining the field. Consider the sequence b = {b(i)} whose elements are obtained from the same binary representation of a but assuming a different set of basis (say (y(0), y(1),..., y(n-1)}) i.e., b(i) = Sigma(r-1)(j=0)a(ij)gamma(j). We study the relation between the minimal polynomial of a and b. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
