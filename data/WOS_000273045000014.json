In this paper a new symmetric key cryptosystem that exploits the idea of nonlinear mappings and their fixed points to encrypt information is presented. Furthermore, a measure of the quality of the keys used is introduced. The experimental results indicate that the proposed cryptosystem is efficient and secure to ciphertext-only attacks. Finally, three modifications of the basic cryptosystem that render it more robust are presented and efficiency issues are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
