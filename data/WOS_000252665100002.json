Our initial characterization, in the spirit of Post (1994, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 50, 284-316), oft lie degrees of the immune and hyperimmune n-enumerable sets leads to a number of results setting other immunity properties in the context of the Turing and wtt-degrees derived from the Ershov hierarchy. For instance, We Show that ally)n-enumerable hyperhyperimmune set must be co-enumerable, for each n >= 2. The situation with regard to the wtt-degrees is particularly interesting, as demonstrated by I range of results concerning the wtt-predecessors of hypersimple sets. Finally, we give a number of results directed at characterizing basic classes of n-enumerable degrees in terms of natural information content. For example, a 2-enumerable degree contains a 2-enumerable dense immune set iff it contains a 2-enumerable r-cohesive set iff it bounds a high enumerable set. This result is extended to a characterization of n-enumerable degrees which bound high enumerable degrees. Furthermore, a characterization for n-enumerable degrees bounding Only low(2) enumerable degrees is given.", "paper_title": "Post's programme for the Ershov hierarchy", "paper_id": "WOS:000252665100002"}
