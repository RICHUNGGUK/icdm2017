Motivated by the recent findings on the predictability of human behavior patterns in data networks, and the emergence of highly capable handheld devices, our design aims to smooth out the network traffic over time and minimize the data delivery costs. Our framework utilizes proactive data services as well as smart content recommendation schemes for shaping the demand. Proactive data services take place during the off-peak hours based on a statistical prediction of a demand profile for each user, whereas smart content recommendation assigns modified valuations to data items so as to render the users' demand less uncertain. Hence, our recommendation scheme aims to boost the performance of proactive services within the allowed flexibility of user requirements. We conduct theoretical performance analysis that quantifies the leveraged cost reduction through the proposed framework. We show that the cost reduction scales at the same rate as the cost function scales with the number of users. Furthermore, we prove that demand shaping through smart recommendation strictly reduces the incurred cost even below that of proactive downloads without recommendation.", "paper_title": "Proactive Content Download and User Demand Shaping for Data Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000367100900017"}
