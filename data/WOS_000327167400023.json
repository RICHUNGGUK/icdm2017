In this paper, one organization of on-chip data memory called LIBODM (Lifetime Based On-chip Data Memory) is proposed to reduce the reference delay for data and on-chip data memory size in RCP. In the LIBODM, the allocation of data is based on the data dependency. The data with low data dependency are stored off-chip to save the storage costs, while the data with high data dependency are stored on-chip to reduce the reference delay. Besides, in the LIBODM, the on-chip data are classified into two types, and the classification is based on the lifetime of data. For short lifetime data, they are preferred to be stored into FIFO to increase the reuse ratio of memory space naturally. For long lifetime data, they are preferred to be stored into RAM for several time references. The LIBODM has been testified in one CGRA (Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Architecture) called RPU (Reconfigurable Processing Unit), and two RPUs has been integrated in a RCP-REMUS_HP (High Performance version of Reconfigurable MUlti-media System) focused on video decoding. Thanks to the LIBODM, although the size of on-chip data memory in REMUS_HP is small, a high performance can still be achieved. Compared with XPP and ADRES, in REMUS_HP, the on-chip data memory size at same performance level is only 23.9% and 14.8%. REMUS_HP is implemented on a 48.9 mm(2) silicon with TSMC 65nm technology. Simulation shows that 1920* 1088 @30 fps can be achieved for H.264 high-profile decoding when exploiting a 200 MHz working frequency. Compared with the high performance version of XPP, the performance is 150% boosted, while the energy efficiency is 17.59x boosted.", "paper_title": "The Organization of On-Chip Data Memory in One Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000327167400023"}
