ABC is a heuristic algorithm with simple structure, ease of implementation and robustness. A nonlinear factor for convergence control is introduced in the algorithm to enhance the balance of global and local searches. To investigate the applicability of this proposed technique to system identification, three examples are studied under different conditions regarding data availability, noise pollution level, priori knowledge of parameters, etc. Simulation results show the proposed technique produces excellent parameter estimation, even with few measurements and high noise corruptions.
