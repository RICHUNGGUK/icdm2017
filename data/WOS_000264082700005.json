The network is a dense wavelength division multiplex overlay over legacy time division multiplexed passive optical networks (PONs), each operating in its native format. A single such fiber plant deployment can support multiple logical PONs, each operating on a unique wavelength pair. This stack of logical PONs can be configured for optimal bandwidth delivery to the end user by controlling the number of optical network units (ONUs) supported in every such logical PON. Microring-resonator-based optical routers are used to dynamically manage the logical network topology to control the number of ONUs supported per logical PON. We present techniques to calculate an optimal network configuration and its use in a typical evolving access scenario. The network view from a data transport perspective and from a control and management perspective is also presented.
