This is achieved by considering user concerns, task significances, affordances, and emotional responses as the interaction components and by exploring behavior sequences for a goal in using a product the first time. The tasks in the same group at each level in the user concern structure are therefore in a competing relationship in going up to a higher task. The task tree with the significances and the affordance probabilities can be analyzed. The order of a user's exploring behavior sequences can be determined through comparisons of the expected significances, which can be obtained by the modified subjective expected utility theory. A user's emotional responses for the tasks that a behavior sequence is composed of can be calculated by the modified decision affect theory. Here, the emotional response refers to a user's internal reactions for the degree to which a product's affordance features can meet his or her mental model in use. The average emotional response for a behavior sequence can be a user's decisional factor for the optimal use method in using a product with a goal. Also, the design problems of a product can be checked from users' point of view, and the emotional losses/changes by usage failures can be discussed. For an illustrative purpose, the proposed model is applied to a numerical example with some assumptions.", "paper_title": "User Behavior Model Based on Affordances and Emotions: A New Approach for an Optimal Use Method in Product-User Interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000355344100001"}
