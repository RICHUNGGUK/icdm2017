Solving X(Y) projects an instrumental reading back onto the scale of measurements as an object of pivotal interest. The arrays of instrumental readings are projected in this manner in practice, yielding arrays of calibrated measurements, typically subject to errors of calibration. The effects of calibration errors on the properties of calibrated measurements are examined here under linear calibration. Irregularities arise as induced dependencies, inflated variances, non-standard distributions, inconsistent sample means, the underestimation of measurement variance, and other unintended consequences. On the other hand, conventional properties are seen to remain largely in place in the use of selected regression diagnostics and in one-way comparative experiments using calibrated data.", "paper_title": "Irregularities in X(Y) from Y(X) in linear calibration", "paper_id": "WOS:000324730900002"}
