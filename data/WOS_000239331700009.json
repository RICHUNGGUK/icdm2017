Design/methodology/approach - Empirical evidence is gathered though a survey data conducted with 159 firms in the wireless communication sector. The paper tests the assumption that the two safeguarding mechanisms are used to a greater extent in interdependency-intensive networks than in other supply chain contexts. Findings - This empirical study suggests that: in a network-dependent context, relational investments allow firms to safeguard their portfolios of relationships; electronic collaboration seems to be a safeguarding mechanism for firms in downstream-dependent network contexts; in general, firms appear to use both relational investments and electronic collaboration to manage their relationships in a supply chain network; and the knowledge-based theory may explain the strong relationship between upstream and downstream use of electronic collaboration. Research limitations/implications - Overall, the present study complements the extant literature on supply chain management and inter-firm electronic collaboration by showing how an important structural characteristic of supply chain networks (i.e. dependency) operates on the choice of using two key safeguarding mechanisms. Practical implications - Results stress the importance of these safeguarding mechanisms in joint actions such as collabonative planning, forecasting and replenishment. Originality/value - The paper addresses interdependencies from a network perspective which encompasses the firms' complete portfolio of relationships.", "paper_title": "Safeguarding mechanisms in a supply chain network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239331700009"}
