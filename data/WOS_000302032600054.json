Recognizers play an important role in this field, allowing the interpretation of the user's intention, but they still present some important lacks. This paper proposes a new recognition paradigm using an agent-based architecture that does not depend on the drawing sequence and takes context information into account to help decisions. Another improvement is the absence of operation modes, that is, no button is needed to distinguish geometry from symbols or gestures, and also \"interspersing\" and \"overtracing\" are accomplished.
