First, MA 5 is relevant to NASDAQ, whereas MA 10 is relevant to SSEC, which indicates that the trend of NASDAQ is more stable than that of SSEC. Second, different nonlinear mechanisms exist in the two stock markets, such that MA 10 and SAR have a nonlinear correlation to SSEC and NASDAQ, respectively. This finding indicates that the volatility reversion of NASDAQ is faster than SSEC. In addition, the relationship of middle Bollinger Bands (mavg) with SSEC is linear, whereas that with NASDAQ is nonlinear. Third, the most significant impact on SSEC is from CMF, whereas that on NASDAQ is from Average Directional Index (ADX). This result indicates the existence of more speculative behavior in SSEC than in NASDAQ.", "paper_title": "Difference Between Chinese and US Stock Markets: Determinants, Mechanisms, and Impact", "paper_id": "WOS:000370190600004"}
