It is thus important to produce defect free high quality garment products. Inspection processes done on fabric industries are mostly manual hence time consuming. To reduce error on identifying fabric defects requires automotive and accurate inspection process. Considering this lacking, this research implements a Textile Defect detector. A multi-layer neural network is determined that best classifies the specific problems. To feed neural network the digital fabric images taken by a digital camera and converts the RGB images are first converted into binary images by restoration process and local threshold techniques, then three different features are determined for the actual input to the neural network, which are the area of the defects, number of the objects in a image and finally the shape factor. The develop system is able to identify two very commonly defects such as Holes and Scratches and other types of minor defects. The developed system is very suitable for Least Developed Countries, identifies the fabric defects within economical cost and produces less error prone inspection system in real time.", "paper_title": "A suitable neural network to detect textile defects", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100048"}
