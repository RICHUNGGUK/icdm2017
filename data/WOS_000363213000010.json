Research shows that people conduct collaborative information searches while planning their travel activities online. However, little is known in depth about tourists' online collaborative search. This study examines tourists' collaborative information search behavior in detail, including their search stages, online search strategies, and information flow breakdowns. The data for analysis included pre- and postsearch questionnaires, web search and chat logs, and postsearch interviews. A model of tourist collaborative information retrieval was developed. The model identified collaborative planning, collaborative information searching, sharing of information, and collaborative decision making as four stages of tourists' collaborative search. The results show that tourists collaborated by planning their search strategies, dividing search tasks into subtasks and allocating workload, using search queries and URL links recommended by teammates, and discussing search results together. Related personal knowledge and experiences appeared important in trip planning and collaborative information search. During the collaborative search, tourists also encountered various information flow breakdowns in different search stages. These were classified and their effects on collaborative information search were reported. Implications for system design in support of collaborative information retrieval in travel contexts are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Understanding tourists' collaborative information retrieval behavior to inform design", "paper_id": "WOS:000363213000010"}
