These algorithms consider the jobs one at a time or in a batch. The latter can be potentially useful to minimize the resource conflict between multiple consecutive requests. Extensive simulations using both real world networks and random topologies show that the greedy strategy, which process requests one at a time, can perform comparable to batch scheduling and is significantly better in terms of computational time requirement. Further, this strategy can be extended to reduce the path switching overheads.", "paper_title": "In-advance path reservation for file transfers in e-science applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000299509500004"}
