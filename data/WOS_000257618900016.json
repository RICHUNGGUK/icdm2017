It proposes and analyses network architectures that integrate Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) with Optical Burst Switched (OBS) network technology in a unified manner. It demonstrates that the proposed SIP-enabled OBS network can be used to manage application sessions and provide network and IT services according to the application requirements. Furthermore, various SIP over OBS layering architectures, utilizing a number of end-to-end resource discovery protocols (both for network and non-network (IT) resources) are presented and analyzed. Finally, this paper reports on the validation of functionalities, mechanisms and protocols for the proposed SIP-enabled OBS network, from the node level to the network level, through a test-bed demonstrator.
