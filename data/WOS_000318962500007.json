This paper presents a series of investigations aimed to find answers for two important questions, one is \"Are there advantageous locations when releasing a robot for speedier chemical source localisation with no prior knowledge about the environment as well as the possible location of the source?\" The other question is similar but focusing on whether a different surge distance makes any noticeable differences. To find the answers, a simulated autonomous robot and an indoor office-like environment which contains an odour/gas source emitting varying chemical concentration levels as well as constantly varied wind speeds and directions, were adopted.
