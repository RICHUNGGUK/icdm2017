In this paper, a 4-DOF dexterous endoscopic parallel manipulator for MIS is designed and implemented. The manipulator is developed based on the concept of virtual chain and screw theory. The manipulator consists of four links; two links are 2-PUU (each leg consists of one active prismatic joint and two passive hook joints); the other two links are 2-PUS (each leg consists of one active prismatic join, one passive hook joint and one passive spherical joint). The inverse and forward kinematics solutions are derived analytically and numerically, respectively. The singularity analysis is investigated using screws algebra. The manipulator workspace is obtained using MATLAB software. The known problem of limited bending angles found in previous existing surgical manipulators was solved as the proposed manipulator can reach +/- 90 degrees in any direction. The proposed surgical manipulator is designed, manufactured and tested successfully. The system model utilizing PID and PI controllers has been built using MATLAB software. Co-simulation using ADAMS/MATLAB software is implemented to validate the achieved bending angles and the proposed tracking control. The results show that the performance of the tracking control is satisfactory since the tracking error is about 2.5%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
