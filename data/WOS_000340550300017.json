Our approach is based on rapid generation of facial disparity maps, requiring neither expensive devices nor generic face models. It consists in incorporating face properties into the disparity estimation process to enhance the 3D face reconstruction. We propose a model-based method that is independent from the specific stereo algorithm used. Our method is a two-step process. First, an algorithm based on the Active Shape Model (ASM) is proposed to acquire a disparity model specific to the face concerned. Second, using this model as a guidance, the dense disparity is calculated and the depth map is estimated. Besides, an original post-processing algorithm is proposed in order to detect holes and spikes in the generated depth maps caused by wrong matches and uncertainties. It is based on the smoothness property of the face and a local and global analysis of the image. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the reconstruction accuracy and the speed of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Rapid and accurate face depth estimation in passive stereo systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340550300017"}
