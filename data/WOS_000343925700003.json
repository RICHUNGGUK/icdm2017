This study shows how to construct some families of rotation symmetric functions which are balanced or plateaued. The authors also consider vectorial Boolean functions [that is, maps from GF(2)(n) to GF(2)(m)] which are k-rotation symmetric and they give two infinite families of such functions which are permutations with the maximum possible algebraic degree. The families of functions that they give provide a source, which can be searched for functions with other useful cryptographic properties.", "paper_title": "Families of rotation symmetric functions with useful cryptographic properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000343925700003"}
