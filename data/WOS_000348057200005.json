We show that these models can be used to develop 3D content creation algorithms that can convert monocular 2D videos into statistically natural 3D-viewable videos. First, accurate depth information on key frames is obtained via human annotation. Then, both forward and backward motion vectors are estimated and compared to decide the initial depth values, and a compensation process is applied to further improve the depth initialization. Then, the luminance/chrominance and initial depth map are decomposed by a Gabor filter bank. Each subband of depth is modeled to produce a NSS prior term. The statistical color-depth priors are combined with the spatial smoothness constraint in the depth propagation target function as a prior regularizing term. The final depth map associated with each frame of the input 2D video is optimized by minimizing the target function over all subbands. In the end, stereoscopic frames are rendered from the color frames and their associated depth maps. We evaluated the quality of the generated 3D videos using both subjective and objective quality assessment methods. The experimental results obtained on various sequences show that the presented method outperforms several state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D conversion methods.", "paper_title": "Toward Naturalistic 2D-to-3D Conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000348057200005"}
