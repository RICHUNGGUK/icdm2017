In this paper, we investigate a quantitative automaton model and a quantitative logic for nested words. The behavior resp. the semantics map nested words to weights which are taken from a strong bimonoid. Strong bimonoids can be viewed as semirings without requiring the distributivity assumption which was essential in the classical theory of formal power series; strong bimonoids include e.g. all bounded lattices and many other structures from multi-valued logics. Our main results show that weighted nested word automata and suitable weighted MSO logics are expressively equivalent. This extends the classical Buchi-Elgot result from words to a weighted setting for nested words.", "paper_title": "WEIGHTED NESTED WORD AUTOMATA AND LOGICS OVER STRONG BIMONOIDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000341493500008"}
