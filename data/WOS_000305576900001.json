Frequent clustering process of classical controlling methods, such as LEACH, is apt to cause serious energy consuming. Some improved methods reduced re-clustering frequency, but these methods sometimes lead to energy imbalance in the stable communication period. In this paper, a hierarchical topology controlling method BCHED is proposed. With double round clustering mechanism, BCHED activates a local re-clustering process between two rounds of data transmission, and with optional cluster head exchanging mechanism, BCHED reorganize the node clusters according to their residual energy distribution. Experimental results show that, with BCHED, the energy balance performance of WSN system is significantly improved, and the system lifetime can be effectively extended.", "paper_title": "BCHED - Energy Balanced Sub-Round Local Topology Management for Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000305576900001"}
