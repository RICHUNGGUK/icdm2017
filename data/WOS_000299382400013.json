A hierarchical support vector machines (H-SVM) scheme is proposed with the following advantages. First, H-SVM offers an efficient evaluation procedure in a distributed manner due to hierarchical structure. Second, H-SVM could determine these parameters based only on simpler network information, e.g., the hop counts, without requiring particular ranging hardware. Third, the exact mean and the variance of the estimation error introduced by H-SVM are derived which are seldom addressed in previous works. Furthermore, we present a parallel learning algorithm to reduce the computation time required for the proposed H-SVM. Thanks for the quicker matrix diagonization technique, our algorithm can reduce the traditional SVM learning complexity from O(n(3)) to O(n(2)) where n is the training sample size. Finally, the simulation results verify the validity and effectiveness for the proposed H-SVM with parallel learning algorithm.", "paper_title": "Determination of Wireless Networks Parameters through Parallel Hierarchical Support Vector Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000299382400013"}
