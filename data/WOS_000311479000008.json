By introducing some scalars into matrix cross-term bounding technique, we present a new approach for the state feedback controller, with less conservatism, based on the Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs) and the descriptor model transformation. We further extend the method to robust H infinity control considering both disturbances and parametric uncertainties. For the BMI problem which is difficult to be solved directly, a modified optimisation algorithm is proposed. The practicability, less conservatism and effectiveness of the results are demonstrated by two examples.", "paper_title": "Stability of discrete-time networked control systems and its extension for robust H infinity control", "paper_id": "WOS:000311479000008"}
