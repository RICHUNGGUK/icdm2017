Design/methodology/approach - A virtual soft material introduced to an element will change the stiffness of the element and may consequently change the stress distribution of that element and its neighbors. With this property, the virtual stiffness of the selected element is calculated and the threshold of the stress changes is derived. The stress threshold is used to evaluate the role of an element on the load path and therefore decide the contribution of the element to the structure. Adding this checking operation into the original ESO iterations enables validation of element removal. Findings - The reason for structure break down with the ESO method is that the element removal criterion of ESO only works for certain optimal objectives. It cannot guarantee that the structure does not fail. The proposed operation offers a stronger and stricter constraint condition for ESO's element removal process, preventing the structure from breaking down in some special cases. Originality/value - The tests on several examples reported in the literature show that the proposed method has the same ability to achieve an optimum solution as the original ESO methods do, while avoiding incorrect deletion of structurally important elements. The benchmark tie-beam problem is solved successfully with this algorithm. The method can be used in other situations as well.", "paper_title": "A constraint and algorithm for stress-based evolutionary structural optimization of the tie-beam problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000359048600011"}
