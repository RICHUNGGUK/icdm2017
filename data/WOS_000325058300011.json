In this paper, it is found that the tolerable maximum element size to achieve acceptable accuracy for soil shear strength is surprisingly small. The discrepancy is governed by the line averaging effect along potential slip curves - the discrepancy is small if the line averaging is strong. Discretization based on element-level averaging (ELA) is always unconservative, giving mobilized shear strength always larger than the actual value, while discretization based on the midpoint method can be sometimes conservative.
