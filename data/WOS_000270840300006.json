The dynamics has been studied by perturbing liquid velocity at the inlet of boiling channel with a step function and heating rate with a ramp function. Both finite volume method (FVM) and finite difference method (FDM) have been applied to solve the model equations that have been developed to predict boiling boundary. The effect of thermal non-equilibrium conditions on subcooled boiling has been taken into consideration. A comparative study of the two methods has been carried out based on the analytical solution of the equations. The study shows that at higher system frequency, increasing number of computational grids increase the accuracy of numerical solutions using FVM while FDM fails to achieve the same. The superiority of FVM over FDM for the problem has also been confirmed by grid convergence analysis. An attempt has also been made to find the analytical solution of the effect of change of heat input on boiling boundary, which is an essential part of computations for the simulation of startup and shutdown of the steam generator.
