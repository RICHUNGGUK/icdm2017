This paper aims to put forward a new soft set-(M,N)-soft intersection set, which is a generalization of soft intersection sets. We introduce (M, N)-S I (implicative) filters of R-0-algebras. Some characterizations of these kinds of filters are established. In particular, we discuss the properties of (M,N)-soft congruences in R-0-algebras. It can lay a foundation for providing a new soft algebraic tool in considering many problems that contain uncertainties.", "paper_title": "On (M,N)-S I (implicative) filters in R-0-algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000343988900004"}
