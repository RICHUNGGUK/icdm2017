The proposed discretization scheme simulates drawdown within the well more accurately than commonly applied schemes. The solution is compared to existing (semi) analytical models for the simulation of slug tests and pumping tests with constant discharge in single- and multi-layer systems. For all cases, it is concluded that the finite-difference model approximates drawdown to acceptable accuracy. The main advantage of finite-difference approaches is the ability to account for the varying saturated thickness in unconfined top layers. Additionally, it is straightforward to include radial variation of hydraulic parameters, which is useful to simulate the effect of a finite-thickness well skin. Aquifer tests with variable pumping rate and/or multiple wells may be simulated by superposition. The finite-difference solution is implemented in MAxSym, a MATLAB tool which is designed specifically to simulate axi-symmetric flow. Alternatively, the presented equations can be solved using a standard finite-difference model. A procedure is outlined to apply the same approach with MODFLOW. The required modifications to the input parameters are much larger for MODFLOW than for MAxSym, but the results are virtually identical. The presented finite-difference solution may be used, for example, as a forward model in parameter estimation algorithms. Since it is applicable to multi-layer systems, its use is not limited to the simulation of traditional pumping and slug tests, but also includes advanced aquifer tests, such as multiple pumping tests or multi-level slug tests.
