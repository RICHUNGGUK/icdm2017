It has previously been shown that the unweighted version of the problem is solvable in polynomial time while the weighted version is (weakly) NP-hard. In this paper, we strengthen these results as follows: (1) We prove that the weighted version is strongly NP-hard even if all edge weights belong to the set {1,k}, where k is any fixed integer greater than or equal to 2, and that there exists no pseudo-polynomial time approximation algorithm for this problem whose approximation ratio is smaller than (1+1/k) unless P = NP; (2) we present a new polynomial-time algorithm that approximates the general version of the problem within a ratio of (2-1/k), where k is the maximum weight of an edge in G; (3) we show how to approximate the special case in which all edge weights belong to {1,k} within a ratio of 3/2 for k=2 (note that this matches the inapproximability bound above), and (2-2/(k+1)) for any ka parts per thousand yen3, respectively, in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithms for the graph orientation minimizing the maximum weighted outdegree", "paper_id": "WOS:000290681500006"}
