First, a smooth volumetric electron density map is constructed from atomic data using weighted Gaussian isotropic kernel functions and a two-level clustering technique. This enables the selection of a smooth implicit solvation surface approximation to the Lee-Richards molecular surface. Next, a modified dual contouring method is used to extract triangular meshes for the surface, and tetrahedral meshes for the volume inside or outside the molecule within a bounding sphere/box of influence. Finally, geometric flow techniques are used to improve the surface and volume mesh quality. Several examples are presented, including generated meshes for biomolecules that have been successfully used in finite element simulations involving solvation energetics and binding rate constants.
