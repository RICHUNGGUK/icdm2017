We derive the secrecy capacity region of this channel for the most general case. We first show that even for the single-input single-output (SISO) case, existing converse techniques for the Gaussian scalar broadcast channel cannot be extended to this secrecy context, to emphasize the need for a new proof technique. Our new proof technique makes use of the relationships between the minimum-mean-square-error and the mutual information, and equivalently, the relationships between the Fisher information and the differential entropy. Using the intuition gained from the converse proof of the SISO channel, we first prove the secrecy capacity region of the degraded MIMO channel, in which all receivers have the same number of antennas, and the noise covariance matrices can be arranged according to a positive semi-definite order. We then generalize this result to the aligned case, in which all receivers have the same number of antennas; however, there is no order among the noise covariance matrices. We accomplish this task by using the channel enhancement technique. Finally, we find the secrecy capacity region of the general MIMO channel by using some limiting arguments on the secrecy capacity region of the aligned MIMO channel. We show that the capacity achieving coding scheme is a variant of dirty-paper coding with Gaussian signals.", "paper_title": "The Secrecy Capacity Region of the Gaussian MIMO Multi-Receiver Wiretap Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000288459100017"}
