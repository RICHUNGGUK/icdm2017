Recently, road-side access points for vehicular networks and outdoor WiFi stations are deployed in wide urban areas and compete with each other for limited wireless resources. We focus on pursuing the best balance among (i) optimality of resource utilization, (ii) robustness to new station installation and traffic demand, and (iii) scalability to the population of stations and area size. The algorithm is designed based on a vector space theory with correctness proof. Compared with our previous work that presents the basic algorithm and theory, we extend the algorithm to a multi-layer (i.e. hierarchical) version to handle more realistic situations. Additionally, we have conducted extensive simulations with a variety of scenarios. Finally, the applicability of approach has been testified by a case study on a scheduling problem for roadside access points of vehicular networks in cooperation with a manufacturing corporation.
