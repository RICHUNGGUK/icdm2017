A set of sufficient conditions for the existence and exponential attractivity of the almost periodic solutions are derived under mild conditions. For special cases, we also present several criteria correspondingly. In addition, an example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
