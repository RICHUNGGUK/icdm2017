And if the points P and Q are unknown before the computation of multiple scalar multiplications, we have to precompute and store some points as fast as possible. This paper proposes an efficient precomputation scheme of kP + lQ by using conjugate and co-Z addition formulas where k and I are integers, and P and Q are points on a curve. To compute c(i)P +/- d(i)Q where c(i).d(i) is an element of {1, 3, 5, ... , m}, our scheme is more efficient than others.
