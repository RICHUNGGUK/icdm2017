In addition, a detailed discussion of the practically achievable tradeoff ranges via the gate size and especially supply voltage tuning is present. We have applied the methodology for the design and fine tuning of the run-time switchable buffers within the Level-1 (L1) embedded SRAMs (eSRAM), confirming that a very wide range in delay and energy reduction (up to 50%) can be achieved when compared to solely optimal speed eSRAM design using conventional high speed buffers.", "paper_title": "Design and Synthesis of Pareto Buffers Offering Large Range Runtime Energy/Delay Tradeoffs Via Combined Buffer Size and Supply Voltage Tuning", "paper_id": "WOS:000262017400011"}
