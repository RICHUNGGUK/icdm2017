A setup time is required for a job if it is the first job to be processed on a machine or its processing on a machine follows a job that belongs to another class. Processed jobs are delivered in batches to their respective customers. The batch size is limited by the capacity of the delivery vehicles and each shipment incurs a transport cost and takes a fixed amount of time. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the last arrival time of jobs to customers and the delivery (transportation) cost. For the problem of processing jobs on a single machine and delivering them to multiple customers, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem optimally. For the problem of processing jobs on parallel machines and delivering them to a single customer, we propose a heuristic and analyze its performance bound. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
