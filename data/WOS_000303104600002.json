Crisp data are commonly used in traditional DEA models. However, inputs and outputs have been observed whose values are imprecise in many cases. Meanwhile, the weights of inputs and outputs must be maintained in some ranges for the production mechanisms to work in reality. In this paper, a generalized fuzzy DEA model with assurance regions (GFDEA/AR) is proposed. Two linear programming models to determine the lower and upper bounds of fuzzy efficiency scores under given alpha levels is proposed. The proposed GFDEA/AR model is then used to evaluate the performance of manufacturing enterprises in different cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
