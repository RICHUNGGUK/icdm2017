Basically, TAEC explores the temporal dependence of video frames by pushing out the lower impact frames. In doing so, queuing delay is controlled and the important frame is retransmitted multiple times. We consider the application of the nonstationary stochastic control to further improve the wireless system throughput by exploring the multiuser diversity gain. The techniques involved in our proposed solution consist of constructing a Markov model, reducing the number of parameters estimated, and avoiding the state explosion problem. The provisioning of immediate bandwidth guarantee is another feature of TAEC, i.e., when exploring the multiuser diversity gain, the users share their reserved bandwidth only if the perceived video qualities are acceptable. As shown in the simulation, TAEC improves the perceived video quality in terms of luminance PSNR when compared to other schemes.", "paper_title": "Type-Aware Error Control for Robust Interactive Video Services over Time-Varying Wireless Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000284276800013"}
