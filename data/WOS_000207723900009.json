As case studies, the design of partially reconfigurable ASIP (r-ASIP) architectures is presented for two classes of algorithms with widespread diffusion in image/video processing: motion estimation and retinex filtering. Design optimizations are addressed at both algorithmic and architectural levels. Special processor concepts used to trade-off performance versus flexibility and to enable new features of post-fabrication configurability are shown. Silicon implementation results are compared to known ASIC, DSP or reconfigurable designs; the proposed r-ASIPs stand for their better performance-flexibility figures in the respective algorithmic class.", "paper_title": "ASIP-based reconfigurable architectures for power-efficient and real-time image/video processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000207723900009"}
