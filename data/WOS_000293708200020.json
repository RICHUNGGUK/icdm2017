Using fuzzy-logic systems to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, a fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the immeasurable states. By combining adaptive-backstepping technique and DSC technique, an adaptive fuzzy output-feedback backstepping-control approach is developed. The proposed control method not only overcomes the problem of \"explosion of complexity\" inherent in the backstepping-design methods but also overcomes the problem of unavailable state measurements. It is proved that all the signals of the closed-loop adaptive-control system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Observer-Based Adaptive Fuzzy Backstepping Dynamic Surface Control for a Class of MIMO Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000293708200020"}
