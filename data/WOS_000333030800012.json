Based on artificial immune system, quantum evolutionary computing and the strategy of co-evolution, a quantum immune clonal coevolutionary algorithm (QICCA) is proposed to solve DMO problems. The algorithm adopts entire cloning and evolves the theory of quantum to design a quantum updating operation, which improves the searching ability of the algorithm. Moreover, coevolutionary strategy is incorporated in global operation and coevolutionary competitive operation and coevolutionary cooperative operation are designed to improve the uniformity, the diversity and the convergence performance of the solutions. The results on test problems and performance metrics compared with ICADMO and DBM suggest that QICCA has obvious effectiveness and advantages which shows great capability of evolving convergent, diverse and uniformly distributed Pareto fronts.", "paper_title": "Quantum immune clonal coevolutionary algorithm for dynamic multiobjective optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000333030800012"}
