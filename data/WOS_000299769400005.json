Due to size constraints, cell-phone cameras have constant, or near constant focal length, making them an ideal application for calibrated projective geometry. In contrast to previous RS rectification attempts that model distortions in the image plane, we model the 3D rotation of the camera. We parameterise the camera rotation as a continuous curve, with knots distributed across a short frame interval. Curve parameters are found using non-linear least squares over inter-frame correspondences from a KLT tracker. By smoothing a sequence of reference rotations from the estimated curve, we can at a small extra cost, obtain a high-quality image stabilisation. Using synthetic RS sequences with associated ground-truth, we demonstrate that our rectification improves over two other methods. We also compare our video stabilisation with the methods in iMovie and Deshaker.", "paper_title": "Efficient Video Rectification and Stabilisation for Cell-Phones", "paper_id": "WOS:000299769400005"}
