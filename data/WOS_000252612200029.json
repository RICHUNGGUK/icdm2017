Based on this observation, we present the concept of the symmetric 2-adic complexity of periodic binary sequences. The expected value of the 2-adic complexity is determined, and a lower bound on the expected value of the symmetric 2-adic complexity of periodic binary sequences is derived. We study the variance of the 2-adic complexity of periodic binary sequences, and the exact value for it is given. Because the 2-adic complexity of periodic binary sequences is unstable, we present the concepts of the k-error 2-adic complexity and the k-error symmetric 2-adic complexity, and lower bounds on them are also derived. In particular, we give tighter upper and lower bounds for the minimum 2-adic complexity of I-sequences by substituting two symbols within one period.", "paper_title": "On the 2-adic complexity and the kappa-error 2-adic complexity of periodic binary sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000252612200029"}
