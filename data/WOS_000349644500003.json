Design/methodology/approach-The structural equation modeling (SEM) method is used to examine the proposed model, based on data collected from 361 companies in greater China. Findings-Integrative mechanisms are helpful for logistics outsourcing (basic, customized, and advanced outsourcing). Specially, information sharing contributes to customized and advanced outsourcing, but has no significant effect on basic outsourcing. In contrast, process coordination improves basic and advanced outsourcing, but insignificantly influences customized outsourcing. Besides, each type of logistics outsourcing has differently effects on 3PL users' performance. This study contributes to 3PL theories and practices. Originality/value-This study empirically examines the antecedents and the outcomes of logistics outsourcing, contributing to 3PL literature and practices.", "paper_title": "Effect of information sharing and process coordination on logistics outsourcing", "paper_id": "WOS:000349644500003"}
