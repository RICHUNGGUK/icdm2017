The power saving and rate-distortion performances of individual schemes are simulated, and then, the combined effects are modeled to obtain the best operation combination. The optimized combinations are defined as a power-level table. The proposed power-aware design is tested with four popular power-saving schemes and simulations show that a power saving of similar to 25% is achieved at the sacrifice of <0.172 dB Bjontegaard Delta peak signal-to-noise ratio degradation.", "paper_title": "An Effective Combination of Power Scaling for H.264/AVC Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000031"}
