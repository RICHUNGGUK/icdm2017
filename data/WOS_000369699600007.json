The purpose of this paper is to explore what achievement values were derived from playing massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), especially for high-engaged MMORPGs players. Design/methodology/approach - The research employed two approaches to collect data: focus group and a web survey of online game players were conducted. Moreover, an addiction-engagement scale was used to ensure all participants were genuinely highly engaged MMORPGs players in data collection process. There are 12 highly engaged players were recruited as focus group members in Phase 1. The online survey yielded 315 responses, of which 267 were considered valid, and 177 of those were considered to be genuine highly engaged players in Phase 2. In the study, exploratory factor analysis was performed to reveal underlying structure of achievement values. Findings - The result focussing on popular MMORPGs reveal that highly engaged players derived six achievement values from playing MMORPGs, including fantasy satisfaction, adventure, victory, socialization ability, self-actualization, and advancement of wealth and status. Originality/value - In view of the prevalence of MMORPGs, it is imperative to draw attention to understand students' achievement values derived from playing MMORPGs. By doing that, educators know how to bridge students' achievement values to their academic performance.", "paper_title": "Understanding players' achievement values from MMORPGs: an exploratory study", "paper_id": "WOS:000369699600007"}
