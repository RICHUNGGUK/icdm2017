For that purpose, an improved bound on the number of non-polarizing channels is obtained. The main result is that the blocklength required to communicate reliably scales at most as O((I(W) - R)(-5.702)), where R is the code rate and I(W) is the symmetric capacity of the channel W. The results are then extended to polar lossy source coding at rate R of a source with symmetric distortion-rate function D(center dot). The blocklength required scales at most as O((D-0)(-5.702)), where D-0 is the maximal allowed gap between the actual average (or typical) distortion and D(R).", "paper_title": "Improved Bounds on the Finite Length Scaling of Polar Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100016"}
