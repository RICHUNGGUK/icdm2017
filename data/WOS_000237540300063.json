In this paper, we present an agent-based middleware called CAMPS for providing context-aware services for Smart Space in order to afford effective supports for context acquisition, representation, interpretation, and utilization to applications. In CAMPS, a formal context model, which combines First Order Probabilistic Logic with OWL ontologies, has been investigated to facilitate context modeling and reasoning about imperfect and ambiguous contextual information and to enable context knowledge sharing and reuse. A context inference mechanism based on an extended Bayesian Network approach has been studied to enable automated reactive and deductive reasoning. In addition, we implement a prototype and study on our experience in smart classroom application.", "paper_title": "CAMPS: A middleware for providing context-aware services for Smart Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300063"}
