These applications require resources mobilization not always available. To maintain high quality service without interruption, it is essential for network to be more intelligent to anticipate users' movements. It should be able to reserve the necessary resources in the future locations to be visited. We present in this paper an original solution for users' displacements prediction based on an Ants system behavior. This Solution is adapted to small size cells such as micro-cell and pico-cell architectures. Carried out simulations show that one displacement can be predicted with very high degree of accuracy even if mobile history lacks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
