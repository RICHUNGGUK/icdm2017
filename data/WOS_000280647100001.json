This approach extends the reach of the modern theory of interior-point methods, and lays the foundation for new ways to treat structured convex optimization problems with a very large number of constraints. Moreover, our approach provides a strong connection from the theory of self-concordant barriers to the combinatorial optimization literature on solving packing and covering problems.", "paper_title": "Self-Concordant Barriers for Convex Approximations of Structured Convex Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000280647100001"}
