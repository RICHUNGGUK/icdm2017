MITOS monitors the traffic load distribution in the different WLAN segments, as well as the location of each user, and when necessary, suggests to specific users to change their location in order to improve their quality of service. Enhancements to the basic MITOS architecture are introduced to intelligently manage local congestion, and maintain an almost uniform load level across the network. The approach used for load balancing is based on game theoretic mechanisms, such as the solutions to the Santa Fe Bar Problem. Simulation results are provided showing the efficiency of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "An overlay smart spaces system for load balancing in wireless LANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237835400012"}
