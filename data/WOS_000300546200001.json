Frequently, these tasks involve working with many different Web applications. For this kind of tasks users have to move information manually among Web pages. While in the field of Adaptive Web there is important and meaningful research about adapting Web sites according with the user's activity most adaptation approaches are applied only in the boundaries of single Web applications. In this work we show to use Client-Side adaptation to provide new techniques for concern-sensitive, task-based adaptations across the Web. We show an architectural overview of our tool and illustrate the power of the approach with examples.", "paper_title": "A CROWDSOURCED APPROACH FOR CONCERN-SENSITIVE INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION ACROSS THE WEB", "paper_id": "WOS:000300546200001"}
