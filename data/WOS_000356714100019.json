Taking advantage of the characteristics of both social networks and opportunistic networks (OppNets), MSNs are capable of providing an efficient and effective mobile environment for users to access, share, and distribute data. However, the lack of a protective infrastructure in these networks has turned them into convenient targets for various perils. This is the main impulse why MSNs carry disparate and intricate safety concerns and embrace divergent safety challenging problems. In this paper, we aim to provide a clear categorization on safety challenges and a deep exploration over some recent solutions in MSNs. This work narrows the safety challenges and solution techniques down from OppNets and delay-tolerant networks to MSNs with the hope of covering all the work proposed around security, privacy, and trust in MSNs. To conclude, several major open research issues are discussed, and future research directions are outlined.", "paper_title": "Safety Challenges and Solutions in Mobile Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356714100019"}
