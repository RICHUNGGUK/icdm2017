Feldman et al. relaxed this IP problem and presented linear programming (LP) based decoding. In this paper, we propose a new separation algorithm to improve the error-correcting performance of LP decoding for binary linear block codes. We use an IP formulation with indicator variables that help in detecting the violated parity checks. We derive Gomory cuts from the IP and use them in our separation algorithm. An efficient method of finding cuts induced by redundant parity checks (RPC) is also proposed. Under certain circumstances we can guarantee that these RPC cuts are valid and cut off the fractional optimal solutions of LP decoding. It is demonstrated on three LDPC codes and two BCH codes that our separation algorithm performs significantly better than LP decoding and belief propagation (BP) decoding.", "paper_title": "A Separation Algorithm for Improved LP-Decoding of Linear Block Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000278812000019"}
