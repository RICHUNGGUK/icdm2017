The standardization dictates the physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC) layer protocols for WBAN-based communications. Unlike the pre-existing wireless communication standards, IEEE 802.15.6 standardization supports short-range, extremely low power wireless communication with high quality of service and support for high data rates upto 10 Mbps in the vicinity of living tissues. In this work, we construct a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) that efficiently depicts the states of an IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA-based WBAN. Following this, we put forward a thorough analysis of the standard in terms of reliability, throughput, average delay, and power consumption. The work concerns non-ideal channel characteristics and a saturated network traffic regime. The major shortcoming of the existing literature on Markov chain-based analysis of IEEE 802.15.6 is that the authors did not take into consideration the time spent by a node awaiting the acknowledgement frame after transmission of a packet, until time-out occurs. Also, most of the work assume that ideal channel characteristics persist for the network which is hardly the case in practice. This work remains distinctive as we take into account the waiting time of a node after it transmits a packet while constructing the DTMC. Based on the DTMC, we perform a user priority (UP)-wise analysis, and justify the importance of the standard from a medical perspective.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of IEEE 802.15.6 MAC Protocol under Non-Ideal Channel Conditions and Saturated Traffic Regime", "paper_id": "WOS:000361480400015"}
