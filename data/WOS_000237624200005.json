The following features can be chosen in an automatic or semi-automatic way: (1) format of the common block HEPEVT; (2) version of the physics input (for TAUOLA): as published, as initialized by the CLEO collaboration, as initialized by the ALEPH collaboration (it is suggested to use this version only with the help of the collaboration advice), new optional parametrization of matrix elements in 4 pi decay channels; (3) type of application: stand-alone, universal interface based on the information stored in the HEPEVT common block including longitudinal spin effects in the elementary Z/y* -> tau(+)tau(-) process, extended version of the standard universal interface including full spin effects in the H/A -> tau(+)tau(-) decay, interface for KKMC Monte Carlo, (4) random number generators; (5) compiler options.
