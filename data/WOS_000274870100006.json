Water flows in a very heterogeneous geological media which contains complex structures, Decomposing these Structures into approximately equivalent sub-structures for load-balancing is a major challenge. This paper proposes and analyzes a new algorithm using finite element methods to simulate parallel flow fluid in such complex media. Fully parallel software is developed and numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
