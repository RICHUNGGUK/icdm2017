Its running time is O(nk2(k+(log2) (k)(log2) (n))), where n is the number of vertices and k is the number of terminals. This is faster than all previously known algorithms if log n(log log n)(3) < k < (n - log(2) n)/2. Our algorithm is based on a new tree composition theorem. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
