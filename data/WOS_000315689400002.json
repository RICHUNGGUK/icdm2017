Even though there are many conceptual frameworks for using multi-agent systems, there is no well established and widely accepted method for the representation of multi-agent systems. We adapt a well-known formal model, predicate transition nets, to include the notions of dynamic structure, agent communication and coordination to address the representation problems. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for modeling multi-agents based on the extensions. We demonstrate our modeling approach with an example. Several case studies on different application domains from our previous works are also discussed.", "paper_title": "A METHODOLOGY FOR MODELING MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS USING NESTED PETRI NETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000315689400002"}
