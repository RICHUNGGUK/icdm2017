Under a block-fading channel model, it is shown that a broadcast strategy maximizes the expected reliably received rate when the decoding delay constraint is one block and in certain cases when the delay constraint is two blocks. The latter requires a new analysis of underlying parallel Gaussian broadcast channels (GBCs) which are not degraded in the same direction.", "paper_title": "Broadcasting over uncertain channels with decoding delay constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000236126000009"}
