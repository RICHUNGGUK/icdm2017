However, such migrations are an important source of concerns for network operators as the reconfiguration campaign can lead to long, service-disrupting outages. In this paper, we propose a methodology that addresses the problem of seamlessly modifying the configuration of link-state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs). We illustrate the benefits of our methodology by considering several migration scenarios, including the addition and the removal of routing hierarchy in a running IGP, and the replacement of one IGP with another. We prove that a strict operational ordering can guarantee that the migration will not create any service outage. Although finding a safe ordering is NP-complete, we describe techniques that efficiently find such an ordering and evaluate them using several real-world and inferred ISP topologies. Finally, we describe the implementation of a provisioning system that automatically performs the migration by pushing the configurations on the routers in the appropriate order while monitoring the entire migration process.", "paper_title": "Lossless Migrations of Link-State IGPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000313661000013"}
