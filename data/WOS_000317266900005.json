The concise and syntax-driven translation can be used to reason in Petri net terms about open reconfigurable systems. We demonstrate that the pi-graphs and their translated high-level Petri nets agree at the semantic level. In consequence, existing results on pi-graphs naturally extend to the translated Petri nets, most notably a guarantee of finiteness by construction.", "paper_title": "A Petri Net Interpretation of Open Reconfigurable Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317266900005"}
