The measured formative time lag and statistical time lag of address discharge for TR were 21-31 ns and 31-74 ns shorter than the one for the typical reset, respectively. The TR reset resulted in much less increase of statistical time lag than the typical reset when the reset-to-address time interval was increased, and similar to 70 ns smaller deviation of the statistical time lag among different color cells. Calculations show that the TR reset forms a much smoother wall charge profile, which is less susceptible to cell parameter variations, than the typical reset. The observed differences in the time lags of address discharge between different scan lines and color cells are strongly correlated to the differences of the wall charge profile, indicating that a smooth wall charge profile formed by the reset using face discharges only reduces the time lag of address discharge and minimizes the susceptibility of address discharge to cell parameter variation.
