Size, speed and distributed operation are major challenges concerning those systems. Many data warehouses have huge sizes and the requirement that queries be processed quickly and efficiently, so parallel solutions art deployed to render the necessary efficiency. Distributed operation, on the other hand, concerns global commercial and scientific organizations that need to share their data in a coherent distributed data warehouse. In this article we review the major concepts, systems and research results behind parallel and distributed data warehouses.
