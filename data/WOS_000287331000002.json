Math. Anal. 16:852-858, 1985). These expressions allow computations to proceed until a prespecified degree of accuracy is achieved. For both distributions, convergence acceleration methods are used to compute CDF values which achieve reasonably fast run times for dimensions up to 50 and error degrees of freedom as large as 100. Software that implements these computations is described and has been made available on the Web.", "paper_title": "Exact distributional computations for Roy's statistic and the largest eigenvalue of a Wishart distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000287331000002"}
