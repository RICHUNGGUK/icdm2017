Following previous work by Li et al. (2007), we propose an algorithm that relies on homotopy and fast evaluation-interpolation techniques. We obtain a quasi-linear time complexity for substantial families of examples, for which no such result was known before. Applications are given notably to additions of algebraic numbers in small characteristic. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
