The time-varying unknown phase delay that arises due to both software (filtering) and hardware (sensors) in these robotics instruments adversely affects the device performance. In this paper, moving window-based least squares support vector machines approach is formulated for multistep prediction of tremor to overcome the time-varying delay. This approach relies on the kernel-learning technique and does not require the knowledge of prediction horizon compared to the existing methods that require the delay to be known as a priori. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations and experiments with the tremor data recorded from surgeons and novice subjects. Comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques highlights the suitability and better performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Multistep Prediction of Physiological Tremor Based on Machine Learning for Robotics Assisted Microsurgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000348071500015"}
