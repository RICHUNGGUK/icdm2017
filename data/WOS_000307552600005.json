Multi-networked feedback control loops called subsystems in an NLCS share a common communication media. Therefore, there is a competition for the available bandwidth. A non-cooperative game fairness model is first formulated, and then the utility function of subsystems is designed. This takes into account of a number of factors, namely transmission data rate, sampling, the feature of scheduling pattern adopted, and networked control. For the problem defined above, the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium point are proved. Following this, an evolutionary algorithm appeared in the literature recently, shuffled frog leaping algorithm, is improved applying to obtain an optimal solution. The algorithm has a high convergence rate, and the comparison simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical approach and the algorithm applied.", "paper_title": "Bandwidth scheduling and optimization using non-cooperative game model-based shuffled frog leaping algorithm in a networked learning control system", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552600005"}
