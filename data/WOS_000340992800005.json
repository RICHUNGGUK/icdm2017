However, in the setting of uncertainty theories more general than probability theory, this principle no longer holds in general. It is therefore useful to know for which families of events it continues to hold. This paper investigates this question in the setting of belief functions. After exhibiting original sufficient and necessary conditions for the principle to hold, we illustrate its use on the uncertainty analysis of Boolean and non-Boolean systems in reliability.
