However, the variability of vehicles in size, color, shape, etc. poses an enormous challenge, especially for the vehicle verification task. Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOGs) have successfully been applied to image-based verification of objects. However, these descriptors are computationally demanding and are not affordable for real-time on-road vehicle detection. In this paper, less-demanding HOG descriptors are proposed and evaluated that significantly lighten the computation by exploiting the a priori known vehicle appearance. The proposed descriptors are evaluated on a large, public database and the experiments disclose that the computation times are reduced in a factor of more than 5, thus rendering HOG-based real-time vehicle detection affordable, while achieving detection rates of over 96%.
