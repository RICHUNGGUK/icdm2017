The semantics of equilibrium logic is given in an indirect way: the notion of an equilibrium model is defined in terms of quantification over hereand-there models. We here give a direct semantics of equilibrium logic, stated for a modal language embedding the language of equilibrium logic. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
