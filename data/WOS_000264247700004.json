Therefore, it is desirable and essential to fulfill security requirements in security-critical real-time systems. This paper addresses the issue of optimizing quality of security in real-time systems. To meet the needs of a wide variety of security requirements imposed by real-time systems, a group-based security service model is used in which the security services are partitioned into several groups depending on security types. While services within the same security group provide the identical type of security service, the services in the group can achieve different quality of security. Security services from a number of groups can be combined to deliver better quality of security. In this study, we seamlessly integrate the group-based security model with a traditional real-time scheduling algorithm, namely earliest deadline first (EDF). Moreover, we design and develop a security-aware EDF schedulability test. Given a set of real-time tasks with chosen security services, our scheduling scheme aims at optimizing the combined security value of the selected services while guaranteeing the schedulability of the real-time tasks. We study two approaches to solve the security-aware optimization problem. Experimental results show that the combined security values are substantially higher than those achieved by alternatives for real-time tasks without violating real-time constraints.", "paper_title": "Static Security Optimization for Real-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264247700004"}
