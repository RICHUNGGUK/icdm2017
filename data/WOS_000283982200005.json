In this study, a novel full-angle FDOT with spatially coded parallel excitation (SC-FDOT) is proposed, which provides much better image qualities than our previous FDOT with multiple-points illumination (MP-FDOT) while maintaining comparable temporal resolution. Singular-value analysis and numerical simulations are used to obtain the key experimental parameters including the optimal point sources number and the optimal projections number, and to compare the performances of SC-FDOT, MP-FDOT and the conventional FDOT with single-point illumination. Results demonstrate that SC-FDOT has the best spatial-temporal performances in imaging fast biological activities through whole body. Physical phantom experiments are performed to evaluate the spatial performance of SC-FDOT in practical experimental applications. Utilizing the proposed system, a nude mouse implanted with a small fluorescent inclusion is also imaged. The preliminary result demonstrates the feasibility of SC-FDOT in in vivo applications.", "paper_title": "Full-Angle Fluorescence Diffuse Optical Tomography With Spatially Coded Parallel Excitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000283982200005"}
