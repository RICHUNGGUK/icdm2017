Different from image re-coloring schemes, reproducing a video for dichromats requires maintaining temporal color consistency between frames, i.e., the same color in different frames should be re-colored to the identical new color. To achieve this goal, we extract video key colors from shots after motion estimation at first. Based on the importance of video key colors, a process order is defined to perform efficient color remapping and solve the contrast maintaining problem. Then, the remapped frame pixel values are interpolated by the re-mapped video key colors with spatial-temporal constraints. Experimental results show that our method can increase the visibility for dichromats and guarantee temporal color consistency.", "paper_title": "Temporal Color Consistency-Based Video Reproduction for Dichromats", "paper_id": "WOS:000295007300010"}
