In order to successfully implement these paradigms a methodology to progressively adopt or transform an arbitrary map representation in an arbitrary fashion on-the-fly is necessary. Such a methodology was previously considered not feasible due to the high computational complexity associated with existing automated map generalisation methodologies. This paper presents a methodology, inspired by related research in the field of computer graphics, which offers the potential to reduce such associated computational complexity. This is achieved using an approach to map transformation which takes advantage of the geometric coherence between a user's spatial data requirements. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
