Based on the study, we propose a multi-agent cooperative operation strategy for the immune system based on the immune network theory. In order to achieve successful swarm coordination, we design each agent to select its favorable strategy according to distributed sensing through local communication. Experiments show that this Immunology-inspired Cooperative Operation strategy performs well even under dynamically changing environment. Its effectiveness is also verified by numerical simulation on multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) coordination. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
