Due to enhanced flexibility of the decision making, intuitively, we expect that grouping together separated systems into one system provides improved performance over the previously separated systems. This paper presents a result counter-intuitive against such an expectation. We consider a non-cooperative optimal flow control scheme M/M/n queueing systems where each of multiple players strives to optimize unilaterally its own power where the power of a player is the quotient of the throughput divided by the mean response time for the player. We report a counter-intuitive case where the power of every user degrades after grouping together K(> 1) separated M/M/N systems into a single M/M/(K x N) system. Some numerical results are presented. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "A paradox in optimal flow control of M/M/n queues", "paper_id": "WOS:000232198700006"}
