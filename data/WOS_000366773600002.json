Previously, researchers proved that to minimize the worst case updating cost in case of single user deletion, one needs to use a special 2-3 tree. In this paper, we study the average case for user update. We prove that in the optimal tree, the branching degree of every node can be bounded by 3 and furthermore the structure of the optimal tree can be pretty balanced. We also show the way to construct the optimal tree when there are loyal users in the group. Finally we discuss about the weighted case where different users have different probabilities to be the first one leaving the group. We design a polynomial time algorithm to construct the optimal tree when the number of different probabilities is a constant. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
