Previous research has shown that SIMD-based optimizations can multiply decoding speeds. Following these pioneering studies, we propose a general approach to accelerate compression algorithms. By instantiating the approach, we have developed several novel integer compression algorithms, called Group-Simple, Group-Scheme, Group-AFOR, and Group-PFD, and implemented their corresponding vectorized versions. We evaluate the proposed algorithms on two public TREC datasets, aWikipedia dataset, and a Twitter dataset. With competitive compression ratios and encoding speeds, our SIMD-based algorithms outperform state-of-the-art nonvectorized algorithms with respect to decoding speeds.", "paper_title": "A General SIMD-Based Approach to Accelerating Compression Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000354062500006"}
