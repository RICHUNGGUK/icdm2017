Their different processing capabilities make it challenging to guarantee satisfactory quality in all possible situations. This paper proposes a systematic methodology for interactive 3D graphics applications to adapt the complexity of the content automatically to the terminal's available resources. Our contribution is an offline/online partitioned optimisation that increases the visual quality with respect to previous work at the same rendering cost, while the overhead of the optimisation is minimal.", "paper_title": "Platform independent optimisation of multi-resolution 3D content to enable universal media access", "paper_id": "WOS:000240833100006"}
