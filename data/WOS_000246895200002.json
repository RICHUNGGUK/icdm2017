Although this element is unstable for all meshes, it provides optimal approximations for the velocity and the pressure in many cases. We establish a relation between the stabilities of the L-1-P-0 element (bilinear/constant on quadrilaterals) and the P-1-P-0 element. We apply many stability results on the L-1-P-0 element to the analysis of the P-1-P-0 element. We prove that the element has the optimal order of approximations for the velocity and the pressure on a variety of mesh families. As a byproduct, we also obtain a basis of divergence-free piecewise linear functions on a mesh family on squares. Numerical tests are provided to support the theory and to show the efficiency of the newly discovered, truly divergence-free, 91 finite element spaces in computation.
