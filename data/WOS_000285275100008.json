In this paper, a fuzzy logic based scheme for fast selection of best base station and of handover technique at the handover time is presented in order to minimize the delay during handover for sensitive multimedia traffic. The scheme considers several parameters such as receiver power levels, handover type, traffic type, base station load and mobile station speed for making the handover decision by the mobile station. Through simulations, we compare our proposed handover scheme based on fuzzy logic modeling with classical handover decision. And finally, we present results based on Quality of Service (QoS) criteria to confirm the validity of the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
