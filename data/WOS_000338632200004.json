The F TraI protein nicks one F plasmid strand, separates cut and uncut strands, and pilots the cut strand through a secretion pore into the recipient. TraI is a modular protein with identifiable nickase, ssDNA-binding, helicase and protein-protein interaction domains. While domain structures corresponding to roughly 1/3 of TraI have been determined, there has been no comprehensive structural study of the entire TraI molecule, nor an examination of structural changes to TraI upon binding DNA. Here, we combine solution studies using small-angle scattering and circular dichroism spectroscopy with molecular Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations to assess solution behavior of individual and groups of domains. Despite having several long (>100 residues) apparently disordered or highly dynamic regions, TraI folds into a compact molecule. Based on the biophysical characterization, we have generated models of intact TraI. These data and the resulting models have provided clues to the regulation of TraI function.", "paper_title": "Structures of TraI in solution", "paper_id": "WOS:000338632200004"}
