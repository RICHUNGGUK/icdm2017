We illustrate the process of removing corrupted components by subtracting the estimated dynamic minimum of short-time spectra. Experimental results show the proposed method is stable and yield a good performance in ASR under noisy environments. If combined with peak isolation method, DMSSS can improve the recognition performance significantly.", "paper_title": "Robust speech feature extraction based on dynamic minimum subband spectral subtraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300136"}
