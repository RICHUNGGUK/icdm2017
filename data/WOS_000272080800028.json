In this article, we describe a novel web-based tool that integrate the miRNA-targeted mRNA data, protein-protein interactions ( PPI) records, tissues, biochemical pathways, human disease and gene function information to establish a disease-related miRNA target pathway database. This database is unique in the sense that it links miRNA target genes with their PPI partners according to being tissue- and diseases-speci. c or both. The same approach is also applied to siRNA data. This database provides two types of searches: ( i) tissue- and ( ii) disease-specific miRNA ( or siRNA) targeting pathways. The search allows one to identify tissue- or disease-specific miRNA ( or siRNA) target gene's PPI partners two levels beyond.", "paper_title": "ncRNAppi-a tool for identifying disease-related miRNA and siRNA targeting pathways", "paper_id": "WOS:000272080800028"}
