Post-adoption behavioral intention includes continuous adoption intention and positive word-of-mouth. Empirical results indicate that satisfaction is a crucial variable in predicting as well as explaining continuous adoption intention and positive word-of-mouth. Multi-dimensional customer value, through emotional value, directly influences satisfaction; this relationship proves the suitability of the cognition-emotional response path. Furthermore, from the multi-dimensional customer value and emotional response link we find that social value is the optimal variable in predicting emotional value, second is information quality value, followed by network externalities value, and then by system quality value. On the other hand, empirical results also indicate that the relationship between perceived costs and emotional value was not established, a possible explanation is that the research stimulus and samples are all voluntary and no payment was involved in using the research stimulus.", "paper_title": "THE POST-ADOPTION BEHAVIOR OF ONLINE KNOWLEDGE COMMUNITY: DECOMPOSING CUSTOMER VALUE", "paper_id": "WOS:000287427800007"}
