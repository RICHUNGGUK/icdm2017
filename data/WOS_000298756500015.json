Properties such as IR spectrum, heat of formation, thermodynamic properties, and crystal structure were predicted. The compound belongs to the Pbca space group, with the lattice parameters a = 15.07 , b = 12.56 , c = 18.34 , Z = 8, and rho = 1.990 g center dot cm(-3). The stability of the compound was evaluated by the bond dissociation energies and results showed that the first step of pyrolysis is the rupture of the N-NO(2) bond in the side chain. The detonation properties were estimated by the Kamlet-Jacobs equations based on the calculated crystal density and heat of formation, and the results were 9.240 km center dot s(-1) for detonation velocity and 40.136 GPa for detonation pressure. The designed compound has high thermal stability and good detonation properties and is probably a promising high energy density compound (HEDC).", "paper_title": "Theoretical investigations of a high density cage compound 10-(1-nitro-1, 2, 3, 4-tetraazol-5-yl)) methyl-2, 4, 6, 8, 12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane", "paper_id": "WOS:000298756500015"}
