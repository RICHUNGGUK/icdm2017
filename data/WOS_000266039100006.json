The proposed algorithm has the better performance than space-time matched filter, supports small sample sizes, and even works well in array error condition. Most notably, it does not require knowledge of the direction of arrival and channel fading information.", "paper_title": "BLIND PARALIND SPACE-TIME MULTIUSER DETECTION FOR ASYNCHRONOUS CDMA SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000266039100006"}
