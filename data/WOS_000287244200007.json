When consecutive segments run on different cores, accesses to intersegment data incur cache misses. Data marshaling eliminates such cache misses by identifying and marshaling the necessary intersegment data when a segment is shipped to a remote core.", "paper_title": "DATA MARSHALING FOR MULTICORE SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287244200007"}
