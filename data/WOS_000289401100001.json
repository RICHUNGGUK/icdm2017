However, large number of unforeseen factors and events influence the drilling rate and make it, a complex and stochastic process. Consequently, prediction of drilling rate has remained challenging during last decades. Many different techniques have been introduced for this mission. Among those, Bourgoyne and Young model (BY M) has been widely used during last decades. BY M has been made up of eight functions. Each function represents the effect of some drilling parameters. Although the relationship between drilling rate and mentioned eight functions is nonlinear and very complex, Bourgoyne and Young simply multiplied all eight functions with each other to attain the drilling rate. In tics research, after determining constant coefficients of Bourgoyne and Young model using Genetic Algorithm, a General Regression Neural Networks (GRNN) is employed hierarchically in ()viler to uncover the complex relation saof drilling rate and mentioned eight functions of BYM. The data sets used in this study are nine wells of an Iranian gas field called \"Khangiran\". Simulation results show that the proposed approach is more accurate than a GABYM in drilling rate prediction.", "paper_title": "INTELLIGENT DRILLING RATE PREDICTOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000289401100001"}
