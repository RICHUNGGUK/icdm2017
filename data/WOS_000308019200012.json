In this context, computational image processing for the analysis of single cell behaviour plays an increasing role in systems biology and mathematical modelling approaches. Consequently, we developed a software package with graphical user interface for the analysis of single bacterial cell behaviour. Results: A new software called TLM-Tracker allows for the flexible and user-friendly interpretation for the segmentation, tracking and lineage analysis of microbial cells in time-lapse movies.", "paper_title": "TLM-Tracker: software for cell segmentation, tracking and lineage analysis in time-lapse microscopy movies", "paper_id": "WOS:000308019200012"}
