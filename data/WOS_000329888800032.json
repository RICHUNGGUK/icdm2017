A comprehensive data driven model using an extended Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM) has been developed whose input is a 26 dimensional facial geometric feature vector comprising eye, lip and eyebrow feature points. The analytical face model using this 26 dimensional geometric feature vector has been effectively used to describe the facial changes due to different expressions. This paper thus includes an automated generation scheme of this geometric facial feature vector. The proposed non-heuristic model has been developed using training data from MMI facial expression database. The emotion recognition accuracy of the proposed scheme has been compared with radial basis function network, multi-layered perceptron model and support vector machine based recognition schemes. The experimental results show that the proposed model is very efficient in recognizing six basic emotions while ensuring significant increase in average classification accuracy over radial basis function and multilayered perceptron. It also shows that the average recognition rate of the proposed method is comparatively better than multi-class support vector machine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
