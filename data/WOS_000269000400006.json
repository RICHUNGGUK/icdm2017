This paper presents a new algorithm for recognizing small blends automatically for the purpose of mesh generation. The algorithm first transforms the input B-rep model into an aggregation of faces. Then, each face is judged to be a blend or not based on matching conditions. At last, the blends with larger physical sizes than a threshold value are excluded. The innovations lie in the recognition conditions and the unique calculating procedure of the blend physical size. Several examples are given to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Automatic small blend recognition from B-rep models for analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000269000400006"}
