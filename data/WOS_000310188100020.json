The method is based on the \"precise integration method\" and an improvement on the data preliminary treatment is employed to ensure the precision. For practical usage, a trigonometric function approximation expression for the cnoidal function is provided with brief verification. When the modulus of the wave is less than 0.95, the maximum error and absolute average error are acceptable for engineering. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
