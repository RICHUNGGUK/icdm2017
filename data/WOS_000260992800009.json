Although there are many sources of uncertainty in system models, two basic kinds of parametric uncertainty are fundamentally different from each other: natural/stochastic and epistemic uncertainties. However, conventional methods such as standard Monte Carlo Sampling (MCS), which assumes vagueness as random property, may not be suitable for this type of uncertainty analysis. An improved systematic uncertainty and variability analysis can provide insight into the level of confidence in model estimates, and it can aid in assessing how various possible model estimates should be weighed. The main goal of the present study was to introduce Fuzzy Latin Hypercube Sampling (FLHS), a hybrid approach for incorporating epistemic and stochastic uncertainties separately. An important property of this technique is its ability to merge inexact generated data of the LHS approach to increase the quality of information. The FLHS technique ensures that the entire range of each variable is sampled with proper incorporation of uncertainty and variability. A fuzzified statistical summary of the model results produces a detailed sensitivity analysis, which relates the effects of variability and uncertainty of input variables to model predictions. The feasibility of the method has been tested with a case study, analyzing total variance in the calculation of incremental lifetime risks due to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) for the residents living in the surroundings of a municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) in the Basque Country, Spain.
