Shparlinski showed that there exists a polynomial basis having 0 (log n) elements of trace one. Here we show that for every t <= n, there exists a polynomial basis having t + O (log n) elements of trace one. We also study consequences of our results to the existence of irreducible polynomials of certain weights.", "paper_title": "The trace spectra of polynomial bases for F(2)n", "paper_id": "WOS:000248134300005"}
