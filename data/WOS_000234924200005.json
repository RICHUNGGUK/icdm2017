The company has to maintain a stable supply of containers to meet spontaneous shipment demand. The regional maintenance and repair (M&R) team is responsible for the control of technical requirements and repair standards of the containers. The regional M&R office will use a contract survey service if it has a query on a repair request. The traditional way of approving repair request by using fax and telephone results in a large amount of paper work. Information lag has an adverse effect on container readiness. We use a case study of a container shipping company to illustrate that a knowledge-based work order system can enhance the maintenance capability of inventory management. Through the example of building a communication platform, the company can gain knowledge of different trading parties, making better forecasts and strategic plans.", "paper_title": "A case on re-engineering the work order system in a container shipping company", "paper_id": "WOS:000234924200005"}
