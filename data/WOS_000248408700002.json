The estimator expression was derived and shown to be independent of the stimulating signal. Simulations were used for obtaining the critical values for this coherence estimate. The technique was also evaluated throughout simulations and next applied to the EEG from 12 subjects under intermittent photic stimulation at 4 and 6 Hz. In both simulation and EEG data, major differences between partial and simple coherences occurred at the stimulation frequency and harmonics, except for those falling within the alpha band. These findings suggest that the technique is highly selective in removing the contribution of the periodic source. They also indicate high coherence values of the ongoing EEG within the alpha band.", "paper_title": "Evaluating the relationship of non-phase locked activities in the electroencephalogram during intermittent stimulation: a partial coherence-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000248408700002"}
