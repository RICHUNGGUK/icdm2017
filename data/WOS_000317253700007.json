First approach uses extended complex-valued back-propagation algorithm to train MLP network, whose output's amplitudes are encoded in one-of-N coding. It makes a classification decision based on accumulated distance between network output and trained pattern. The second approach is inspired in RBF networks with two layer architecture. Neurons from the first layer have fixed position in space and time encoded into theirs weights. This layer is trained by presented extension of neural gas algorithm into complex numbers. The second layer affects which neurons from the first layer belong to specific class. Paper contains details on experimenting with proposed approaches on artificial data of hand-written character recognition and comparison of both methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
