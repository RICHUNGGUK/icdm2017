Knowledge acquisition (KA), i.e. building a BN from the knowledge of experts in the application domain, involves two phases: knowledge gathering and model construction, i.e. defining the model based on that knowledge. The number of parameters involved in a large network is normally intractable to be specified by human experts. This leads to a trade-off between the accuracy of a detailed model and the size and complexity of such a model. In this paper, a Knowledge Acquisition Tool (KAT) to automatically perform information gathering and model construction for diagnosis of the radio access part of cellular networks is presented. KAT automatically builds a diagnosis model based on the experts' answers to a sequence of questions regarding his way of reasoning in diagnosis. This will be performed for two BN structures: Simple Bayes Model (SBM) and Independence of Causal Influence (ICI) models.", "paper_title": "Knowledge acquisition for diagnosis in cellular networks based on Bayesian networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200006"}
