First, the probability density function (pdf) of inter-carrier interference (ICI) power in Rayleigh fadiner environments is derived. Second, the pdf of the signalto-interference ratio (SIR) is then derived. The cumulative distribution function (cdf) and hence pdf of the SIR with selective diversity are then given in the third and fourth steps. Using the BER expressions of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and differential BPSK (DBPSK) modulation in an added white Gaussian noise (AWGN), the corresponding BER expressions of OFDM systems can then be derived. Detailed discussions are given. Possible future work is also outlined.
