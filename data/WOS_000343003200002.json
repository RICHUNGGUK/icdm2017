Remote sensing analysis modeling often requires the use of multiple data sources, computer resources, tools, and models, and couples these resources into a workflow for global change research. Therefore, remote sensing analysis modeling research today faces a critical challenge: the registry, discovery, and allocation of modeling resources are complex, as they are heterogeneous and geographically distributed. This paper proposes a resource package-oriented approach that provides guidelines for remote sensing analysis modeling to increase model sharing and integrating. This unified wrapping approach can be used to make the management and use of existing resources becoming easy and reusable. Based on this description of construction method, different remote sensing analysis resources can be combined together on-demand. We developed a web environment to compose different remote sensing modeling resources as on-demand processing components, based on the existing workflow engineering, and use a dust storm monitoring model as an example. Comparative analyses are given to further explain the applications of this hierarchical construction method in the areas of the remote sensing analysis model.", "paper_title": "A \"Resource Package\"-Oriented Approach for Remote Sensing Analysis Modeling - Dust Storm Monitoring Model as Example", "paper_id": "WOS:000343003200002"}
