The algorithm is presented here in 1, 2 or 3 physical dimensions. The size power-law exponent c or the fractal dimension D can be specified ab initio over a substantial range. The method creates an infinite set of shapes whose areas (lengths, volumes) obey a power law and sum to the area (length and volume) to be filled. The algorithm begins by randomly placing the largest shape and continues using random search to place each smaller shape where it does not overlap or touch any previously placed shape. The resulting gasket is a single connected object.", "paper_title": "An Algorithm for Random Fractal Filling of Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000327433800008"}
