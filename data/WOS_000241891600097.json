However, it is a computational challenge. A self-adaptive string length evolution strategy was presented so as to meet the inconstant intersection number in different potential routes. String length would be adjusted according to the intersection number. Simulation results showed it could work well in the urban rerouting problem.", "paper_title": "Self-adaptive length genetic algorithm for urban rerouting problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600097"}
