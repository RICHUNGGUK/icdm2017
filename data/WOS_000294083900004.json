In the post deployment scenario, existing coverage or connectivity of the network is disturbed due to predictable or unpredictable death of the nodes and maintenance of the network manually is difficult due to physical condition of the monitoring region. In this paper, potential connectivity and coverage maintenance algorithms for the wireless sensor networks are proposed that let the sensors work alternatively by identifying the redundant sensing regions in the post deployed scenarios and maintain the network with limited mobility. Decision of mobility of the nodes among immediate neighbors of a dead node is totally autonomous and distributed, and it is made to maintain the network without disturbing the existing coverage and connectivity. Performance evaluation of our protocols shows that the average mobility distance and energy consumption of the nodes are limited to maintain the coverage and connectivity. Moreover, the proposed algorithms could be worked for the communication range (R-c) of a node is equal to sensing range (R-s) or for R-c < 2R(s). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
