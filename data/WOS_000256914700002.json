Hypercubes, crossed cubes, twisted cubes, and Mobius cubes all belong to the class of BC networks (Fan and He in Chin. J. Comput. 26(1): 84 - 90, 2003). We prove that the super connectivity of X(n) is 2n - 2 for n >= 3 and the conditional diagnosability of X(n) is 4n - 7 for n >= 5. As a corollary of this result, we obtain the super connectivity and conditional diagnosability of the hypercubes, twisted cubes, crossed cubes, and Mobius cubes.", "paper_title": "On conditional diagnosability and reliability of the BC networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256914700002"}
