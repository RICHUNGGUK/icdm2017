Geometric detail scaling and enhancement can always produce fantastic effects by directly manipulating the geometric details of the underlying geometry. Detail-preserving editing is capable of preserving geometric details during the shape deformation of point-sampled model. For efficient editing, the point set of the model is first clustered by a mean shift scheme, according to its anisotropic geometric features and each cluster is abstracted as a simplification sample point (SSP). Our editing operation is implemented by manipulating the SSP first and then diffusing the deformation to all sample points on the underlying geometry. As a post-processing step, a new up-sampling and relaxation procedure is proposed to refine the deformed model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by several examples.", "paper_title": "High frequency geometric detail manipulation and editing for point-sampled surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000252486200005"}
