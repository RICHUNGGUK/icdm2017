In quantum computing, reversible computing is the main venue for the realization and design of classical functions and circuits. We present a new approach to synthesis of reversible circuits using Kronecker Functional Lattice Diagrams (KFLD). Unlike many of contemporary algorithms for synthesis of reversible functions that use n x n Toffoli gates, our method synthesizes functions using 3 x 3 Toffoli gates, Feynman gates and NOT gates. This reduces the quantum cost of the designed circuit but adds additional ancilla bits. The resulting circuits are always regular in a 4-neighbor model and all connections are predictable. Consequently resulting circuits can be directly mapped in to a quantum device such as quantum FPGA[14]. This is a significant advantage of our method, as it allows us to design optimum circuits for a given quantum technology.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of Quantum Arrays from Kronecker Functional Lattice Diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784600007"}
