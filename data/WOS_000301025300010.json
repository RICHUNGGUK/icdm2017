The sum of exponentials model finds application in modeling various physical phenomena in a wide variety of real life applications. The problem of finding the nonlinear least squares estimates in well known to be numerically difficult. In this paper, we propose an elitist generational genetic algorithm based iterative procedure for computing the nonlinear least squares estimates. Simulation studies and real life data fitting examples indicate satisfactory performance of the proposed technique. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
