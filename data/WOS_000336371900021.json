By employing Lyapunov functional and theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side, we establish several sufficient conditions for exponential stability of the equilibrium point. In comparison with the existing results, the proposed stability conditions are milder and more general, and can be applied to the memristor-based neural networks model whose connection weight changes continuously. Numerical examples are also presented to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Global exponential stability of a class of memristive neural networks with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000336371900021"}
