A cellular/VoWLAN dual-mode system enables users to access a low-cost VoIP service in a WLAN hotspot and switch to a wide-area cellular system without WLANs. Unfortunately, cellular/VoWLAN dual-mode mobiles suffer the power consumption problem that becomes one of the major concerns for commercial deployment of the dual-mode service. In this study, we present a novel power saving mechanism, called PIANO (paging via another radio), for the integration of heterogeneous wireless networks, and further apply the proposed methods to implement a cellular/VoWLAN dual-mode system. Based on the proposed mechanisms, a dual-mode mobile can completely switch off its WLAN interface, only leaving the cellular interface awake to listen to paging messages. When a mobile receives a paging message from its cellular interface, it wakes up the WLAN interface and responds to connection requests via WLAN networks. Therefore, a dual-mode mobile reduces the power consumption by turning off the WLAN interface during idle, and can also receive VoWLAN services. Measurement results based on the prototype system demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly extend the standby hours of a dual-mode mobile.", "paper_title": "PIANO: A power saving strategy for cellular/VoWLAN dual-mode mobiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000257394500010"}
