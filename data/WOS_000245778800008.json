At these points elasto-plastic tangent operators could become singular which would cause considerable numerical difficulties. In this paper we present a modified elliptic cap model in which the surfaces intersect in a smooth manner and in this way there is no need for changing the original model parameters. Several numerical examples are presented which show a very good approximation of soil behavior and an excellent convergence of computed results for all possible stress paths. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
