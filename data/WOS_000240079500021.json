Each model is represented as a clustered hierarchy of sphere tree (CHST). Graphics processing unit (GPU)-based occlusion queries were used for fast collision culling between massive models. Furthermore, we are able to generate these hierarchies and perform collision queries using out-of-core techniques on all triangulated models. Experimental results show that STHCD performs real-time collision detection between massive bones and implant models, consisting of millions of triangles at interactive rates on a commodity PC.", "paper_title": "Efficient and accurate collision detection based on surgery simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500021"}
