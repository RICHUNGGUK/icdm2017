Among many serious parameters affecting the performance of MEMS gyros, our attention is focused on the scale factor error due to its nonlinearity and asymmetry. Motivated by the capability of fuzzy logic in managing nonlinear mapping, a fuzzy logic based compensation algorithm is proposed. The ADXRS 300 gyros of Analog Device were selected as the candidates at our lab. Experimental results demonstrate that gyros augmented by proposed approach show improvements in scale factor error of an order of magnitude (extremely linear output) throughout operating dynamic range.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy logic based performance augmentation of MEMS gyroscope", "paper_id": "WOS:000261327100002"}
