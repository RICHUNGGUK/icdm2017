In this approach, GA's selection and crossover operations are used in CA's population space. GA's mutation is replaced by CA based mutation operation which can attract individuals to move to the semi-feasible and feasible region of the optimization problem to avoid the 'eyeless' searching in GA. Thus it is possible to enhance search ability and to reduce computational cost. This approach is applied to solve constrained optimization problems. An example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Integration of genetic algorithm and cultural algorithms for constrained optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000090"}
