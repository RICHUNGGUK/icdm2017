The security itself within this network is an additional concern that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we present a trust-based framework for secure and effective collaboration within an intrusion detection network (IDN). In particular, we design a trust model that allows each IDS to evaluate the trustworthiness of other IDSes based on its personal experience. We also propose an admission control algorithm for the IDS to manage the acquaintances it approaches for advice about intrusions. We discuss the effectiveness of our approach in protecting the IDN against common attacks. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate that our system yields significant improvement in detecting intrusions. The trust model further improves the robustness of the collaborative system against malicious attacks. The experimental results also support that our admission control algorithm is effective and fair, and creates incentives for collaboration.", "paper_title": "Trust Management and Admission Control for Host-Based Collaborative Intrusion Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000287504000005"}
