With the growth of Internet GIS, many difficulties have occurred in integrating GIS components because of their diversity. The main objective of this study is to suggest a new development model for dynamic and interoperable Internet GIS applications. The model is based mainly on the dynamic integration of Internet GIS components by applying Extensible Markup Language (XML), XML Web Service, Geography Markup Language (GML), and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), etc. The relevant technologies of Internet GIS were reviewed thoroughly, and then a new model was designed. During the design of the new model, typical examples of GIS Web Service components were suggested, together with practical structures for applications using these components. Six examples of components and four types of applications were suggested, and they were experimentally implemented for model validation and improvement. The suggested model and components will enable easier and more rapid development of Internet GIS applications through the dynamic integration of distributed GIS components. Users will be able to avoid redundancy and consequently reduce both cost and time during each GIS project.", "paper_title": "XML Web service-based development model for Internet GIS applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000237482700002"}
