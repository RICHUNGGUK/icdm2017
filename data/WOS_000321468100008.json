In this paper, using the feasibility and simplicity of grid-based clustering and routing schemes, we investigate optimizing lifetime of a two-dimensional wireless sensor network. Thus how to determine the optimal grid sizes in order to prolong network lifetime becomes an important problem. At first, we propose a model for lifetime of a grid in equal-grid model. We also consider that nodes can transfer packets to a grid which is two or more grids away in order to investigate the trade-off between traffic and transmission energy consumption. After developing the model for an adjustable-grid scenario, in order to optimize lifetime of the network, we derive the optimal values for dimensions of the grids. The results show that if radio ranges are adjusted appropriately, the network lifetime in adjustable-grid model is prolonged compared with the best case where an equal-grid model is used.", "paper_title": "Increasing Lifetime of a Two-Dimensional Wireless Sensor Network Using Radio Range Adjustments", "paper_id": "WOS:000321468100008"}
