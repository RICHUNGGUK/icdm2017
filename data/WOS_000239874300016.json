The sequence of moments when a neuron emits a spike is called the spike train (of this neuron); by designating one neuron as the output neuron of a spiking neural P system Pi, one obtains a spike train of Pi. Given a specific way of assigning sets of numbers to spike trains of Pi, we obtain sets of numbers computed by Pi. In this way, spiking neural P systems become number computing devices. We consider a number of ways to assign (code) sets of numbers to (by) spike trains, and prove then computational completeness: the computed sets of numbers are exactly Turing computable sets. When the number of spikes present in the system is bounded, a characterization of semilinear sets of numbers is obtained. A number of research problems is also formulated.", "paper_title": "Spike trains in spiking neural P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239874300016"}
