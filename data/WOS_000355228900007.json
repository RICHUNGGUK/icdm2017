In the proposed approach, a multi-reservoir cascaded hydro-electric system with a nonlinear relationship between water discharge rate, net head and power generation is considered. Constraints such as power balance, water balance, reservoir volume limits and operation limits of hydro and thermal plants are also considered. The feasibility, and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a test system, and the obtained results are compared with the existing conventional and evolutionary algorithms. Simulation results reveal that the proposed CMS-ES_DTBP scheme appears to be best in terms of convergence speed and cost compared with other techniques.", "paper_title": "Short-term hydro-thermal scheduling using CMA-ES with directed target to best perturbation scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000355228900007"}
