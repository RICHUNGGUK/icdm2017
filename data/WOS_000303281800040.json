In order to build the model, the paper also proposes and preliminarily investigates the use of multi-label classification algorithm using only the LO features. As many LOs include textual material that can be indexed, and such indexes can also be used to filter the objects by matching them against user-provided keywords, we then did experiments using web classification with text features to compare the accuracy with the results from metadata (LO feature).
