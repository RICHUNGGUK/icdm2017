This paper aims to present a new method for such decomposition, where a combination of algebraic graph theory and differential equations is employed. Design/methodology/approach - In the present method, a combination of graph theory and differential equations is employed. The proposed method transforms the eigenvalue problem involved in decomposing FEM by the algebraic graph method, into a specific initial value problem of an ordinary differential equation. Findings - The transformation of this paper enables many advanced numerical methods for ordinary differential equations to be used in the computation of the eigenproblems. Originality/value - Combining two different tools, namely algebraic graph theory and differential equations, results in an efficient and accurate method for decomposing the FEM which is a combinatorial optimization problem. Examples are included to illustrate the efficiency of the present method.", "paper_title": "A new algorithm for domain decomposition of finite element models", "paper_id": "WOS:000259510600003"}
