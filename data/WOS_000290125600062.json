Visually salient region is introduced into watermark synchronization. The saliency value of a region is used as the quantitative measure of robustness, based on which the idea of locally most salient region (LMSR) is proposed to generate the disjoint invariant regions. A meaningful binary watermark is then encoded using Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) in transform domain. Simulation results and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "High Capacity Watermark Embedding Based on Invariant Regions of Visual Saliency", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600062"}
