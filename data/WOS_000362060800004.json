A motion control strategy of walking-aid robot based on the observation of the human status through wearable sensors is proposed. During normal walking, the robot is controlled using a conventional admittance control scheme. When the tendency of a fall is detected, the robot will immediately react to prevent the user from falling down. The distance between the human Center of Pressure (COP) and the midpoint of the human feet is assumed to be a significant feature to detecting the fall events. When the user is in a quasi-static state or walking slowly, the COP can be approximated by the projection of Center of Gravity (COG) of the user's body. A simple and low-cost wearable sensor system is proposed to measure online the COG of the user. A limitation of the proposed wearable sensor system is that the Head-Arms-Torso (HAT) of the user is assumed to be always in upright position, which may generate measurement error. From comparison experiments with a reference optical system it is found that the measurement error is acceptable especially at the early stage of fall event. Dubois possibility theory is applied to describe the membership function of \"normal walking\" state. A threshold based fall detection approach is obtained from online evaluation of the walking status. Finally, experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier IV.
