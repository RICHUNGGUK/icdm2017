An important question in this research area has been to decide whether the closures associated with certain families of lattice-free sets are polyhedra. For a long time, the only result known was the celebrated theorem of Cook, Kannan and Schrijver who showed that the split closure is a polyhedron. Although some fairly general results were obtained by Andersen et al. (Math Oper Res 35(1):233-256, 2010) and Averkov (Discret Optimiz 9(4):209-215, 2012), some basic questions have remained unresolved. For example, maximal lattice-free triangles are the natural family to study beyond the family of splits and it has been a standing open problem to decide whether the triangle closure is a polyhedron. In this paper, we show that when the number of integer variables the triangle closure is indeed a polyhedron and its number of facets can be bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input data. The techniques of this proof are also used to give a refinement of necessary conditions for valid inequalities being facet-defining due to Cornu,jols and Margot (Math Program 120:429-456, 2009) and obtain polynomial complexity results about the mixed integer hull.", "paper_title": "The triangle closure is a polyhedron", "paper_id": "WOS:000336278500002"}
