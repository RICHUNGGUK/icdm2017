In this paper we prove a trade-off between the size of the separator and the sharpness with which we can fix the size of the two sides of the partition. Our result appears to be a handy and powerful tool for the design of exact and parameterized algorithms for NP-hard problems. We illustrate that by presenting two applications. Our first application is a O(2 (n+o(n)))-time algorithm for the Degree Constrained Spanning Tree problem: find a spanning tree of a graph with the maximum number of nodes satisfying given degree constraints. This problem generalizes some well-studied problems, among them Hamiltonian Path, Full Degree Spanning Tree, Bounded Degree Spanning Tree, and Maximum Internal Spanning Tree. The second application is a parameterized algorithm with running time O(16 (k+o(k))+n (O(1))) for the k-Internal Out-Branching problem: here the goal is to compute an out-branching of a digraph with at least k internal nodes. This is a significant improvement over the best previously known parameterized algorithm for the problem by Cohen et al. (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 76:650-662, 2010), running in time O(49.4 (k) +n (O(1))).", "paper_title": "Sharp Separation and Applications to Exact and Parameterized Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000300573500009"}
