THE AUTHORS DEMONSTRATE A PERFORMANCE OF 8.11 GFLOPS ON THE MYRIAD I PROCESSOR, AND A PERFORMANCE/WATT RATIO OF 23.17 GFLOPS/W FOR A KEY COMPUTATIONAL KERNEL. THESE RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR SCIENTIFIC-COMPUTING TASKS AND INVITE FURTHER RESEARCH.", "paper_title": "THE MOVIDIUS MYRIAD ARCHITECTURE'S POTENTIAL FOR SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000351462300003"}
