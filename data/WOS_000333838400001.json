The key issue is how to process the numerous events generated by IoT. In this paper, a proactive complex event processing method is proposed for large-scale transportation IoT. Based on a multilayered adaptive dynamic Bayesian model, a Bayesian network structure learning algorithm using search-and-score is proposed to support accurate predictive analytics. A parallel Markov decision processes model is designed to support proactive event processing. State partitioning and mean field based approximation are used to support large-scale application. The experimental evaluations show that this method can support proactive complex event processing well in large-scale transportation Internet of Things.", "paper_title": "A Proactive Complex Event Processing Method for Large-Scale Transportation Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000333838400001"}
