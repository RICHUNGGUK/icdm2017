Salient feature. of ONTOP include a knowledge base that incorporates both standardized optimization terminology, formal method definitions, and often unrecorded optimization details, such as any idealizations and assumptions that may be made when creating an optimization model, as well as the model developer's rationale and justification behind these zation model, as well as the model developer idealizations and assumptions. ONTOP was developed using Protege, a Java-based, free. open-source ontology development environment created by Stanford University. Two engineering design optimization case studies are presented. The first case study consists of the optimization of a structural beam element and demonstrates ONTOP's ability to ad dress the variations in an optimal solution that may arise when different techniques and approaches are used. A second case study, a more complex design problem that deals with the optimization of an impeller of a pediatric left ventricular heart assist device, demonstrates the wealth of knowledge ONTOP is able to capture. Together these test beds help illustrate the potential value of an ontology in representing application-specific knowledge while facilitating both the sharing and exchanging of this knowledge in engineering design optimization.", "paper_title": "Ontologies for supporting engineering design optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000247557100004"}
