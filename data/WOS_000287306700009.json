Incautious implementation of these features demands both heavy memory and performance overrun. To accomplish such software evolution activities in resource-constrained embedded systems, we propose a component-based run-time evolution infrastructure that reconciles richness of evolution alternatives and performance requirements. Our proposal is based on off-site components reifications, which are representations of components that allow us to treat evolution concerns remotely. Hence, the workload to be processed by the embedded device is alleviated. Memory and processor-time resources consumption evaluation on a real-world scenario show the efficiency and pertinence of our approach.", "paper_title": "A Component-based Run-time Evolution Infrastructure for Resource-Constrained Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000287306700009"}
