The key is to opportunistically leverage data lossless compressibility and utilize the compression gain to realize memory-damage-aware data manipulation to reduce the cycling-induced physical damage. Based upon experiments using commercial sub-22-nm MLC NAND flash memory chips, we show that the proposed design technique can improve the P/E cycling endurance by 50%. We further carried out application-specific integrated circuit design to demonstrate the practical feasibility for implementing the proposed design technique.", "paper_title": "True-Damage-Aware Enumerative Coding for Improving NAND Flash Memory Endurance", "paper_id": "WOS:000355218000018"}
