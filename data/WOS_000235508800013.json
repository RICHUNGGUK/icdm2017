This improvement is achieved by adjusting each mobile node's optimal regional domains according to its mobility behavior. With Mobile IP, the capricious mobility and variable traffic load of a mobile node has an impact on its average signaling traffic cost. In this paper, the mobility of all mobile nodes is classified into two modes: random mobility mode and regular mobility mode. We develop new analytical models to formulate the movement behavior and mathematically evaluate their characteristics when applied to these two modes. MORR has the adaptability to manipulate various mobility modes of each mobile node in dedicated ways to determine an optimal regional domain of this mobile node. Simulation results show that anywhere from 3 to 15 percent of the signaling cost is saved by MORR in comparison with the previous distributed dynamic location management schemes for various scenarios.", "paper_title": "MORR: A novel regional location management scheme based on user movement behavior in mobile IP", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508800013"}
