These features are used to train a classifier that can effectively learn cues such as the presence of a nearby post-synaptic region. As a result, our algorithm successfully distinguishes synapses from the numerous other organelles that appear within an EM volume, including those whose local textural properties are relatively similar. Furthermore, as a by-product of the segmentation, our method flawlessly determines synaptic orientation, a crucial element in the interpretation of brain circuits. We evaluate our approach on three different datasets, compare it against the state-of-the-art in synapse segmentation and demonstrate our ability to reliably collect shape, density, and orientation statistics over hundreds of synapses.", "paper_title": "Learning Context Cues for Synapse Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000325380300010"}
