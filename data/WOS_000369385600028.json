A new ABCDV-Hop (Artificial Bee Colony DV-Hop) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Based on the traditional DV-Hop algorithm, by using the minimum hops of nodes and position information of anchor nodes, the average distance per hop is solved by artificial bee colony algorithm to make it more close to the actual value. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional DV-Hop algorithm, the improved algorithm can effectively reduce the positioning error without increasing the node hardware overhead.", "paper_title": "A SECURITY DV-Hop Localization Algorithm Resist Spoofing Attack", "paper_id": "WOS:000369385600028"}
