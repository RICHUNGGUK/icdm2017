In contrast to earlier work, it is based on electrical equations rather than table look up, thus, exposing more flexibility. For the first time, simulation of sequential circuits is dealt with; interaction of fault effects in current time frame And earlier time frames is elaborated on for different bridge resistances. Experimental results are given for resistive-bridging and stuck-at faults in combinational and sequential circuits. Different definitions of fault coverage are listed, and quantitative results with respect to all these definitions are given for the first time.", "paper_title": "Simulating resistive-bridging and stuck-at faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000240926700022"}
