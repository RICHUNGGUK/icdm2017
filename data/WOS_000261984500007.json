In this paper, we propose a rule language to specify and explicitly manage the normative positions of agents (permissions, prohibitions and obligations), with which distinct deontic notions and their relationships can be captured. Our rule-based formalism includes constraints for more expressiveness and precision and allows to supplement (and implement) electronic institutions with norms. We also show how some normative aspects are given computational interpretation.", "paper_title": "Constraint rule-based programming of norms for electronic institutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000261984500007"}
