Generally, solving the CSP is NP-hard, and many different approaches have been developed. In this paper, a novel computing model, a class of neural-like membrane systems (neural-like P systems) which is inspired by the graph-like structure and intercellular communication of biological neurons is presented as a model for solving CSPs. Neural-like P systems are networks of cells (neurons) working with multisets or strings. By broadcasting symbol-impulses to neighbor cells and processing multisets or strings of symbol-impulses from neighbor cells, neural-like P systems can solve the CSP in polynomial time without using cell division or cell separation.", "paper_title": "A Polynomial-Time Solution to Constraint Satisfaction Problems by Neural-like P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000324972400008"}
