In particular we concentrate on insertion or deletion of Watson Crick palindromes. We show that the new relation similar to(theta) is, in fact, an equivalence relation where theta is any arbitrary antimorphic involution that is not the identity on the letters of the alphabet. We also show that the set of all theta-palindromic free words defined in (Daley et al. in preparation) is similar to(theta)-independent. Using the relation we define a new subclass of primitive words which we call as similar to(theta)-primitive words and show that the class of all similar to(theta)-primitive words is closed under circular permutations. We also define similar to(theta)-conjugates and similar to(theta)-commutativity and study the properties of such words and show that they are similar to that of conjugate words and words that commute.", "paper_title": "A relation by palindromic subwords", "paper_id": "WOS:000286534400011"}
