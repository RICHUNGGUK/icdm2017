The independent variables in the model are nitriding time, salt bath compositions ratio, salt bath aging time, ferro-chromium particle size, ferro-chromium weight percent, salt bath temperature and coating time. The model output variable was the layer thickness of coating. For purpose of constructing these models, 105 different experimental data were gathered from the experiment. The data used in the fuzzy logic model is arranged in a format of eigth parameters that cover the input and output parameter. In this model, the training and testing results in the fuzzy logic systems have shown strong potential for prediction of effects of pre-nitriding, salt bath condition and coating variables on layer thickness of Cr(C, N) coating on 1.2210 steel.", "paper_title": "Modeling layer thickness of duplex ceramic (chromium carbonitride) coating on cold work tool steel using fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000334211500013"}
