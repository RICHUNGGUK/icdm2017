The 802.11 handoff consists of (1) scanning, (2) authentication, and (3) reassociation. Particularly, the scanning has been studied intensively since it accounts for a major portion of the handoff latency due to potential overheads in the scanning operation. That is, (1) a scanning STAtion (STA) should stay in a scanned channel waiting for Access Points (APs)' responses without any assurances of APs' existence after request frame transmissions; moreover, (2) per-channel waiting time is not explicitly defined in the 802.11 standard. In order to reduce the overheads, we propose novel scanning schemes composed of two phases: (1) channel selection phase; and (2) AP search phase. In the channel selection phase, a scanning STA identifies and selects the channels suitable for the 802.11 scanning by assessing all employed channels with Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS) handshaking in a virtual AP environment. Then, in the AP search phase, it performs a unicast-based scanning in order to search for an AP suitable for its handoff in a selected channel. For a proper handoff decision depending on STA's requirement, we build two algorithms referred to as first-fit and near best-fit algorithms, respectively. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed schemes to existing approaches via simulations with realistic time-varying channel models in various simulation environments. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scanning schemes provide relatively shorter handoff latencies as (1) a scanning STA has shorter channel switching time; (2) an 802.11 WLAN employs more channels; and (3) the APs are deployed more densely.
