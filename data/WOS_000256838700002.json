The authors proposed a new way to solve the burst contentions in OBS rings. As illustrated in the paper, basing the optical buffers with depth about the maximum Data Burst (DB) size and a proper wavelengths selection strategy for the local DBs the burst loss rate in an OBS ring can be decreased to a negligible level. So buffer insertion, the most successful method for asynchronous packet switching, can be adopted in OBS ring by an acceptable cost.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the burst loss rate in OBS rings with depth limited optical buffers", "paper_id": "WOS:000256838700002"}
