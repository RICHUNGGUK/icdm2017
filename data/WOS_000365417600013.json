We define a generic model where transitions are labeled by elements of a finite partition of the alphabet. We then extend Angluin's L* algorithm for learning regular languages from examples for such automata. We have implemented this algorithm and we demonstrate its behavior where the alphabet is a subset of the natural or real numbers. We sketch the extension of the algorithm to a class of languages over partially ordered alphabets.", "paper_title": "LEARNING REGULAR LANGUAGES OVER LARGE ORDERED ALPHABETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000365417600013"}
