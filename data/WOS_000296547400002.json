The proposed method is based on the formulation of novel error functions in the projective plane between lines and points which involve the use of non-linear optimisation procedures that allow to treat equally finite and infinite vanishing points. These functions are included into the EM framework, which handles the multi-modality of the problem naturally with mixture models. Results show that the proposed method of joint computation of vanishing points and lines converging at such points enhances the robustness and the accuracy of locating these points.
