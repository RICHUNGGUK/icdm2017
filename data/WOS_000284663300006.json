Through the exploration of the sub-space code sequences and bit code sequences for different gray levels, the authors first complete the design and implementation of the parameterized fractal scanning IP core for various gray levels, which can be used in every flat panel display controller. And then a novel OLED gray-scale controller embedded in a fractal scanning IP core is designed. It can efficiently increase the imaging gray levels and speed up frame frequency of display systems. Serial applications and tests indicate that the novel controller can obtain 100% scan utilization and a significant decrease in the system clock frequency (a multiple of 29 for 256 gray levels), compared with the traditional scan methods. With the proposed method there is no need of using high-speed IC circuits to realize the high articulation and resolution display of video images. Thus, the paper provides a new approach and an engineering way to solve one of the pressing problems of high-resolution flat panel display technology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
