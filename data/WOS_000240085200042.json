This paper improves the tolerance relation proposed by M.Kryszkiewcz to obtain the gamma-tolerance relation and gamma-tolerance classes, presents rough set model for incomplete information system based on the gamma-tolerance relation. The method of gamma-tolerance relation is proved to be more superior to that of M.Kryszkiewcz's tolerance relation. Finally, the conception of gamma-attributes reduction is defined, and the algorithm of gamma-attribute reduction is provided.", "paper_title": "Knowledge reduction in incomplete systems based on gamma-tolerance relation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200042"}
