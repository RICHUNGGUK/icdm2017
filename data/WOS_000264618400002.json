The resistors of the classical passive polyphase filter have been replaced by transconductors, CMOS inverters (F. Tillman and H. Sjoland, Proceedings of the Norchip Conference (pp. 12-15), Nov. 2005; Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing, 50(1) 7-12, 2007). A three-stage 0.13 mu m CMOS active polyphase filter has been designed. Simulations with a differential input signal show a quadrature error less than 1A degrees for the full stable input voltage range for frequencies from 6 GHz to 14 GHz. Phase errors in the differential input signal are suppressed at least three times at the output. Corner simulations at 10 GHz show a maximum phase error of 3A degrees with both n- and pMOS slow, in all other cases the error is less than 0.75A degrees. The three-stage filter consumes 34 mA from a 1.2 V supply. To investigate the robustness of the filter to changes in inverter delay, an inverter model was implemented in Verilog-A. Linear c (in) and g (in) were used, whereas g (m) , c (out) , and g (out) were non-linear. It was found that the filter could tolerate substantial delays. Up to 40A degrees phase shift resulted in less than 1.5A degrees quadrature phase error at the output.", "paper_title": "Analysis of a high frequency and wide bandwidth active polyphase filter based on CMOS inverters", "paper_id": "WOS:000264618400002"}
