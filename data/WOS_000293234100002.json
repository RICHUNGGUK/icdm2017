We consider the batch consolidation problem of minimizing the number of batches of a finite set of items. This article focuses on the case in which only one or two items can be processed in a single batch. The problem is NP-hard and cannot be approximated within 1.0021 of the optimum under the premise, P not equal NP. However, the problem admits a 3/2-approximation. The idea is to decompose the demands of items so that a maximum matching in the graph on the vertices of the decomposed demands provides a well-consolidated batch set.
