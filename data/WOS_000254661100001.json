The encryptioner will not need to obtain the decryptioner's certificate. That will simplify the certificate managernent. Therefore, it is still interesting to propose some new identity-based encryption schemes. In this paper, we will propose two new different constructions, i.e. receiptor-oriented encryption schemes. They are both identity-based encryption schemes and also based on pairings. The proposed encryption schemes have a new advantage, i.e. backward-and-forward security. In addition, we provide the security analysis for the proposed schemes.", "paper_title": "Pairing-based public-key encryption schemes with backward-and-forward security", "paper_id": "WOS:000254661100001"}
