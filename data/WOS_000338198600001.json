The paper surveys algorithms to implement such sampling efficiently, with particular focus on the case of constrained devices with small on-board storage and without access to large numbers of external random bits. We review lattice encryption schemes and signature schemes and their requirements for sampling from discrete Gaussians. Finally, we make some remarks on challenges and potential solutions for practical lattice-based cryptography.", "paper_title": "Sampling from discrete Gaussians for lattice-based cryptography on a constrained device", "paper_id": "WOS:000338198600001"}
