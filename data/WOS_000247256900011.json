Our problem class includes linear ordinary differential equations with a time-dependent inhomogeneity. We show that the order of a positive exponential Runge-Kutta method cannot exceed two. On the other hand there exist second-order methods that preserve positivity for linear problems. We give some examples for the latter.", "paper_title": "Positivity of exponential Runge-Kutta methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000247256900011"}
