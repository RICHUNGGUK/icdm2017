The novel optimization algorithm is also employed to deal with several nonlinear benchmark functions as well as a practical engineering design problem. Simulation results demonstrate the remarkable advantages of our approach in achieving the diverse optimal solutions and improved convergence speed.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Artificial Immune Optimization Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000272257300006"}
