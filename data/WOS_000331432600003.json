Anomaly detection is essential for improving the reliability of Web applications. Current approaches model correlations among metrics, and detect anomalies when the correlations are broken. However, dynamic workloads cause the metric correlations to change overtime. Moreover, modeling various metric correlations are difficult in complex Web applications. This paper addresses these problems and proposes an online anomaly detection approach for Web applications. We present an incremental clustering algorithm for training workload patterns online, and employ the local outlier factor (LOF) in the recognized workload pattern to detect anomalies. In addition, we locate the anomalous metrics with the Student's t-test method. We evaluated our approach on a testbed running the TPC-W industry-standard benchmark. The experimental results show that our approach is able to (1) capture workload fluctuations accurately, (2) detect typical faults effectively and (3) has advantages over two contemporary ones in accuracy.
