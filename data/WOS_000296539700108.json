Accordingly, it is extended by introducing Mercer's kernels in order to solve the problem of nonlinear decision boundaries, which presents a significant matrix pattern based nonlinear support vector machines: Ker-MCSVMmatrix. The above-mentioned approaches not only keep the merits of MCSVM, but, owing to introducing matrix pattern based within-class scatter matrix into support vector machines, theoretically better solve the singular problem of within-class scatter matrix when small sample size problems are dealt with, reduce the time/place complexity when within-class scatter matrix, its invertible matrix and weight vector omega are calculated. Hence, the classification accuracy is improved to certain extent. Experimental results indicate the above advantages of the proposed methods: both MCSVMmatrix and Ker-MCSVMmatrix.
