In order to improve the tracking performance, we introduce a P-type high-order iterative learning algorithm that makes use of information from several previous iterations. An initial state learning scheme is proposed to eliminate the effect of the initialization error on the final tracking error. Furthermore, we establish a sufficient condition to ensure asymptotic convergence. A simulation example is also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed result.", "paper_title": "High-Order ILC with Initial State Learning for Discrete-Time Delayed Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299313200004"}
