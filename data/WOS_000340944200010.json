Previous works have showed that the end-to-end delay scales linearly with the source-to-destination distance, and thus the delay performance can be characterized by the delay-distance ratio gamma. However, the range of gamma, which may be the most important parameter for delay, remains unknown. We expect that gamma may depend heavily on the node density lambda of a wireless multihop network. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental relationship between gamma and lambda. Obtaining the exact value gamma(lambda) of is extremely hard, mainly because of the dynamically changing network topologies caused by the link unreliability. Instead, we provide both upper bound and lower bound to the delay-distance ratio gamma(lambda). Simulations are conducted to verify our theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Node Density and Delay in Large-Scale Wireless Networks With Unreliable Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000340944200010"}
