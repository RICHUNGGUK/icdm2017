This paper proposes methods to hide information into images that achieve robustness against printing and scanning with blind decoding. The selective embedding in low frequencies scheme hides information in the magnitude of selected low-frequency discrete Fourier transform coefficients. The differential quantization index modulation scheme embeds information in the phase spectrum of images by quantizing the difference in phase of adjacent frequency locations. A significant contribution of this paper is analytical and experimental modeling of the print-scan process, which forms the basis of the proposed embedding schemes. A novel approach for estimating the rotation undergone by the image during the scanning process is also proposed, which specifically exploits the knowledge of the digital halftoning scheme employed by the printer. Using the proposed methods, several hundred information bits can be embedded into images with perfect recovery against the print-scan operation. Moreover, the hidden images also survive several other attacks, such as Gaussian or median filtering, scaling or aspect ratio change, heavy JPEG compression, and rows and/or columns removal.", "paper_title": "'Print and scan' resilient data hiding in images", "paper_id": "WOS:000246145600005"}
