The method exploits the high efficiency of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for medium-sized problems and has the additional advantage of being relatively simple to implement. It is also applicable to both autonomous and non-autonomous systems. As an example of its use, it is employed to find periodic orbits in the Rossler system, a coupled Rossler system, as well as an eight-dimensional model of a flexible rotor-bearing; problems which have been treated previously via two related methods. The results agree with the previous methods and are seen to be more accurate in some cases. A simple implementation of the method, written in the Python programming language, is provided as an Appendix.", "paper_title": "Optimized shooting method for finding periodic orbits of nonlinear dynamical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000360859000007"}
