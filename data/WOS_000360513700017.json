However, fitting the Fourier harmonics to a comprehensive database of individual bouncing force records established in this study showed that such a radical simplification of the reality leads to a significant loss of key information. Hence, this study brings the Fourier model to a higher level, where the fitted harmonics are personalised, randomised and the natural variability taken into account, leading to a stochastic generator of near-periodic bouncing force time histories which can simulate reliably the actual measurements.
