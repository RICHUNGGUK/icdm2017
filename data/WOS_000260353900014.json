The inner region of the turbulent boundary layer is not included in the modeling of this attached, wall-bounded flow. Appropriate boundary conditions and closure are derived using a combination of elements from asymptotic expansions, matching, and well-established wall-modeling approaches. The modeling approach for this application combines the stretched-vortex subgrid model with a localized wall-shear-stress treatment that relates the instantaneous wall-parallel velocity to the shear stress via the log-law, as appropriate for this (near-) zero pressure gradient flow. The impermeability boundary condition is built into the method such that only the outer-flow solution is simulated, obviating the need to impose the stiff no-slip condition at the wall. This formulation attempts to minimize numerical and modeling errors introduced by the boundary-condition treatment, while preserving the fundamental elements required to predict low-order statistics of these flows. We present simulation results for turbulent channel flow up to Reynolds number based oil the wall-friction velocity of 10(6). These compare favorably with results from large-scale DNS and experimental correlations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
