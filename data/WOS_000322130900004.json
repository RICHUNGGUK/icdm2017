The same test may be used when implementing floating-point operations with input and output operands of different formats, using arithmetic operators tailored for manipulating operands of the same format. That test depends on a \"magic constant\" e. We show how to choose that constant e to make the test reliable and efficient. Various cases are considered, depending on the availability of an fma instruction, and on the range of f(x).", "paper_title": "On Ziv's Rounding Test", "paper_id": "WOS:000322130900004"}
