In order to ease and bring more convenience for cooperative driving tests, we introduce an intelligent vehicle simulation platform, called CyberTORCS, for the research in cooperative driving. Details of the simulator modules including vehicle body control, vehicle visualization modeling and track visualization modeling are presented. Two simulation examples are given to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed simulation platform.", "paper_title": "CyberTORCS: An Intelligent Vehicles Simulation Platform for Cooperative Driving", "paper_id": "WOS:000291215500013"}
