That is, we investigate the links between the class VPSPACE of families of polynomials and the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation over C. Roughly speaking, a family of polynomials is in VPSPACE if its coefficients can be computed in polynomial space. Our main result is that if (uniform, constant-free) VPSPACE families can be evaluated efficiently, then the class PAR(C) of decision problems that can be solved in parallel polynomial time over the complex field collapses to P-C. As a result. one must first be able to show that there are VPSPACE families which are hard to evaluate in order to separate P-C from NPC, or even from PAR(C). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
