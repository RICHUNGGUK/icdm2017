Three dimensional particles axe considered to be observed via their two dimensional profiles and the problem is to predict the extremal shape factor in a given size class. We proof the stability of the domain of attraction of the spheroid's and its profile shape factor under a tail equivalence condition. We show namely that the Faxlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern bivariate distributions gives the tail uniformity. We provide a way how to find normalising constants for the shape factor extremes. The theory is illustrated on examples of distributions belonging to Gumbel and Frechet domain of attraction. We discuss the ML estimator based on the largest observations and hence the possible statistical applications at the end.", "paper_title": "Extremes of spheroid shape factor based on two dimensional profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000237779100004"}
