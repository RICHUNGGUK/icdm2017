The control strategy realizes automatic regulation of direct current (DC) bus voltage in the system, so it stabilizes the DC bus voltage of the system. The experimental results show that the controller has better self-learning and robustness, and realizes the satisfactory operation of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "A new control strategy of a wind power generation and flywheel energy storage combined system", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000198"}
