We have proposed a feedback method that is based on a checklist and video demonstrations. To help trainees efficiently check their performance and correct errors, the checklist was prepared with items specific to the performance of tasks related to individual body parts (e.g., the height of the waist). In this system, two Kinect RGB-D sensors were used for measuring the posture of the trainees and patients. An automatic skill evaluation method was used to designate the trainees' performance against each evaluation item as correct or incorrect. Furthermore, the system's operation interface was designed to enable self-operation by trainees. Control tests were performed to measure the training effectiveness of the system. The results of the tests on a control group (n = 5) that used only a textbook and demonstration video but did not receive feedback were compared with those of the experimental group (n = 5) that used the proposed system. The results of both subjective and objective evaluation demonstrated that the experimental group showed greater improvement in performing patient transfer than the control group (p < 0.05).", "paper_title": "Self-Help Training System for Nursing Students to Learn Patient Transfer Skills", "paper_id": "WOS:000348905200003"}
