We show how the idea of approximate computations on granulated data has evolved toward complete product supporting standard analytic database operations and their extensions. We refer to our previous works where our query execution algorithms were described in terms of iteratively computed rough approximations. We explain how to interpret our data organization methods in terms of classical rough set notions such as reducts and generalized decisions.", "paper_title": "Two Database Related Interpretations of Rough Approximations: Data Organization and Query Execution", "paper_id": "WOS:000325745600032"}
