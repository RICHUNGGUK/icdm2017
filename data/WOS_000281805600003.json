Wavelet packet is firstly applied to extract of distinctive feature of current signals. Then this information is introduced to training ANN for identifying an HIF from the normal system operation events. The simulated results clearly show that the proposed technique can accurately identify the HIF in overhead distribution feeder.", "paper_title": "A New Protection Scheme for High Impedance Fault Detection using Wavelet Packet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000281805600003"}
