Building on the theory of finite-time Lyapunov stability, we propose sufficient criteria which guarantee the system to reach a consensus in finite time, provided that the underlying directed network contains a spanning tree. Novel finite-time consensus protocols are introduced as examples for applying the criteria. Simulations are also presented to illustrate our theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Finite-time consensus for multi-agent systems with fixed topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000297251500008"}
