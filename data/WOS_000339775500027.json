The results obtained are compared with those of a steady-state model previously reported by the authors. The pollutant concentrations are examined on the roof where the stack is located as well as on the leeward wall of an upstream tower to the emitting building in order to evaluate how the pollutant is dispersed by the DES model compared to RNG model. DES results are discussed against those from RNG k-epsilon approach and wind tunnel. The study emphasises limits in reproducing correctly the wind flow and dispersion fields due to underestimation and/or overestimation of the Reynolds stress components and the steady-state methodology when using the RNG k-epsilon model. Despite such limits, the RNG model produces a similar average error, in terms of concentrations, to that obtained with the DES model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
