Without requiring the specific mathematical model of a plant, the parameters of stabilising controller are calculated directly from data for a linear time-invariant system. In fact, using the traditional unity feedback control, the existing results which focus on calculating stabilising PID or first-order controllers have been reported in the literature. However, there exists certain steady-state error in these approaches if the integrators are not added into the controller. In this paper, a 2-DOF controller is designed to ensure no changes in characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop systems, furthermore, in terms of a pre-specified criterion function, by applying the iterative feedback tuning technique, a local optimal performance is achieved. Especially, for the step input, through tuning the parameters of controller, the steady-state error can be reduced to zero. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of this method.", "paper_title": "Data-driven criteria synthesis of system with two-degree-of-freedom controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000340192900005"}
