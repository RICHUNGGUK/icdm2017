In this paper, a new class of image morphing algorithms is proposed based on the theory of optimal mass transport. The L-2 mass moving energy functional is modified by adding an intensity penalizing term, in order to reduce the undesired double exposure effect. It is an intensity-based approach and, thus, is parameter free. The optimal warping function is computed using an iterative gradient descent approach. This proposed morphing method is also extended to doubly connected domains using a harmonic parameterization technique, along with finite-element methods.", "paper_title": "An image morphing technique based on optimal mass preserving mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000246641600001"}
