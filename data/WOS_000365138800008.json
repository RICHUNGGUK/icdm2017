Trust is a level of subjective probability between two entities, a trustor (i.e. source entity) and a trustee (i.e. target entity), which is formed through the direct observation nature and/or recommendation from trusted entities. Trust relationship is the most complex relationship between trustor and trustee because it is extremely subjective, non-symmetric, partial transitive, dynamic, context-dependant, uncertainty, and difficult to be evaluation and establish. Today, there is no special trust evaluation model for cloud computing environment. Hence, in this paper, we present a trust model based on fuzzy mathematics named TMFM in cloud computing environment according to success and failure interaction between cloud entities so that the fuzzy direct trust relation is calculated based on direct experiences between trustor and trustee also, trustor can builds a fuzzy Indirect trust relation with trustee through his acquaintances. Simulation results show that the TMFM model has some identification and containment capability in synergies cheating, promotes interaction between entities, and improves the performance of the entire cloud environment.", "paper_title": "A trust model between cloud entities using fuzzy mathematics", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800008"}
