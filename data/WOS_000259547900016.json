In spite of these efforts, the formulation has been reduced to tracking planar targets or targets rotating inside a plane parallel to the image plane. The aim of this paper is to extend the multi-kernel tracking to cope with situations different to those. To this end, we consider the triangular mesh described by the centers of the kernels and we develop the estimation of a set of affine transforms, one at each mesh triangle, subject to the constraints that each affine transform of a triangle must be compatible with the affine transforms coming from contiguous triangles. The method is applied to sequences including face and car tracking. Results show an outperformance respect to previous kernel tracking methods, which generally work with a too restricted set of movements. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
