It compares both modal responses without ignoring mode shapes, and these results are reasonably in agreement with the literature. Increasing displacement contour loops within the brain in higher frequency modes probably exhibits the shearing and twisting modes of the brain. Additional and rarely reported modal responses such as 'mastication' mode of the mandible and flipping mode of nasal lateral cartilages are identified. This suggests a need for detailed modelling to identify all the additional frequencies of each individual part. Moreover, it is found that a damping factor of above 0.2 has amplifying effect in reducing higher frequency modes, while a diminishing effect in lowering peak biomechanical responses, indicating the importance of identifying the appropriate optimised damping factor.", "paper_title": "Conventional and complex modal analyses of a finite element model of human head and neck", "paper_id": "WOS:000346069000005"}
