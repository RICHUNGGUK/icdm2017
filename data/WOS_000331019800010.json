Specifically, this study examines the interdependence among the proposed aspects and criteria used to assess GSCM in two hierarchical structures and compares these results to those of a real situation. Additionally, the aspects and criteria involve qualitative preferences in GSCM evaluation. Hence, this study proposes to use both hybrid fuzzy set theory and ANP methods. Examining two types of hierarchical structure provides the ability to examine study problems that have similar aspects and criteria with respect to situations that occur in GSCM. This study argues that while many of the commonly employed close-loop and open hierarchical structures display numerous worthwhile operational processes, further refinement of the criteria and methods are needed to improve the field. The results indicate that the close-loop hierarchical structure more closely resembles existing applications. The managerial implications of this result are discussed, and concluding remarks are provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
