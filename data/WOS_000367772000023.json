Theoretical research shows that when the electrode on the piezoelectric patch bonded on a vibrating structure is separated into several pieces, voltage response (including amplitude and phase) of each piece is different from each other. If each electrode is appropriately connected to the shunted circuit by certain design, the electromechanical coupling factor of the whole system can be increased effectively. In addition, the 'current flowing circuit' is introduced in the system to realize the multimodal vibration control. Experimental investigation has been carried out to validate the principle.
