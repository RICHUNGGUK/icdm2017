We propose a novel method for 3D shape recovery of faces that exploits the similarity of faces. Our method obtains as input a single image and uses a mere single 3D reference model of a different person's face. Classical reconstruction methods from single images, i.e., shape-from-shading, require knowledge of the reflectance properties and lighting as well as depth values for boundary conditions. Recent methods circumvent these requirements by representing input faces as combinations (of hundreds) of stored 3D models. We propose instead to use the input image as a guide to \"mold\" a single reference model to reach a reconstruction of the sought 3D shape. Our method assumes Lambertian reflectance and uses harmonic representations of lighting. It has been tested on images taken under controlled viewing conditions as well as on uncontrolled images downloaded from the Internet, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness under a variety of imaging conditions and overcoming significant differences in shape between the input and reference individuals including differences in facial expressions, gender, and race.", "paper_title": "3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image Using a Single Reference Face Shape", "paper_id": "WOS:000285313200014"}
