In this paper, we investigate the induction of fuzzy classification rules for data mining purposes, and propose a hybrid genetic algorithm for learning approximate fuzzy rules. A novel niching method is employed to promote coevolution within the population, which enables the algorithm to discover multiple rules by means of a coevolutionary scheme in a single run. In order to improve the quality of the learned rules. a local search method was devised to perform fine-tuning on the offspring generated by genetic operators in each generation. After the CA terminates, a fuzzy classifier is built by extracting a rule set from the final population. The proposed algorithm was tested on datasets from the UCI repository, and the experimental results verify its validity in learning rule sets and comparative advantage over conventional methods.
