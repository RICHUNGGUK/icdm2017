Ranking from binary comparisons is a ubiquitous problem in modern machine learning applications. In this paper, we consider l(1)-norm SVM for ranking. As well known, learning with l(1)-norm restrictions usually leads to sparsity. Moreover, instead of independently draw sample sequence, we are given sample of exponentially strongly mixing sequence. Under some mild conditions, a learning rate is established.", "paper_title": "l(1)-Norm support vector machine for ranking with exponentially strongly mixing sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000342162900002"}
