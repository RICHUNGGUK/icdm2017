Reproducing such features in electronic systems and circuits is of great importance for a variety of applications. We consider memory models inspired by an intriguing ability of slime molds to both memorize the period of temperature and humidity variations and anticipate the next variations to come, when appropriately trained. Effective circuit models of such behavior are designed using: 1) a set of LC contours with memristive damping and 2) a single memcapacitive system-based adaptive contour with memristive damping. We consider these two approaches in detail by comparing their results and predictions. Finally, possible biological experiments that would discriminate between the models are discussed. In this paper, we also introduce an effective description of certain memory circuit elements.", "paper_title": "Memory Models of Adaptive Behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000325980900008"}
