In such networks, the probability of frame drop (P-drop) is greater than zero due to successive collisions with a finite retry limit m. The IEEE 802.11 DCF is one such widely accepted protocol used in wireless local area networks (WLANs). The objective of the work reported in this paper is to provide guaranteed channel access to colliding frames for avoiding successive collisions for any loss-sensitive application, and thus, increase network throughput under finite m. We propose the semi-distributed backoff (SDB) algorithm, which operates in two modes: S-mode and R-mode. The key idea of the SDB scheme is to perform receiver-side backoff, if a mobile station encounters collision even after performing the existing sender-side backoff procedures. Using the SDB scheme, we design Semi-DCF, a MAC protocol for WLANs, which performs opportunistic migration from random to deterministic backoff. Semi-DCF functions independent of m. This protocol exploits the collision detection capability of receivers for disseminating information on optimal backoffs to the contenders using signature vectors. An analysis of Semi-DCF using the 2D Markov chain, coupled with results of network simulation establishes its superior performance in WLANs.", "paper_title": "Semi-Distributed Backoff: Collision-Aware Migration from Random to Deterministic Backoff", "paper_id": "WOS:000352569700015"}
