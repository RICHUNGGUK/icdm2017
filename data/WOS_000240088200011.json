However, like frequent pattern mining, when the minimum association threshold is set to be low, it still generates a large number of mutually associated patterns. The huge number of patterns produced not only reduces the mining efficiency, but also makes it very difficult for a human user to analyze in order to identify interesting/useful ones. In this paper, a new task of maximal frequent mutually associated pattern mining is proposed, which can dramatically decrease the number of patterns produced without information loss due to the downward closure property of the association measure and meanwhile improve the mining efficiency. Experimental results show that maximal frequent mutually associated pattern mining is quite a necessary approach to lessening the number of results and increasing the performance of the algorithm. Also, experimental results show that the techniques developed are much effective especially for very large and dense datasets.", "paper_title": "Efficiently mining maximal frequent mutually associated patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200011"}
