This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional 14 external penalization\" techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision free area for each polygon before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied, the placement and the sequence of placement of the polygons. For each non placed polygon, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the polygon, would allow it to be fitted in the container. It is proposed a crystallization heuristic, in order to increase the number of accepted solutions. The bottom left and larger first deterministic heuristics were also studied. The proposed process is suited for non convex polygons and containers, the containers can have holes inside. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
