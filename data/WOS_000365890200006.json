In this paper, we address the question of how to discriminate between each type of writing on registration forms. Registration-form documents consist of various type zones, such as printed text, handwriting, table, image, noise, etc., so segmenting the various zones is a challenge. We adopt herein an approach called \"multiscale-region projection\" to identify printed text and handwriting. An important aspect of our approach is the use of multiscale techniques to segment document images. A new set of projection features extracted from each zone is also proposed. The classification rules are mining and are used to discern printed text and table lines from handwritten text. The proposed system was tested on 11 118 samples in two registration-form-image databases. Some possible measures of efficiency are computed, and in each case the proposed approach performs better than traditional methods.", "paper_title": "Multiscale Region Projection Method to Discriminate Between Printed and Handwritten Text on Registration Forms", "paper_id": "WOS:000365890200006"}
