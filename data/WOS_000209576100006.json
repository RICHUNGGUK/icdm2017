Many commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensor nodes can be specialized to meet these requirements using tunable parameters (e.g., processor voltage and frequency) to specialize the operating state. Since a sensor node's performance depends greatly on environmental stimuli, dynamic optimizations enable sensor nodes to automatically determine their operating state in situ. However, dynamic optimization methodology development given a large design space and resource constraints (memory and computational) is an extremely challenging task. In this paper, we propose a lightweight dynamic optimization methodology that intelligently selects initial tunable parameter values to produce a high-quality initial operating state in one-shot for time-critical or highly constrained applications. Further operating state improvements are made using an efficient greedy exploration algorithm, achieving optimal or near-optimal operating states while exploring only 0.04% of the design space on average. We also propose an application metrics estimation model, which is leveraged by our dynamic optimization methodology, to estimate high-level application metrics (e.g., lifetime, throughput) from sensor node tunable parameters and hardware specific internals.
