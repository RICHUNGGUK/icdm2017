Consider the following two operations: given a line with a specified point on the line we can construct a new line through the point which forms an angle with the new line which is a multiple of pi/n (folding); and given two lines we can construct the point where they cross (intersection). Starting with the line y = 0 and the points (0, 0) and (1, 0) we determine which points in the plane can be constructed using only these two operations for n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and also consider the problem of the minimum number of steps it takes to construct such a point.", "paper_title": "CONSTRUCTING POINTS THROUGH FOLDING AND INTERSECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000324479200003"}
