In this case, the approximation algorithms are given k (k >= 0) extra processors than the optimal off-line algorithm. For on-line algorithms, the Greedy algorithm and shelf algorithms are studied. For off-line algorithm, we consider the LPT (longest processing time) algorithm. Particularly, we prove that the schedule produced by the LPT algorithm is no longer than the optimal off-line algorithm if and only if k >= m - 2.", "paper_title": "WORST-CASE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION ON MULTIPROCESSOR TASK SCHEDULING WITH RESOURCE AUGMENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000291552600012"}
