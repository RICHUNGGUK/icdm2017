This bottleneck significantly impedes our ability to establish new (bio) analytical methods in fields such as pharmacology, metabolomics and pesticide research. We report the development of a multi-platform, user-friendly software tool MUSCLE (multi-platform unbiased optimization of spectrometry via closed-loop experimentation) for the robust and fully automated multi-objective optimization of targeted LC-MS/MS analysis. MUSCLE shortened the analysis times and increased the analytical sensitivities of targeted metabolite analysis, which was demonstrated on two different manufacturer's LC-MS/MS instruments.", "paper_title": "MUSCLE: automated multi-objective evolutionary optimization of targeted LC-MS/MS analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000352268900027"}
