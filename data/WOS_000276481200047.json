In this contribution we test the performance of several ensembles of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, in which each component learner has been trained on different types of bio-molecular data, and then combined to obtain a consensus prediction using different aggregation techniques. Experimental results using data obtained with different high-throughput biotechnologies show that simple ensemble methods outperform both learning machines trained on single homogeneous types of bio-molecular data, and vector space integration methods.
