Based on the assumption that each vertex is adjacent to at least one fault-free vertex, the conditional (t, k)-diagnosis of graphs was investigated by using the comparison diagnosis model. Lower bounds on the conditional (t, k)-diagnosability of graphs were derived, and applied to obtain the following results. 1) Symmetric d-dimensional grids are conditionally (N/2d+1 - 1, 2d - 1)-diagnosable when d >= 2 and N (the number of vertices) >= 4(d). 2) Symmetric d-dimensional tori are conditionally (1/5(N + min{8/5 N-2/3, 2N - 20/15} + 2); 6)-diagnosable when d = 2 and N >= 49 and (N/2d+1 - 1, 4d - 2)-diagnosable when d >= 3 and N >= 4(d). 3) Cube-connected cycles are conditionally (N/4 - 1, 4)-diagnosable. 4) k-ary trees are conditionally (N/k+1 - 1, 1)-diagnosable.", "paper_title": "Conditional (t, k)-Diagnosis in Graphs by Using the Comparison Diagnosis Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000354414500009"}
