In this paper, it is shown that each 1-planar graph of minimum degree 6 contains a copy of 4-cycle with all vertices of degree at most 19. In addition, we also show that the complete graph K 4 is light in the family of 1-planar graphs of minimum degree 7, with its height at most 11.", "paper_title": "New Upper Bounds for the Heights of Some Light Subgraphs in 1-Planar Graphs with High Minimum Degree", "paper_id": "WOS:000297927800002"}
