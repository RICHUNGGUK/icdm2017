Under mild technical assumptions on the function H0(u)=ln(F0(u)), we show that the limit shape *(x) exists and is given by the equation y=-1H0(e-x), where 2=<mml:mstyle displaystyle=\"true\">01</mml:msubsup>u-1</mml:mstyle><mml:msub>H0(u)du. The wide class of partition measures covered by this result includes (but is not limited to) representatives of the three meta-types of decomposable combinatorial structures assemblies, multisets, and selections. Our method is based on the usual randomization and conditioning; to this end, a suitable local limit theorem is proved. The proofs are greatly facilitated by working with the cumulants of sums of the part counts rather than with their moments.Copyright (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
