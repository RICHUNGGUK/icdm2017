In this philosophy, users of cloud storage services no longer physically maintain direct control over their data, which makes data security one of the major concerns of using cloud. Existing research work already allows data integrity to be verified without possession of the actual data file. When the verification is done by a trusted third party, this verification process is also called data auditing, and this third party is called an auditor. However, such schemes in existence suffer from several common drawbacks. First, a necessary authorization/authentication process is missing between the auditor and cloud service provider, i.e., anyone can challenge the cloud service provider for a proof of integrity of certain file, which potentially puts the quality of the so-called 'auditing-as-a-service' at risk; Second, although some of the recent work based on BLS signature can already support fully dynamic data updates over fixed-size data blocks, they only support updates with fixed-sized blocks as basic unit, which we call coarse-grained updates. As a result, every small update will cause re-computation and updating of the authenticator for an entire file block, which in turn causes higher storage and communication overheads. In this paper, we provide a formal analysis for possible types of fine-grained data updates and propose a scheme that can fully support authorized auditing and fine-grained update requests. Based on our scheme, we also propose an enhancement that can dramatically reduce communication overheads for verifying small updates. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can offer not only enhanced security and flexibility, but also significantly lower overhead for big data applications with a large number of frequent small updates, such as applications in social media and business transactions.", "paper_title": "Authorized Public Auditing of Dynamic Big Data Storage on Cloud with Efficient Verifiable Fine-Grained Updates", "paper_id": "WOS:000342179000003"}
