The state transition model represents the video decoding process by a notion-compensated prediction. Furthermore, the new observation model that represents all image blurring process is defined. and calculation of the Kalman gain becomes possible. The problem of the traditional methods is solved by using the Kalman filter in the proposed method, and accurate reconstruction of corrupted video frames, is achieved. Consequently. an effective error concealment method using the Kalman filter is realized. Experimental results showed that the proposed method has better performance than that of traditional methods.", "paper_title": "Kalman Filter-Based Error Concealment for Video Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000265630900011"}
