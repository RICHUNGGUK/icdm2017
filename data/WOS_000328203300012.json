In this paper we present a structured peer-to-peer (P2P) network designed for the distribution of live-content, with low bandwidth consumption, within a VANET. This P2P network is modelled using a media distribution graph. The implementation of a structured network allows a peer to schedule consecutive data chunks produced by the media source by means of a scheduling algorithm. In our analysis we obtain a bound for the maximum delay between the media source and any of the peers of the network and the buffer size needed to allow consecutive scheduling. We study a type of media distribution graph and we calculate its order and diameter, which means that under stable conditions we can ensure certain quality-of-service parameters. The results of simulation over NS2 show the fitness of the mathematical analysis.", "paper_title": "Structured Peer-to-Peer Real Time Video Transmission over Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328203300012"}
