Based on this method, this paper proposes a fast nonlinear multigrid (NMG) method for solving the underlying Euler-Lagrange system of two coupled second-order nonlinear partial differential equations. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and realistic images not only confirm that the recommended VTV-based regularization yields better registration qualities for a wide range of applications than those of the SVTV-based regularization, but also that the proposed NMG method is fast, accurate, and reliable in delivering visually-pleasing registration results.", "paper_title": "Vectorial Total Variation-Based Regularization for Variational Image Registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000324597800031"}
