It achieves the following merits, which are rare in the literature. First, it reduces network deployment costs by only equipping an integrated SIP mobile server. Second, it supports both SIP-based and non-SIP-based applications. Third. by adopting the analytical model proposed in Mohanty and Akyildiz (2007) [19], mathematical analyses are provided to investigate six performance metrics of SIP + HCoP-B and the other four well-known SIP's over NEMO schemes over the error-prone wireless link. Finally, it is shown that SIP + HCoP-B outperforms these four traditional schemes through intensive simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
