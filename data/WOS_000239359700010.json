Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU) imaging has been used to assess tissue perfusion in models of ischemia-related angiogenesis, growth-factor mediated angiogenesis, and tumor angiogenesis. In these studies, microvascular flow is measured in order to assess the total impact of adaptations at different vascular levels. High-resolution methods for imaging larger vessels have been developed in order to derive \"angiograms\" of arteries, veins, and medium to large microvessels. We describe a novel method of vascular bed (microvessel and arterial) characterization of vessel anatomy and flow simultaneously, using serial measurement of the fractal dimension (FD) of a temporal sequence of CEU images. This method is proposed as an experimental methodology to distinguish ischemic from nonischemic tissue. Moreover, an improved approach for extracting the FD unique to this application is introduced.", "paper_title": "Anatomy and flow in normal and ischemic microvasculature based on a novel temporal fractal dimension analysis algorithm using contrast enhanced ultrasound", "paper_id": "WOS:000239359700010"}
