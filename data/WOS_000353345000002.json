The coupling matrix is generated by frequency transformation technique applied to advance filtering functions for direct-coupled asymmetric dual-band bandstop filter in cul-de-sac configuration. The proposed approach provides control of all the major parameters such as center frequencies, intercavity couplings, and input/output couplings of filter independently in both the designated bands. The dual-band DR filters (2 x 2) pole, with return loss=15 dB and percentage rejection bandwidth of 1.6 and 0.6% in two bands, at 9.96 and 10.15 GHz, respectively, are designed, built, and tested. The measured and simulated results are in good agreement over the desired band. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
