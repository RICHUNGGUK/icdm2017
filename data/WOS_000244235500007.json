Using only simple instrumentation with four concrete embedded sensors, a complete WIM system with axle detection, weighing, track detection and attempted identification of locomotives was implemented on a bridge with multiple railway tracks. The results and the effectiveness of this type of sensor setup is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
