We show that for every such channel: 1) There is an appropriately-defined notion of approximation of space-time codes such that each code is arbitrarily well approximated by one whose alphabet lies in the field of algebraic numbers; 11) Each space-time code whose alphabet lies in the field of algebraic numbers is an appropriately-defined lift from a corresponding space-time code defined over a finite field or a \"scaled\" lift from a Galois ring of arbitrary characteristic. This implies that all space-time codes can be designed over finite fields or over Galois rings of arbitrary characteristic and then lifted to complex matrices with entries in a number field.", "paper_title": "The equivalence of space-time codes and codes defined over finite fields and Galois rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000256120100002"}
