This interaction involves coordination of sigma bonds of the 112 with the transition metal, and it is comparatively strong, allowing promising hydrogen storage applications. In this work, the impact of structural geometry on this coordination is investigated using a model titan carbide structure (TiC4H4) by performing density functional theory calculations.", "paper_title": "Impact of geometry on the hydrogen storage properties of titanium carbide: a dft study on the model tic(4)h(4)", "paper_id": "WOS:000254193800009"}
