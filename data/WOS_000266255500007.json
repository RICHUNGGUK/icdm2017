Electromechanical filters have reappeared with the new manufacturing capabilities of micro-electro-mechanical structures (MEMS). In such small dimensions it proves essential to treat their elastic behaviour as continuous rather than discrete systems that require suitable design methods, some of which are developed here. In MEMS filters, the input signal is converted to external electrostatic forces and in order to perform the desired filtering, the electrodes need to be shaped such that they excite only a desired part of the dynamics. An optimization scheme that shapes these electrodes to achieve optimal filtering is developed. In order to enhance the filter's performance and minimize energy lost to the supporting structure, a special support tuning method is proposed. Several simulated examples examine the effectiveness of the proposed optimization methods.", "paper_title": "Optimal electrode shaping for precise modal electromechanical filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000266255500007"}
