When ontological representation is needed, hyperonymy, the closest approximation to the is-a relation, is at stake. In this paper we describe the principles of our vector model (conceptual vector model) and show how to account for hyperonymy within the vector-based frame for semantics. We show how hyperonymy diverges from is-a and what measures are more accurate for hyperonymy representation. Our demonstration results in initiating a cooperation process between semantic networks and conceptual vectors. Text automatic rewriting or enhancing, ontology mapping with natural language expressions, are examples of applications that can be derived from the functions we define in this paper.", "paper_title": "Mixing semantic networks and conceptual vectors application to hyperonymy", "paper_id": "WOS:000237197600005"}
