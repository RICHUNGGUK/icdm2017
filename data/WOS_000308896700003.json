In this case, these constraints are the possibility to implant the VAD system, providing a sufficient perfusion of the human body and cutting down development costs. Design/methodology/approach - In the described approach an optimization algorithm is integrated in the initial stage of the design process for a drive system. Findings - During simulations the optimum drive design under the implantation constraints of the given VAD system is found. The key constraints of this design, which are torque, axial force and losses, are validated during initial test bench measurements of a drive prototype. Practical implications - The described design process enables an optimum drive design from the beginning of a VAD development. This reduces the time to initial and chronic in vivo test, which are required to be approved for the market later. Therefore, this approach cuts development and device costs. Additionally, this design process can be transferred for the design of other drive concepts and applications. Originality/value - The developed and proved method in this paper enables a competitive and reliable drive design.", "paper_title": "Algorithm-based, drive design for a ventricular assist device", "paper_id": "WOS:000308896700003"}
