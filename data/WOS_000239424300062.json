Computer and videogames differ from other web and productivity software in that games are much more highly interactive and immersive experiences. Whereas usability and user modelling for other software may be based on productivity alone, games require an additional factor that takes account of the quality of the user experience in playing a game. In order to describe that experience we describe a model of User, System and Experience (USE) in which the primary construct for evaluation of a player's experience will be the Experience Fluctuation Model (EFM), taken from Flow theory. We illustrate with a straightforward example how this system may be automated in real-time within a commercial game.", "paper_title": "User-system-experience model for user centered design in computer games", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300062"}
