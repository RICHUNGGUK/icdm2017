This paper addresses the Neumann exterior problem of Stokes equations using the wavelet natural boundary element method. The Stokes exterior problem is reduced into an equivalent Hadamard-singular Natural Integral Equation (NIE). By virtue of the wavelet-Galerkin algorithm, the simple and accurate computational formulae of stiffness matrix are obtained. The 2(J+3) x 2(J+3) stiffness matrix is sparse and determined only by its 2(J) + 3J + 1 entries. It greatly decreases the computational complexity. Also, the condition number of stiffness matrix is O(N), where N is the discrete node number. This indicates that the proposed algorithm is more stable than that of classical finite element method. The error estimates are established for the wavelet-Galerkin approximate solution. Several numerical examples are given to evaluate the performance of our method with encouraging results.", "paper_title": "Wavelet natural boundary element method for the Neumann exterior problem of Stokes equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000236891300002"}
