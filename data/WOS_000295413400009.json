With an increase of security attacks in the computer networks, these security issues become critical for CBIR systems. In this paper, we propose a novel two-party watermarking protocol that can resolve the issues regarding user rights and privacy. Unlike the previously published protocols, our protocol does not require the existence of a trusted party. It exhibits three useful features: security against partial watermark removal, security in watermark verification and non-repudiation. In addition, we report an empirical research of CBIR with the security mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed protocol is practicable and the retrieval performance will not be affected by watermarking query images.", "paper_title": "Secure Image Retrieval Based on Visual Content and Watermarking Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000295413400009"}
