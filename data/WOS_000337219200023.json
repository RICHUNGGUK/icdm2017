In this paper, we present a single hidden-layer network TIClassRBM for invariant pattern recognition by incorporating linear transformations into discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine. In our model, invariant feature extraction and pattern classification can be implemented simultaneously. The mapping from input features to class label is represented by two groups of weights: transformed weights that connect hidden units to data, and pooling weights that connect pooling units yielded by probabilistic max-pooling to class label. All weights play an important role in the invariant pattern recognition. Moreover, TIClassRBM can handle general transformations contained in images, such as translation, rotation and scaling. The experimental studies on the variations of MNIST and NORB datasets demonstrate that the proposed model yields the best performance among some comparative models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
