In contrast, this paper presents an exact algorithm for the problem based on branch-and-bound. Several techniques are investigated to speed up the algorithm, including bounds based on linear programming, a custom inference engine to make the most out of the inferred information, advanced necessary conditions for partial solutions, and different heuristics to obtain high-quality initial solutions. It is demonstrated with empirical measurements that the resulting algorithm can solve highly complex partitioning problems in reasonable time. Moreover, it is about ten times faster than a previous exact algorithm based on integer linear programming. The presented methods can also be useful in other related optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Finding optimal hardware/software partitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000250580800003"}
