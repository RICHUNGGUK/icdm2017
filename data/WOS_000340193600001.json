A radial basis function neural network is utilised to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions; an updating rule is designed to estimate on-line time-varied fault of actuator; and the controller with the states feedback and faults estimation is applied to compensate for the effects of fault and minimise H-infinity performance criteria in order to get a desired H-infinity disturbance rejection constraint. Sufficient conditions are derived, which guarantees that the closed-loop system is robustly stable and satisfies the H-infinity performance in both normal and fault cases. In order to reduce computing cost, a simplified algorithm of matrix Riccati inequality is given. A spacecraft model is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "H-infinity fault-tolerant control for time-varied actuator fault of nonlinear system", "paper_id": "WOS:000340193600001"}
