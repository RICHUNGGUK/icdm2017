Data communication between each GPU is executed based on the POSIX thread. Compared with the single-GPU implementation, this implementation can provide faster computation speed and more storage space to perform simulations on a significant larger system. In benchmark, the performance of GPUs is compared with that of Material Studio running on a single CPU core. We can achieve more than 90x speedup by using three C2050 GPUs to perform simulations on an 80 * 80 * 80 system. This implementation is applied to the study on the dispersancy of lubricant succinimide dispersants. A series of simulations are performed on lubricant-soot-dispersant systems to study the impact factors including concentration and interaction with lubricant on the dispersancy, and the simulation results are agreed with the study in our present work.
