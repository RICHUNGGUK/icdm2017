The analysis of the genetic material of living organisms which consist of nucleic acids DNA and RNA is of great importance for diagnosis and taxonomy reasons. In the present paper we propose a new methodology for the representation of genetic sequences as fuzzy sets in the I-12 space which can significantly improve the results of Sadegh-Zadeh and Torres & Nieto. An important characteristic of our proposed methodology is that the location of Amino acids along the genetic sequences play an important role thus extending in a significant way the computational efficiency advantage of genetic sequence representation. We present some characteristic examples using the new proposed methodology where we calculate the distance and similarity degree of given polynucleotides.", "paper_title": "An extension of fuzzy topological approach for comparison of genetic sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800051"}
