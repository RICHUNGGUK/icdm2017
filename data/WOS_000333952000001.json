Leibniz designed a cryptographic machine based on an unevenly rotating cylinder with alphabetic strips affixed. It functioned at a level of sophistication not seen again until the 1920s. However, despite repeated efforts, he failed to find a sponsor for its production. Fortunately, his surviving descriptions suffice to enable its recent reconstruction.", "paper_title": "Leibniz's Machina Deciphratoria: A Seventeenth-Century Proto-Enigma", "paper_id": "WOS:000333952000001"}
