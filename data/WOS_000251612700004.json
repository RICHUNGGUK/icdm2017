The widespread use of such systems raises non trivial security concerns. In particular, confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the distributed data must be ensured. To cope with such issues, we describe here a system for securing push distribution of XML documents, which adopts digital signature and encryption techniques to ensure the above mentioned properties and allows the specification of both signature and access control policies. We also describe the implementation of the proposed system and present an extensive performance evaluation of its main components.", "paper_title": "A system for securing push-based distribution of XML documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000251612700004"}
