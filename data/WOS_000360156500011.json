However, these processes execute only part of a complete computing task and the remaining part will involve the loss of energy. This paper discusses the recently introduced approach of programmable directed logic networks for energy efficient logic operations. Along the way, some misleading concepts appearing in many publications related to reversible logic are indicated.", "paper_title": "To what extent is zero energy computing feasible?", "paper_id": "WOS:000360156500011"}
