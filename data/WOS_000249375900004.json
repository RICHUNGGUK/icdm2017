Based on theories and models of text comprehension and web navigation, the plausibility of the proposed model is discussed. The model was used to generate navigation support and this support was offered to users in real time during their navigation sessions, in two experiments. In the first experiment navigation support was offered in the auditory modality and it had a positive effect on user's task performance, especially for users with low spatial abilities. In the second experiment navigation support was offered in the visual modality and users positively evaluated it. Users navigated in a more structured way, judged the system as more usable, and perceived themselves as less disoriented. Support did also here lead to better task performance. Finally, some aspects concerning further enhancement of the validity of the proposed model and its practical relevance are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
