Coupled with peer-to-peer technology, it can serve as a central building block for developing data-dissemination applications deployed over a large-scale network infrastructure. A key open problem in creating large-scale content-based pub-sub infrastructures relates to efficiently and accurately matching subscriptions with substring predicates to incoming events. This work addresses this issue.", "paper_title": "Publish-subscribe information delivery with substring predicates", "paper_id": "WOS:000247796700006"}
