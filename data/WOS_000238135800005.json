A particular choice of the data leads to the class of doubly-cyclic CC's. Within this large class Reed-Solomon and BCH convolutional codes can be defined. After constructing doubly-cyclic CC's, basic properties are derived on the basis of which distance properties of Reed-Solomon convolutional codes are investigated. This shows that some of them are optimal or near optimal with respect to distance and performance.", "paper_title": "On doubly-cyclic convolutional codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000238135800005"}
