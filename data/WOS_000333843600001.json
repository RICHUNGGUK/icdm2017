Although the technology supports monitoring activity patterns, enabling applications to recognize activities user-independently is still a main concern. Achieving this goal is tough for two reasons: firstly, different people exhibit different physical patterns for the same activity due to their different behavior. Secondly, different activities performed by the same person could have different underlying models. Therefore, it is unwise to recognize different activities using the same features. This work presents a solution to this problem. The proposed system uses simple time domain features with a single neural network and a three-stage genetic algorithm-based feature selection method for accurate user-independent activity recognition. System evaluation is carried out for six activities in a user-independent setting using 27 subjects. Recognition performance is also compared with well-known existing methods. Average accuracy of 93% in these experiments shows the feasibility of using our method for subject-independent human activity recognition.", "paper_title": "User-Independent Activity Recognition via Three-Stage GA-Based Feature Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000333843600001"}
