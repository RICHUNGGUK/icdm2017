These estimators, also known as software sensors have been successfully applied in many chemical process systems such as reactors, distillation columns, and heat exchanger due to their robustness, simple formulation, adaptation capabilities and minimum modelling requirements for the design. However, the various types of AI methods available make it difficult to decide on the most suitable algorithm to be applied for any particular system. Hence, in this paper, we provide a broad literature survey of several AI algorithms implemented as estimators in chemical systems together with their advantages, limitations, practical implications and comparisons between one another to guide researchers in selecting and designing the AI-based estimators. Future research suggestions and directions in improvising and extending the usage of these estimators in various chemical operating units are also presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
