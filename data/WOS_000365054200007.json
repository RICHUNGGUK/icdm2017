Determining how to effectively utilize this new media to distribute promotional advertisements to suitable customers is thus an important issue. In this research, an endorser-based social diffusing mechanism, which considers the factors of users' preferences, influence, and diffusion power, is proposed to enhance the effectiveness of target advertising by discovering the most appropriate endorsers that can propagate the ads to the identified target users. Our experimental results show the proposed model can appropriately enhance satisfaction and target delivery rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
