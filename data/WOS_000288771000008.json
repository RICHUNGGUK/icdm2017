Numerous designs have been proposed to address the obvious scalability and efficiency challenges such systems face in Internet-scale deployments. These designs have often been based on implicit assumptions of full deployment and a homogeneous autonomous system structure. Considering incremental deployment in a heterogeneous inter-domain setting, however, reveals both new scalability challenges and deployment and operation related disincentives. In this paper, we propose an inter-domain rendezvous design that combines policy-based name routing between adjacent networks with hierarchical interconnection overlays for scalable global connectivity. This hybrid design enables partial deployment and explicitly addresses the different operational incentives and policies of network service providers and enterprise networks. Extensive domain-level simulations show good performance for our solution in terms of overlay-induced latency, inter-domain path stretch and routing load distribution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
