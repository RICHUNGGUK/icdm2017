In the present study, an analysis is carried Out to predict the academic performance of business school graduates using neural networks and traditional statistical techniques and results are compared to evaluate the performance of these techniques. The underlying constructs in a traditional business school curriculum are also identified and its relevance with the various elements of admission process is presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
