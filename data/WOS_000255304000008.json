We model constraints between robots using a graph where each edge is associated with the interaction between two robots and describes a constraint on relative configurations. We develop a decentralized motion control system that leads each robot to their individual goals while maintaining the constraints specified on the graph. We present experimental results with groups of holonomic and non-holonomic mobile robots. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
