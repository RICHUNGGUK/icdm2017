The Ada MCBoost algorithm is then proposed to classify multiclass SAR targets. In the new algorithm, we introduce a novel large-margin loss function to design a multiclass classifier directly instead of decomposing the multiclass problem into a set of binary ones through the error-correcting output codes (ECOC) method. Finally, experiments show that the new features are helpful for SAR targets discrimination; the new algorithm had better recognition performance than three other contrast methods.", "paper_title": "A Modified AdaBoost Algorithm with New Discrimination Features for High-Resolution SAR Targets Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422400018"}
