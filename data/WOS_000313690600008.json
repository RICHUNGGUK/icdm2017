The proposed method reconstructs the difference between the previous and the current image frames. This difference image is sparse. We recover the sparse difference image from its partial k-space scans by using a nonconvex compressed sensing algorithm. As there was no previous fast enough algorithm for real-time reconstruction, we derive a novel algorithm for this purpose. Our proposed method has been compared against state-of-the-art offline and online reconstruction methods. The accuracy of the proposed method is less than offline methods but noticeably higher than the online techniques. For real-time reconstruction we are also concerned about the reconstruction speed. Our method is capable of reconstructing 128 x 128 images at the rate of 6 frames/s, 180 x 180 images at the rate of 5 frames/s and 256 256 images at the rate of 2.5 frames/s.", "paper_title": "Compressed Sensing Based Real-Time Dynamic MRI Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000313690600008"}
