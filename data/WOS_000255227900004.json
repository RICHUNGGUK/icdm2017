The observational interpretation of specifications and refinements adds expressive power and flexibility, but introduces some subtle problems. Our study of these issues is carried out in the context Of CASL architectural specifications. We introduce a definition of observational equivalence for CASL models, leading to an observational semantics for architectural specifications for which we prove important properties. Overall, this fulfills the long-standing goal of complementing the standard semantics Of CASL specifications with an observational view that supports observational refinement of specifications in combination with CASL-style architectural design.", "paper_title": "Observational interpretation of CASL specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000255227900004"}
