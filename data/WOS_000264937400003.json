The hidden functions of the generalized problem are not restricted to be linear but can also be m-variate polynomial functions of total degree n >= 2. The problem of identifying hidden m-variate polynomials of degree less or equal to n for fixed n and m is hard on a classical computer since Omega(root d) black-box queries are required to guarantee a constant success probability. In contrast, we present a quantum algorithm that correctly identifies such hidden polynomials for all but a, finite number of values of d with constant probability and that has a running time that is only polylogarithmic in d.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT QUANTUM ALGORITHM FOR IDENTIFYING HIDDEN POLYNOMIALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264937400003"}
