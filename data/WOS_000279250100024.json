The method is based on frequency-domain circuit analysis and the technique of vector fitting [14], and obtains the time-domain voltage response at given PIG nodes. The frequency-domain circuit equation including partial reluctances is derived, and then solved with the GMRES algorithm with rescaling, preconditioning and recycling techniques. With the merit of sparsified reluctance matrix and iterative solving techniques for the frequency-domain circuit equations, the proposed method is able to handle large-scale P/G networks with complete inductive modeling. Numerical results show that the proposed method is orders of magnitude faster than HSPICE, several times faster than INDUCTWISE [4], and capable of handling the inductive P/G structures with more than 100,000 wire segments.", "paper_title": "Efficient Power Network Analysis with Modeling of Inductive Effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250100024"}
