This problem encodes various fundamental NP-hardproblems including Maxcut and Max-k-cut. We also consider the multiway uncut problem. We are given a graph G and a set of terminals T subset of V-G. We want to partition V-G into vertical bar T vertical bar parts, each containing exactly one terminal, so as to maximize the number of edges in E-G having both endpoints in the same part. Multiway uncut can be viewed as a special case of prelabeled NIGH where one is also given a prelabeling phi' : U -> V-H, U subset of V-G, and the output has to be an extension of phi'. Both NIGH and multiway uncut have a trivial 0.5-approximation algorithm. We present a 0.8535-approximation algorithm for multiway uncut based on a natural linear programming relaxation. This relaxation has an integrality gap of 6/7 similar or equal to 0.8571, showing that our guarantee is almost tight. For maximum graph homomorphism, we show that a (1/2 + epsilon(0))-approximation algorithm, for any constant epsilon(0) > 0, implies an algorithm for distinguishing between certain average-case instances of the subgraph isomorphism problem that appear to be hard. Complementing this, we give a (1/2 + Omega(1/vertical bar H vertical bar log vertical bar H vertical bar))-approximation algorithm.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithms for graph homomorphism problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240348600016"}
