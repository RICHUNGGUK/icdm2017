The key ideas of BLISCO are to replace compatibility constraint with the sum of coupled outputs as an integrated objective of subsystems and to decompose design variables into system design variables and subsystem design variables, while maintaining the collaborative mechanism of CO. One mathematical example and two engineering problems are used to test the effectiveness of BLISCO under the platform of iSIGHT (TM). Results from the test cases show that BLISCO has satisfactory convergence, accurate result and reliable robustness.", "paper_title": "On the development of Bi-Level Integrated System Collaborative Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000287865000006"}
