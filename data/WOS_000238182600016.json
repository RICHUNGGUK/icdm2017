The scalability of ad hoc networks is becoming an important issue due to the increasing number of applications in a distributed environment, the great number of mobile nodes involved into communication and wide speed range in which the mobile nodes can move. It is important to offer scalability in terms of network size, traffic load and mobility speed. The proposed protocol, called Geo-LANMAR, inherits the same advantage of LANMAR protocol in terms of group motion support and traffic load scalability and it reflects also the behaviour of geo-routing protocols such as GPSR. Geo-LANMAR is based on the idea of Terminodes routing for the forwarding scheme: long-distance geo-forwarding and low-distance table-driven routing. Its updating scheme, instead, is similar to the Hazy Sighted Link State Routing (HSLS) through a spatial and time update rate differentiation: frequent update rate for short distance and lower update rate for long distance. Performance evaluation of Geo-LANMAR has been lead out and a comparison in terms of throughput, average end-to-end delay and control overhead has been conducted against other well-known protocols such as LANMAR, GPSR and AODV. Geo-LANMAR results scalable in terms of traffic load, mobility speed, number of nodes and number of groups. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
