We evaluate the following types of multilayer perceptron. (A) A single multi-output (SMO) perceptron both for discrimination and for quantification. (B) An SMO perceptron for discrimination followed by multiple multi-output (MMO) perceptrons for quantification. (C) An SMO perceptron for discrimination followed by multiple single-output (MSO) perceptions for quantification. (D) MSO perceptrons for discrimination followed by MSO perceptions for quantification, called the MSO-MSO perceptron model, under the following conditions: (D1) using a simple one-against-all (OAA) decomposition method; (D2) adopting a simple OM decomposition method and virtual balance step; and (D3) employing a local OAA decomposition method, virtual balance step and local generalization strategy all together. The experimental results for 12 kinds of volatile organic compounds at 85 concentration levels in the training set and 155 concentration levels in the test set show that the MSO-MSO perceptron model with the D3 learning procedure is the most effective of those tested for discrimination and quantification of many kinds of odors.
