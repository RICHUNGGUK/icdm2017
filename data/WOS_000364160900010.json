Under the framework of stochastic theory and Lyapunov stability method, we develop some techniques of intermittent control with adaptive aperiodicity to achieve the synchronization of a class of neural networks, modeled by stochastic systems. Some effective sufficient conditions are established for the realization of synchronization of the underlying network. Numerical simulations of two examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results obtained in the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
