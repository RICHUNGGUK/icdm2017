Hash values of H are disclosed gradually from x(n-1) to x(0). The correctness of a disclosed hash value x(i) can be verified by checking the equation x(n) =(?) hash(n-i)(x(i)). To speed up the verification, Fischlin introduced a check-bit scheme at CT-RSA 2004. The basic idea of the check-bit scheme is to output some extra information cb, called a check-bit vector, in addition to the public value x(n), which allows each verifier to perform only a fraction of the original work according to his or her own security level. We revisit the Fischlin's check-bit scheme and show that the length of the check-bit vector cb can be reduced nearly by half. The reduced length of cb is close to the theoretic lower bound.", "paper_title": "Fast Verification of Hash Chains with Reduced Storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300043"}
