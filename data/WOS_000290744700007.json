Different from the past work in energy-efficient real-time task scheduling, we explore strategies to maximize the amount of data transmitted by a 3G module under a given battery capacity. In particular, we present algorithms under different workload configurations with and without timing constraint considerations. Experiments were then conducted to verify the validity of the strategies and develop insights in energy-efficient data transmission.", "paper_title": "Data Transmission with the Battery Utilization Maximization", "paper_id": "WOS:000290744700007"}
