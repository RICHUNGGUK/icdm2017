The calculation of Em, can be realized by the one optimization and three single point calculations of the energy for each compound with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups involved in HB. The intramolecular hydrogen bond energies estimated for 153 structures (of 102 compounds) ranged from 1.4 to 13.7 kcal/mol for systems without resonance-assisted hydrogen bonding (RAHB). To verify the method, we show the correlations of the energy (E-HB) in six-, seven-, and eight-membered HB rings in the optimized multifunctional molecules with the usual geometry descriptors of hydrogen bonds. Moreover, topological parameters from the atoms in molecules (AIM) theory and the calculated infrared and proton NMR spectra are correlated. The effects of conjugation and pi-electron delocalization, bifurcation, and cooperativity are discussed, along with the correlation between the strength and geometrical parameters of H bonding.", "paper_title": "Estimation of the Intramolecular O-H center dot center dot center dot O=C Hydrogen Bond Energy via the Molecular Tailoring Approach.
