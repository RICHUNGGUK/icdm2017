In this study. a PSO-based improved Wang-Mendel (WM) method is proposed, which is a new combined modelling method based on fuzzy system and evolutionary algorithm. This method adopts a modified Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the fuzzy rule centroid of data covered area and thus obtains complete fuzzy rule set through extrapolating. The electric load-forecasting model based on this proposed method is described, and a case study on short-term load forecast illustrates that this method effectively enhances the forecast accuracy of WM method, has a fast convergence rate, and is independent of the forecasting objects.
