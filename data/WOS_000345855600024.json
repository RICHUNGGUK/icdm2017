It is defined on a regular spatial grid by local noises, which are sums of cosines with random phase. Our model is versatile thanks to separate sampling in the spatial and spectral domains. Therefore, it encompasses Gabor noise and noise by Fourier series. A stratified spectral sampling allows for a faithful yet compact and efficient reproduction of an arbitrary power spectrum. Noise by example is therefore obtained faster than state-of-the-art techniques. As a second contribution we address texture by example and generate not only Gaussian patterns but also structured features present in the input. This is achieved by fixing the phase on some part of the spectrum. Generated textures are continuous and non-repetitive. Results show unprecedented framerates and a flexible visual result: users can control with one parameter the blending between noise by example and structured texture synthesis.", "paper_title": "Local Random-Phase Noise for Procedural Texturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000345855600024"}
