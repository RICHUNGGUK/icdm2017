Therefore, a new direction of the encryption method research is to combine the biometric information with the traditional encryption algorithm. The key extracted from the iris and AES encryption algorithm are used in the image encryption algorithm. The db2 wavelet decomposition to the iris region is performed, and the third level high frequency coefficient is extracted as the iris feature codes, from which a 192 bit key is generated by using the stochastic mapping function. The randomness of the key extraction is analyzed. The proposed algorithm is employed to do the encryption test to the image. The encryption effect is compared with the scrambling encryption effect of the classic Arnold method. The experiment results show that security of the encryption image gained by using the proposed algorithm is higher, achieving the purpose of protecting image information.", "paper_title": "Image Encryption Research based on Key Extracted from Iris Feature", "paper_id": "WOS:000369375600016"}
