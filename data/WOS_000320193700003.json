It was known that the graphon is random-free if and only if the entropy of this random graph is subquadratic. We prove that for random-free graphons, this entropy can grow as fast as any subquadratic function. However, if the graphon belongs to the closure of a random-free hereditary graph property, then the entropy is O(n log n). We also give a simple construction of a non-step-function random-free graphon for which this entropy is linear, refuting a conjecture of Janson.", "paper_title": "The Entropy of Random-Free Graphons and Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000320193700003"}
