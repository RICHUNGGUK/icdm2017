This paper presents an approach for generating illusory motions on 3D surfaces which can be used for shape illustration as well as artistic visualization of line fields on surfaces. Our method extends previous work on generating illusory motions in the plane, which we adapt to 3D surfaces. In addition, we propose novel volume texture of repeated asymmetric patterns (RAPs) to visualize bidirectional flows, thus enabling the visualization of line fields in the plane and on the surface. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with applications in shape illustration as well as line field visualization on surfaces. For the design of optical illusion art, it is a tough case to arrange the distribution of RAP. However, we provide a semi-automatic algorithm to help users design flow direction. Finally, this technique applies to the design of street art and user could easily set the perspective effect and flow motion for illustration.", "paper_title": "Optical illusion shape texturing using repeated asymmetric patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000337054700023"}
