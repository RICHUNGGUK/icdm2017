This strategy is applied to predict permeability of Mansuri Bangestan reservoir located in Ahwaz, Iran utilizing available geophysical well log data. Our methodology utilizes a hybrid genetic algorithm-neural network strategy (GA-ANN). The proposed algorithm combines the local searching ability of the gradient-based back-propagation (BP) strategy with the global searching ability of genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms are used to decide the initial weights of the gradient decent methods so that all the initial weights can be searched intelligently. The genetic operators and parameters are carefully designed and set avoiding premature convergence and permutation problems. For an evaluation purpose, the performance and generalization capabilities of GA-ANN are compared with those of models developed with the common technique of BP. The results demonstrate that carefully designed genetic algorithm-based neural network outperforms the gradient descent-based neural network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
