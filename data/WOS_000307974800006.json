The fast-growing design complexity with large-scale mixed-size macros and standard cells has caused significant challenges to modern circuit placement. Analytical algorithms have been shown to be most effective for standard-cell placement, but the problems with the rotation and legalization of large macros impose intrinsic limitations for analytical placement. Consequently, most recent works on mixed-size placement resort to combinatorial macro placement. Instead, this paper presents the first attempt to resolve the intrinsic problems with a unified analytical approach. Unlike traditional analytical placement that uses only wire and density forces to optimize the positions of circuit components, we present a new force, the rotation force, to handle macro orientation for analytical mixed-size placement. The rotation force tries to rotate each macro to its desired orientation based on the wire connections on this macro. A cross potential model is also proposed to increase the rotation freedom during placement. The final orientation of each macro with legalization consideration is then determined by mathematical programming. A macro flipping force is also proposed to determine the flipping orientation of each macro at the end of global placement. Compared with start-of-the-art mixed-size placement approaches (such as FLOP, CG, and MP-tree), our approach achieves the best average wirelength efficiently.", "paper_title": "Unified Analytical Global Placement for Large-Scale Mixed-Size Circuit Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000307974800006"}
