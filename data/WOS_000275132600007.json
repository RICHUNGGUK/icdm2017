The method requires minimal user interaction and is able to segment the near-end wall in arteries with large, hypoechogenic and irregular plaques, issues usually not considered previously due to the increased segmentation difficulty. The adventitia is detected by searching for the best fit of a cubic spline to edges having features compatible with the adventitia boundary. The algorithm uses a global smoothness constraint and integrates discriminating features of the adventitia to reduce the attraction by other edges. Afterwards, using the information of the adventitia location, the lumen boundary is detected by combining dynamic programming, smooth intensity thresholding surfaces and geometric snakes. Smooth contours that correctly adapt to the intima are produced, even in the presence of deep concavities. Moreover, unlike balloon-based snakes, the propagation force does not depend on gradients and does not require a predefined direction. An extensive statistical evaluation is computed, using a set of 47 images from 24 different symptomatic patients, including several classes, sizes and shapes of plaques. Bland-Altman plots of the mean intima-media thickness, for manual segmentations of two medical experts, show a high intra-observer and inter-observer agreement, with mean differences close to zero (mean between -0.10 mm and 0.18 mm) and with the large majority of differences within the limits of agreement (standard deviation between 0.10 mm and 0.12 mm). Similar Plots reveal it good agreement between the automatic and the manual segmentations (mean between -0.07 mm and 0.11 mm and standard deviation between 0.11 mm and 0.12 mm).
