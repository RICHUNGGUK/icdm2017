A limitation of PCSA is that it cannot be measured directly from a specimen, as there is usually no area within the muscle traversed by all fibres. Traditionally, a formula requiring averaged architectural parameters has been used. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a fibre bundle element (FBE) method to calculate PCSA from digitised fibre bundle data of five architecturally distinct muscles and compare the FBE and PCSA formula. An FBE method was developed that used a serially arranged set of cylinders as the volumetric representation of each fibre bundle, and PCSA was computed as the summation of the cross-sectional area of each FBE. Four of five muscles had significantly different PCSA between FBE and formula methods. The FBE method provides an approach that considers architectural variances while minimising the need for averaged architectural parameters.", "paper_title": "Fibre bundle element method of determining physiological cross-sectional area from three-dimensional computer muscle models created from digitised fibre bundle data", "paper_id": "WOS:000285145800012"}
