The future behavior of the plant is predicted using a discrete-time state-space model in the reference frame for a finite set of voltage vectors, which is pre-selected by a graph algorithm. The preferable input is chosen based on a cost function. Contrarily to conventional MP-DTC (and DTC), the stator flux is not explicitly controlled nor hysteresis bounds are used. The cost function is designed to meet multiple demands: torque reference tracking, Maximum Torque per Ampere (MTPA) tracking for high electrical efficiency, and limitation of the states to their maximum admissible values. For demonstration, the presented control strategy has been implemented on a small-scale Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) drive system with two-level Voltage Source Inverter (VSI). The results are promising with respect to both, dynamic and steady-state operation.", "paper_title": "Model Predictive Direct Torque Control With Finite Control Set for PMSM Drive Systems, Part 1: Maximum Torque Per Ampere Operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700012"}
