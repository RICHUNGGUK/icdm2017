Because of their data manipulating capabilities, GIS have been linked to different simulation models in different research areas and are commonly used for both surface and ground water modeling. Unfortunately this has been done mainly with proprietary GIS which are expensive and which do not provide access to their source code thus making them hard to customize. In order to overcome these problems, a module was created in the Open Source Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS to integrate it with the finite difference groundwater flow model MODFLOW, to take full advantage of the GIS capabilities. The results obtained with this module, when compared to those obtained with an existing MODFLOW pre and post-processor show that it can be used to develop groundwater flow models using uniform grid spacing on the horizontal plane. This module provides a tool for groundwater flow modeling to those users who cannot afford the commercially available processors and/or to those who wish to develop their models within a GIS.
