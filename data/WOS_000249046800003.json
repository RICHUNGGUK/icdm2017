The tool relies on highly realistic 3D- and 2D-representations of the heterogeneous internal structure of concrete for understanding the micromechanics of aggregate-matrix interactions. The generation mechanism allows control of aggregate volume content, shape and size distribution. The allocation procedure proved capable to produce numerical concrete with aggregate distributions comparable to real concrete. The continuum was discretised into lattices of linear elements, for structural analyses. Compression, direct tension and wedge-splitting tests were simulated. Parametrical study was carried out to investigate effects of different material properties and proportions in concrete admixtures. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
