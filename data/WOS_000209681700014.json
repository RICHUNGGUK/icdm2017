In this letter, we propose an efficient tag anti-collision protocol termed the adaptive assigned tree slotted Aloha anti-collision (AdATSA) protocol. In this protocol, the binary grouping and adaptive recognition phases are employed to effectively estimate the tag number and promptly identify tags. Additionally, we further improve the system efficiency of AdATSA by investigating the influence factor between the frame length and the tag number. Through numerical results, we are able to obtain several values of the influence factor, which helps to achieve the optimal system efficiency for AdATSA. Both analytical and simulation results are presented to show that the highest system efficiency of AdATSA is 61.7%, outperforming the previous protocols.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Anti-Collision Protocol for Large-Scale RFID Tag Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681700014"}
