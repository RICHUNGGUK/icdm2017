This paper presents a proposal complementing the generative power of shape grammars with reinforcement learning techniques. We use simple (naive) shape grammars capable of generating a large variety of different deigns. In order to generate those designs that comply with given design requirements, the grammar is subject to a process of machine learning using reinforcement learning techniques. Based on this method, we have developed a system for architectural design, aimed at generating two-dimensional layout schemes of single-family housing units. Using relatively simple grammar rules, we learn to generate schemes that satisfy a set of requirements stated in a design guideline. Obtained results are presented and discussed.
