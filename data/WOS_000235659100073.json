But not all the users in the field of remote sensing have the required knowledge of the grid computing. In this paper, we introduce a Grid-based programming environment (GPE) for remotely sensed data processing. User who doesn't have the knowledge of how to deal with transactions of the Grid computing environment can program with it. Although GPE isn't fit for the algorithms in which there exists strong correlation, it works well with the other algorithms and accelerates the computation evidently.", "paper_title": "A grid-based programming environment for remotely sensed data processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100073"}
