It is well known that wavelet coefficients with high magnitude (corresponding to edges and textures) tend to be clustered in a few amount of vectors. In this paper, we first show that this property has a major influence on the performances of ECLVQ schemes. Since this clustering property cannot be taken into account by the classical i.i.d. assumption, our first proposal is to model the Joint distribution of vectors by a multidimensional mixture of generalized Gaussian (MMGG) densities. The main outcome of this MMGG model is to provide a theoretical framework to simply derive from i.i.d. R-D models, the corresponding MMGG R-D models. In a second part, a new code-book better suited to wavelet coding is proposed: the so-called dead,one lattice vector quantizers (DZLVQ). It consists of generalizing the scalar dead zone to vector quantization by thresholding vectors according to their energy. We show that DZLVQ improves the rate-distortion tradeoff. Experimental results are provided for the pyramidal LVQ scheme under the assumption of a multidimensional mixture of Laplacian (MML) densities. Results performed on a set of real life images show the precision of the analytical R-D curves and the efficiency of the DZLVQ scheme.", "paper_title": "Entropy-coded lattice vector quantization dedicated to the block mixture densities", "paper_id": "WOS:000258618100009"}
