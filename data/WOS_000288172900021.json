This paper investigates a multi-layer network architecture where a generalized multiple protocol label switching (GMPLS) controlled transparent wavelength switched optical network (WSON), as the transport core, collaborates with multiple client optical burst switching (OBS) networks distributed at the edge. Dynamic interworking mechanism as well as the related signaling/routing protocol extensions for multi-QoS burst streams transmission among different OBS domains are proposed so as to provision an end-to-end (e2e) transparent optical connectivity with on-demand bandwidth to end-users. Moreover, the survivability of this transparent optical connectivity is also addressed. To validate the feasibility of this architecture, an integrated OBS/WSON network testbed was constructed, and stable e2e transparent connectivities were successfully demonstrated for an efficient multi-QoS burst streams transmission.", "paper_title": "Multi-layer network architecture in support of end-to-end transparent optical connectivities", "paper_id": "WOS:000288172900021"}
