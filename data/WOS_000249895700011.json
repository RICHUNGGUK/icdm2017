This phenomenon is studied with computational simulation. The particle-packet and bubble are modelled by a double particle-layers and porous medium model and a hemispherical model, respectively. The heat transfer to and within the object is simulated concurrently. Different grid schemes are applied and different grid sizes are used in meshing the particle-packet and the object as there is a very large difference in their geometrical sizes. Based on theoretical analysis, an approximate method is developed to calculate the heat flux at the surface of the object. The simulation is implemented in a CFD package and the results are compared with experiments. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. and Civil-Comp Ltd.
