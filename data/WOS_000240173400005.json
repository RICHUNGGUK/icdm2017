Non-asymptotic convergence bounds to this limit in the L-2 sense are provided, together with upper bounds on the classification error that is shown to converge to the Bayes risk, therefore proving the Bayes-consistency of a variety of methods although the regularization term does not vanish. These results are particularly relevant to the one-class SVM, for which the regularization can not vanish by construction, and which is shown for the first time to be a consistent density level set estimator.", "paper_title": "Consistency and convergence rates of one-class SVMs and related algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000240173400005"}
