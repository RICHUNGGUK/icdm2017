It is known that there exist systems and functions such that the approximation process is weakly divergent, i.e., divergent for certain subsequences. Here we strengthen this result by proving strong divergence, i.e., divergence for all subsequences. Further, in case of divergence, we give the divergence speed. We consider sampling at Nyquist rate as well as oversampling with adaptive choice of the kernel. Finally, connections between strong divergence and the Banach-Steinhaus theorem, which is not powerful enough to prove strong divergence, are discussed.", "paper_title": "Strong divergence for system approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000363254900004"}
