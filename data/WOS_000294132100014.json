We perform all operations on communication standard-compliant signal packets, thereby putting the device under the normal operating conditions. The transmitter on one device under test (DUT) is coupled with a receiver on another DUT to form a complete transmitter-to-receiver path. Parameters of the two devices are decoupled from one another by carefully modeling the system and using signal processing techniques. Simulation as well as measurement results confirm the high accuracy of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "A Multi-Site Test Solution for Quadrature Modulation RF Transceivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000294132100014"}
