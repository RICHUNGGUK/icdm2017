Frame pixel-shift is a common form of severe defect in videos caused by loss of consecutive pixels by the video transmission system. Pixel-shift refers to the large amount of pixel shifts one by one due to a small quantity of image data loss. The damaged region in the affected frame is usually quite large, causing serious degradation of visual quality. This paper addresses the issue of how to automatically detect and restore frame pixel-shift in videos. Pixel-shift frame detection relies on spatio-temporal information and motion estimation. Accurate measurement of pixels shift is achieved based on the analysis of temporal frequency information and restoration is accomplished by reversing the pixels shift and spatio-temporal interpolation. Performance evaluation using real video sequences demonstrate the good performance of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "Automatic detection and restoration of frame pixel-shift in videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000276139000005"}
