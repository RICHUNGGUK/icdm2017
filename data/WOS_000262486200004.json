Denoting S (v) (G,c) the set of colors assigned to the edges incident to a vertex vaV, and D (v) (G,c) the minimum number of integers which must be added to S (v) (G,c) to form an interval, the deficiency D(G,c) of an edge coloring c is defined as the sum a (vaV) D (v) (G,c), and the span of c is the number of colors used in c. The problem of finding, for a given graph, an edge coloring with a minimum deficiency is NP-hard. We give new lower bounds on the minimum deficiency of an edge coloring and on the span of edge colorings with minimum deficiency. We also propose a tabu search algorithm to solve the minimum deficiency problem and report experiments on various graph instances, some of them having a known optimal deficiency.", "paper_title": "Lower bounds and a tabu search algorithm for the minimum deficiency problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000262486200004"}
