DFPRM expression has the advantage of compactness and easy testability. The EXOR part in the proposed structure is designed as a tree of depth (inverted right perpendicularlog(2) sinverted left perpendicular + 1), where s is the number of product terms and sum terms in the given DFPRM expression realised by PLAs. This solves an open problem of designing an EXOR-tree-based RMC network that admits a universal test set. For an n-variable function, a test sequence of length (2n + 8) vectors is sufficient to detect all single stuck-at and bridging faults in the proposed design. The proposed EXOR-tree-based network reduces circuit delay significantly compared with cascaded EXOR-based design. The test sequence is independent of the function and the circuit-under-test, and the test set can be stored in a ROM for built-in-self-test.", "paper_title": "Universal test set for detecting stuck-at and bridging faults in double fixed-polarity Reed-Muller programmable logic arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000236132300006"}
