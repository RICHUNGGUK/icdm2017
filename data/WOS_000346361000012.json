Traditional approaches for discovering publication outlets mainly focus on manually matching research relevance in terms of keywords as well as comparing journal qualities, but other research-relevant information such as social connections, publication rewards, and productivity of authors are largely ignored. To assist in identifying effective publication outlets and to support effective journal recommendations for manuscripts, a three-dimensional profile-boosted research analytics framework (RAF) that holistically considers relevance, connectivity, and productivity is proposed. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed framework, a prototype system was implemented using the ScholarMate research social network platform. Evaluation results show that the proposed RAF-based approach outperforms traditional recommendation techniques that can be applied to journal recommendations in terms of quality and performance. This research is the first attempt to provide an integrated framework for effective recommendation in the context of scientific item recommendation.", "paper_title": "A Profile-Boosted Research Analytics Framework to Recommend Journals for Manuscripts", "paper_id": "WOS:000346361000012"}
