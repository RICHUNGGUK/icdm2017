However, it has a drawback: in SOV, a vehicle that is temporarily stopped takes a long time to restart. This study proposes a revised SOV model that suppresses this particular defect; the basic concept of this model is derived from the car-following model, which considers the velocity gap between a particular vehicle and the preceding vehicle. A series of simulations identifies the model parameters and clarifies that the proposed model can reproduce the three traffic phases: free, jam, and even synchronized phases, which cannot be achieved by the conventional SOV model.", "paper_title": "A REVISED STOCHASTIC OPTIMAL VELOCITY MODEL CONSIDERING THE VELOCITY GAP WITH A PRECEDING VEHICLE", "paper_id": "WOS:000296644000008"}
