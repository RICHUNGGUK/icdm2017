It is designed in a single-poly seven-metal 65-nm CMOS process. Several aspects of state-of-the-art QVCO design are addressed, for example tank design and circuit topologies in nano-meter CMOS technology. To minimize power dissipation, an inductor with a high LQ product of 188 nH at 2.4 GHz, and a self-resonant frequency (f(SR)) of 3.8 GHz, was designed. According to post-layout simulations, the power dissipation is below 300 mu W at a 0.6 V supply. At this supply, the simulated tuning range and phase noise at 1 MHz offset are 10.3% (2.26-2.5 GHz) and -109.6 dBc/Hz respectively. The phase noise figure of merit (FoM) is better than 182.5 dB at all supply voltages of interest, which is competitive to other state-of-the-art QVCOs.", "paper_title": "Design and analysis of an ultra-low-power LC quadrature VCO", "paper_id": "WOS:000288165500007"}
