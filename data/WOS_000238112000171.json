By recognizing the fact that BSS for basic ICA model corresponds to matrix factorization problem, in this paper, a novel idea of BSS for NNL model is proposed that the BSS for NNL corresponds to a non-negative matrix factorization problem and the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) technique is utilized. For better expression of the patterns of the sources, the NMF is further extended to pattern expression NMF (PE-NMF) and its algorithm is presented. Finally, the experimental results are presented which show the effectiveness and efficiency of the PE-NMF to BSS for a variety of applications which follow NNL model.", "paper_title": "Blind source separation with pattern expression NMF", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000171"}
