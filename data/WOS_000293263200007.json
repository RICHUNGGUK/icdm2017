The need for automated phenotyping in plant biology opens new fields of application for image acquisition and compression algorithms. In this report, we focus on X-ray imaging for high-throughput analysis of seeds. A practical tradeoff between the tolerated distortion on images and image acquisition rates is demonstrated for measurement, visual inspection or pattern recognition. In these contexts, using the same methodology, we quantify the highest acquisition and compression rates achievable while preserving all the useful biological information with standard lossy compression formats. Using a study case, we quantitatively demonstrate the interest of considering the final biological task as a priori knowledge to optimize the design of phenotyping systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
