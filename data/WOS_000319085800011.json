To this end, we propose a Network Virtual Platform (NetVP) that consists of one or more virtual host (vHOST) modules and virtual local area network (vLAN) modules to support electronic system level (ESL) top-down design flow as well as provide the on-line verification throughout the entire development process. The on-line verification capability of NetVP enables the designed target to communicate with a real network for system validation. For ESL top-down design flow, we also propose untimed and timed interfaces to support hardware/software co-simulation. In addition, the NetVP can be used in conjunction with any ESL development platform through the untimed/timed interface. System development that uses this NetVP is efficient and flexible since it allows the designer to explore design spaces such as the network bandwidth and system architecture easily. The NetVP can also be applied to the development of other kinds of network accelerators.", "paper_title": "A System-Level Network Virtual Platform for IPsec Processor Development", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085800011"}
