Apparently, 3L-CVRP is a combination of capacitated vehicle routing and three-dimensional bin packing problem and thus of high complexity. Different from most of previous works, we propose an innovative approach, called improved least waste heuristic for solving the loading subproblem, which is iteratively invoked by a simple tabu search algorithm for the routing. The good performance in terms of the solution quality and computational efficiency of our approach is shown through the numerical experiments on the benchmark instances from literature.
