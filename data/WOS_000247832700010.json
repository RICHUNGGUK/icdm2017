However, its practical use is often limited by the intrinsic low spatial resolution and long acquisition time. Spectral localization by imaging (SLIM) has been proposed as a non-Fourier reconstruction algorithm that incorporates spatial a priori information about spectroscopically uniform compartments. Unfortunately, the influence of the magnetic field inhomogeneity-in particular, the susceptibility effects at tissues' boundaries-undermines the validity of the compartmental model. Therefore, we propose BSLIM as an extension of SLIM with field inhomogeneity compensation. A B-o-field inhomogeneity map, which can be acquired rapidly and at high resolution, is used by the new algorithm as additional a priori information. We show that the proposed method is distinct from the generalized SLIM (GSLIM) framework. Experimental results of a two-compartment phantom demonstrate the feasibility of the method and the importance of inhomogeneity compensation.", "paper_title": "BSLIM: Spectral localization by imaging with explicit B-0 field inhomogeneity compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000247832700010"}
