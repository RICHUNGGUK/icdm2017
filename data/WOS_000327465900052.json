However each network device must be configured, typically in a low-level syntax. This time-consuming and error-prone process limits scalability and discourages repeated experimentation. This demonstration will show a platform to automate emulated network configuration and measurement, making large scale network experimentation accessible.", "paper_title": "Automated Configuration and Measurement of Emulated Networks with AutoNetkit", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900052"}
