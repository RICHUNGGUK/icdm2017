A DAR-C contains not only rule itself, but also its comments that specify when to apply the rule. In order to formalize this problem, we first present the expression method of candidate effective time slots, and then propose several definitions concerning DAR-C. Subsequently, two algorithms, namely ITS2 and EFP-Growth2, are developed for handling the problem of mining DAR-C. In particular, ITS2 is an improved two-stage dynamic association rule mining algorithm, while EFP-Growth2 is based on the EFP-tree structure and is suitable for mining high-density mass data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency and scalability of our proposed two algorithms (i.e., ITS2 and EFP-Growth2) on DAR-C mining tasks, and their practicability on real retail dataset.", "paper_title": "Mining dynamic association rules with comments", "paper_id": "WOS:000276511700004"}
