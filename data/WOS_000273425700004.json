Thus we propose unsupervised feature selection algorithms based on eigenvectors analysis to identify critical original features for principal component. The presented algorithms are based on k-nearest neighbor rule to find the predominant row components and eight new measures are proposed to compute the correlation between row components in transformation matrix. Experiments are conducted on benchmark data sets and facial image data sets for gender classification to show their superiorities.", "paper_title": "COMBINING FEATURE SELECTION WITH EXTRACTION: UNSUPERVISED FEATURE SELECTION BASED ON PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273425700004"}
