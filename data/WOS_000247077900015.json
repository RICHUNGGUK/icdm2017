To reduce the overhead, the proactive caching schemes have been proposed. However, they require too many control packets delivering the security context information to neighbor access points. Our contribution is made in two-fold: one is a significant decrease in the number of control packets for proactive caching and the other is a superior cache replacement algorithm.", "paper_title": "Smart Proactive caching scheme for fast authenticated handoff in wireless LAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000247077900015"}
