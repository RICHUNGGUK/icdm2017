Examining characteristics such as support-size, frequency and phase responses, amongst others, we show how Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWTs), particularly the ones which derive from Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, can be used to extract important features from a speech signal which are useful for SV. Lastly, an SV algorithm based on the concepts presented is described.", "paper_title": "A WAVELET-BASED SPEAKER VERIFICATION ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000284648400006"}
