The eventual success of such applications depends on the efficient management of the limited system resources while taking into account the time-varying wireless channel conditions as well as the varying multimedia source content. In this paper, we review some of the recent advances in cross-layer design schemes, which aim at providing significant gains in performance for video streaming systems through contentaware resource allocation. Advances in both, real-time video streaming, where the video is encoded and transmitted in real-time, as well as, on-demand video streaming, where the video is pre-encoded in a media server, are considered.
