The difficulty of this process underscores the importance of knowledge authoring tools that satisfy the demands of end-users. The authors hypothesize that the acceptability of a knowledge authoring tool for the creation of medical knowledge base content can be predicted by an accepted model in the information technology (IT) field, specifically the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods: An online survey was conducted amongst knowledge base authors who had previously established experience with the authoring tool software. The Likert-based questions in the survey were patterned directly after accepted TAM constructs with minor modifications to particularize them to the software being used. The results were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results: The TAM performed well in predicting end-users' behavioral intentions to use the knowledge authoring tool. Five out of seven goodness-of-fit statistics indicate that the model represents the behovioral intentions of the authors well. All but one of the hypothesized relationships specified by the TAM were significant with p values less than 0.05. Conclusions. The TAM provides an adequate means by which development teams can anticipate and better understand what aspects of a knowledge authoring tool ore most important to their target audience. Further research involving other behavioral models and an expanded user base will be necessary to better understand the scope of issues that factor into acceptability.", "paper_title": "Modeling end-users' acceptance of a knowledge authoring tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000241149400009"}
