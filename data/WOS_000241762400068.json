This paper presents an approach for dynamic reconfiguration of application modules in sensor networks based on Nano-Qplus. The version information from proposed methods is registered into NVSync (Nano-Qplus Version Synchronization), a node management tool. It dynamically reconfigures application modules on the nodes by synchronizing them with the node information map on the centralized repository. Our approach utilizes efficient usage of limited memory by systematically managing application modules of each node composed of sensor network. Additionally, it reduces unnecessary energy consumption by dynamic reconfiguration of application modules on the nodes. Therefore, it can flexibly deal with change of application environment of the node.", "paper_title": "A node management tool for dynamic reconfiguration of application modules in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762400068"}
