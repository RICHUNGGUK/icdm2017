The technique developed can be used for any application, because its implementation is transparent for the user, and integrates different compression algorithms for both MPI collective and point-to-point primitives. Furthermore, compression is turned on and off and the most appropriate compression algorithms are selected at runtime, depending on the characteristics of each message, the network behavior, and compression algorithm behavior, following a runtime adaptive strategy. Our system can be optimized for a specific application, through a guided strategy, to reduce the runtime strategy overhead. Adaptive-CoMPI has been validated using several MPI benchmarks and real HPC applications. Results show that, in most cases, by using adaptive compression, communication time is reduced, enhancing application performance and scalability.", "paper_title": "Adaptive-Compi: Enhancing Mpi-Based Applications' Performance and Scalability by using Adaptive Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000287233400004"}
