The idea behind our method is to concentrate all the 3D curvature at a small number of select mesh vertices, called cone singularities, and then cut the mesh through those singular vertices to obtain disk topology. The singular vertices are chosen automatically. As opposed to most previous methods, our flattening process involves only the solution of linear systems of Poisson equations, thus is very efficient. Our method is shown to be faster than existing methods, yet generates parameterizations having comparable quasi-conformal distortion.", "paper_title": "Conformal flattening by curvature prescription and metric scaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000255285500034"}
