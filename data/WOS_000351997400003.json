While Terasort is known for its sorting speed on big data, its performance and energy consumption still can be optimized. We have analyzed the characteristics of Terasort and have identified the existence of idle nodes, which does not only waste energy but also loses performance. Therefore, we optimize Terasort through a single-task distributed algorithm and a task self-resizing algorithm to save time and reduce the energy that is consumed by map nodes and reduce nodes, which is caused by task schedule and waiting for input data. The algorithm proposed in this paper has proved to be effective in optimizing performance and energy consumption through a series of experiments. It can also be adapted to other applications in the MapReduce environment.", "paper_title": "Performance and Energy Optimization of the Terasort Algorithm by Task Self-Resizing", "paper_id": "WOS:000351997400003"}
