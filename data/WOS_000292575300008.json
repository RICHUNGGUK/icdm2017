The main contribution of this work is the utilization of the two-diode model to represent the PV cell. This model requires only four parameters and known to have better accuracy at low irradiance level, allowing for more accurate prediction of PV system performance during partial shading condition. The proposed model supports a large array simulation that can be interfaced with MPPT algorithms and power electronic converters. The accurateness of the modeling technique is validated by real time simulator data and compared with the three other types of modeling, namely Neural Network, P&O and single-diode model. It is envisaged that the proposed work is very useful for PV professionals who require simple, fast and accurate PV model to design their systems.
