When the available knowledge is naturally scattered among different sources of information, computing such consequences with respect to the global theory in a decentralized way is a challenging problem. This paper presents SOMEWHERE2, a multilayered architecture that may be used to solve such consequence finding problems in peer-to-peer networks of collaborating entities, that may evolve over time. The general layout of this architecture is described as well as the roles of its main components. Thanks to a careful and modular design, the resulting framework is very generic. This facilitates alternative implementations of specific components as well as its extension with additional features. First experimental results are presented, illustrating the scalability and robustness of this architecture. This framework may be used as a robust building block for more advanced distributed applications, such as Peer Data Management Systems.", "paper_title": "A MULTI-LAYERED ARCHITECTURE FOR COLLABORATIVE AND DECENTRALIZED CONSEQUENCE FINDING", "paper_id": "WOS:000357750700010"}
