Operations managers and workers need accurate and timely data to improve their productivity. Rapid growth in the use of mobile technologies has increased the demand for mobile-based data-collection solutions to bridge the information gap in SMEs. As part of this effort, we have developed a web-based authoring tool that enables non-programmers to build mobile applications that collect production information. This paper describes the proposed mobile data-collection system, and examines its feasibility in SMEs at which production data is manually collected and managed using paper forms. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed system can successfully overcome technical constraints, providing a simple means of creating mobile data-collection tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
