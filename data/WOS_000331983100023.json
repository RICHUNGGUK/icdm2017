Moreover, the prevalence of intelligent mobile phones and wireless networks can allow users to use network services at home and obtain multimedia content easily through mobile devices, thus achieving ubiquitous network cloud multimedia service. However, how to meet the users' demand for high quality and diversified cloud multimedia with handheld devices, which have limited arithmetic capability and power, is an interesting and challenging study. This paper proposed an adaptive energy-efficient stream decoding system for cloud multimedia network on multicore systems. The overall dynamic energy-efficient design was planned in a systematic viewpoint, and the temporary storage block for cloud multimedia was controlled, while considering the instancy of cloud multimedia streaming transmission without destroying the original decoding process. The system decoding schedule time was adjusted to reduce the cloud multimedia data dependence by dynamic-voltage-frequency-scaling system. The adaptive energy-efficient stream decoding system was proven to be feasible for the cloud multimedia network.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Energy-Efficient Stream Decoding System for Cloud Multimedia Network on Multicore Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000331983100023"}
