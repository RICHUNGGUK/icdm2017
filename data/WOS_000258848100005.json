In this paper we investigate spatio-temporal movement patterns in large tracking data sets. We present a natural definition of the pattern 'one object is leading others', which is based on behavioural patterns discussed in the behavioural ecology literature. Such leadership patterns can be characterised by a minimum time length for which they have to exist and by a minimum number of entities involved in the pattern. Furthermore, we distinguish two models (discrete and continuous) of the time axis for which patterns can start and end. For all variants of these leadership patterns, we describe algorithms for their detection, given the trajectories of a group of moving entities. A theoretical analysis as well as experiments show that these algorithms efficiently report leadership patterns.", "paper_title": "Reporting leaders and followers among trajectories of moving point objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000258848100005"}
