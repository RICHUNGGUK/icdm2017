Distributed dynamic state feedback control law is introduced to realize the regulator problem and a general global method for error regulation is established. The Jordan canonical form is used to stabilize the closed-loop control system. Sylvester equation and internal model theory are adopted to achieve the objectives of output regulation for every initial condition in the state space. Finally, numerical simulations are utilized to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
