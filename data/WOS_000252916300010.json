Design/methodology/approach - An analytical model is introduced regarding multiple designs of permanent magnet synchronous machines. This electromagnetic model is coupled to a numerical simulation. Thereby, the advantages of both computational methods are combined by parameterizing the analytical model to the numerical solution. This results in a high-efficient analytical model with the accuracy of the numerical simulation. The results of the analytical model are compared to measurements of a permanent magnet synchronous machine. Various machine modifications are simulated to evaluate possible limitations of the analytical model. Findings - It can be stated, that a once parameterized analytical model achieves a high accuracy. Furthermore, geometric variations can be applied without the need of a new parameterization through a numerical simulation. Only changing the permanent magnet height or the air gap height results in a significant deviation and a new numerical simulation is recommended. Research limitations/implications - Only measurements for machines up to 5 kW were available. In consequence, the model is only validatet in this range. Practical implications - With the presented analytical model, an electromagnetic design of a permanent magnet synchronous machine can be performed very time efficient achieving accurate results. Furthermore, optimization studies can be performed with low-computational costs. Originality/value - The introduced analytical model can be parameterized by a numerical simulation. The numeric simulation process and the parameterization are performed automatically according to the data calculated by the analytical model. Measurements demonstrate the effectiveness and the limitations of the model.", "paper_title": "Coupling of analytical and numerical methods for the electromagnetic simulation of permanent magnet synchronous machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300010"}
