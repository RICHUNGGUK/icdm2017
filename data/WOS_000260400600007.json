An improved BP decoding algorithm, called the shuffled BP decoding algorithm, decodes each symbol node in serial at each iteration. To reduce the decoding delay of the shuffled BP decoding algorithm, the group shuffled BP decoding algorithm divides all symbol nodes into several groups. In contrast to the original group shuffled BP, which automatically generates groups according to symbol positions, in this paper we propose a method for grouping symbol nodes which generates groups according to the structure of a Tanner graph of the codes. The proposed method can accelerate the convergence of the group shuffled BP algorithm and obtain a lower error rate in a small number of iterations. We show by simulation results that the decoding performance of the proposed method is improved compared with those of the shuffled BP decoding algorithm and the group shuffled BP decoding algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Method for Grouping Symbol Nodes of Group Shuffled BP Decoding Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400600007"}
