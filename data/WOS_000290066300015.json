Usually, customers employ speedometers (such as Speedtest) to evaluate the access link performance. Such speedometers run in the user's PC, concurrently with many other applications which may generate cross-traffic and reduce the processing time to the remaining applications. In this paper we analyze the impact of cross-traffic from other applications and CPU and memory occupancy due to concurrent applications in the speedometer accuracy, for a broad range of file-download and packet-train-based measurement techniques. We conclude that the packet-train technique is highly immune to cross-traffic, CPU and memory occupancy, which makes it amenable to use in general-purpose PCs running concurrent software. However, an estimation of CPU, memory occupancy and cross-traffic from other applications improves the measurement accuracy. In this regard, we present the QoS-Poll measurement software, which estimates the occupancy of system resources, including cross-traffic from other applications, and defines a region of acceptance of the bandwidth measurement in terms of the previous system parameters. The results of a QoS-Poll measurement campaign (more than 75 households) are also reported, showing excellent measurement accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
