High received signal to noise ratio and compliance with the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) spectral mask call for judicious design of UWB pulse shapers. In this paper, even and odd order derivatives of Gaussian pulse are used respectively as base waveforms to produce two synthesized pulses. Our method can realize high efficiency of spectral utilization in terms of normalized effective signal power (NESP). The waveform design problem can be converted into linear programming problem, which can be efficiently solved. The waveform based oil even order derivatives is orthogonal to the one based on odd order derivatives.", "paper_title": "Optimal Waveform Design for Ultra-Wideband Communication Based on Gaussian Derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000262763400011"}
