With more photos stored on personal devices, there is a growing need of photo tools that can empower users to organize and manage personal photographs. To target this goal, we devote our efforts to develop a photos management system used for cellphone, namely Photo 4W, offering the index of mobile photography related to what, where, who and when. The key technologies in this system mainly include face annotation and scene classification. Face annotation is implemented by using interactive method after face detection. To help user annotate faces, we provided a batch solution in which users are allowed to multi-select a group of faces and then assign one name from a predicted candidate list. Scene classification utilizes semi-automated method to classify photos based on their semantic content. Experiments conducted on a real family album demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and efficient for mobile photo management. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
