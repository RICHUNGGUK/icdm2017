This paper presents a novel, simple, yet powerful method for rotation-invariant color texture classification. Firstly, we define a Distance-based Local Binary Pattern (DLBP) descriptor to characterize the color texture. By learning the joint distribution of the rotation-invariant DLBP and color intensity information, we define our Multiple Sub-DLBPs (MS_DLBP) descriptor. The MS_DLBP features defined in this paper are invariant to rotation. Here, we also compared seven important color spaces in terms of their effectiveness in our proposed MS_DLBP approach. The experimental results on the Outex and CUReT databases show the defined DLBP descriptor performs better than the existing color LBP descriptors and the proposed MS_DLBP approach is very robust to rotation invariance and outperforms state-of-the-art texture analysis methods. Also, HSV color space is shown to outperform the other color spaces in many cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
