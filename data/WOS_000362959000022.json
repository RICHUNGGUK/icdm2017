Recently, many leakage-resilient cryptographic primitives have been proposed. In this paper, we put forward the first leakage-resilient wicked identity-based encryption (wicked IBE) scheme. To achieve this goal, we first present a new wicked IBE scheme in the composite order groups. The security proof of this scheme is achieved via the dual system encryption technique. In contrast with existing wicked IBE schemes, the new proposal can be proved fully secure in the standard model, even when the maximum hierarchy depth is a polynomial in the security parameter. Moreover, its security is based on some standard assumptions in the composite groups, which are independent of the hierarchy depth of the scheme. Based on this newly proposed scheme, we then put forward a fully secure leakage-resilient wicked IBE scheme in the bounded memory-leakage model. The leakage here is not only allowed on the user's secret key, but also on the master secret key. Its security is proved in the standard model by a hybrid argument in a sequence of computationally indistinguishable games. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first wicked IBE scheme in the context of leakage resilience.", "paper_title": "Fully Secure Wicked Identity-Based Encryption Against Key Leakage Attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000362959000022"}
