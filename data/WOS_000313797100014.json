In this paper, we study the cone of quadratic forms. Understanding the structure of is important for globally solving NP-hard quadratic programs over P. We establish key characteristics of and construct a separation algorithm for provided one can optimize with respect to a related cone over the boundary of P. This algorithm leads to a nonlinear representation of and a class of tractable relaxations for , each of which improves a standard polyhedral-semidefinite relaxation of . The relaxation technique can further be applied recursively to obtain a hierarchy of relaxations, and for constant recursive depth, the hierarchy is tractable. We apply this theory to two important cases: P is the nonnegative orthant, in which case is the cone of completely positive matrices; and P is the homogenized cone of the \"box\" [0, 1] (n) . Through various results and examples, we demonstrate the strength of the theory for these cases. For example, we achieve for the first time a separation algorithm for 5 x 5 completely positive matrices.", "paper_title": "Separation and relaxation for cones of quadratic forms", "paper_id": "WOS:000313797100014"}
