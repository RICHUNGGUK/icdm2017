A novel way about nonlinear regression modeling of high-technology manufacturing (HTM) productivity with the support vector machines (SVM) is presented in this paper. Optimization of labor productivity (LP) is also presented in this paper, which is based on chaos and uses the SVM regression model as the objective function.", "paper_title": "Modeling and optimization of high-technology manufacturing productivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300133"}
