The proposed scheme uses a tuning mechanism to make its initial response faster improving the traditional large settling time of these circuits. A zero-IF baseband receiver chain suitable for Bluetooth that includes the proposed dc offset correction has been designed in a 0.18 mu m CMOS technology at 1.2 V supply voltage.", "paper_title": "DC offset control with application in a zero-IF 0.18 mu m CMOS Bluetooth receiver chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000282012800002"}
