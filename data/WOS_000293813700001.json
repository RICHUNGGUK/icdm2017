Design/methodology/approach - An online questionnaire was used to survey professors teaching subjects online. Findings - There is a considerable lack of knowledge on the part of professors regarding copyright issues, both in general terms and in specific matters related to digital learning. Strong discrepancies are found between the text of the law and the notion actually held by professors as to how legislators have formulated the law. Originality/value - This information may be useful for professors themselves as well as for persons managing the e-learning platforms of universities. It demonstrates that the law was reformed without any discussion with those actually engaged in online teaching.", "paper_title": "Copyright and e-learning: professors' level of knowledge about the new Spanish law", "paper_id": "WOS:000293813700001"}
