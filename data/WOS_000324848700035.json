To tackle with this problem, we propose a robust sample-based image completion scheme which is a cascade of two major procedures. First, we extract structural information from both source and sample images and then apply boundary band map (BBM) descriptor to perform template matching under contour consistency constraint and reconstruct the damaged structures. Second, a weighted exemplar-based image synthesis algorithm is further devised taking the previous structural information and matching results into account. Extensive experiments and comparative study show the reliability and superiority of our image completion algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
