We propose that such receivers should include a standardised Java-based procedural environment capable of rendering 2D/3D graphics and video, and a declarative environment supporting W3C recommendations such as SMIL and XForms. We also introduce a graphics architecture model that meets such requirements. As a proof-of-concept, a prototype implementation of the model is presented. This implementation enhances television content by allowing the user to play 3D graphics games, to run Java applications, and to browse XML-based documents while meeting current hardware restrictions.", "paper_title": "A graphics architecture for high-end interactive television terminals", "paper_id": "WOS:000250871400005"}
