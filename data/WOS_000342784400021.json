In far-view soccer videos, player tracking methods that perform processing based only on visual features cannot accurately track players since each player region becomes small, and video coding causes color bleeding between player regions and the soccer field. In order to solve this problem, the proposed method performs player tracking on the basis of the following three elements. First, we utilize visual features based on uniform colors and player shapes. Second, since soccer players play in such a way as to maintain a formation, which is a positional pattern of players, we use this characteristic for player tracking. Third, since the movement direction of each player tends to change smoothly in successive frames of soccer videos, we also focus on this characteristic. Then we adopt three energies: a potential energy based on visual features, an elastic energy based on formations and a movement direction-based energy. Finally, we define a composite energy function that consists of the above three energies and track players by minimizing this energy function. Consequently, the proposed method achieves accurate player tracking in far-view soccer videos.", "paper_title": "Player Tracking in Far-View Soccer Videos Based on Composite Energy Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784400021"}
