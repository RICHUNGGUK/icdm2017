In this paper, topology and operational principle of OFVA are introduced, the analytical formulas of the electromagnetic force for the x and y directions, which can drive the mover to generate a circular motion trajectory, are derived, and the characteristic of static electromagnetic force is predicted by analytical method and 2-D (two-dimensional) FEM (finite element method), 3-D and measurement. The coupled magnetic field-circuit-motion simulation models which are driven by current and voltage source are established, respectively, and some of its operational characteristics are analyzed. Simulation and experiment validate theoretical analysis and the feasibility of the fabricated prototype, demonstrate the good performance of the OFVA, and provide valuable reference for engineering applications.", "paper_title": "System Modeling and Operational Characteristic Analysis for an Orbital Friction Vibration Actuator Used in Orbital Vibration Welding", "paper_id": "WOS:000322179400002"}
