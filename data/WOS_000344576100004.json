In selecting items from these menus, novice users physically rehearse the same actions that an expert would use. We describe these menus and their potential applications in further detail, along with a study comparing keyboard-card menus' presentation of what are effectively shortcuts with a presentation of these same shortcuts that uses dropdown menus. The data from our study shows that keyboard-card menus have significant advantages over dropdown menus in making the transition to expert use faster.", "paper_title": "Keyboard-Card Menus: A New Presentation of Non-Standard Shortcuts", "paper_id": "WOS:000344576100004"}
