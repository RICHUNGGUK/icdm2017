The relationship between the watermarking capacity and the watermark detection error rate is also discussed. The research of watermark detection error rate will help us finding the ways to embed more watermark messages while keeping an acceptable detection error rate, and it is useful for the design of the general algorithms of watermarking and detection. The watermarking system is analyzed based on the channel capacity and error rate of the communication system, and the relation between the detection error rate with the capacity and payload capacity is derived. According to the experimental results, the detection error rate of watermark is mainly influenced by the watermark average energy and the watermarking capacity. The error rate rises with the increase of watermarking capacity. When the channel coding is used, the watermarking error rate drops with the decrease of the payload capacity of watermarking.
