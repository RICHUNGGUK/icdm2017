An important application of these algorithms is focused source reproduction. The focused source reproduction capability is strongly coupled with the array length. The array length is a very important design factor in consumer products, but it is very short in home entertainment systems, compared with ideal WFS systems or theater speaker systems. Therefore, a well-defined measure for the maximum focusing range is necessary for designing an array speaker product. In this paper, a maximum focusable range measure is proposed and is analyzed by simulation of a small array speaker. The analysis results show that the proposed maximum focusable range has properties strongly related to the capability for focused source reproduction.", "paper_title": "Maximum Focusing Range for Focused Sound Source Reproduction in a Short-Aperture Array Loudspeaker", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400028"}
