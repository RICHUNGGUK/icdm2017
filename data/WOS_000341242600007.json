Fabricated in a 2 mu m InGaP/GaAs hetero-junction bipolar transistor (HBT) process, the operating gain is observed to be 31.3 dB. The PA meets the minimum adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) requirement of -30 dBc for LTE with 20 MHz wide channel bandwidth up to an output power of 30 dBm with the aid of a novel dual stage linearizer. Biased at low quiescent current of less than 100 mA with a headroom consumption of 3.5 V, the power added efficiency (PAE) is observed to be 38.29% at 30 dBm. With this high linear output power, the stringent requirement of antenna path loss is nullified. PA serves to be the first reported work to achieve 30 dBm linear output power at supply voltage of 3.5 V.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF WIDEBAND LTE POWER AMPLIFIER WITH NOVEL DUAL STAGE LINEARIZER FOR MOBILE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000341242600007"}
