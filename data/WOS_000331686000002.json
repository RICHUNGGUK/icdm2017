The mel-cepstral feature parameters, line spectral frequency values, and Fourier-domain Lebesgue features were extracted from the vibration signals. The best experimental results were obtained using the mel-cepstral feature parameters. The feature parameters were classified using a support vector machine (SVM), which was trained a priori using a manually classified dataset. An average recognition rate of 98.2% was achieved. An important feature of the method is that it is easily trainable, enabling it to be applicable to other nuts, including walnuts and pistachio nuts. In addition, the system can be implemented in real time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
