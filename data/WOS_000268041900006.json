The location of image capture is, however, subjective and has relied on the esthetic sense of photographers up until this point. In this paper, we will not only visualize areas with images, but also propose a general framework to determine where the most distinct viewpoints should be located. Starting from elevation data, we present spatial and content information in ground-based images such that (1) a given number of images can have maximum coverage on informative scenes; (2) a set of key views can be selected with certain continuity for representing the most distinct views. According to the scene visibility, continuity, and data redundancy, we evaluate viewpoints numerically with an object-emitting illumination model. Our key view exploration may eventually reduce the visual data to transmit, facilitate image acquisition, indexing and interaction, and enhance perception of spaces. Real sample images are captured based on planned positions to form a visual network to index the area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
