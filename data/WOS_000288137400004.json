Particularly, a mobile node (MN) must be authenticated in order to utilize the network resources whenever the MN performs its initial access or handover. In this paper, we present secure handover scenarios for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6): namely, handover re-authentication (HORA) and handover early-authentication (HOEA). The presented secure handover scenarios are based on EAP that is a common authentication framework for wireless mobile networks. Analysis results for the total handover latency and packet loss are presented to demonstrate whether the presented secure handover scenarios satisfy with real-time applications. PMIPv6 is in the early stage of deployment in various wireless mobile networks. The conducted results in this paper thus offer the key to an understanding of feasibility of PMIPv6 in the coming next-generation network environments.
