This basis is nonnegative, normalized and linearly independent. And its corresponding MD-splines have local support, obey the convex hull and piecewise polynomial properties, and are C(min(m, n)) continuous, where m,n are different degrees of two adjoining segments. Compared with Sederberg et al. (2003), the MD-splines in this paper involve some of its cases and have higher order continuity in some cases. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
