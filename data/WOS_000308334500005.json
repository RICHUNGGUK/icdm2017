It requires firstly the determination of the model-base. For this, the number of models is selected via a neural network and a rival penalized competitive learning (RPCL), and the operating clusters are identified by using the fuzzy K-means algorithm. The obtained results are then exploited for the parametric identification of the models. The second step consists in validating the proposed model-base by using the adequate method of validity computation. Two examples are presented in this paper which show the efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A Multimodel Approach for Complex Systems Modeling based on Classification Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000308334500005"}
