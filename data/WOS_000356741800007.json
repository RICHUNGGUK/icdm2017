The methodology focuses on simplicity and reproducibility of the involved components as well as performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Exploiting a variety of low-level 2D and 3D geometric features, we further improve their distinctiveness by involving individual neighborhoods of optimal size. Due to the use of individual neighborhoods, the methodology is not tailored to a specific dataset, but in principle designed to process point clouds with a few millions of 3D points. Consequently, an extension has to be introduced for analyzing huge 3D point clouds with possibly billions of points for a whole city. For this purpose, we propose an extension which is based on an appropriate partitioning of the scene and thus allows a successive processing in a reasonable time without affecting the quality of the classification results. We demonstrate the performance of our methodology on two labeled benchmark datasets with respect to robustness, efficiency, and scalability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
