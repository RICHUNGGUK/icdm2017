The technology acceptance model (TAM) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) can both provide knowledge about users' intention to use a service, making them good models to base formative decisions on. Unlike TAM, TPB is concerned with specific information related to the service context, and provide knowledge about what makes IT useable. We used an adapted version of the TPB as the foundation for a formative service evaluation technique called F-SET. We applied the F-SET to a case where two subsequent versions of a service prototype were evaluated. The first prototype was a description of the service supported by Hi-Fi design sketches showing what a web-based meal planning tool could look like. The second prototype consisted of both service processes and the web-based meal planning tool. To find relevant factors that influence future use of such a service, a survey of 28 informants was conducted with the first prototype. The second prototype involved five families who used the service for two weeks. The feedback provided by the families, based on the factors identified in the pre-test, influenced the future direction of the service development. Feedback from the informants was distributed between the service and the IT system, and the most common factors that influence the intention to use the service were time, price, usefulness and availability. Feedback included both positive and negative comments, as well as bugs and suggestions for improvements. We discuss potential improvements and what kind of information to expect from the different constructs of the TPB.", "paper_title": "Formative Evaluation of IT-based Services: A Case Study of a Meal Planning Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000344604900003"}
