In this paper, we propose a trust model which evaluates neighbours' direct trust by factors of encounter time, mobility, and successful cooperation frequency. The revised D-S evidence theory is used to combine multiple recommended pieces of evidence and obtain the recommended trust value. Then based on the novel trust mechanism, we propose a trusted routing protocol named TDS-AODV protocol by extending the AODV protocol. In this protocol, a node makes a routing decision according to the trust values of its neighbour nodes. Finally, two routes are built: the main route with highest route trust value in the candidate routes and a backup route. Simulation results reveal that TDS-AODV can eliminate malicious nodes effectively when building the route; furthermore, it also achieves better performance than TAODV and AODV in terms of throughput, packet delivery ratio, and average end to end delay.", "paper_title": "A Credible Routing Based on a Novel Trust Mechanism in Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000318704800001"}
