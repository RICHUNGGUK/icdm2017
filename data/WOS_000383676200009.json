Since the introduction of evolutionary algorithms several studies have been conducted on the development of metaheuristic optimization algorithms. Most of these algorithms are inspired by biological phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm inspired by prey-predator interaction of animals. In the algorithm randomly generated solutions are assigned as a predator and preys depending on their performance on the objective function. Their performance can be expressed numerically and is called the survival value. A prey will run towards the pack of preys with better surviving values and away from the predator. The predator chases the prey with the smallest survival value. However, the best prey or the prey with the best survival value performs a local search. Hence the best prey focuses fully on exploitation while the other solution members focus on the exploration of the solution space. The algorithm is tested on selected well-known test problems and a comparison is also done between our algorithm, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. From the simulation result, it is shown that on the selected test problems prey-predator algorithm performs better in achieving the optimal value.", "paper_title": "Prey-Predator Algorithm: A New Metaheuristic Algorithm for Optimization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000383676200009"}
