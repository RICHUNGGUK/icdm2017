New parameters, like wave information flow, wave information/knowledge content or wave information impedance, are first defined and then represented by wave probabilistic functions. Next, relations between newly defined parameters are used to compute information power or to build wave information circuits covering feedbacks, etc.", "paper_title": "WAVE PROBABILISTIC INFORMATION POWER", "paper_id": "WOS:000292802400005"}
