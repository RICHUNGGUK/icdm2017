This work investigates several different properties of NC that influence the energy consumption and thus are important when designing NC systems for battery-driven devices. Different approaches to the necessary implementation of coding operations and Galois fields arithmetic are considered and complexity expressions for coding operations are provided. We also benchmark our own mobile phone implementation on a Nokia N95 under different settings. Several NC strategies are described and compared, furthermore expressions for transmission times are developed. It is also shown that the use of NC introduces a trade off between reduction in transmission time and increase in energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Cautious View on Network Coding - From Theory to Practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000262763400005"}
