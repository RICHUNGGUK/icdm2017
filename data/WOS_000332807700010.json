In this paper, numerical algorithms of attribute reduction with neighborhood-covering rough sets are developed by using evidence theory. We firstly employ belief and plausibility functions to measure lower and upper approximations in neighborhood-covering rough sets, and then, the attribute reductions of covering information systems and decision systems are characterized by these respective functions. The concepts of the significance and the relative significance of coverings are also developed to design algorithms for finding reducts. Based on these discussions, connections between neighborhood-covering rough sets and evidence theory are set up to establish a basic framework of numerical characterizations of attribute reduction with these sets.
