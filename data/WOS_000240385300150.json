However, because of the complex structure, there are only few achievements on the control algorithm for constrained Wiener-typed system. An improved dual-mode control algorithm is put forward. Firstly, Zeroin Algorithm is applied to obtain the inverse of the static nonlinear block of the Wiener-typed nonlinear system. Then, we define the invariant ellipsoid sets for estimated state and estimated error respectively, and guarantee the feasibility, stability and convergence of this algorithm by the theory of invariant set combined with Dual-Model approach[1]. In contrast to traditional algorithms, this one has the advantages of larger initial stable region in state space and higher tracking accuracy. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed algorithm are validated by case studies.", "paper_title": "Dual-mode control algorithm for Wiener-typed nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300150"}
