The model library should support the process of modelling and reuse, while also emphasizing openness to brace the modeller during the development and refinement phase. The bond graph approach is good when it comes to the physical modelling of systems and is a good tool for combining different energy domains to better help in understanding the system. In addition, a bond graph is a powerful method to find dependencies between various components. Using a causal analysis, any problems in the model, for example, algebraic constrains or dependent system variables, will be detected, and the necessary remodelling may be performed to handle such problems. The bond graph approach is therefore used when developing the component library. The component library consists of selected power producers such as diesel and gas engines, fuel cell and synchronous generator and power consumers such as asynchronous motor with a voltage source converter in addition to a generic load used for hotel and auxiliary loads. The library also consists of a ship model and propeller models.", "paper_title": "Bond graph modelling of marine power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000304310200001"}
