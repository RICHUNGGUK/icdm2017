Since an entity is expected to capture the semantic content of documents and queries more accurately than a term, it would be interesting to study whether leveraging the information about entities can improve the retrieval accuracy for entity-bearing queries. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval approach, i.e., latent entity space (LES), which models the relevance by leveraging entity profiles to represent semantic content of documents and queries. In the LES, each entity corresponds to one dimension, representing one semantic relevance aspect. We propose a formal probabilistic framework to model the relevance in the high-dimensional entity space. Experimental results over TREC collections show that the proposed LES approach is effective in capturing latent semantic content and can significantly improve the search accuracy of several state-of-the-art retrieval models for entity-bearing queries.", "paper_title": "Latent entity space: a novel retrieval approach for entity-bearing queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000365876500001"}
