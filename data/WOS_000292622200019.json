The SPAC scheme is based on the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) protocol with slight modifications of control packets; network congestions are avoided by a simple and precise admission control that blocks most of the overloading flow requests in the route-discovery process. System simulations show that the SPAC scheme and its performance is comparable to the contention-aware admission control protocol (CACP)-Multihop performance in all respects; the SPAC scheme is also simpler. As compared to a QoS-aware routing protocol employing either \"listen\" or \"hello\" scheme, the SPAC protocol offers higher throughput and remarkably less end-to-end delays under heavy loads.
