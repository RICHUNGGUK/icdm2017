Zur Transformation von Raumkurven, Mathematische Annalen 66 (4), 517-557] published one century ago, a family Of Curves with constant Curvature but non-constant torsion was defined. We characterize them as space curves with constant curvature and whose normal vector makes a constant angle with a fixed line. The relation between these Curves and rational curves with double Pythagorean hodograph is Studied. A method to construct closed curves, including knotted curves, of constant curvature and Continuous torsion using pieces of Salkowski curves is outlined. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
