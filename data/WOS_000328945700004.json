Here, the authors investigate how ubiquitous traffic sensing technologies and techniques can be incorporated with conventional traffic control and monitoring practices in the city of Oulu, Finland. In collaboration with the city's traffic control center and traffic planners, they exploit inductive magnetic sensing and Wi-Fi scanning across the city center, and develop tools to assist traffic operators in their tasks.", "paper_title": "Traffic in the Smart City Exploring City-Wide Sensing for Traffic Control Center Augmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000328945700004"}
