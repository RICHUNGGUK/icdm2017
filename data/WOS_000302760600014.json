However, the standard NEMO solution does not specify any Route Optimization mechanism, as a result of which the data is always exchanged over a bi-directional tunnel maintained between the MNet and its respective Home Agent. This in-efficient routing of packets imposes several performance issues that gets compounded for nested Mobile Networks, where data packets will be tunneled/detunneled multiple times undergoing repeated levels of encapsulations/decapsulations. Such routing of packets, commonly termed as pinball routing, is considered a serious performance limitation and its adverse effect is maximum during intra-nest communication, i.e., between two inter-communicating nodes existing within the same MNet domain. Another issue concerned with nested mobile networks is loop formation and race condition between two competing Mobile Routers. Previously, we had proposed a basic RO solution called NERON. In this paper we extend the base NERON protocol solution to solve issues due to Pinball routing phenomena, and to avoid loop formation and race condition between contending Mobile Routers.
