To understand and decompose transceiver power consumption, we have created a toolkit incorporating a library of transceiver circuits in 45-nm CMOS and MOS current mode logic (MCML) and characterize power consumption using representative network traffic traces with digital synthesis and SPICE tools. Our toolkit includes all the components required to construct a library of different transceivers: line coding, frame alignment, channel bonding, serialization and deserialization, clock-data recovery, and clock generation. For optical transceivers, we show that photonic components and front end drivers only consume a small fraction (<22%) of total serial transceiver power. This implies that major reductions in optical transceiver power can only be obtained by paying attention to the physical layer circuits such as clock recovery and serial-parallel conversions. We propose a burst-mode physical layer protocol suitable for optically switched links that retains the beneficial transmission characteristics of 8b/10b, but, even without power gating and voltage controlled oscillator power optimization, reduces the power consumption during idle periods by 29% compared with a conventional 8b/10b transceiver. We have made the toolkit available to the community at large in the hope of stimulating work in this field.", "paper_title": "Power Optimized Transceivers for Future Switched Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343014100004"}
