Useful properties of graphs with a given disk dimension are derived, leading to an algorithm to obtain an outerplanar subgraph of a graph with disk dimension k by removing at most 2k - 2 vertices. This reduction is used to obtain linear-time exact and approximation algorithms on graphs with fixed disk dimension. In particular, a linear-time approximation algorithm is presented for the pathwidth problem. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
