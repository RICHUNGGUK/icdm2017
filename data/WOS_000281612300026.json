This paper is concerned with the synchronization problem of a general class of stochastic GONs with time delays and Markovian jumping parameters, where the GONs are subject to both the stochastic disturbances and the Markovian parameter switching. The regulatory functions of the addressed GONs are described by the sector-like nonlinear functions. By applying up-to-date 'delay-fractioning' approach for achieving delay-dependent conditions, we construct novel matrix functional to derive the synchronization criteria for the GONs that are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Note that LMIs are easily solvable by the Matlab toolbox. A simulation example is used to demonstrate the synchronization phenomena within biological organisms of a given CON and therefore shows the applicability of the obtained results.
