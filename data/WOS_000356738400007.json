The properties considered for the linear analysis were the load-slip modulus and load carrying capacity. For the non-linear analysis five mathematical models were selected to describe the connection load-slip behavior. The models were fitted to the load-slip curves available in the references. The obtained parameters were subjected to a statistical analysis in order to assess the most adequate statistical distributions. On this analysis the whole set of suitable results available included more than 1000 single test results to have a sample as broad as possible. A chi-square goodness-of-fit with a 5% of significance level were performed to selected distributions, in most of the situations the normal distribution was found to be adequate. Furthermore, for most of the connection types good load-slip descriptions could be obtained with the 3 parameter models. (C) 2015 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
