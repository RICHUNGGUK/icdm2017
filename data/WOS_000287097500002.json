In particular, we analyze and compare several generative approaches widely used for count data clustering, namely multinomial, multinomial Dirichlet, and multinomial generalized Dirichlet mixture models. Moreover, we propose a clustering approach via a mixture model based on a composition of the Liouville family of distributions, from which we select the Beta-Liouville distribution, and the multinomial. The novel proposed model, which we call multinomial Beta-Liouville mixture, is optimized by deterministic annealing expectation-maximization and minimum description length, and strives to achieve a high accuracy of count data clustering and model selection. An important feature of the multinomial Beta-Liouville mixture is that it has fewer parameters than the recently proposed multinomial generalized Dirichlet mixture. The performance evaluation is conducted through a set of extensive empirical experiments, which concern text and image texture modeling and classification and shape modeling, and highlights the merits of the proposed models and approaches.", "paper_title": "Count Data Modeling and Classification Using Finite Mixtures of Distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000287097500002"}
