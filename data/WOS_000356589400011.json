The network will cover all 47 prefectures with 100-Gigabit Ethernet technology and connect each pair of prefectures with a minimized latency. This will enable users to leverage evolving cloud-computing powers as well as draw on a high-performance platform for data-intensive applications. The transmission layer will form a fully meshed, SDN-friendly, and reliable network. The services will evolve to be more dynamic and cloud-oriented in response to user demands. Cyber-security measures for the backbone network and tools for performance acceleration and visualization are also discussed.", "paper_title": "New Directions for a Japanese Academic Backbone Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589400011"}
