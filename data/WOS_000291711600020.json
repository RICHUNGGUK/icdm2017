Then, the corresponding symmetric key is encrypted using the public key cryptosystem. To eliminate this requirement, public key cryptosystems for encrypting long messages have been designed. However, none of the existing public key cryptosystems for long messages is identity-based. In this paper, we give the first identity-based cryptosystem for encrypting long messages. Our cryptosystem is highly efficient in that it only needs 1 bilinear map operation for encrypting a long message. Furthermore, we show that computing any part of the plaintext message encrypted using our cryptosystem is as hard as breaking Boneh and Franklin's standard identity-based cryptosystem, even if the adversary knows all other parts of the message. We also extend our work to achieve chosen ciphertext security.", "paper_title": "AN IDENTITY-BASED CRYPTOSYSTEM FOR ENCRYPTING LONG MESSAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711600020"}
