Given two sets of objects and , a top-k similarity join returns k pairs of most similar objects from . In the conventional model of top-k similarity join processing, an object is usually regarded as a point in a multi-dimensional space and the similarity is measured by some simple distance metrics like Euclidean distance. However, in many applications an object may be described by multiple values (instances) and the conventional model is not applicable since it does not address the distributions of object instances. In this paper, we study top-k similarity join over multi-valued objects. We apply two types of quantile based distance measures, I center dot-quantile distance and I center dot-quantile group-base distance, to explore the relative instance distribution among the multiple instances of objects. Efficient and effective techniques to process top-k similarity joins over multi-valued objects are developed following a filtering-refinement framework. Novel distance, statistic and weight based pruning techniques are proposed. Comprehensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our techniques.", "paper_title": "Efficient top-k similarity join processing over multi-valued objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000331971100001"}
