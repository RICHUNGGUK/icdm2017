By treating the images of both a circle and a sphere as a revolving stick, the introduced algorithm gives the constraint of the imaged absolute conic (IAC) with the help of the projected circle centers. It is also introduced on how to compute the projected circle centers of different calibration objects. Once the projected circle centers are computed, the Euclidean structure then can be determined by the constraint of the IAC. Experiments with simulated and real data are carried out to show the validity of the proposed camera calibration algorithm.", "paper_title": "Applications of projected circle centers in camera calibration", "paper_id": "WOS:000276149200008"}
