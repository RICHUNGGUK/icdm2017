In practice, replacement of G-code based part programs into STEP-NC is a huge task. In this paper, methods to interpret G-code based part programs into STEP-NC code are investigated. G-code is a compact, coded set of numbers for axis movements, while STEP-NC is very comprehensive and includes information about features, operations, strategies, cutting tools, and so on. It is thus very challenging to derive such comprehensive information from the low level G-code information. In this paper, we first clarify what should be given and what may be given, and then present algorithms for deriving STEP-NC information, such as geometric features, operations, etc., from the tool movement (G-code) based on expert reasoning. The algorithms are developed for the turning application. The developed algorithms were implemented and tested on G-code part programs used in actual practice. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
