For this model, we propose a weight learning heuristic which combines the pseudo-inverse approach with a row-shifting schema. The influence of the ratio of random connectivity on retrieval quality and learning time has been studied. Our approach has been successfully tested on a complex pattern, as it is the case of traffic video sequences, for different combinations of the involved parameters. Moreover, it has demonstrated to be robust with respect to highly variable frame activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
