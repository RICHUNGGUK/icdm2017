A second-order-accurate Lax-Wendroff difference scheme for the telegrapher equations for both uniform and nonuniform transmission lines is derived. Based on this scheme, a new method for analyzing lossy multiconductor transmission lines which do not need to be decoupled is presented by combining with matrix operations. Using numerical experiments, the proposed method is compared with the characteristic method, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) approach, and the Lax-Friedrichs technique. With the presented method, a circuit including lossy multiconductor transmission lines is analyzed and the results are consistent with those of PSPICE. The nonlinear circuit including nonuniform lossy multiconductor transmission lines is also computed and the results are verified by HSPICE. The proposed method can be conveniently applied to either linear or nonlinear circuits which include general transmission lines, and is proved to be efficient.", "paper_title": "Time-domain analysis of lossy multiconductor transmission lines based on the Lax-Wendroff technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000291353400010"}
