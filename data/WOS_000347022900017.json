This paper considers the remanufacturing and pricing decisions when both the remanufacturing yield and the demand for remanufactured products are random. Two typical sequential decision strategies are explored: First-Remanufacturing-Then-Pricing (FRTP) and First-Pricing-Then-Remanufacturing (FPTR). The optimal remanufacturing quantity and selling price of the remanufactured product are developed for each strategy, under negligible salvage value and shortage penalty. We also conduct a numerical study to investigate the scenario where the salvage value and shortage penalty are non-negligible, and explore the parameter sensitivity of the systems. We find that FRTP strategy is more preferable for low remanufacturing cost, market-price sensitivity, and variance of demand randomness, and for high shortage penalty, salvage value, and variance of remanufacturing yield; while FRTP strategy is more preferable for the complementary situation.
