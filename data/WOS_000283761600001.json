The surface tension effect is treated as a jump condition at the interface and incorporated into the Navier-Stokes equation via a capillary pressure gradient. The interface is tracked by a coupled level set and volume-of-fluid (CLSVOF) method based on the finite-volume formulation on a fixed Eulerian grid. It has been shown in a stationary benchmark test the spurious currents are greatly reduced and the sharp pressure jump across the interface is well preserved. Numerical instabilities caused by the sharp treatment on a fixed grid are avoided. Several dynamic tests are performed to further validate the accuracy and versatility of the present method, the results of which are in good agreement with data reported in the literature.
