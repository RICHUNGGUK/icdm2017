Prior studies employed the Logit, linear and Tobit regression models to classify the determination of assets impairment and to diagnose the magnitude of the impairment, respectively. However, the drivers of assets write-off are somewhat complicated explicitly or implicitly, these models are unlikely to provide fairly satisfactory results. To improve the diagnosis, the Random Forests model is used for the classification determining and the magnitude diagnosing of assets impairment in this study. The result reveals that the Random Forests model outperforms the Logit and linear regression models in each case with variables selected by individual wrapping approach. This study also demonstrates diagnostic checks for both models with similar selected variables. The results are robust to these various specifications.", "paper_title": "DIAGNOSING ASSETS IMPAIRMENT BY USING RANDOM FORESTS MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000299782600005"}
