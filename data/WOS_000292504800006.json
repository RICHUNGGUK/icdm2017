To ensure the reliability of the system, extensive tests are required. However, enumerating all test cases is infeasible, especially when the tests involve time-consuming hardware operations. To solve this problem, we propose a testing methodology for RFID systems which does not enumerate all test cases but rather those which are representative. A clustering method is adopted in selecting representative test cases. Although a small number of selected test cases are run, we can still obtain a relatively high bug detection rate compared with running the enumerated test cases. Our extensive experiments show the efficiency and effectiveness of our testing methodology.", "paper_title": "Data-driven testing methodology for RFID systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000292504800006"}
