Fundamental conditions for availability of system behaviors of such network systems are clarified in a form of beta-level fixed point theorem for system of fuzzy-set-valued operators. Here, the proof of this theorem is accomplished by the concept of Hausdorff's ball measure of non-compactness introduced into the Banach space.", "paper_title": "A Basic Fuzzy-Estimation Theory for Available Operation of Extremely Complicated Large-Scale Network Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300039"}
