While consonant in dissenting from the conventional wisdom to set the buffer size to the product of the link bitrate and round-trip propagation delay of served connections, the new studies often propose alternative guidelines that starkly contradict each other. In this paper, we review the problem of link buffer sizing from two simulation perspectives. First, we use the packet-level simulator ns-2, which is currently the predominant tool for evaluation of network designs, to explore the contradictions between the buffer sizing guidelines. We attribute the contradictions to differences in assumptions and goals of the earlier studies and present our own argument for using small constant buffer sizes. Second, we reflect on the suitability of ns-2 itself for studying the problem of link buffer sizing. We the identify ns-2 deficiencies that undermine the trustworthiness of results provided by this prevailing simulation tool. We also suggest directions and discuss challenges for designing a simulation methodology capable of providing undisputed answers on link buffer sizing.", "paper_title": "Simulation perspectives on link buffer sizing", "paper_id": "WOS:000250300000004"}
