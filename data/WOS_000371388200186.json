In this paper, a novel radio vortex multiple-input multiple-output (RV-MIMO) system is proposed to provide high capacity in free space. In particular, the vortex channel of the proposed system is modeled. Based on this model, the optimal vortex phase is derived, which results in the optimal capacity of the proposed RV-MIMO system. Simulation results show that the proposed RV-MIMO system could achieve higher capacity than the MIMO system in free space.", "paper_title": "Radio Vortex Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Communication Systems With High Capacity", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200186"}
