BioMercator was the first software offering a complete set of algorithms and visualization tool covering all steps required to perform QTL meta-analysis. Despite several limitations, the software is still widely used. We developed a new version proposing additional up to date methods and improving graphical representation and exploration of large datasets.", "paper_title": "BioMercator V3: an upgrade of genetic map compilation and quantitative trait loci meta-analysis algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000306686400026"}
