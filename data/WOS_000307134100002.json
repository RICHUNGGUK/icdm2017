In this research, we propose a novel iris liveness detection method based on multi-features extracted from multispectral images. First, we analyze the specific multispectral characteristics of conjunctival vessels and iris textures. To ensure the effective utilization of these characteristics, iris images are simultaneously captured at near-infrared (860 nm) and blue (480 nm) wavelengths. Then we respectively define and measure relative number of conjunctival vessels (RNCV) and entropy ratio of iris textures (ERIT) using 860-nm and 480-nm images. Finally, the feature values of RNCV and ERIT are arranged to form a robust 2-D feature vector. The trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify the feature vectors extracted from live and fake irises. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can discriminate between live irises and various types of fake irises with high classification accuracy and low computational cost.
