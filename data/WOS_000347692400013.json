Much progress has been made for the existence of -GDDs of type , especially when is even. The corresponding problem for block size three had been solved by Colbourn et al. (J Comb Theory Ser A 59:73-89, 1992). In this paper, we consider the entire existence problem for such -GDDs. We show that, for each given g, up to a small number of undetermined cases of , the necessary conditions on for the existence of a -GDD of type are also sufficient.", "paper_title": "Group divisible designs with block size four and group type g(u)m(1)", "paper_id": "WOS:000347692400013"}
