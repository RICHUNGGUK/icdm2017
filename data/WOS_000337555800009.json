SOS simulates the symbiotic interaction strategies adopted by organisms to survive and propagate in the ecosystem. Twenty-six unconstrained mathematical problems and four structural engineering design problems are tested and obtained results compared with other well-known optimization methods. Obtained results confirm the excellent performance of the SOS method in solving various complex numerical problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
