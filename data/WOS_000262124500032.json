We use this model to study the traffic dynamics at highway bottlenecks either caused by the restriction of the number of lanes or by on-ramps or off-ramps. The coupling conditions for the Riemann problem of the system are applied in order to treat the interface between different road sections consistently. Our numerical simulations show the appearance of synchronized flow at highway bottlenecks. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
