Serotonin 5-HT6 binding and dopamine antagonism were investigated in separate studies. A set of 5-HT6 binders and non-binders was retrieved from the PDSP K-i database, whereas dopamine antagonists were retrieved from the MeSH Pharmaceutical Action file. The side effect data was extracted from ChemoText, a data repository containing MeSH annotations pulled from MEDLINE records. These side effects profiles were treated as molecular descriptors enabling a QSAR-like approach to build models that could reliably discriminate different classes of molecules, e.g., binders versus non-binders, and dopamine antagonists versus non-antagonists. Selected models with the best external prediction performances were applied to a library of ca. 1000 chemicals with known side effects profiles in order to predict their potential 5-HT6 binding and/or dopamine antagonism. In each case the virtual screening process was able to identify putatively active compounds that through subsequent literature-based validation were found to be likely or known 5-HT6 binders or dopamine antagonists. These results demonstrate that side effect profiles can be utilized to predict a drug's unknown molecular activity, thus representing a valuable opportunity in repositioning the drug for a new indications.", "paper_title": "Drug Side Effect Profiles as Molecular Descriptors for Predictive Modeling of Target Bioactivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000350475300009"}
