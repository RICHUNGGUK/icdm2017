Also being the de-facto standard of data representation and exchange over the Web, XML (eXtensible Markup Language) has been widely applied in Web-based engineering applications for product data exchange and share. It is essential to integrate EXPRESS data model and XML data model in engineering data modeling. EXPRESS-G is the graphical representation of EXPRESS and can serve as the conceptual design of Web-based engineering data models. Fuzzy engineering information is inherent in many engineering activities. In order to explicitly represent and handle fuzzy engineering information, this paper introduces an extended EXPRESS-G data model for different kinds of fuzziness modeling. After presenting the formal descriptions and corresponding representations of the fuzzy EXPRESS-G data model, the paper investigates the formal transformation from the fuzzy EXPRESS-G data model to the fuzzy XML model. The formal transformation approaches proposed in the paper are demonstrated with engineering application examples.", "paper_title": "Extending engineering data model for web-based fuzzy information modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000324343100007"}
