However, the h value, which is a vital parameter in the proceeding of the FLR model, is usually set by the design team subjectively. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach using the FLR models attached with optimized h values to identify the functional relationships in QFD, where the coefficients are assumed as symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers. The h values in the FLR models are determined according to the criterion of maximizing the system credibilities of the FLR models. Furthermore, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. Results of the numerical example show that the fuzzy coefficients obtained through the FLR models with optimized h values are more effective than those obtained through the FLR models with arbitrary h values selected by the design team.
