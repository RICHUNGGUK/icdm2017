This technique takes advantage of a logarithmic transformation that reduces the data variance. However, backtransformed lognormal kriging estimates are biased because the nonbias term is totally dependent on a semivariogram model. This paper proposes a new approach for backtransforming lognormal kriging estimates that not only presents none of the problems reported in the literature but also reproduces the sample histogram and, consequently, the sample mean.", "paper_title": "On unbiased backtransform of lognormal kriging estimates", "paper_id": "WOS:000248624600004"}
