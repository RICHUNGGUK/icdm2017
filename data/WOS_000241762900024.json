We base our work on distance field function method and mainly concentrate on how to simply and uniformly solve the problems of isosurface generation caused by non-manifold surface. Our work includes three main steps: grid adjustment analysis, volume construction and surface construction. In the first step, we present a new method to process non-manifold contour by adaptively adjusting grid size. In the volume construction and the surface construction steps, we use classic distance field function and Marching Cube method respectively. The experiment shows that our algorithm has more realistic results in constructing 3D surface from planar contour.", "paper_title": "Constructing 3D surface from planar contours with grid adjustment analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900024"}
