Actually, environmental assessment methodologies like Life Cycle Assessments reach, in this case, methodological and organisational limits. More generally, the complexity inherent in the design process may put off eco-design initiatives from a lack of organisational management, methods and tools. In this article, we propose a project management methodology to facilitate the integration of eco-design into the design process of complex industrial systems. This methodology is based on continuous improvement and a Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, Control (DMAIC) process. It is then structured around precise team definition, precise milestones, deliverables and phases. A first stage ensures a reliable environmental assessment of the full system and the identification of environmental improvement projects. A second stage allows the independent execution of the most promising improvement projects. A first application is proposed on the Alstom Grid AC/DC (alternative current/direct current) conversion substations for the aluminium industry. A Life Cycle Assessment has been performed with limited resources and has provided rich findings and promising perspectives. It shows in particular that the best environmental configuration of such a complex industrial system depends on external parameters like the implantation site.", "paper_title": "Proposition for an adapted management process to evolve from an unsupervised Life Cycle Assessment of complex industrial systems towards an eco-designing organisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000305465100004"}
