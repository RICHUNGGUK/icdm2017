It is argued, for example, that supertask machines can compute beyond the Turing limit, e.g., compute the halting function. We challenge this assumption. We do not deny that supertask machines can compute beyond the Turing limit. Our claim, rather, is that the (hyper) computational power of these machines is not related to supertasks, but to the \"right kind\" of computational structure.", "paper_title": "Supertasks do not increase computational power", "paper_id": "WOS:000300891600006"}
