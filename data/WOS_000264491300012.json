Especially, the most important issue for practical purposes is how to achieve the interoperability between XML model and relational database model. Until now, various algorithms have been proposed to achieve it. However, existing algorithms do not consider implicit referential integrity relation. VP-T and QP-T have been proposed to resolve the problem - QP-T enhanced VP-T based on query pattern. However, both have a critical restriction that column titles for an attribute are identically represented. Therefore, several referential integrity relations might not be extracted. In this paper, we introduce a novel translation algorithm whose name is WordNet-based Translation algorithm (WB-T) to resolve the above issues. WB-T can check similarity between column titles based on WordNet and extract more exact implicit referential integrity relation than the previous algorithms. WB-T provides improved extraction accuracy and reduces the extraction time.", "paper_title": "WB-T: A WORDNET-BASED TRANSLATION ALGORITHM FOR RDB-TO-XML CONVERSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264491300012"}
