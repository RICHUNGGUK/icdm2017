Blocking behaviors analysis is an effective approach to studying network performance and finding a graceful compromise among hardware costs, blocking probability and crosstalk tolerance; however, little has been done on analyzing the blocking behavior of VSOB networks under crosstalk constraint which adds a new dimension to the switching performance. In this paper, we study the overall blocking behavior of a VSOB network under various degree of crosstalk, where an upper bound on the blocking probability of the network is developed. The upper bound depicts accurately the overall blocking behavior of a VSOB network as verified by extensive simulation results and it agrees with the strictly nonblocking condition of the network. The derived upper bound is significant because it reveals the inherent relationship between blocking probability and network hardware cost, by which a desirable tradeoff can be made between them under various degree of crosstalk constraint. Also, the upper bound shows how crosstalk adds a new dimension to the theory of switching systems.", "paper_title": "A new dimension analysis on blocking behavior in banyan-based optical switching networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000257930400020"}
