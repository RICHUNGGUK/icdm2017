Such assessment activities are typically multi-phase and multi-disciplinary, and generate large amounts of information that need efficient management. During the lifecycle of one building, multiple assessment methods are employed semi-concurrently and with a great deal of information overlap between successive phases. This information is semantically rich and context-dependent, reflecting the local perspective that it exists within. Usage of separate and disconnected tools for each method results in information fragmentation and redundancy, posing problems for well-informed decision making. The objective of this research is to develop an integral reference model, CLIP (Computational support for Lifecycle Integral Performance assessment), that aims to improve the efficiency and quality of existing performance assessment practices. The model provides flexible, modular, and extensible data structures and algorithms for the representation, transformation, integration, and visualization of performance information. The initial results support the CLIP model's ability to deal with the local volatility and variation in the processes and information content that is being managed, while requiring further refinement and extension work to achieve a customized solution to fit in different contextual settings.
