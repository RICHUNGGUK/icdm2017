The interference avoidance performance in terms of BER and bitrate are improved by adding multiple antennas to the system and the use of V-BLAST technique at the receiver. The results show the most promising interference avoidance technique combined with MIMO V-BLAST architecture to be applied in the CR system.", "paper_title": "Cognitive radio with single carrier TDCS and multicarrier OFDM approach with V-BLAST receiver in rayleigh fading channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000259482600002"}
