We propose a novel noniterative, nonlinear, and space-variant descreening filter that removes a wide range of Moire-causing screen frequencies in a scanned document while preserving image sharpness and edge detail. This filter is inspired by Perona-Malik's anisotropic diffusion equation. The amount of diffusion of the image intensity resulting from applying the filter is governed by an edge intensity estimate that is robust under halftone noise. More precisely, the filter extracts a spatial feature vector comprising local intensity gradients estimated from a local window in a presmoothed version of the noisy input image. Tunable nonlinear polynomial functions of this feature vector are then used to perform one iteration of a discrete diffusion controlled by the intensity gradient. The polynomial functions and feature extraction kernels are selected empirically in order to minimize computation while ensuring robust performance across a wide range of test images on a target imaging platform. The algorithm uses integer arithmetic, mostly relying on low-cost bit-wise shift and addition operations, and uses a strictly sequential architecture to provide a cost-effective and robust descreening solution in practical imaging devices including copiers and multifunction printers. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to other descreening solutions and demonstrate that the new algorithm improves quality over the existing methods while reducing computation.", "paper_title": "Hardware-Friendly Descreening", "paper_id": "WOS:000274732000016"}
