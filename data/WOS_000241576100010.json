In John Searle's philosophical work on social reality, this coordinator articulates the struggle to create and maintain the status functions and collective intentionality required for successful data sharing. Each technical solution to data sharing can fail to ensure that the meaning of the shared data is understood. Data sharing must move one rung higher and become information sharing, which requires the collective recognition of status functions and the creation of collective intentionality. Integral to successful information sharing is the creation of an environment of trust that ensures that function recognition occurs. In this paper I examine cases that highlight trust as a measure of status function recognition.", "paper_title": "Status functions, collective intentionality: Matters of trust for geospatial information sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241576100010"}
