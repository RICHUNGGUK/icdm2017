It will be shown that corresponding filter banks possess the special structure, and the parametrization of filter banks is present. Moreover, we show that when considering tight frame systems with two generators, the Ron-Shen's continuous-linear-spline-based tight frame is the only one with totally interpolating property and symmetry. But in the dual frame context, more good examples of bi-frames with symmetric/antisymmetric property can be obtained and constructed, which in particular, include frames with the uniform symmetry.", "paper_title": "Constructing totally interpolating wavelet frame systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000355330800005"}
