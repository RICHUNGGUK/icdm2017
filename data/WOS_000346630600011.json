We propose a very accurate strategy to overcome this challenge. Its core concept is the conversion of the model into the format of biochemical systems theory (BST), which greatly facilitates the computation of sensitivities. First, the steady state of interest is determined by integrating the model equations toward the steady state and then using a Newton-Raphson method to fine-tune the result. The second step of conversion into the BST format requires several instances of numerical differentiation. The accuracy of this task is ensured by the use of a complex-variable Taylor scheme for all differentiation steps. The proposed strategy is implemented in a new software program, COSMOS, which automates the stability and sensitivity analysis of essentially arbitrary ODE models in a quick, yet highly accurate manner. The methods underlying the process are theoretically analyzed and illustrated with four representative examples: a simple metabolic reaction model; a model of aspartate-derived amino acid biosynthesis; a TCA-cycle model; and a modified TCA-cycle model.
