The DPP is a large-scale real-world problem for which analytical models do not exist. We propose a model for solving the problem and develop a solution methodology which involves an effective use of relaxation and restriction that significantly speeds up a CPLEX-based branch-and-bound. The solution times for intermediate-sized problems are around 1 h at maximum, whereas it takes about a week in the Turkish Armed Forces to produce a suboptimal feasible solution based on trial-and-error methods. The proposed model can be used to evaluate and assess investment decisions in transportation infrastructure and transportation assets as well as to plan and execute cost-effective deployment operations at different levels of planning.
