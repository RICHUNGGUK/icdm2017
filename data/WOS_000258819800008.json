This approach overcomes the limitation of prior Green function-based methods and allows extraction of substrate parasitics in the presence of sinkers, trenches, and wells. A careful use of volume and boundary-element meshing, as well as discrete transforms, yields a technique that is computationally efficient. The accuracy of the method is comparable to that of 3-D semiconductor device simulators with significantly smaller computational costs.", "paper_title": "Extraction of parasitics in inhomogeneous substrates with a new Green function-based method", "paper_id": "WOS:000258819800008"}
