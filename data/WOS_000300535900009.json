Deployment of multiple sinks is a candidate solution for congestion and is also promising in terms of reliability and energy-efficiency. In order to gain the maximum benefit from multiple sinks, it is essential to distribute the load among them evenly. In this paper, we propose a cross layer geographic forwarding scheme MLBRF (Multi-Sink Load Balanced Reliable Forwarding) which aims to provide reliable and energy efficient video delivery in a multi-sinked sensor network for target tracking. In order to provide load balancing among the sinks. MLBRF proposes a sink selection mechanism based on fuzzy logic for the frame forwarding which evaluates the traffic density in the direction of each sink by combining two dynamic criteria which are the number of contenders and the buffer occupancy levels in the neighborhood with the static distance criterion. The performance of the fuzzy sink selection mechanism is compared using simulation with various sink selection mechanisms. The results show that MLBRF gains the maximum benefit from deploying multiple sinks in terms of reliability, latency and energy efficiency by using the proposed fuzzy sink selection mechanism.
