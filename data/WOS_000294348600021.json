The crude form holds whenever the process N (adm) of customers admitted to service has a linear asymptote, and then (var N (dep) (0,t])/t and (var N (adm)(0,t])/t share a common limit (that may be infinite) in stationary G/G/k/K systems. A standard integral formula for the variance of a stationary orderly point process shows that, if N (dep) is a renewal process whose generic lifetime X has finite second moment, then B (1)=(var X)/([E(X)](2)), and the more detailed linear asymptote holds when E(X (3)) is finite. Geometric ergodicity of the queue size process Q(a <...) in stationary M/M/k/K systems establishes that the more detailed linear asymptote is true for them. It is conjectured that var N(0,t]similar to B (1) t for any stationary point process N possessing an embedded regenerative structure.", "paper_title": "Revisiting queueing output processes: a point process viewpoint", "paper_id": "WOS:000294348600021"}
