Hence each job and machine are labelled with the GoS levels, and each job can be processed by a particular machine only when the GoS level of the job is not less than that of the machine. The goal is to minimize the makespan. In this paper, we consider the problem with two GoS levels. It assumes that the GoS levels of the first k machines and the last m - k machines are 1 and 2, respectively, and every job has a GoS level of I alternatively or 2. We first prove the lower bound of the problem under consideration is at least 2. Then we discuss the performance of algorithm AW presented in [2] for the problem and show it has a tight bound of 4 - 1/m. Finally, We present an approximation algorithm with a competitive ratio of 12+4 root 2/7 approximate to 2.522.", "paper_title": "Online scheduling on parallel machines with two GoS levels", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454600003"}
