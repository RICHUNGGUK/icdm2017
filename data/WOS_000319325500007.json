A batch processing machine can process several jobs simultaneously as long as its capacity is not exceeded. The processing times and sizes of jobs are non-identical. The processing time of a batch is given by the longest job in the batch. Machines have different speeds and each machine works at a consistent rate. The problem under study is NP-hard. Thus, several heuristics are proposed. An algorithm batching rule (BR) is designed to balance the release times and processing times when it is employed to form batches. After the batches are formed, a heuristic Assignment Rule for Uniform parallel Machines is developed to schedule them on uniform parallel machines. A lower bound is also presented to evaluate the performance of the algorithms via computational experiments. The results show that the problem can be solved effectively and the heuristic Best Fit Longest Processing Time improved by BR outperforms other heuristics.", "paper_title": "Heuristics to schedule uniform parallel batch processing machines with dynamic job arrivals", "paper_id": "WOS:000319325500007"}
