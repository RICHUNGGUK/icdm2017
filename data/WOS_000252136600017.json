The biological background of the protein structure prediction, the Levinthal paradox and HP model are firstly revised. Subsequently the evolutionary algorithm, memetic algorithm, ant colony optimization algorithm, tabu search, self organizing map-based iterative approaches and the typical chain growth computing approaches are reviewed. The advantages/disadvantages of various computing approaches and the current optimal results are introduced. Finally, the promising model and computing approaches are discussed.
