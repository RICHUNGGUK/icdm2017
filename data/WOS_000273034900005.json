The characteristic of the received signal when the target has 3-D rotation is studied, and it is approximated as multi-component amplitude modulated and frequency modulated (AM-FM) signal. Then a new algorithm for the adaptive Chirplet decomposition is presented to analyze the AM-FM signal, and the high quality instantaneous ISAR images are obtained based on the Range-Instantaneous-Doppler (RID) algorithm. The results of simulated and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the method proposed.", "paper_title": "ISAR imaging for three-dimensional rotation targets based on adaptive Chirplet decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000273034900005"}
