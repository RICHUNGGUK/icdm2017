For doing so, we present the fuzzy probabilistic ordered weighted averaging (FPOWA) operator. It is an aggregation operator that unifies the fuzzy probabilistic aggregation and the fuzzy OWA (FOWA) operator in the same formulation considering the degree of importance that each concept has in the analysis. We study its applicability and we see that it is very broad because all the previous studies that use the probability or the OWA operator can be revised and extended with this new approach. We focus on a multi-person decision making problem that unifies risk and uncertain environments in the same formulation. We implement this approach in a political management problem regarding the selection of fiscal policies.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Multi-Person Decision Making with Fuzzy Probabilistic Aggregation Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000296658700002"}
