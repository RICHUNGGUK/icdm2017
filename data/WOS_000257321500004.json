We first consider ternary trees having a reflexive symmetry and we relate all symmetric combinatorial objects by means of bijection. We then generalize the symmetric structures and correspondences to an infinite family of symmetric objects.", "paper_title": "On symmetric structures of order two", "paper_id": "WOS:000257321500004"}
