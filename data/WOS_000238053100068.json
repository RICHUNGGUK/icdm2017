The selection of effective chromatic combinations and the relation of color to the perceived aesthetic and emotional value, of a web site is the focus of this paper. The subject of the reported research has been to define a model through which to be able to associate color combinations with specific desirable emotional and aesthetic values. The presented approach involves application of machine learning techniques on a rich data set collected during a number of empirical studies.", "paper_title": "Modeling perceived value of color in web sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100068"}
