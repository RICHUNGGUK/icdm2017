The proposed approaches of statistical inferences are fuzzy least squares (FLS) method and bootstrap technique. FLS is constructed on the basis of minimizing the sum of square of the total difference between observed and estimated outputs. Numerical examples are illustrated to perform the hypotheses test and to provide the percentile confidence regions by proposed approach.", "paper_title": "The statistical inferences of fuzzy regression based on bootstrap techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000351408300009"}
