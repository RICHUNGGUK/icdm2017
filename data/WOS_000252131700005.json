Since the overall performance of such distributed systems often depends on the efficiency of their communication networks, performance analysis of the interconnection networks for such distributed systems is paramount. In this paper, we develop an analytical model, under non-uniform traffic and in the presence of communication locality, for the m-port n-tree family interconnection networks commonly employed in large-scale cluster computing systems. We use the proposed model to study two widely used interconnection networks flow control mechanism namely the wormhole and store&forward. The proposed analytical model is validated through. comprehensive simulation. The results of the simulation demonstrated that the proposed model exhibits a good degree of accuracy for various system organizations and under different working conditions.
