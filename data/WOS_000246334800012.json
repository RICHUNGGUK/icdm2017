We propose a new feedback control method to control the flow of the ABR traffic. In this method, the ABR source has multiple states and the number of cells transmitted by the ABR source is controlled by the feedback based on the congestion state of the buffer. By using the Markov chain method, we establish a tractable analytical model for the system. We give some iterative formulas for calculating the transition probabilities. Then, based on the analysis, we calculate the cell loss probability and the utilization of the network system. The impact of several parameters on the system performance is presented through some numerical results.
