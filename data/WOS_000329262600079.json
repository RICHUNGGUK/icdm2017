Under these circumstances, the different ordinates of the angular flux are mutually coupled. We explore here the use of a parallel sweep-based block diagonal pre-conditioner as a complement of the GMRES solver on the solution of the discretization matrix (which includes all the inter-ordinate couplings). The validity of this approach, when compared to the standard source iteration scheme, is successfully assessed for a significant range of the coupling parameters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
