Most researches that have pursued this goal consider only requests expressed in English. A way to facilitate the use of several languages in natural language systems is by using an interlingua. An interlingua is an intermediary representation for natural language information that can be processed by machines. We propose to convert natural language requests into an interlingua [universal networking language (UNL)] and to execute these requests using software components. In order to achieve this goal, we propose OntoMap, an ontology-based architecture to perform the semantic mapping between UNL sentences and software components. OntoMap also performs component search and retrieval based on semantic information formalized in ontologies and rules.", "paper_title": "OntoMap: an ontology-based architecture to perform the semantic mapping between an interlingua and software components", "paper_id": "WOS:000275444000003"}
