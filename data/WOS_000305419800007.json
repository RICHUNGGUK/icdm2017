Given a weighted gene network and a gene in this network, the goal of an inference algorithm is to identify the potential regulatory pathways passing through this gene. Results: In a departure from previous approaches that largely rely on the random walk model, we propose a novel single-source k-shortest paths based algorithm to address this inference problem. An important element of our approach is to explicitly account for and enhance the diversity of paths discovered by our algorithm. The intuition here is that diversity in paths can help enrich different functions and thereby better position one to understand the underlying system-of-interest. Results on the yeast gene network demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach over extant state-of-the-art inference algorithms. Beyond utility, our algorithm achieves a significant speedup over these baselines.", "paper_title": "A single source k-shortest paths algorithm to infer regulatory pathways in a gene network", "paper_id": "WOS:000305419800007"}
