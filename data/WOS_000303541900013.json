It is found that both Au (2) (-) and AuAg- dimers catalyze the reaction according to the similar mono-center Eley-Rideal mechanism. The catalytic reaction is of the multi-channel and multi-step characteristic, which can proceed along four possible pathways via two or three elementary steps. In AuAg-, the Au site is more active than the Ag site, and the calculated energy barrier values for the rate-determining step of the Au-site catalytic reaction are remarkably smaller than those for both the Ag-site catalytic reaction and the Au (2) (-) catalytic reaction. The better catalytic activity of bimetallic AuAg- dimer is attributed to the synergistic effect between Au and Ag atom. The present results provide valuable information for understanding the higher catalytic activity of Au-Ag nanoparticles and nanoalloys for low-temperature CO oxidation than either pure metallic catalyst.", "paper_title": "A comparative theoretical study of the catalytic activities of Au (2) (-) and AuAg- dimers for CO oxidation", "paper_id": "WOS:000303541900013"}
