The Poisson equation relating the fluid vorticity and velocity is solved using Fast Fourier Transforms subject to free space boundary conditions. Solid boundaries are implemented using the semi-implicit formulation of Brinkman penalization and we show that the penalization can be carried out as a simple interpolation. We validate the implementation against the analytic solution to the Perlman test case and by free-space simulations of the onset flow around fixed and rotating circular cylinders and bluff body flows around bridge sections.
