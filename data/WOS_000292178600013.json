In this work, using phase space reconstruction in order to classify five heartbeat types can fill this gap to some extent. In the first and second method, Reconstructed phase space (RPS) is modeled by the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and bins, respectively, and then classified by classic Bayesian classifier. In the third method, RPS is directly used to train predictor time-delayed neural networks (TDNN) and classified based on minimum prediction error. All three methods highly outperform the results reported before, for patient independent heartbeat classification. The best result is achieved using GMM-Bayes method with 92.5% classification accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
