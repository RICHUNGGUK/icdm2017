This is, to our knowledge, the largest web-based application deployment of PLT Scheme. Our experiences developing with PLT Scheme show that deficiencies in the existing infrastructure can be easily overcome, and we can exploit advanced language features to improve productivity. We conclude that PLT Scheme makes an excellent platform for developing web-based applications, and is competitive with more mainstream choices.", "paper_title": "Experience report: Scheme in commercial web application development", "paper_id": "WOS:000253409900017"}
