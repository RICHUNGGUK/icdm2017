However, spatially explicit ecosystem simulations over large landscape present computational challenges. This paper presents a framework to support spatially explicit agroecosystem modeling and data analysis over large landscape, which includes four major phases of agroecosystem simulation: simulation data preparation, site-based simulation on high performance computers, data management and data analysis. Then, a case study on a regional intensive modeling area (RIMA) was presented as an application to demonstrate the system implementation and capability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
