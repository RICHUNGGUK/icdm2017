Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art approach, which estimates the relative importance of the single feature dimensions still suffers from low matching accuracy and high time cost. To this end, this paper proposes a novel cross-domain visual matching framework leveraging multiple feature representations. To integrate the discriminative power of multiple features, we develop a data-driven, query specific feature fusion model, which estimates the relative importance of the individual feature dimensions as well as the weight vector among multiple features simultaneously. Moreover, to alleviate the computational burden of an exhaustive subimage search, we design a speedup scheme, which employs hyperplane hashing for rapidly collecting the hard-negatives. Extensive experiments carried out on various matching tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in both accuracy and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Accurate and efficient cross-domain visual matching leveraging multiple feature representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000319478400011"}
