The consensus controller is developed by combining the graph theory and stochastic tools. The control input for each agent relies on its own state and its neighbours' states corrupted by noises, the noises are considered proportional to the relative distance between agents, both of the noisy case and the noise-free case are studied, and conditions to achieve mean square convergence under noisy measurement and asymptotic convergence in absence of noises are derived. Finally, in order to prove the validity of the consensus control, some simulations were carried out.", "paper_title": "Leader-following consensus for single-integrator multi-agent systems with multiplicative noises in directed topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000357938800010"}
