It can apply a different inheritance pattern or a de novo mutations discovery model to each family and select single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions segregating in each family or shared by multiple families. It also provides a variety of variant annotations and retains and annotates all transcripts hit by a single variant. Excel-compatible outputs including all annotated variants segregating in each family or shared by multiple families will be provided for users to prioritize variants based on their customized thresholds. A list of genes that harbor the segregating variants will be provided as well for possible pathway/network analyses. FamAnn uses the de facto community standard Variant Call Format as the input format and can be applied to whole exome, genome or targeted resequencing data.", "paper_title": "FamAnn: an automated variant annotation pipeline to facilitate target discovery for family-based sequencing studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000335001000017"}
