A close-loop integrated frame for target-assignment is proposed novelly which incorporates the kinematics between flight vehicles and targets. Based on an integral performance index which represents the energy cost, the optimal switching assignment-plan is obtained. Considering the configuration variation introduced by a switching assignment-plan, an H. guidance law with switching-target is proposed which underlays a dynamic assignment process in cooperative tracking. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed guidance-law and the switching-plan for target assignment.", "paper_title": "Optimal switching target-assignment based on the integral performance in cooperative tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000314426900010"}
