Temporal patterns are identified by detecting abrupt increases of frequencies of noun phrases extracted from titles and abstracts of DKE papers over time. Conceptual structures of the subject domain are identified by clustering analysis. Concept maps and network visualizations are presented to illustrate salient patterns and emerging thematic trends. A variety of statistics are reported to highlight key contributors and DKE papers that have made profound impacts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
