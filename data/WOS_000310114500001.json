The resulting system preserves all couplings between rigid and elastic motions and can be projected onto a few vibration modes of a reference configuration. This gives equations of motion with cubic terms in the rigid-body degrees of freedom and constant coefficients which can be pre-computed prior to the time-marching simulation. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the approach and to show its advantages with respect to mean-axes approximations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
