Such competition is characterized by proliferation-destruction phenomena and the interacting entities are characterized by a microscopic state which is modified by interactions. The model also includes the description of the natural trend of immune cells to reach a healthy or sentinel level, even when they have been involved in the competition with the tumor cells. The model is developed in the mathematical framework of the kinetic theory for active particles. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
