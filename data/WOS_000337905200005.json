The system is equipped with dynamic thermal management through a cooling subsystem which can switch between two cooling modes. Real-time jobs which arrive to the system have stochastic properties and are prone to soft errors. A successful job is one that enters the system and completes its execution with no timing or soft error. Appropriateness of the system is evaluated based on its performance, temperature behavior, reliability, and energy consumption. It is noteworthy that these criteria have mutual interactions to each other: the stochastic nature of the system affects the success ratio of jobs beside the system dynamic power, the leakage as well as dynamic power impacts the processor temperature, this temperature affects the leakage power, the cooling subsystem power, and the soft error rate, which the latter in turn impacts the system reliability and the success ratio of jobs. This paper proposes an analytical evaluation method with a Markovian view to the system which considers these reciprocal effects. A number of simulation experiments are carried out to validate the accuracy of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Analytical Leakage-Aware Thermal Modeling of a Real-Time System", "paper_id": "WOS:000337905200005"}
