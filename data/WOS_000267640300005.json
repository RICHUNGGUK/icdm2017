In experiments, in most cases, via assignment and global routing on both of layers in which all nets are realized and the violation of wire congestion on layer I is small are speedily obtained.", "paper_title": "Routability Driven Via Assignment Method for 2-Layer Ball Grid Array Packages", "paper_id": "WOS:000267640300005"}
