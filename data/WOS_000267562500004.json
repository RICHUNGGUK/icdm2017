The countries are clustered into four groups with respect to their relative country sizes with an application of Fuzzy c-Means clustering technique. The novelty of this approach is that it is an unsupervised method that generates membership values between zero and one instead of binary values that take values of zero or one only. In addition to this it has the advantages of its tolerance to imprecise data and the ease of understanding. The results show that the saving retention coefficients are greater for larger countries except for the cluster which contains the largest country. Thus, this work presents only partial evidence that the country size affects the relationship of domestic saving and investment. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
