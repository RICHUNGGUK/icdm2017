The performance of the SARASOM is evaluated and compared with the Elman network as well as with a hidden Markov model (HMM) in a number of prediction tasks using sequences of letters, including some experiments with a reduced lexicon of 15 words. The results were very encouraging with the SARASOM learning better and performing with better accuracy than both the Elman network and the HMM.", "paper_title": "SARASOM: a supervised architecture based on the recurrent associative SOM", "paper_id": "WOS:000355765200007"}
