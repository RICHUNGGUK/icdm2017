To take the full solid-fluid interactions into account, a novel modeling approach for colloidal particles, called pseudo-solid model (PSM) is introduced in the framework of lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for multi-component fluids. A typical phenomenon in the fluid layer due to the lateral capillary forces, namely the attraction of two colloidal particles with the same affinity is numerically demonstrated, while the influence of particle distance and surface tension as well as the so-called many-body effects are investigated. Furthermore, the formation of self-assemblies of colloidal particles on the substrate is simulated under different coverage ratios and interfacial tensions. Results show good agreement with previous studies, proving the potential of LB-PSM as a simulation model to provide further insight into the self-organizing process of colloidal particles.
