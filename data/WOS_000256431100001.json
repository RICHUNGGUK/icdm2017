Let mas(D) denote the maximum size of an induced acyclic subgraph in D. We obtain tight concentration results on the size of mas(D). Precisely, we show that mas(D) <= 2/ln(1-p)(-1) (ln np + 3e) almost surely, provided p >= W/n for some fixed constant W. This combined with known and new lower bounds shows that (for p satisfying p = omega(1/ n) and p <= 0.5) mas(D) = 2(ln np)/ln(1-p)(-1) (1 +/- o(1)). This proves a conjecture stated by Subramanian in 2003 for those p such that p = omega(1/n). Our results are also valid for the random digraph obtained by choosing each of the n(n-1) directed edges independently with probability p.", "paper_title": "On the size of induced acyclic subgraphs in random digraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000256431100001"}
