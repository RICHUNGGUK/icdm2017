First, the sliding surface is designed based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Then, we analyze the mechanism of chattering for the discrete-time exponential approximation law, a modified one is presented and applied to the network systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller has good stability and robustness with respect to the uncertainties of the number of active TCP sessions, link capacity and the round-trip time.", "paper_title": "Design of Congestion Control Scheme for Uncertain Discrete Network Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000327050700012"}
