Healthcare informatics researchers believe that such systems hold great promise for improving the efficiency of medical organizations. We surveyed 216 medical practice adopters of electronic purchasing, to assess the post-adoption benefits following system assimilation. Results showed that Internet-based purchasing applications had a positive impact on both claims management and operational performance outcomes. Moreover, we found that compatibility, facilitating conditions, the IT infrastructure, and preference item purchasing were necessary antecedents to effective Internet-based purchasing application assimilation.
