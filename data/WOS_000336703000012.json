Most of the existing approaches do not distinguish among different available verification routes. Moreover, to ensure stronger security, it is important to choose an appropriate metric to evaluate the strength of a route. Besides, all of the existing self-organized approaches use certificate-chains for achieving authentication, which are highly resource consuming. In this paper, we present a self-organized certificate-less on-demand public key management (CLPKM) protocol, which aims at providing the strongest verification routes for authentication purposes. It restricts the compromise probability for a verification route by restricting its length. Besides, we evaluate the strength of a verification route using its end-to-end trust value. The other important aspect of the protocol is that it uses a MAC function instead of RSA certificates to perform public key verifications. By doing this, the protocol saves considerable computation power, bandwidth and storage space. We have used an extended strand space model to analyze the correctness of the protocol. The analytical, simulation, and the testbed implementation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
