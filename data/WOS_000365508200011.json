A multifactor life model of a large-scale BESS containing four factors, charge/discharge rate, times, T-C/D, and temperature, is developed, which has taken into account the cell series/parallel effects and BESS operational characteristics. A comprehensive evaluation system including BESS aging level (BAL), energy loss index (ELI), and tracking inaccuracy index (TII) is proposed, and the relationships between T-C/D and the three indices are discussed. In order to combine the advantages of low BAL and low ELI under long T-C/D and low TII under short T-C/D, a fuzzy controller is designed to regulate T-C/D in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by actual data from a wind farm in eastern China.", "paper_title": "Variable charge/discharge time-interval control strategy of BESS for wind power dispatch", "paper_id": "WOS:000365508200011"}
