The response surface is found using an iterative algorithm and the probability of failure is evaluated using the first-order and the second-order reliability method (FORM/SORM). Independent standard normal variables in U-space are chosen as basic random variables and transformed into correlated non-normal variables in the original space of random variables for constructing the response surface. The proposed method is first illustrated for a circular tunnel with analytical solutions considering Mohr-Coulomb (M-C) and Hoek-Brown (H-B) yield criteria separately. The failure probability with respect to the plastic zone criterion and the tunnel convergence criterion are estimated from FORM/SORM and compared to those obtained from Monte Carlo Simulations. The results show that the support pressure has great influence on the failure probability of the two failure modes. For the M-C model, the hypothesis of uncorrelated friction angle and cohesion will generate higher non-performance probability in comparison to the case of negatively correlated shear strength parameters. Reliability analyses involving non-normal distributions are also investigated. Finally, an example of a horseshoe-shaped highway tunnel is presented to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method for practical applications where numerical procedures are needed to calculate the performance function values.
