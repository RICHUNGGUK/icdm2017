Typically, components of a parallel application will contend for the use of resources among themselves and with entities external to the application, such as other processes running in the computers of the cluster. The performance modeling approach should be able to represent these sources of contention and to produce an estimate of the execution time, preferably in polynomial time. This paper presents a polynomial time static performance prediction approach in which the prediction takes the form of an interval of values instead of a single value. The extra information given by an interval of values represents the variability of the underlying environment more accurately, as indicated by the practical examples presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
