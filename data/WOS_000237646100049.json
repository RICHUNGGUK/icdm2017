Currently, plentiful signal traffics for handover and handover delay due to it have been proposed as a hot issue in the MIPv6. Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) is designed to reduce the signaling load and handover latency. However, HMIPv6 only improves local mobility while the handover delay still occurs in the handover between mobility anchor points. In this paper, we propose an efficient binding update scheme to reduce signaling cost and handover latency in the HMIPv6. Especially, a signal message from a MN contains another signal message, which allows the MN to originate only the half of signal messages in home registration process, compared to original protocol. The improvements contributed by the proposed scheme over the basic HMIPv6 are shown to be significant.", "paper_title": "An efficient binding update scheme in HMIPv6", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100049"}
