The prediction of cooperative gene regulation is accomplished by either Gaussian Graphical Models or Pairwise Mixed Graphical Models. The proposed framework was tested on yeast cell cycle datasets: (1) 54 known yeast cell cycle genes with 9 cell cycle regulators and (2) 676 putative yeast cell cycle genes with 9 cell cycle regulators. The new framework gave promising results on inferring TF-TF and TF-gene interactions. It also revealed several interesting mechanisms such as negatively correlated protein-protein interactions and low affinity protein-DNA interactions that may be important during the yeast cell cycle. The new framework may easily be extended to study other higher eukaryotes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
