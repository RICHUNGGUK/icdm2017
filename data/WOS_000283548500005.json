The new method is called statCap, where orthogonal polynomials are used to represent the statistical processes in a deterministic way. We first show how the variational potential coefficient matrix is represented in a first-order form using Taylor expansion and orthogonal decomposition. Then, an augmented potential coefficient matrix, which consists of the coefficients of the polynomials, is derived. After this, corresponding augmented system is solved to obtain the variational capacitance values in the orthogonal polynomial form. Finally, we present a method to extend statCap to the second-order form to give more accurate results without loss of efficiency compared to the linear models. We show the derivation of the analytic second-order orthogonal polynomials for the variational capacitance integral equations. Experimental results show that statCap is two orders of magnitude faster than the recently proposed statistical capacitance extraction method based on the spectral stochastic collocation approach and many orders of magnitude faster than the Monte Carlo method for several practical conductor structures.", "paper_title": "Variational Capacitance Extraction and Modeling Based on Orthogonal Polynomial Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000283548500005"}
