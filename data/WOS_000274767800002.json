It can provide security well beyond content privacy and integrity. The scientific studies of anonymous communications are largely originated from Chaum's two seminal approaches: mixnet and DC-net. In this paper, we present an overview of the research in this field. We start with the basic definitions of anonymous communications, We then describe the cryptographic primitives, the network protocols, and some of the representative anonymous communication systems. We also describe verifiable mixnets and their applications to electronic voting. Finally, we briefly cite some other anonymous systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
