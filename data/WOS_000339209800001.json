The load balancing in the network alongside the congestion is another major problem in mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing due to difference in link cost of the route. Most of the existing routing protocols provide solutions to load balancing or congestion adaptivity separately. In this paper, a congestion adaptive routing along with load balancing, that is, load balanced congestion adaptive routing (LBCAR), has been proposed. Transferring of load from congested nodes to less busy nodes and involvement of other nodes in transmission that can take part in route can improve the overall network life. In the proposed protocol two metrics, traffic load density and link cost associated with a routing path, have been used to determine the congestion status. The route with low traffic load density and maximum life time is selected for packet transmission using this protocol. Performance of the network using LBCAR has been analyzed and compared with congestion adaptive routing protocol (CRP) for packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and normalized routing overhead.", "paper_title": "Load Balanced Congestion Adaptive Routing for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339209800001"}
