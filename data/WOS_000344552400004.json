Nowadays, application of specific high-performance computing techniques for signal processing in communication systems is receiving considerable attention. In this paper, we present an accelerated and efficient iterative receiver, which has been implemented following two strategies. First, we reduce the computational cost using parallelized algorithms executed on graphics processing unit. In addition, our receiver allows the selection between two types of detectors with different complexity and performance. The selection can be done to fulfill a given compromise between bit error rate and power consumption.", "paper_title": "A GPU implementation of an iterative receiver for energy saving MIMO ID-BICM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344552400004"}
