Realizing this vision is challenging though as SDN proposals to date req require substantial and expensive changes to the existing network architecture before the benefits cart be realized. As a result, the number of SDN deployments has been rather limited in scope. To kickstart wide-scale SDN deployment, there is a. need for low-risk, high return solutions that solve a. timely problem. As one possible solution, we show how we can significantly improve the performance of legacy IP routers, i.e. \"supercharge\" by CC/111bl ling then i with SDN-enabled devices. In this abstract, we supercharge one particular aspect of the router performance: its convergence time after a. link or a node failure.", "paper_title": "Supercharge me: Boost Router Convergence with SDN", "paper_id": "WOS:000370556200042"}
