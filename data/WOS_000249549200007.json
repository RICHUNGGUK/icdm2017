The exact variance large-sample method is examined and explicit formulas are derived for observations from uniform, normal and Laplace distributions. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the exact variance procedure and compare its performance with two simplified approximations that have been suggested in the statistical literature. From the simulation results, it is evident that the exact variance approach is more accurate than the two approximate methods. To facilitate practical use, tabulated values of the estimated sample sizes are provided.", "paper_title": "Power and sample size determinations for theWilcoxon signed-rank test", "paper_id": "WOS:000249549200007"}
