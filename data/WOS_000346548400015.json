In order to ensure that the quality of ICT standards is well developed, it is important that these standards and standardization procedures meet certain requirements. This study reviews standardization research in terms of the process of standardization, innovation, and the demand-supply perspective. It draws implications that standards will be one of the important tools for national economic growth and for unconventional strategies of businesses. The analyses, based on the demand-supply framework, finally suggest promising opportunities for potential researchers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
