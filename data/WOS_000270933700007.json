For the location estimation method, we adopted the calibration model. By applying the Adaptive Zone Based K-NNSS (AZ-NNSS) algorithm, which considers the velocity of devices, this paper presents a 9% improvement of accuracy compared to the existing K-NNSS-based research, with 37% of the K-NNSS computation load. The accuracy is further enhanced by using a Kalman filter; the improvement was about 24%. This research also shows the level of accuracy that can be achieved by replacing a subset of the calibration data with values computed by a numerical equation, and suggests a reasonable number of calibration points. In addition, we use both the mean error distance (MED) and hit ratio to evaluate the accuracy of location estimation, while avoiding a biased comparison.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Location Estimation and Reducing Computation using Adaptive Zone Based K-NNSS Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000270933700007"}
