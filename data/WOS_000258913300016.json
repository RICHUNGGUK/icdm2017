An elastically deformable model algorithm that establishes correspondence among a set of faces is proposed first and then bilinear models that decouple the identity and facial expression factors are constructed. Fitting these models to unknown faces enables us to perform face recognition invariant to facial expressions and facial expression recognition with unknown identity. A quantitative evaluation of the proposed technique is conducted on the publicly available BU-3DFE face database in comparison with our previous work on face recognition and other state-of-the-art algorithms for facial expression recognition. Experimental results demonstrate an overall 90.5% facial expression recognition rate and an 86% rank-1 face recognition rate.", "paper_title": "Bilinear models for 3-D face and facial expression recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000258913300016"}
