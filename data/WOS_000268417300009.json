If sensing error is unacceptably high, we can reduce the number of working channels so as to improve the channels-vs.-sensing nodes ratio, and undertake differential or split sensing in which subsets of sensing nodes target idle and active channels, respectively. The paper presents a probabilistic analysis of the sensing process, including the split sensing policy, and investigates the range of values in which such, incomplete sensing is capable of maintaining an accurate view of the status of the working channel set.
