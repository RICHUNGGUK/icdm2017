We have benchmarked Endeavour using 450 pathway maps and 826 disease marker sets from MetaCore (TM) of GeneGo, Inc. containing a total of 9911 and 12 432 genes, respectively. We obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.97 for pathway and of 0.91 for disease gene sets. These results indicate that Endeavour can be used to efficiently prioritize candidate genes for pathways and diseases.", "paper_title": "Large-scale benchmark of Endeavour using MetaCore maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000280263400024"}
