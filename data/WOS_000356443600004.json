In patients with epilepsy, TMS can induce epileptiform discharges (EDs) with a stochastic occurrence despite constant stimulation parameters. This observation raises the possibility that the pre-stimulation period contains multiple covert states of brain excitability some of which are associated with the generation of EDs. Objective: To investigate whether the interictal period contains \"high excitability\" states that upon brain stimulation produce EDs and can be differentiated from \"low excitability\" states producing normal appearing TMS-EEG responses. Methods: In a cohort of 25 patients with Genetic Generalized Epilepsies (GGE) we identified two subjects characterized by the intermittent development of TMS-induced EDs. The high-excitability in the pre-stimulation period was assessed using multiple measures of univariate time series analysis. Measures providing optimal discrimination were identified by feature selection techniques. The \"high excitability\" states emerged in multiple loci (indicating diffuse cortical hyperexcitability) and were clearly differentiated on the basis of 14 measures from \"low excitability\" states (accuracy = 0.7). Conclusion: In GGE, the interictal period contains multiple, quasi-stable covert states of excitability a class of which is associated with the generation of TMS-induced EDs. The relevance of these findings to theoretical models of ictogenesis is discussed.", "paper_title": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Combined with EEG Reveals Covert States of Elevated Excitability in the Human Epileptic Brain", "paper_id": "WOS:000356443600004"}
