Based on a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, some LMI-based sufficient conditions are proposed for stabilization of the controlled systems via fuzzy state feedback controllers. In order to eliminate the ill-conditioned problem caused by the interaction of fast and slow modes, solutions to the above problem are transformed to a group of well-conditioned-independent LMIs. The proposed approach does not involve the decomposition of the systems into fast and slow subsystems and hence is applicable to standard and non-standard singularly perturbed nonlinear systems. Two examples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Robust fuzzy control of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems with parametric uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400023"}
