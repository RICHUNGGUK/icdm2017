However, there are some drawbacks for data mining tool, such as neural networks has long training times and genetic algorithm is brute computing method. This study proposes a new procedure, joining quantitative value of RFM attributes and K-means algorithm into rough set theory (RS theory), to extract meaning rules, and it can effectively improve these drawbacks. Three purposes involved in this study in the following: (1) discretize continuous attributes to enhance the rough sets algorithm; (2) cluster customer value as output (customer loyalty) that is partitioned into 3, 5 and 7 classes based on subjective view, then see which class is the best in accuracy rate; and (3) find out the characteristic of customer in order to strengthen CRM. A practical collected C-company dataset in Taiwan's electronic industry is employed in empirical case study to illustrate the proposed procedure. Referring to [Hughes, A. M. (1994). Strategic database marketing. Chicago: Probus Publishing Company], this study firstly utilizes RFM model to yield quantitative value as input attributes; next, uses K-means algorithm to cluster customer value; finally, employs rough sets (the LEM2 algorithm) to mine classification rules that help enterprises driving an excellent CRM. In analysis of the empirical results, the proposed procedure outperforms the methods listed in terms of accuracy rate regardless of 3, 5 and 7 classes on output. and generates understandable decision rules.
