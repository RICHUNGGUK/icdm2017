To overcome an overtraining of the classifier caused by noisy and non-stationary data, the EEG signals are filtered and their autoregressive (AR) properties are extracted using an AR model before being passed to the A NNC. For evaluation purposes, the same data in Hoffmann et al. (2008) were used. With and without the AR property extraction, the proposed ANNC could achieve 100% accuracy for all the subjects. To verify the performance improvement of the proposed classification scheme, a comparison of the ANNC and the conventional back-propagation neural network classifier was performed as well.", "paper_title": "CLASSIFYING MENTAL ACTIVITIES FROM EEG-P300 SIGNALS USING ADAPTIVE NEURAL NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309246100032"}
