Based on a novel cumulative vector form model for fractional systems, a general Kalman filter is introduced. The validity of the proposed method has been compared with a previously presented method via simulation results. It is shown that this method can be better applied for discrete time stochastic fractional systems with slower dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
