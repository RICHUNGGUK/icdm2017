The authors present and discuss several design issues associated with two Australian national RFID projects, implemented based on the EPCglobal Network. Using practical experience gained from these projects, they identify several areas of improvement and research opportunities for future large-scale RFID implementations and deployments.", "paper_title": "RFID Infrastructure Design A Case Study of Two Australian RFID Projects", "paper_id": "WOS:000262501000005"}
