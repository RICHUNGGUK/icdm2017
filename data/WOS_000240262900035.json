Summarizing the psychophysical discoveries on preattentive vision, we propose two types of computational simulations of this biological process: the visual similarity clustering and visual saliency detection, based on which we implement a novel biological plausible way to guide the interpretation of document images. Experimental results prove the efficiency of these two computational processes, whose outputs can be further utilized by other task-oriented DIA applications.", "paper_title": "Applying preattentive visual guidance in document image analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900035"}
