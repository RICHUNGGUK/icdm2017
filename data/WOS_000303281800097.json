Within the field of Information Technology, clusters, grids and data centres represent the hungriest consumers of energy and therefore energy (saving) policies for these infrastructures should be applied in order to maximize their resources. It is proved in this paper that approximately 40% of energy can be saved in a data centre if an adequate policy is applied. Furthermore, a software tool is presented where simulations can be run and results for real scenarios can be obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
