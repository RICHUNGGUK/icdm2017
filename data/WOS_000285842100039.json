For sets G(K) obtained by varying a vector y of parameters in a fixed-structure computational unit K(.,y) (e.g., the set of Gaussians with free centers and widths), upper and lower bounds on the G(K)-variation norms of functions having certain integral representations are given, in terms of the L-1-norms of the weighting functions in such representations. Families of functions for which the two norms are equal are described.", "paper_title": "On a Variational Norm Tailored to Variable-Basis Approximation Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000285842100039"}
