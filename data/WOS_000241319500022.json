In doing so, two main contrasting factors have to be considered: not only the bandwidth should be adapted to the traffic profile but also the effort for bandwidth renegotiation associated with a variation of the allocated bandwidth should be kept at low levels. In this context, we formulate a problem of optimal LSP bandwidth reservation as the one of minimizing a convex combination of the difference between the assigned bandwidth and the estimated future traffic, and of a measure of the frequency of bandwidth variations. The contribution of this paper is to propose a new method to reserve optimally the bandwidth of an LSP, avoiding an excess of bandwidth renegotiations on the basis of prediction of future traffic, assuming a simple birth-and-death model to describe the traffic dynamics. Whenever the prediction is inaccurate due to unpredictable variations in the characteristics of real traffic, a suitable \"emergency procedure\" is proposed, which performs a new traffic prediction and a consequent modified bandwidth reservation. Numerical results are presented which show the effectiveness of the method and the achieved performance, both for simulated and real data traffic. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
