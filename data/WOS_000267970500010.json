The model operates on a lattice (rectangular array of points) using a space-time Markov process, which gives a stochastic simulation of growth patterns in terms of parameters of the local region. The model generates disturbance patterns on the landscape based on user-defined inputs of the total area disturbed and the number of patches to be disturbed. The model is developed in a C + + software package named \"TDsimulator\" (\"Terrain Disturbance Simulator\") which can be used to predict changes in landscape cover under a variety of stochastic scenarios. The software comprises a set of GIS routines that collectively yield the disturbance patterns. A demonstration of the stochastic model is provided for simulating fire behaviour in a forested landscape. The numerical examples illustrate the total disturbance impact under different initial conditions and scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
