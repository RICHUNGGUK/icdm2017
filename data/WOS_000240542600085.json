The properties of weak connectivity in subsection based on hypercube model are addressed, for purpose of achieving inner-area pairwise key establishment. Also a hybrid hypercube model based on location-aware deployment is proposed, focusing on dramatic varieties of network size. Corresponding algorithms on inter-area pairwise key establishment are presented, as well as security and performance analysis.", "paper_title": "A further approach on hypercube-based pairwise key establishment in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600085"}
