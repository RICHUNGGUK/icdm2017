To improve the conditions for the solvability of the stabilization problem, a nonquadratic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with a triple-summation term is established, and a nonparallel distributed compensation (non-PDC) scheme is adopted along with thematrixtransformation technique. In addition, an appropriate free-weightingmatrix method is proposed to exploit novel slack variables for null sum terms, especially resulting from Sigma(i)(x(i+1) - x(i))(T) (center dot)(x(i+1) + x(i)).", "paper_title": "Improved Approach to Robust H-infinity Stabilization of Discrete-Time T-S Fuzzy Systems With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000283370100016"}
