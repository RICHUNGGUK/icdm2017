We provide a full algebraic characterization of this class of models and we show they are completely representable by means of persegrams. Finally, decomposition of a coherent conditional probability according to a persegram is presented.", "paper_title": "Asymmetric decomposability and persegram representation in coherent conditional probability theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000325822900015"}
