Two conflicting rescheduling criteria are considered: the total completion time, as the measure of scheduling cost (efficiency); and the number of jobs assigned to different machines in the original schedule and newly generated schedule, as the measure of disruption cost (stability). Further, the rescheduling problem is defined as a bi-criteria scheduling problem. Two polynomial time algorithms are proposed to lexicographically optimize the two criteria. Besides, the set of all efficient schedules with respect to the two criteria can be also generated in polynomial time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
