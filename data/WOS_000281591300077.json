Based on the chance measure and critical values of the random fuzzy variable, three chance-constrained programming models are constructed for the problem with respect to different criteria. Some equivalents of objectives and constraints are also discussed in order to investigate mathematical properties of the models. To solve the models, a potential path searching algorithm, simulation algorithms and a genetic algorithm are integrated as a hybrid algorithm to solve an optimal solution. Finally, some numerical examples are performed to show the applications of the models and the algorithm. (c) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
