Rather than extending optimal 2-dimensional methods, 32,16,20,2 we base our method on a suboptimal 2-dimensional algorithm, outlined by Lee and Drysdale and modified by Sharir(25,30) for computing the diagram of circular sites. For complexity considerations, we assume the sites have bounded complexity, i.e., the algebraic degree is bounded as is the number of algebraic patches making up the site. For the sake of simplicity we assume that the sites are what we call rounded. This assumption simplifies the analysis, though it is probably unnecessary. Our algorithm runs in time O(C(n)) where C(n) is the worst-case complexity of an n-site diagram. For spherical sites C(n) is theta(n(2)), but sharp estimates do not seem to be available for other classes of site.", "paper_title": "Optimal Voronoi diagram construction with n convex sites in three dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000252048100002"}
