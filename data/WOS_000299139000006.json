We propose a context compression model that works in an orthogonal fashion. We first reduce the dimensions of multivariate contextual information. This is achieved through the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which determines the statistical dependencies between the different contextual components. We then suppress the transmission of the determined principal components through an extrapolation scheme that exploits the properties of each individual component. Our findings are quite promising for the broader domain of WSN-based application engineering and context awareness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
