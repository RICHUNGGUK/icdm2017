It comprises key components such as the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), which includes Neighborhood area network (NAN). When multi-hopping is considered in wireless communication, especially in WiFi and ZigBee, the range of the communication can be extended to communicate with the gateway collector in AMI network. Wireless mesh AMI network may have smart meters, a NAN gateway, and fixed as well as mobile repeaters. Though many techniques have been developed to secure on-demand routing protocols in wireless multi-hop ad-hoc networks, these protocols have shortcomings. In this paper, we propose two robust and secure multipath routing protocols for wireless mesh AMI networks. We have analyzed their robustness to various attacks. The simulation results show that the proposed protocols are better than existing secure routing protocols.", "paper_title": "Secure and robust multipath routings for advanced metering infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000326461100028"}
