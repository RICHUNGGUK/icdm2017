The preconditioning matrix is adapted automatically from the pressure and/or velocity flow-field by a power-law relation. The cavitating calculations are based on a single fluid approach. In this approach, the liquid/vapour mixture is treated as a homogeneous fluid whose density is controlled by a barotropic state law. This physical model is integrated with a numerical resolution derived from the cell-centered Jameson's finite volume algorithm. The stabilization is achieved via the second-and fourth-order artificial dissipation scheme. Explicit four-step RungeKutta time integration is applied to achieve the steady-state condition. Results presented in the paper focus on the pressure distribution on hydrofoils wall, velocity profiles, lift and drag forces, length of sheet cavitation, and effect of the power-law preconditioning method on convergence speed. The results show satisfactory agreement with numerical and experimental works of others. The scheme has a progressive effect on the convergence speed. The results indicate that using the power-law preconditioner improves the convergence rate, significantly.
