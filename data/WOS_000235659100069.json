In this paper, aiming at the heterogeneity and dynamism of a grid system, a novel fault-tolerant grid-scheduling model is presented based on Stochastic Petri Net. On the other hand, a new grid-scheduling strategy, the united strategy for the availability factor and expected accomplishing time (USAT), is put forward, In the end, the performance of the scheduling strategy based on the fault-tolerant grid-scheduling model is analyzed by SPNP software package. ne numerical results show that USAT strategy can reduce these bad effects of dynamic and autonomic resources to some extent so as to guarantee quality of service (QoS).", "paper_title": "A dependable task scheduling strategy for a fault tolerant grid model", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100069"}
