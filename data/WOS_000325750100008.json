A stream program consists of a set of tasks where the same tasks are repeated over multiple iterations of data (e.g., video frames). Examples of such programs are video analysis applications for computer-aided diagnosis and computer-assisted surgeries. Our design goal is to reduce the implementation efforts and ease collaborative software development of stream programs while supporting efficient execution of the programs on the target hardware. To validate the toolkit, we implemented EM-Automated-RT software with the toolkit and reported our experience. EM-Automated-RT performs real-time video analysis for quality of a colonoscopy procedure and provides visual feedback to assist the endoscopist to achieve optimal inspection of the colon during the procedure. The software has been deployed in a hospital setting to conduct a clinical trial. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
