In this paper we give a linear-time algorithm for finding a convex grid drawing of every 4-connected plane graph G with four or more vertices on the outer face. The size of the drawing satisfies W + H <= n - 1, where n is the number of vertices of G, W is the width and H is the height of the grid drawing. Thus the area W center dot H is at most [(n - 1)/2] - [(n - 1)/2]. Our bounds on the sizes are optimal in a sense that there exist an infinite number of 4-connected plane graphs whose convex drawings need grids such that W + H = n - I and W center dot H = [(n - 1)/2] - [(n - 1)/2].", "paper_title": "Convex grid drawings of four-connected plane graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000240856900004"}
