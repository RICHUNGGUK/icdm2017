To solve the problem, three self-adapting genetic algorithms were proposed with different control parameters of mutation, crossover, and selection adjusted during the execution. The algorithms were applied to create heterogeneous ensembles comprising regression fuzzy models to aid in real estate appraisals. The results of experiments revealed that the self-adaptive algorithms converged faster than the classic genetic algorithms. The heterogeneous ensembles created by self-adapting methods showed a very good predictive accuracy when compared with the homogeneous ensembles obtained in earlier research.", "paper_title": "Selection of Heterogeneous Fuzzy Model Ensembles Using Self-adaptive Genetic Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000293770300006"}
