Malignant breast tumors tend to present irregular and blurred contours while benign ones are usually round, smooth and well-defined. Accordingly, investigating the tumor contour may help in establishing diagnosis. Herein, Mutual Information and Linear Discriminant Analysis were implemented to rank morphometric features in discriminating breast tumors in ultrasound images. Seven features were extracted from Convex Polygon and the Normalized Radial Length techniques. By applying a Mutual Information based approach, it was possible to identity features with possibly non-linear contributions to the outcome. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
