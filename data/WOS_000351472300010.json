So, we presented a novel hybrid particle swarm optimization based memetic algorithm (HPMA) for DNA sequence compression. In HPMA, within the framework of the memetic algorithm, dynamic comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization method is used for global search, and two adaptive local search operators including center symmetry mutation differential evolution operator and adaptive chaotic search operator work in a cooperative way. HPMA looks for the global optimal code book based on extended approximate repeat vector, by which the DNA sequence will be compressed. Experiments were conducted on 19 high-dimensional functions and 11 real DNA sequences. The results show that HPMA is more competitive in both the performance and scalability, and also attains better compression ability than other representative DNA-specific algorithms on DNA sequence data.", "paper_title": "A hybrid particle swarm optimization based memetic algorithm for DNA sequence compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000351472300010"}
