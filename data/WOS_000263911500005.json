As an infrastructure for service-oriented architectures, the enterprise service bus (ESB) has been regarded as a promising way to support dynamic and agile service integration in distributed heterogeneous environments. The authors' ESB framework for large-scale service integration, JTangSynergy, adopts several mechanisms for providing effective and efficient dependability. It enables automated recovery from component failures and robust execution of composite services by checking service compatibility. The authors tested JTangSynergy in the Chinese Healthcare Service Integration project.", "paper_title": "A Dependable ESB Framework for Service Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000263911500005"}
