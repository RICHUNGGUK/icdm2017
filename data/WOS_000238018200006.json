A number of commonly used features are extracted from multiple signature sample donated by 274 signers. These features are examined for repeatability both within a single signature capture session and between multiple sessions with particular consideration for any performance variation between age groups. Alongside this analysis, an age evaluation of test subjects' ability to enrol/validate on standard systems is presented. Performance is stable across all evaluated age groups proving the ability signature system to be deployed for use within a general population. Some performance features however vary significantly with age in terms of repeatability and mean feature value; characteristics which can be exploited and must be accommodated in the design of systems for use amongst a wide or specific population.
