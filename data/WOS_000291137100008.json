In the presence of deterministic conditionals for continuous variables, we have to deal with the non-existence of the joint density function for the continuous variables. We represent deterministic conditional distributions for continuous variables using Dirac delta functions. Using the properties of Dirac delta functions, we can deal with a large class of deterministic functions. The architecture we develop is an extension of the Shenoy-Shafer architecture for discrete BNs. We extend the definitions of potentials to include conditional probability density functions and deterministic conditionals for continuous variables. We keep track of the units of continuous potentials. Inference in hybrid BNs is then done in the same way as in discrete BNs but by using discrete and continuous potentials and the extended definitions of combination and marginalization. We describe several small examples to illustrate our architecture. In addition, we solve exactly an extended version of the crop problem that includes non-conditional linear Gaussian distributions and non-linear deterministic functions.
