By employing the novel quasi-symmetrical difference method with only the simple shift-add logic and the look-up table, the proposed approach can reduce the hardware area and improve the conversion speed significantly while achieve similar accuracy compared with the previous methods. The implementation results in both FPGA and 0.18-mu m CMOS technology are also presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Low Complexity Logarithmic and Anti-Logarithmic Converters for Hybrid Number System Processors and DSP Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000315244800022"}
