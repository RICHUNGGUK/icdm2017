Some sufficient conditions are established for the existence and globally exponential stability of a unique periodic solution. Furthermore, the results are applied to some typical impulsive neural network systems as special cases, with a real-life example to show feasibility of our results.", "paper_title": "STABILITY ANALYSIS OF A CLASS OF GENERAL PERIODIC NEURAL NETWORKS WITH DELAYS AND IMPULSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000271621900005"}
