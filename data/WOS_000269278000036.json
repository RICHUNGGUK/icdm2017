We introduce a hierarchical hair synthesis framework that views a hairstyle both as a 3D vector field and a 2D arrangement of hair strands on the scalp. Since hair forms wisps, a hierarchical hair clustering algorithm has been developed for detecting wisps in example hairstyles. The coarsest level of the output hairstyle is synthesized using traditional 2D texture synthesis techniques. Synthesizing finer levels of the hierarchy is based on cluster oriented detail transfer. Finally, we compute a discrete tangent vector field from the synthesized hair at every level of the hierarchy to remove undesired inconsistencies among hair trajectories. Improved hair trajectories can be extracted from the vector field. Based on our automatic hair synthesis method, we have also developed simple user-controlled synthesis and editing techniques including feature-preserving combing as well as detail transfer between different hairstyles.", "paper_title": "Example-Based Hair Geometry Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000269278000036"}
