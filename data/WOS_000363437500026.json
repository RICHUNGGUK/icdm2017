Here, we propose a new framework for ranking biomolecules (viz., miRNAs, transcription-factors/TFs and genes) in a multi-informative uterine leiomyoma dataset having both gene expression and methylation data using (statistical) eigenvector centrality based approach. At first, genes that are both differentially expressed and methylated, are identified using Limma statistical test. A network, comprising these genes, corresponding TFs from TRANSFAC and ITFP databases, and targeter miRNAs from miRWalk database, is then built. The biomolecules are then ranked based on eigenvector centrality. Our proposed method provides better average accuracy in hub gene and non-hub gene classifications than other methods. Furthermore, pre-ranked Gene set enrichment analysis is applied on the pathway database as well as GO-term databases of Molecular Signatures Database with providing a pre-ranked gene-list based on different centrality values for comparing among the ranking methods. Finally, top novel potential gene-markers for the uterine leiomyoma are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
