We show that these properties hold true in a classical model with the feature of being contextual, where a correlation is observed between events. Our results show that the classical example is similar to an entangled singlet state for spin-1/2 particles. But, contrary to general opinion, I(corr)(entgld) > 1 is not a necessary and sufficient condition for violating Bell's inequality, since it has been obtained on the basis of a common cause pattern. In other words, it is possible to reconstruct the amount of information contained in a quantum entangled state according to the common cause criterion satisfying local realism.", "paper_title": "Bell's inequality and contextual information", "paper_id": "WOS:000240890100004"}
