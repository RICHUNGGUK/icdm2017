Especially, we obtain a new family with family size 2(n) and maximum nontrivial correlation magnitude 2(n+3/2) +4 for odd m and e = 1. Each sequence in the family is constructed by the interleaving of four GKW-like sequences and a perfect sequence. The correlation distribution and linear spans of the sequences are also determined for odd m.", "paper_title": "New family of binary sequences of period 4(2(n)-1) with low correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000259859400004"}
