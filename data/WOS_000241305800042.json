Such dynamical systems admit limit cycles, and the supercritical Hopf bifurcation normal form is chosen as an example of a system to be approximated. The robustness of the approximations is checked, with a view to circuit implementations.", "paper_title": "Structurally stable PWL approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems admitting limit cycles: An example", "paper_id": "WOS:000241305800042"}
