These visual categories mirror high-level human perception, permitting the design of intuitive and effective color and contrast enhancement strategies. As a pre-processing step, a smart color balancing algorithm is applied, making the overall procedure suitable for uncalibrated images, such as images acquired by unknown systems under unknown lighting conditions.", "paper_title": "Image annotation for adaptive enhancement of uncalibrated color images", "paper_id": "WOS:000235835200019"}
