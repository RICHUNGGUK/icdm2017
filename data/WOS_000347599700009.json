The realized variance is sampled continuously in a risk-neutral market environment. With the application of a Brownian bridge, we derive a theorem for the conditionally expected product of a Brownian motion at two different times for arbitrary powers. This theorem enables us to provide a conditional Monte-Carlo scheme for simulating the fair variance strike. Compared with results in the recent literature, the method outlined in our paper leads to a simplified approach for pricing variance swaps. The method may also be applied to other more sophisticated volatility derivatives. An empirical comparison of this model with the Heston model and a conditional Monte Carlo scheme is also presented using option data on the S&P 500.
