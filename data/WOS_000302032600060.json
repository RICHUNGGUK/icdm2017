Later, Jin presented a new method in 1993, called grey relational clustering (GRC) method that combined grey relational analysis with clustering. However, the CRC method cannot use a tree diagram to make appropriate classification decisions without re-computation. This study thus attempts to combine CRC and hierarchical clustering analysis. Given the existence of an excess of medical resources in the Taipei area, this study attempts to understand the degree of concentration of medical resources in this area. Specifically, this study applies a geographical information system (GIS) to present the geographical distribution of hospitals in Taipei. Additionally, a new-type of cluster analysis, known as hierarchical grey relation clustering analysis, is used to analyze the distribution of hospitals and understand how they compete with one another. The analytical results demonstrate that hierarchical grey relation clustering analysis is a suitable method of analyzing geographical position. Tree diagrams can help policymakers make appropriate classification decisions without re-computation. The study results can inform hospitals of their competitors and help them to develop appropriate responses. Additionally, the analytical results can also provide a reference to government or hospital policymakers to help them position hospitals in areas, thus achieving a better distribution of medical resources in Taipei.
