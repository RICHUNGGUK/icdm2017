In recent years, the control systems progress has moved toward a more efficient and adaptable semi-active technology. Therefore the existent numerical procedures, which proved effective for the passive implementation, are expected to comprise such features as well. This paper deals with a method of controlling in real time the hysteresis component in simulated semi-active control systems through the Bouc-Wen model. An introductive discussion on the theoretical formulation of the original settlement allows to focus on a way for tuning the parameters which can be managed for hysteresis regulation. Proper algorithms, embedded into the analytical formulation of the model, are subsequently selected for implementing the semi-active characteristic. Finally, straightforward dynamic applications on a plane oscillator system point out the general capability of the proposed approach by seismic response simulation and mitigation of the induced structural effects.
