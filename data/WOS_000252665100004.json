In this article we show how to develop a representation theory over a category of domains with morphisms partial continuous functions. The raison detre for introducing partial continuous functions is that by passing to partial maps, we are free to consider totalities which are not dense. We show that the category of admissibly representable spaces with morphisms functions which are representable by it partial continuous function is Cartesian closed. Finally, we consider the question of effectivity.", "paper_title": "Partial continuous functions and admissible domain representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000252665100004"}
