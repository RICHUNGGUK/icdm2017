NLOS is inherently a dominant source of errors in metropolitan area wireless networks, like cellular one, so in this paper we discuss our proposed algorithm within cellular network terminology. This paper contributes two novel algorithms. The first one is to extract the NLOS state of base station (BS) and the second one is a correction algorithm to enhance the measurements accuracy. Our proposed algorithm discuses a novel localization technique to estimate true mobile terminal (MT) location from a set of possibly high NLOS errors and furthermore it can recognize the NLOS states of BSs. Our algorithm utilizes a constrained approach, when range measurements are available from three BSs. Simulations studying the performance of algorithm and demonstrates that mean location error (MLE) over corresponding MT roaming area is nearly independent of the magnitude of NLOS error and can be smaller than 0.005 of cells diameter even in large NLOS error.
