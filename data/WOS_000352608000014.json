In traditional CF methods, only the feedback matrix, which contains either explicit feedback (also called ratings) or implicit feedback on the items given by users, is used for training and prediction. Typically, the feedback matrix is sparse, which means that most users interact with few items. Due to this sparsity problem, traditional CF with only feedback information will suffer from unsatisfactory performance. Recently, many researchers have proposed to utilize auxiliary information, such as item content (attributes), to alleviate the data sparsity problem in CF. Collaborative topic regression (CTR) is one of these methods which has achieved promising performance by successfully integrating both feedback information and item content information. In many real applications, besides the feedback and item content information, there may exist relations (also known as networks) among the items which can be helpful for recommendation. In this paper, we develop a novel hierarchical Bayesian model called Relational Collaborative Topic Regression (RCTR), which extends CTR by seamlessly integrating the user-item feedback information, item content information, and network structure among items into the same model. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our model can achieve better prediction accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods with lower empirical training time. Moreover, RCTR can learn good interpretable latent structures which are useful for recommendation.", "paper_title": "Relational Collaborative Topic Regression for Recommender Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000352608000014"}
