The method is based on measures from information theory and has no underlying free parameters nor does it require training or calibration. The method is based on finding an optimal set of global thresholds, one for each image, by maximising the mutual information above the thresholds while minimising the mutual information below the thresholds. Although some assumptions on the nature of images are made, no assumptions are made by the method on the intensity distributions or on the shape of the image histograms. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated both on synthetic images and medical images from clinical practice. It is then compared against three other thresholding methods", "paper_title": "Mutual information-based binarisation of multiple images of an object: an application in medical imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000320882000002"}
