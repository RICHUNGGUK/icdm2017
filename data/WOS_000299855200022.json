In a previous paper, the authors formulated the assignment of base stations to packet controllers in GSM-EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) as a graph partitioning problem, which was solved by a heuristic method. In this paper, an exact method is presented to find optimal solutions that can be used as a benchmark. The proposed method is based on an effective re-formulation of the classical integer linear programming model of the graph partitioning problem, which is solved by the branch-and-cut algorithm in a commercial optimization package. Performance assessment is based on an extensive set of problem instances built from data of a live network. Preliminary analysis shows some properties of the graphs in this problem justifying the limitations of heuristic approaches and the need for more sophisticated methods. Results show that the proposed method outperforms classical heuristic algorithms used for benchmarking, even under runtime constraints. Likewise, it improves the efficiency of exact methods previously applied to similar problems in the cellular field. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
