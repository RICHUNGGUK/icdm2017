In addition, we substantially extend the classification of combinatorial 3-manifolds with transitive cyclic symmetry up to 22 vertices. Finally, a combination of these results is used to describe new infinite families of transitive cyclic combinatorial manifolds and in particular a family of neighborly combinatorial lens spaces of infinitely many distinct topological types.", "paper_title": "Combinatorial 3-Manifolds with Transitive Cyclic Symmetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000330972200007"}
