The system adopts a DC sensing method to detect the capacitive motion, which is insensitive to the mismatch of the gyroscope capacitors and can eliminate high frequency signals from the chip. Therefore it offers a commendable noise performance with simplified topology. Low noise design can be achieved by a continuous-time charge sensitive amplifier with the input-referred noise voltage of 9.833 nV/rtHz at 10 kHz. A novel high voltage (HV) buffer is adopted in the drive mode to strengthen its drive signal, so that the common-mode voltage of it is made at 5 V that is compatible with the gyroscope. The HV buffer utilizes two sets of power supply to achieve both good noise performance and HV output. The ASIC chip is fabricated in the 0.35 mu m 2P4M BCD HV process, and is 2.5x2.0 mm(2) in dimension. The test results prove that the system achieves a stable closed-loop oscillation in the drive mode. Furthermore, the in-phase demodulation result of the gyroscope system achieves a nonlinearity of 0.14% within the sense range of 0 degrees-500 degrees/s.", "paper_title": "Designing of a micromachined gyroscope system with a closed-loop DC biased interface ASIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000341843200016"}
