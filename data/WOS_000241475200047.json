The covariance of two composite features contains information on statistical dependency among multiple primitive features. A new discriminant analysis (C-LDA) using the covariance of composite features is a generalization of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Unlike LDA, the number of extracted features can be larger than the number of classes in C-LDA. Experimental results on several data sets indicate that C-LDA provides better classification results than other methods.", "paper_title": "Pattern classification using composite features", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200047"}
