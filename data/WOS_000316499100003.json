For visually dominant office work such as typing on the computer, it is possible that delivering posture feedback visually may overload the visual sense while haptic feedback may be a viable alternative. We performed two experiments to compare vibrotactile and visual feedback-posture compliance and dual-task cognitive workload assessment. In the first experiment, our results showed no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between using vibrotactile and visual feedback to obtain postural compliance to a reference posture. In the second experiment, participants experienced typing performance and response time degradations from both types of feedback. However the differences in performance degradation were not statistically significant between the two feedback methods. We conclude that vibrotactile and visual feedback are similarly effective for guiding quasistatic postures in routine tasks such as seated office work.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Visual and Vibrotactile Feedback Methods for Seated Posture Guidance", "paper_id": "WOS:000316499100003"}
