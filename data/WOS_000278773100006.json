In this paper we deal with the class of strict t-norms with well-defined first partial derivatives along their zero borders. We show that the answer to the question is negative for certain couples of such t-norms and we state out possible further research.", "paper_title": "Convex combinations of strict t-norms", "paper_id": "WOS:000278773100006"}
