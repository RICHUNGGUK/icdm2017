GWPOT is a new improvement of the genetic operation tree that consists of the Genetic Algorithm, Weighted Operation Structure, and Pyramid Operation Tree. The developed model obtained better results in benchmark tests against several widely used artificial intelligence (AI) models, including the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Evolutionary Support Vector Machine Inference Model (ESIM). Further, unlike competitor models that use \"black-box\" techniques, the proposed GWPOT model generates explicit formulas, which provide important advantages in practical application.
