Because the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem with an extremely high computational complexity, we propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm, which is a two-step separated subchannel and power allocation algorithm. In the first step, subchannels are allocated to each user, whereas in the second step, the optimal power allocation is carried out on the basis of the given subchannel allocation and the nonlinear interval Gauss-Seidel method. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can achieve a good trade-off between the efficiency and the fairness compared with two other existing relevant algorithms. In particular, the proposed algorithm can always achieve 100% fairness under various conditions.
