The x(2)-detection and Regular-Singular (RS)-attack methods are two well-known statistical steganalysis schemes used against LSB (least significant bit) steganography. The embedded message length can be estimated accurately by these two steganalysis schemes. For secret communication, the resistance of steganography against steganalysis is very important for information security. To avoid the enemy's attempts, the statistical features between stego-images and cover images should be as similar as possible for better resistance to steganalysis. In this manuscript, a reversible histogram transformation function-based LSB steganographic method is proposed to resist statistical steganalysis. The experimental results show that the proposed method resists not only RS-attack but also x(2)-detection methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
