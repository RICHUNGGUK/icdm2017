The neuraminidase of the influenza virus has been the most potential target for the anti-influenza drugs such as oseltamivir and zanamivir. However, the emergence of drug-resistant variants of these drugs makes a pressing need for the development of new neuraminidase inhibitors for controlling illness and transmission. Here a 3D structure model of H1N1 avian influenza virus neuraminidase type 1 (N1) was constructed based on the structure of the template H5N1 avian influenza virus N1. Upon application of virtual screening technique for N1 inhibitors, two novel compounds (ZINC database ID: ZINC02128091, ZINC02098378) were found as the most favorable interaction energy with N1. Docking results showed that the compounds bound not only in the active pocket, but also in a new hydrophobic cave which contains Arg368, Trp399, Ile427, Pro431 and Lys432 of N1. Our result suggested that both of the screened compounds containing the hydrophobic group bring a strong conjugation effect with Arg293, Arg368 Lys432 of N1 by pi-pi interaction. However, the control inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir do not have this effect. The details of N1-compound binding structure obtained will be valuable for the development of a new anti-influenza virus agent.", "paper_title": "Computational study on new natural polycyclic compounds of H1N1 influenza virus neuraminidase", "paper_id": "WOS:000307276900001"}
