Flank wear in drill depends upon speed, feed rate, drill diameter and hence these parameters along with other derived parameters such as thrust force, torque and vibration have been used to predict flank wear using ANN. Effect of using increasing number of sensors in the efficacy of predicting drill wear by using ANN has been studied. It has been observed that inclusion of vibration signal along with thrust force and torque leads to better prediction of drill wear. The results obtained from the two different ANN architectures have been compared and some useful conclusions have been made. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
