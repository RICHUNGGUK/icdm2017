A subcube of {0, 1}(d) is a subset of 2(k) of its points formed by fixing k coordinates and allowing the remaining d - k to vary freely. This paper is concerned with patterns of intersections among subcubes of the discrete cube. Two sample questions along these lines are as follows: given a family of subcubes in which no r + 1 of them have non-empty intersection, how many pairwise intersections can we have? How many subcubes can we have if among them there are no k which have non-empty intersection and no l which are pairwise disjoint? These questions are naturally expressed using intersection graphs. The intersection graph of a family of sets has one vertex for each set in the family with two vertices being adjacent if the corresponding subsets intersect. Let I(n, d) be the set of all n vertex graphs which can be represented as the intersection graphs of subcubes in {0, 1}(d). With this notation our first question above asks for the largest number of edges in a Kr+1-free graph in I(n, d). As such it is a Turan-type problem. We answer this question asymptotically for some ranges of r and d. More precisely we show that if (k + 1)2(left perpendiculard/k+1right perpendicular) < n <= k2(left perpendiculard/kright perpendicular) for some integer k >= 2 then the maximum edge density is (1 - 1/k - o(1)) provided that n is not too close to the lower limit of the range. The second question can be thought of as a Ramsey-type problem. The maximum such n can be defined in the same way as the usual Ramsey number but only considering graphs which are in I(n, d). We give bounds for this maximum n mainly concentrating on the case that l is fixed, and make some comparisons with the usual Ramsey number.", "paper_title": "Turan and Ramsey Properties of Subcube Intersection Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000312036300004"}
