First, the sensitivity of the FEM model on the element shape and mesh density has been analysed. Secondly, with the optimized FEM model, the modal behaviour with the runner vibrating in air and in water has been calculated. The added mass effect by comparing the natural frequencies and mode shapes in both cases has been determined. The numerical results obtained have been compared with experimental results available. The comparison shows a good agreement in the natural frequency values and in the mode shapes. The added mass effect due to the fluid structure interaction has been discussed in detail. Finally, the added mass effect on the submerged runner is quantified using a non-dimensional parameter so that the results can be extrapolated to runners with geometrical similarity.
