One important feature of the time-varying impulses is that both the stabilizing and destabilizing impulses are considered simultaneously. Based on the comparison principle, the stability of delayed neural networks with time-varying impulses is investigated. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the results.
