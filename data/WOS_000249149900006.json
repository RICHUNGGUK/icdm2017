The techniques developed to recover these missing values effectively should be highly precise in order to estimate the missing values completely. The mining of association rules can effectively establish the relationship among items in databases. Therefore, discovered association rules are usually applied to recover the missing values in databases. This study presents a Fast Recycle Combined Association Rules (FRCAR) method to fill in the missing values. FRCAR applies a technique to recycle sub-frequent itemsets and bit-arrays to discover more association rules than the Missing Value Completion (MVC) approach. The experimental result demonstrates that FRCAR results in a higher recovery rate and higher recovery accuracy for missing values.", "paper_title": "Combined association rules for dealing with missing values", "paper_id": "WOS:000249149900006"}
