For this purpose, the fourth-order moments of the real and imaginary parts of frequency components are extracted, for both the speech and noise, separately. For each noisy frame, the mentioned fourth-order moments are also estimated. Making use of the proposed formulas, the signal-to-noise ratio is estimated in each frequency index of the noisy frame. These formulas also predict the overall signal-to-noise ratio in each noisy frame. What makes our method outstanding compared to conventional approaches is that this method takes into consideration both the speech and noise identically. It estimates the negative SNR almost as well as the positive SNR.", "paper_title": "A New Method for Low SNR Estimation of Noisy Speech Signals Using Fourth-Order Moments", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250600029"}
