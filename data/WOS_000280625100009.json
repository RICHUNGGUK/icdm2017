The most efficient approach to address the scalability of multimedia applications is to encode video streams in compliance with the scalable video coding (SVC) standard, which is proposed as an extension to H.264/AVC standard. This paper addresses the rate control and bandwidth sharing for multimedia applications that are relying on SVC-encoded video streams. In previous studies, idealistic utility functions, mainly in the form of a staircase function, were used to cast the rate allocation for SVC-encoded streams as an optimization problem. These utility functions make the optimization problem non-convex and even non-differentiable, for which achieving optimality through dual-based approaches proves quite challenging. Towards this goal, we introduce an accurate analytical model of the utility function for SVC-encoded video streams. Using the abovementioned utility model and adopting the utility-proportional optimization approach, we come up with a convex formulation and propose a dual-based distributed algorithm for rate allocation of SVC-encoded streams. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on an accurate utility function modeling for SVC-encoded streams. Simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm is quite efficient in achieving the convergence towards the global optimality. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
