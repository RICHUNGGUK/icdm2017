This research used a multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis to further characterize and quantify the effects of the simulation parameters on haptic texture rendering and perception. In a pilot experiment, 12 haptic texture samples were generated by using a 3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) force-feedback device with varying spatial period, height, and stiffness coefficient parameter values. The subjects' perceptions of the virtual textures indicate that roughness, denseness, flatness and hardness are distinguishing characteristics of texture. In the main experiment, 19 participants rated the dissimilarities of the textures and estimated the magnitudes of their characteristics. The MDS method was used to recover the underlying perceptual space and reveal the significance of the space from the recorded data. The physical parameters and their combinations have significant effects on the perceptual characteristics. A regression model was used to quantitatively analyze the parameters and their effects on the perceptual characteristics. This paper is to illustrate that haptic texture perception based on force feedback can be modeled in two-or three-dimensional space and provide suggestions on improving perception-based haptic texture rendering.", "paper_title": "Experimental Study on the Perception Characteristics of Haptic Texture by Multidimensional Scaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000369611500006"}
