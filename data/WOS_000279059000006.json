Possible candidates for such analytic validations are the end-to-end response time analysis techniques that can analytically find the worst-case response times of real-time transactions over multiple resources. The existing techniques, however, exhibit severe overestimation when real-time transactions visit the same resource multiple times, which we call a multiple visit problem. To address the problem, this paper proposes a novel analysis that completely changes its analysis viewpoint from classical per-job basis-aggregation of per-job response times-to per-resource basis-aggregation of per-resource total delays. Our experiments show that the proposed analysis can find significantly tighter bounds of end-to-end response times compared with the existing per-job-based analysis.", "paper_title": "Migrating from Per-Job Analysis to Per-Resource Analysis for Tighter Bounds of End-to-End Response Times", "paper_id": "WOS:000279059000006"}
