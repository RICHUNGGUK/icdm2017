Here, we explore the Axelrod model with an extended conservativeness which incorporates not only similarity between individuals but also a preference to the last source of accepted information. The additional preference given to the last source of information increases the initial decay of the number of ideas in the system, changes the character of the phase transition between homogeneous and heterogeneous final states and could increase the number of stable regions (clusters) in the final state.", "paper_title": "AXELROD MODEL WITH EXTENDED CONSERVATIVENESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312457100007"}
