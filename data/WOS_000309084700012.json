We modify the augmented restarted simpler GMRES proposed by Boojhawon and Bhuruth to obtain a simpler GMRES with deflated restarting. Moreover, we also propose a residual-based simpler GMRES with deflated restarting, which is numerically more stable. The main advantage over the augmented version is that the simpler GMRES with deflated restarting requires less matrix-vector products per restart cycle. Some details of implementation are also considered. Numerical experiments show that the residual-based simpler GMRES with deflated restarting is effective. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
