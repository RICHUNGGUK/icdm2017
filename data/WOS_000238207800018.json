We develop algorithms for separating non-random planning-related communications from random background communications in a streaming-model. This work extends previous re stilts related to the identification of hidden groups in the cyclic model. The new statistical model and new algorithms do not assume the existence of a planning time-cycle in the stream of communications of a hidden group. The algorithms construct larger hidden groups by building them Lip from smaller ones. To illustrate our algorithms, we apply them to the Enron email corpus in order to extract the evolution of Enron's organizational structure.", "paper_title": "Finding hidden group structure in a stream of communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800018"}
