A clonal selection algorithm (CSA) based encoding technique is applied to improve the accuracy of classification, which demonstrated in the literature for the first time. With features and RBF kernel parameters selection to predict incipient fault of power transformer improve the accuracy of classification systems and the generalization performance. The proposed approach is distinguished by removing redundant input features that may be confusing the classifier and optimizing the selection of kernel parameters. Simulation results of practice data demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of the proposed approach, which makes operation faster and also increases the accuracy of the classification.", "paper_title": "Power transformer fault diagnosis using support vector machines and artificial neural networks with clonal selection algorithms optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000022"}
