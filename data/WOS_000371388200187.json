We present here both the uplink and downlink analysis based on the assumption that the base stations are distributed according to an independent stationary Poisson point process. This type of modeling allows us to make use of the property that the spatial distribution of the base stations after thinning (switching oFF) is still a Poisson process. This implies that the probability distribution of the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) can be kept unchanged when switching-oFF base stations provided that we scale up the transmission power of the remaining base stations. We then solve the problem of optimally selecting the switch-oFF probabilities so as to minimize the energy consumptions, while keeping unchanged the SINR probability distribution. We then study the tradeoff in the uplink performance involved in switching-oFF base stations. These include the energy consumption, the coverage and capacity, and the impact on amount of radiation absorbed by the transmitting user.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Geometric Models for Green Networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200187"}
