Participants were 88 university students majoring in information technology. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was conducted to examine the differences in KM performance between an experimental group (a total of 43 students learning with e-portfolio) and a control group (a total of 45 students learning without e-portfolio), and the covariate variable was students' grade of the last semester. The results revealed that the experimental group outperformed the control group in the performances of overall KM and five KM aspects (knowledge sharing, innovation, acquisition, application, and accumulation). This showed that e-portfolios significantly facilitated KM performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
