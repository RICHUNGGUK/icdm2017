We tested the research model using a survey of 543 usable responses in China. Our findings show that satisfaction and perceived usefulness positively affect continuance intention, which, together with perceived usefulness, positively influences the WOM behavior. The two different post-adoption behaviors of e-service users, continuance intention and WOM, are closely related. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
