The proposed structure uses six identical cells of which each is engineered to work as a quarter wavelength transmission line with proper characteristic impedance at two distinct frequencies having arbitrary frequency ratio. The performances of the p- and T-cells are studied to assess their ability to provide the required electrical parameters for dual-band operation. It is demonstrated that the single-section p-topology can only lead to a suboptimal design for a dual-band rat-race cell at two nonharmonic frequencies. In contrast, the proposed double-section p-cell structure allows achieving an optimal dual-band cell design. A dual-band rat-race coupler designed at 2.14 and 3.6 GHz has been simulated and fabricated in hybrid microstrip technology. Measurement results agree well with analytically based simulation results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed structure for dual-band operation. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
