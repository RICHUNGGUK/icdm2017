At the same time, the pre-fetching technology also proves to be an efficient method to improve the performance of image-delivery with the low delay and adjustable quality. However, how to deploy the pre-fetching to deliver scalable contents has not been mentioned. Therefore, this paper presents an analysis of the pre-fetching algorithm to deliver layered image contents over the Internet. Based on the analysis of web request probability and the relations between different layers in the scalable imaging delivering system, a new pre-fetching algorithm is proposed to drastically improve cache performance. This proposal is a request frequency-based approach, in which a progressive image format can be used.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS OF AN EFFICIENT PRE-FETCHING ALGORITHM FOR SCALABLE CONTENTS OVER CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264294800028"}
