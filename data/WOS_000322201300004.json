By installing a software in a smartphone, call forwarding is automatically triggered (e.g., when the phone is plugged in a charger or is turned off) or disabled (e.g., when the phone is unplugged from the charger or is turned on). We investigate the performance of the CFA through analytic analysis, simulation, and measurement. Our study indicates that CFA is very feasible for commercial usage.
