This paper proposes an autonomic framework to promote the adaptivity of routing services in sensor networks. The key idea of this framework is to maintain some feature functions that are decoupled from originally-integrated routing services. This separation enables significant service changes to be done by only tuning these functions. Measures including parameterization are taken to save the energy for changing these functions. Further, this framework includes a monitoring module to support a policy-based collaborative adaptation. This paper shows an example autonomic routing service conforming to this framework.", "paper_title": "An autonomic routing framework for sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237308400006"}
