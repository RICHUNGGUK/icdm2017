Technology scaling an increasing power densities make MPSoC lifetime reliability problems more severe. MPSoC reliability strongly depends on system-level MPSoC architecture, redundancy, and thermal profile during operation. We propose an efficient temperature-aware MPSoC reliability analysis and prediction technique that enables MPSoC reliability optimization via redundancy and temperature-aware design planning. Reliability, performance, and area are concurrently optimized. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach has the potential to substantially improve MPSoC system mean time to failure with small area overhead.", "paper_title": "Application-specific MPSoC reliability optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000258762700012"}
