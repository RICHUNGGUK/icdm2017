We use the Variable Consistency Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (VC-DRSA) to formulate airline service strategies by generating airline service decision rules that model passenger preferences for airline service quality. Flow graphs are applied to infer decision rules and variables. This combined method considers decision-maker inconsistency. The use of flow graphs to visualize rules makes them more reasonable and understandable than traditional methods. To validate the effectiveness of our model, a large sample is surveyed. Managerial improvements needed for carriers to achieve the aspired-to level of customer satisfaction are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
