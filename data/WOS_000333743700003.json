This article presents two studies that investigated the effect of visual, auditory, and haptic sensory feedback modalities presented by a virtual button in a 3D environment on task performance (time on task and task errors) and user rating. Although we expected task performance to improve for conditions that combined two or three feedback modalities over a single modality, we instead found a significant emergent behavior that decreased performance in the trimodal condition. We found a significant increase in the number of presses when a user released the button before closing the virtual switch, suggesting that the combined visual, auditory, and haptic feedback led participants to prematurely believe they actuated a button. This suggests that in the design of virtual buttons, considering the effect of each feedback modality independently is not sufficient to predict performance, and unexpected effects may emerge when feedback modalities are combined.", "paper_title": "Emergent Effects in Multimodal Feedback from Virtual Buttons", "paper_id": "WOS:000333743700003"}
