Therefore, power control plays an important role to minimize the transmitted power shared among unicast and multicast users within a cell. In Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS), power control targets to the efficient utilization of radio and network resources. However, the expected high demand for such services stresses the need for an efficient scheme, capable of dynamically allocating radio resources to parallel MBMS sessions. This paper proposes a power control mechanism for efficient MBMS session assignment in next generation UMTS networks. The mechanism shares efficiently the available power resources of UMTS base stations to MBMS sessions running in the network. Furthermore, the mechanism is evaluated through several realistic scenarios and the results indicate the ability of the mechanism to utilize efficiently the radio resources and to ensure the service continuity when parallel MBMS services run in the network. Our approach is compared with current 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) approaches, such as these presented in TS 25.346 and in TR 25.922, in order to highlight the enhancements that it provides.", "paper_title": "An improved mechanism for multiple MBMS sessions assignment in B3G cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000275558500007"}
