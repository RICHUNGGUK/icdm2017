Previous studies assumed that link failures in a road network are statistically independent and that reliability probabilities are perfectly determinable. In real life, these assumptions are dubious, because the failure of a link in one particular area does not necessarily result in the complete failure of the neighboring link, but may lead to deterioration of its performance. This paper presents a new methodology to study the multistate system reliability analysis of transportation networks for which one cannot formulate an \"all or nothing\" type of failure criterion and in which dependent link failures are considered. The methodology is presented, using a numerical example, for computing the probability that travel time between an origin and a destination may exceed a threshold.", "paper_title": "Computing travel time reliability-in transportation networks with multistates and dependent link failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000240003100003"}
