Density functional theory calculations indicate that a progressive shift occurs of the spin density from the Ag center towards the coordinating nitrogen atoms of aza ligands, as the ligation energy increases. Chemistry of Ag(II) might be extended with little effort beyond the known aza connections, to include nitriles, perfluorinated nitriles and perfluorinated amines.", "paper_title": "Ligation of Aza bases to the AgF(2) molecule: a theoretical study", "paper_id": "WOS:000258611500002"}
