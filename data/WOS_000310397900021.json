Five kinds of binary sequences of period N are put into the construction to get five kinds of new 16-QAM sequences of period 4N. These resultant sequences have 5-level autocorrelation {0, +/- 8, +/- 8N}, where +/- 8N happens only once each. The distributions of the periodic autocorrelation are also given. These will provide more choices for many applications.", "paper_title": "A General Construction of Sequences with Good Autocorrelation over the 16-QAM Constellation", "paper_id": "WOS:000310397900021"}
