Sharing product information must precede for the integration. However, because most of the participants have different business experience and business domains, interoperability of product information among enterprises should be guaranteed for collaboration. To achieve interoperability, we Suggest product ontology architecture through the investigation of generic ontology architecture. We first suggest 4-layered ontology architecture for all integrated value chain. Extending this ontology architecture, we develop product ontology architecture which facilitates building product ontologies that are referred to all related participants inbound and outbound of the enterprise for collaboration. Using a product ontology, each enterprise call have semantic interoperability across each other for collaborative works. Because product ontologies have the feature of evolving through product lifecycle, the proposed product ontology architecture reflects this evolving feature to guarantee semantic interoperability.
