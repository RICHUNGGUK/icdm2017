Market segmentation is a key issue for companies to develop and maintain loyal relationships with customers as well as to promote the increase of company sales. This paper proposes a method for market segmentation in retailing based on customers' lifestyle, supported by information extracted from a large transactional database. A set of typical shopping baskets are mined from the database, using a variable clustering algorithm, and these are used to infer customers lifestyle. Customers are assigned to a lifestyle segment based on their purchases history. This study is done in collaboration with an European retailing company. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
