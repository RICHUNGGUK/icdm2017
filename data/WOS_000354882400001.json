We use the pure and bordered construction to get self-dual codes starting from the adjacency matrices of symmetric and non-symmetric 3-class association schemes. In some specific cases, we also study constructions of self-dual codes over . For symmetric 3-class association schemes, we focus on the rectangular scheme and association schemes derived from symmetric designs.", "paper_title": "Self-dual codes from 3-class association schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000354882400001"}
