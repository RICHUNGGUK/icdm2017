Instead of segmenting moving objects in a conventional frame by frame manner, the newly proposed method segments a scene into unchanged background zone (UBZ) and moving object zone (MOZ). As a result, moving objects normally appear in MOZs rather than UBZs, and therefore, detection and behaviours analysis can be performed in MOZs. In visual communication, UBZs do not need to be encoded and transmitted. Moreover, if an object is in UBZs, it can be linked to abnormal events. Experimental results demonstrate the contribution of the proposed method. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
