Firstly, we divide the network into rings, and then have an analysis and calculation on nodes' energy consumption in each ring of the network when clustering algorithm is applied to collect data. We also put forward a scheme of nonuniform node distribution on the basis of the proportion of nodes' energy consumption in each ring, and change nodes' active/hibernating states under density control mechanism when network coverage is guaranteed. Simulation shows NNDC algorithm can satisfyingly balance nodes' energy consumption and effectively avoid the problem of energy hole.", "paper_title": "Research on the Energy Hole Problem Based on Non-uniform Node Distribution for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310982100002"}
