Nevertheless, analysis of records of unitary current events suggests that the kinetic process presents short-term memory. We have previously proposed the resealed range analysis or R/S Hurst analysis as an efficient method to test for the existence of long-term correlation (memory) in single ion channel. In this paper, we investigate the effect of calcium on the memory of the single calcium-activated potassium channel present in Leydig cells. The Hurst coefficient (H; a parameter that predicts memory) was calculated for four different calcium concentrations and presented the following values: 0.634 +/- 0.017 (n = 8) for 10(-6) M; 0.647 +/- 0.001 (n = 9) for 10(-7) M; 0.614 +/- 0.001 (n = 6) for 10(-8) M and 0.618 +/- 0.001 (n = 4) for 10(-9) M. These values of H indicate that open- and closed-dwell times are long-term correlated and that this memory does not change in the presence of different calcium concentrations at a 5% significance level. When the R/S Analysis was applied to the results obtained from simulations of a markovian model (eleven states), it could not account for the long-term correlation found in the experimental data.", "paper_title": "Calcium does not change memory in single calcium-activated potassium channel kinetics", "paper_id": "WOS:000250646000006"}
