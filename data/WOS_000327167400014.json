This difference must be enhanced in order to improve the accuracy of tooth segmentation. This paper proposes a method to improve the intensity between the tooth and dental bone. This method consists of an estimation of tooth orientation (intensity projection, smoothing filter, and peak detection) and PCA-Stacked Gabor with ellipse Gabor banks. Tooth orientation estimation is performed to determine the angle of a single oriented tooth. PCA-Stacked Gabor with ellipse Gabor banks is then used, in particular to enhance the border between the tooth and dental bone. Finally, active contour extraction is performed in order to determine tooth contour. In the experiment, in comparison with the conventional active contour without edge (ACWE) method, the average mean square error (MSE) values of extracted tooth contour points are reduced from 26.93% and 16.02% to 19.07% and 13.42% for tooth x-ray type 1 and type H images, respectively.", "paper_title": "A Single Tooth Segmentation Using PCA-Stacked Gabor Filter and Active Contour", "paper_id": "WOS:000327167400014"}
