Utilizing analytical mechanics, we establish a link between modeling and simulation of constrained multi-body systems in one hand and motion control of underwater vehicles on the other hand. The beauty of the presented approach consists in simplicity and physical interpretability, where imaginary dampers and springs introduce a deformable body and take care of motion of the vehicle. The proposed method is used to develop a novel path-following controller for UUVs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
