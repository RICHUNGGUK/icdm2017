However, when network partitioning occurs, the query-issuing node cannot connect to some nodes having data items included in the top-k query result, and thus, the accuracy of the query result decreases. To solve this problem, data replication is a promising approach. However, if each node sends back its own data items (replicas) responding to a query without considering replicas held by others, same data items are sent back to the query-issuing node more than once through long paths, which results in increase of traffic. In this paper, we propose a top-k query processing method considering data replication in M-P2P networks. This method suppresses duplicate transmissions of same data items through long paths. Moreover, an intermediate node stops transmitting a query message on-demand. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
