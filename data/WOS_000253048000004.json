The authors propose a complete infrastructure for economics-based Service-oriented Grids and demonstrate its application in a data mining prototype. The developments and experiments show that the proposed infrastructure integrates the middleware tools and deployment scripts for automatic bootstrapping and further trading of Grid services, practical agent-based automatic and fair trading of services can be achieved using the proposed infrastructure, and the economic mechanism does not impose any constraint on system size or computational requirements, hence enabling (theoretically) for high scalability.", "paper_title": "A decentralized grid market infrastructure for service oriented grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000253048000004"}
