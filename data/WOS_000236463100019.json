Therefore, the available information annotated in XML keeps and will keep increasing in size. Furthermore, not only the volume of the XML information is increasing but also its complexity. The XML documents evolved from plain structured text representations, to documents having complex and heterogeneous structures and contents like sequential or time series data. In this article we introduce a retrieval scheme designed to manage sequential data in an XML context based on two levels of approximation: on the structural localization/organization of the sequential data and on its content. To this end we merge methods developed in two different research areas: XML information retrieval and sequence similarity search.", "paper_title": "Information retrieval of sequential data in heterogeneous XML databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000236463100019"}
