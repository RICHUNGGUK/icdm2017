A theorem in the first of the two communications provides the basis for the equivalence of both formulations. By providing a simple counterexample, we disprove the theorem. Subsequently, based on an illustrative example, we demonstrate that their criterion differs from the classical one and argue that the proposed criterion is not a suitable measure of discriminability.
