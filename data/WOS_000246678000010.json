This caused a new interdisciplinary field of data mining to arise, encompassing both classical statistical, and modem machine teaming tools to support the data analysis and knowledge discovery from databases. While data mining methods are powerful in dealing with large quantities of data, they are often difficult to master by business users to facilitate decision support. In this paper we introduce our approach to integration of decision support system with data mining methods. We discuss the role of data mining to facilitate decision support, the role of data mining in decision support systems, discuss underlying ideas and applied approaches and introduce a data mining decision support system called DMDSS (Data Mining Decision Support System). We present some obtained results and their beneficial use as expected by the business users.", "paper_title": "Integrating data mining and decision support through data mining based decision support system", "paper_id": "WOS:000246678000010"}
