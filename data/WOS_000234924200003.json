This paper presents a knowledge-based simulation approach for simulating the effect of downstream and upstream operations in supply chain. Based on the simulation result, the performance of supply chain partners can be analysed, evaluated and predicted. With the use of artificial intelligent (AI) techniques, the knowledge-based simulation platform (KBSP) can accumulate the successful experience of the enterprises in formulating and implementing supply chain strategies. The potential benefits of KBSP include the provision of guidance, solution and simulation environment for enterprises to reduce risks for their supply chain operations.", "paper_title": "Knowledge-based simulation and analysis of supply chain performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000234924200003"}
