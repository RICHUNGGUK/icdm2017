Nevertheless, such an ad hoc wireless network has many unstable factors causing the transmission being unreliable. Thus, the broadcasting algorithm needs fault tolerant capability to solve the possible failure of broadcasting process. In this paper, we propose self-pruning-with-fault-tolerant (SPFT) algorithm to achieve fault tolerance and reachable capability. By using the self-pruning approach, SPFT algorithm can reduce the redundant transmissions. In addition, SPFT algorithm selects the stable links in transmission to provide the better success ratio of transmission as well as uses the comparison mechanism to deal with the failure transmissions. By this way, fault tolerance degree can be increased. According to the experimental results, our algorithm has the fault-tolerant capability and offers the benefit of efficiency and reliability for broadcasting in ad hoc wireless network.", "paper_title": "A Reachable and Fault Tolerant Scheme for Broadcast in Ad-Hoc Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000315976100008"}
