For this well-studied problem the Largest Differencing Method of Karmarkar and Karp outperforms other existing polynomial-time approximation algorithms from an average-case perspective. For m >= 3 the worst-case performance of the Largest Differencing Method has remained a challenging open problem. In this paper we show that the worst-case performance ratio is bounded between 4/3 - 1/3(m-1) and 4/3 - 1/3m. For fixed m we establish further refined bounds in terms of n.", "paper_title": "Performance ratios of the Karmarkar-Karp differencing method", "paper_id": "WOS:000242131200002"}
