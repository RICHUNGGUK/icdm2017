Our algorithms have two compelling features: low complexity and sparse solution. Experiments on benchmark data sets show that the proposed algorithm obtains sparse classifiers at a rather low complexity without sacrificing the generalization performance. As validated by the simulation results, FSA-ELM tends to have better scalability and achieves similar or much better generalization performance with much faster learning speed than the traditional ELM algorithm.
