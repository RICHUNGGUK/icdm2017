The proposed features are robust to image rotation, less sensitive to histogram equalization and noise. It comprises of two sets of features: dominant local binary patterns (DLBP) in a texture image and the supplementary features extracted by using the circularly symmetric Gabor filter responses. The dominant local binary pattern method makes use of the most frequently occurred patterns to capture descriptive textural information, while the Gabor-based features aim at supplying additional global textural information to the DLBP features. Through experiments, the proposed approach has been intensively evaluated by applying a large number of classification tests to histogram-equalized, randomly rotated and noise corrupted images in Outex, Brodatz, Meastex, and CUReT texture image databases. Our method has also been compared with six published texture features in the experiments. It is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed method achieves the highest classification accuracy in various texture databases and image conditions.", "paper_title": "Dominant Local Binary Patterns for Texture Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000265091700018"}
