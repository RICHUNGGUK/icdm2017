These methods are promising in that they can automatically discover the low-dimensional nonlinear manifold in a high-dimensional data space and then embed the data points into a low-dimensional embedding space, using tractable linear algebraic techniques that are easy to implement and are not prone to local minima. Despite their appealing properties, these NLDR methods are not robust against outliers in the data, yet so far very little has been done to address the robustness problem. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of an NLDR method called locally linear embedding (LLE). Based on robust estimation techniques, we propose an approach to make LLE more robust. We refer to this approach as robust locally linear embedding (RLLE). We also present several specific methods for realizing this general RLLE approach. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show that RLLE is very robust against outliers. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
