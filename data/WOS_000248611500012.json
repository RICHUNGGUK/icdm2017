Individuals may want to work together across organisation boundaries but do not have much prior knowledge about potential partners. The semantic web and its associated new standards appear very promising as candidates to support a new generation of virtual organisations. Whilst knowledge can be represented in a machine interpretable way, social-like behaviours can be expected in a virtual organisation. In this paper ontology definition techniques from the semantic web are applied to define a virtual state space of a virtual organisation. Actors involved in an organisation, from high level strategy making members to low level physical devices, advertise their skills and local knowledge in a community. A task initiator, with a virtual sensor to perceive the advertised skills and with an adaptive belief model about the community, seeks for the best matched partners for cooperation. The belief model is a fuzzy neural network based on Adaptive Resonance Theory which takes the advertisements of actors as its initial belief and learns actors' actual capabilities through interaction experience. Dynamic alliances can then take place in an automated/semi-automated way that exhibit adaptive ability, self-organisation, unsupervised learning and competition ability. The alliances thus exhibit the inherent characteristics of realistic enterprises or human societies.", "paper_title": "Agent alliance formation using ART-networks as agent belief models", "paper_id": "WOS:000248611500012"}
