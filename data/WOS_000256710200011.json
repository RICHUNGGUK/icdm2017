The decision-making nucleus of the system-system dynamics builder (SD Builder)-is described. The SD Builder is based on a hierarchical object-based representation of a CDS and on a production rules-based representation of discrete processes. It allows the using of on-line simulations, state-graph search, expert systems and other methods for decision making. A conceptual prototype of a sawmill in a timber factory illustrates the concepts described in the paper. In a case of a manufacturing system, the decision-making system makes a part of a manufacturing execution system (MES). (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
