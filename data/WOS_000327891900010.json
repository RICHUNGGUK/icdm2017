We give upper and lower bounds on the number of -dimensional -vertex acyclic tournaments. In addition, we prove that every -vertex -dimensional tournament contains an acyclic subtournament of vertices and the bound is tight. This statement for tournaments (i.e., the case ) is a well-known fact. We indicate a connection between acyclic high-dimensional tournaments and Ramsey numbers of hypergraphs. We investigate as well the inter-relations among various other notions of acyclicity in high-dimensional tournaments. These include combinatorial, geometric and topological concepts.", "paper_title": "On High-Dimensional Acyclic Tournaments", "paper_id": "WOS:000327891900010"}
