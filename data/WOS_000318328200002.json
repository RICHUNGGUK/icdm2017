In past studies, the classical definition of ambiguity has been derived starting from fuzzy set and fuzzy information theories. Our aim is to show that also in the domain of the graphs it is possible to derive a formulation able to capture the same semantic and mathematical concept. To strengthen the theoretical results, we discuss the application of the graph ambiguity concept to the graph classification setting, conceiving a new kind of inexact graph matching procedure. The results prove that the graph ambiguity concept is a characterizing and discriminative property of graphs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
