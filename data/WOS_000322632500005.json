The linear part of the system is identified firstly based on the limited information of the nonlinearity, such as sign information, monotonic information and then, we construct the internal signals to identify the structure and the parameters of the Wiener systems. A novel Particle Swarm Optimization-Rosenbrock (PSO-Rosenbrock) algorithm is developed and the numerical simulation shows that the identification procedure proposed in this paper is effective.
