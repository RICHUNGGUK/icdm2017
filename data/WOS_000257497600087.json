Based on considerations about the expected operating modes of both controllers, the tuning of both inner and outer loop controllers are selected accordingly. This fact motivates the use of a tuning that for the secondary controller that provides a balanced set-point / load-disturbance performance. A new approach is also provided for the assimilation of the inner closed-loop transfer function to a suitable form for tuning of the outer controller. Due to the fact that this inevitably introduces unmodelled dynamics into the design of the primary controller, a robust tuning is needed.", "paper_title": "Balanced PID tuning application to series cascade control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257497600087"}
