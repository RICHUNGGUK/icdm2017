One key point of all critical care for elderly patient is the continuous monitoring of their vital signs. Among these, the ECG signal is used for noninvasive diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Also, there is a pressing need to have a proper system in place for patient identification. Errors in patient identification, and hence improper administration of medication can lead to disastrous results. This paper proposes a novel embedded mobile ECG reasoning system that integrates ECG signal reasoning and RF identification together to monitor an elderly patient. As a result, our proposed method has a good accuracy in heart beat recognition, and enables continuous monitoring and identification of the elderly patient when alone. Moreover, in order to examine and validate our proposed system, we propose a managerial research model to test whether it can be implemented in a medical organization. The results prove that the mobility, usability, and performance of our proposed system have impacts on the user's attitude, and there is a significant positive relation between the user's attitude and the intent to use our proposed system.", "paper_title": "An Embedded Mobile ECG Reasoning System for Elderly Patients", "paper_id": "WOS:000278538300038"}
