Many statistical techniques have been developed for dealing with directional data, but available software for the unique calculations is scarce. This paper describes a MATLAB script, located on the IAMG server, that calculates descriptive statistics and performs inference on azimuthal parameters. The calculations include tests for specific distributions, and tests on the preferred direction and concentration of vectors about this direction. The inference methods use large-sample approximations, plus resampling methods (bootstrap) for smaller sample sizes. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
