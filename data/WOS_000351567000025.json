Li et al. [X. Li et al., Linear Complexity of a New Generalized Cyclotomic Sequence of Order Two of Length pq*, IEICE Trans. Fundamentals, vol.E96-A, no.5, pp.1001-1005, 2013] defined a new modified Jacobi sequence of order two and got its linear complexity. In this corresponding, we determine the linear complexity and minimal polynomials of the new modified Jacobi sequence of order d. Our results show that the sequence is good from the viewpoint of linear complexity.", "paper_title": "On the Linear Complexity of New Modified Jacobi Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567000025"}
