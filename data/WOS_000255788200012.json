It is well known that for the identification of weakly nonlinear systems, despite the spectral regrowth, it suffices to sample the input-output (I/O) data of the system at the Nyquist rate of the input signal. Many applications such as linearization (digital predistortion) and mixed signal simulations require system models at a higher sampling rate than Nyquist. Up to now the construction of such high-rate predistorters has been done by oversampling the corresponding I/O data. This leads to high computational complexity, ill-posedness of the estimation, and high demand on the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling rate for the implementation. This paper discusses an efficient way to obtain high-rate predistorters from low-rate system models and shows the validity of the proposed scheme for a 5th-order complex baseband PA model, where adjacent channel power suppression of 20 dB is achieved.", "paper_title": "A low-rate identification method for digital predistorters based on Volterra kernel interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255788200012"}
