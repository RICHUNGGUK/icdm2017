The thread pitch ranged from 0.5 mm to 1.6 mm. Results suggested that under axial load, the maximum equivalent stresses in cortical bone. cancellous bone and implant-abutment complex decreased by 6.7%, 55.2% and 22.3%, respectively with the variation of thread pitch; and under buccolingual load, 2.7%, 22.4% and 13.0%, respectively. When thread pitch exceeded 0.8 mm, minimum stresses were obtained. Data indicated that cancellous bone was more sensitive to thread pitch than cortical bone did; thread pitch played a great role in protecting dental implant under axial load than under buccolingual load: and thread pitch exceeding 0.8 mm were optimal selection for a screwed implant by biomechanical consideration.
