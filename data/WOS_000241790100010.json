The response of these inhibitory cells depends mainly upon feed-forward LGN inputs. The goal of this study is to determine the role of these cells in modulating the response of simple cells. Here we demonstrate that if the inhibitory contribution due to these cells balances the feed-forward excitatory inputs the spike response of cortical cell becomes sharply tuned. Using a single cell integrate and fire neuron model we show that the ratio of average inhibitory to excitatory conductance controls the balance between excitation and inhibition. We find that many different values of ratio can result in balanced condition. However, the response of the cell is not sharply tuned for each of these ratios. In this study we explicitly determine the best value of ratio needed to make the response of the cell sharply tuned.", "paper_title": "Ratio of average inhibitory to excitatory conductance modulates the response of simple cell", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100010"}
