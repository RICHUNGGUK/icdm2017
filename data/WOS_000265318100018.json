The class of pseudo d-algebras can be included in the class of coupled d-algebras. We show that the class of pseudo d-algebras behaves well with respect to standard mappings such as direct products and standard mappings such as homomorphisms. Indeed, we are able to prove a fundamental theorem of homomorphisms and we are able to identify kernel objects as d-ideals in this theory, We also discuss several large classes of examples of pseudo d-algebras which occur in different settings and we identify properties sufficient for or equivalent to membership in important subclasses of the class of pseudo d-algebras in these settings.
