Identifying clusters can be achieved by optimizing a fitness function that measures the quality of a cluster within the graph. Examples of such cluster measures include the conductance, the local and relative densities, and single cluster editing. We prove that the decision problems associated with the optimization tasks of finding clusters that are optimal with respect to these fitness measures are NP-complete.", "paper_title": "On the NP-completeness of some graph cluster measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000235805500051"}
