The force and torque distribution on the moving magnet array is obtained from an electromagnetic model based on the surface charge method and the Lorentz force and torque integral. The mechanical model is a state-space model derived from FEM. This mechanical model uses the force and torque distribution to determine the deformation of the magnet plate during movement due to the commutated coil set. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
