Convergence to Karush Kuhn Tucker points is proved under the same conditions for NM and monotone algorithms for solving unconstrained and BCOPs. The parallel algorithm has two unique features: all processors exchange information on discrete quasi-minimal points, and are able to sample function values on the whole set of directions that conform to non-negative spanning sets for each decomposed subspace. The parallel algorithm has a high degree of fault tolerance: convergence prevails even if only one processor remains running. Preliminary results are encouraging for solving small- and medium-sized problems.", "paper_title": "On sequential and parallel non-monotone derivative-free algorithms for box constrained optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000325514100005"}
