We show that kappa(2)(FQ(n)) = 3n - 2 for n >= 8; and lambda(2)(FQ(n)) = 3n - 1 for n >= 5. That is, for n >= 8 (resp. n >= 5), at least 3n - 2 vertices (resp. 3n - 1 edges) of FQ(n) are removed to get a disconnected graph that contains no isolated vertices (resp. edges). When the folded hypercube is used to model the topological structure of a large-scale parallel processing system, these results can provide more accurate measurements for reliability and fault tolerance of the system.
