Several methods have been proposed to detect changes in serial conventional MRI but few works have considered Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which is a promising modality for monitoring neurodegenerative disease and particularly Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive framework for detecting changes between two DTI acquisitions by considering different levels of representation of diffusion imaging, namely the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) images, the diffusion tensor fields, and scalar images characterizing diffusion properties such as the fractional anisotropy and the mean diffusivity. The proposed statistical method for change detection is based on the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) that has been derived for the different diffusion imaging representations, based on the core assumption of a Gaussian diffusion model and of an additive Gaussian noise on the ADCs. Results on synthetic and real images demonstrate the ability of the different tests to bring useful and complementary information in the context of the follow-up of MS patients.
