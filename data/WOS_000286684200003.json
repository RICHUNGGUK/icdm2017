Sleep disorders, like any other medical condition potentially affecting the safe performance of essential job functions or the safety of co-workers or the general public, require an individual assessment of the employee diagnosed with the condition to determine medical fitness for service and the necessity of any appropriate reasonable accommodations. The medical fitness assessment is a tool for maximum possible operational safety and the health and safety of all personnel in the railway industry. The article describes relevant international medical fitness standards for railway staff with special rules recommended for mental disorders, disorders of the central nervous system and use of alcohol, drugs, and other psychotropic substances.", "paper_title": "TRANSPORT SAFETY, NEUROBEHAVIORAL DISORDERS AND MEDICAL FITNESS STANDARDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000286684200003"}
