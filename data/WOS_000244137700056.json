By using Lyapunov functions method, some sufficient conditions ensuring global exponential stability of the networks are derived, and the estimated exponential convergence rate is also obtained. A numerical example is given at the end of this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed criteria. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
