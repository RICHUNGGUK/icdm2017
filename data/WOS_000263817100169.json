Additionally, we investigate the effect of the implementation of inflation targeting regime over this relation. The results suggest that the predictive power of the spread varies across time patterns. Inasmuch, the results indicate that the implementation of the inflation target regime was a sine qua non condition for a substantial increase in the predictive power of inflation. Overall, results suggest that wavelets transformations may be very useful in the building of forecasts of important financial variables. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
