After introducing the T-complexity algorithm, we turn our attention to a particular class of \"simple\" finite strings. By exploiting special properties of simple strings, we obtain a fast algorithm to compute the maximum T-complexity among strings of a given length, and our estimates of these maxima show that T-complexity differs asymptotically from Kolmogorov complexity. Finally, we examine how closely de Bruijn sequences resemble strings with high T-complexity.", "paper_title": "Maximizing T-complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000358734200001"}
