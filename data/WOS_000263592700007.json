In this paper we consider the resource allocation challenges that arise in such networks, in particular problems related to construction of end-to-end lightpaths for carrying large multimedia streams. Specifically, we discuss variations of the least cost and widest path problems that address two unique aspects of the user-controlled environment. First, since network resources are exposed for user-control using a service-oriented software control plane, each lightpath is subject to an expiry time. Second, because Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) and resource partitioning introduces multiple redundant paths, classic least cost path computations tend to yield multiple optimal solutions, and so it is useful to break ties among these in a judicious manner. We present polynomial-time path selection techniques that address these issues using efficient data structures. We also show the benefit of breaking ties in shortest path computations in a manner that reduces harmful fragmentation of capacity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
