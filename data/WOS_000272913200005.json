The methods illustrated in this paper, serve to allocate power among the different transmit antennas and the different subcarriers which compose the MIMO OFDM transmitted signal. Several solutions are available to perform power allocation. Frequency domain power allocation, spatial domain power allocation and combined spatial and frequency power allocation are evaluated. We first review and describe the analytical Solution for each power allocation scheme and then evaluate the complexity in terms of both computational operations and BER performances. Simulation results show the performance in term of BER and link the advantage of each possibility of power distribution with the associated complexity.
