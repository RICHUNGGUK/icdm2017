The exact value of linear complexity k(6e)(w) is determined when r = Sigma(w)(i=1) p(ei). Furthermore, an upper bound of the linear complexity is given for the other values of r. Our results show that this sequence has larger linear span than GMW sequence with the same parameters. Finally, the results of a Maple program are included to illustrate the validity of the results.
