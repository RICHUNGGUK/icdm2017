This paper presents the design and implementation of a new, lightweight computational Grid client that provides the same level of functionality and security as its desktop counterparts whilst conforming to the limitations and restrictions of a Personal Digital Assistant environment. A solution has been achieved by taking an architectural perspective of the problem and choosing a tiered, asymmetrical Grid middleware providing an asynchronous messaging model with uniform interface to all resources. The client opens up a new area of Grid computing access: secure and flexible job submission and monitoring to dependable, persistent, powerful and consistent computing services provided by a computational Grid has been freed from static environments into the mobile domain. This has been done without the modification of the underlying Grid middleware and using standards-based protocols and components: J2ME, X.509 certificates, Secure Socket Layer connections and IEEE 802.11b wireless networking.
