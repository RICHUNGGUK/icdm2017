To achieve this, we apply a 3D coordinate to depict the video clip. As the time information representing different frames is considered, the available information is enriched than the single image. Our method takes the global character into account for avoiding visual inconsistencies. We view the video completion problem as a labeling problem and apply the belief propagation algorithm to minimize the energy defined on the label graph. By measuring the similarity between source and target patches, we could discover the appropriate patch to fill the hole. Furthermore, we introduce some techniques to speedup the belief propagation algorithm for gaining better performance efficiency. Examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and the results are encouraging.", "paper_title": "Graph based energy for active object removal", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900021"}
