Currently available approaches to identify expressed or differentially expressed segments in tiling array data are limited in the recovery of the underlying gene structures and require several parameters that are intensity-related or partly dataset-specific. Results: We have developed , a statistical approach that identifies transcribed and differentially expressed segments as significant differences from the background distribution while considering sequence-specific affinity biases and cross-hybridization. It avoids dataset-specific parameters in order to provide better comparability of different tiling array datasets, based on different technologies or array designs. detects highly and differentially expressed segments in biological data with significantly lower false discovery rates under equal sensitivities than commonly used methods. Also, it is clearly superior in the recovery of exon-intron structures. It further provides window z-scores as a normalized and robust measure for visual inspection.", "paper_title": "Detection of differentially expressed segments in tiling array data", "paper_id": "WOS:000304537000008"}
