Furthermore, we study the continuity of the ruled surfaces constructed by linear interpolation between two pairs of C(1)G(2) continuous curves. We give some conditions for the C(1)G(2) continuity of composite surfaces in a shape-blending process. A practical approach is proposed to maintain the C(1)G(2) continuity of Bezier surfaces pairs in a shape-blending process by adjusting the control points along the common boundary of the resulting surface-pair. We finish by proving and justifying the efficiency of the approaching method with some graphical examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
