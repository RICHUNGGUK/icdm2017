We recorded 1492 days of data on several experimental HIS during the French national project \"AILISA\". On these real data, we built a mathematical model of the behavior of the data series, based on \"Hidden Markov Models\" (HMM). The model is then played on a computer to produce simulated data series with added flexibility to adjust the parameters in various scenarios. We also tested several methods to measure the similarity between our real and simulated data. Our simulator can produce large data base which can be further used to evaluate the algorithms to raise an alarm in case of loss in autonomy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
