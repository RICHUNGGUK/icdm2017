It considers the following task: given a function f over a domain D, a property P and a parameter 0 < epsilon < 1, by examining function values of f over o(vertical bar D vertical bar) elements in D, determine whether f satisfies P or differs from any one which satisfies P in at least epsilon vertical bar D vertical bar elements. An algorithm that fulfills this task is called a property tester. We focus on tree-likeness of quartet topologies, which is a combinatorial property originating from evolutionary tree construction. The input function is f(Q), which assigns one of the three possible topologies for every quartet over an n-taxon set S. We say that fQ satisfies tree-likeness if there exists an evolutionary tree T whose induced quartet topologies coincide with f(Q). In this paper, we prove the existence of a set of quartet topologies of error number at least c((n)(4)) for some constant c > 0, and present the first property tester for tree-likeness of quartet topologies. Our property tester makes at most O(n(3)/epsilon) queries, and is of one-sided error and non-adaptive.", "paper_title": "A Property Tester for Tree-Likeness of Quartet Topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000293247300002"}
