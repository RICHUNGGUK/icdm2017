A novel controller design is proposed based on a matrix transformation method with a new equation condition, which can solve the controller gain more easily and avoid complicated calculations of the non-linear matrix inequality. Then, the corresponding criteria can be obtained by combining the matrix transformation method and the ideas of non-uniformly dividing delay interval, which can guarantee the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop systems and calculate the satisfactory controller gain. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme.", "paper_title": "Static output feedback stabilization for systems with time-varying delay based on a matrix transformation method", "paper_id": "WOS:000352217700014"}
