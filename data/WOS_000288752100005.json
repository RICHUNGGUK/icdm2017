It first combines the image gradient and the visual saliency to measure the cost of the seams. Then proposes a method to evaluate the diagonal artifacts in addition to the previous horizontal and vertical artifacts for the forward seam carving method. At last, it develops a simple high-level saliency detection method to constrain the seam carving procedure for protecting the foreground contents. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can improve the visual quality of the re-targeted image and the robustness of the seam carving method. Moreover, the improved method is simple to implement, and can be easily applied to many existing seam carving based image resizing methods.", "paper_title": "Image re-targeting with balanced energy map and foreground constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000288752100005"}
