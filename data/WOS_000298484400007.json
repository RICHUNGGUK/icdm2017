This paper aims at state-of-the-art self-stabilizing flocking control of wireless mobile robots with memory corruption. Flocking of a group of wireless mobile robots has gained a lot of attention due to its wide applications in recent years. While there are few works addressed on fault tolerance issue of flocking, especially for transient failure of robots. However, in the practical applications of robots, for the weak robots, some of their parts, like sensor, moving actuator, or memory etc., are prone to be crashed due to the complex environment. So, it is interesting to explore such kind of component crash or corruption (partly crash), especially for transient failure. The transient failure means the failure is temporary and after a while the robots will not be influenced by outside environment. Specially, in this paper, we mainly focus on how one kind of transient failure-memory corruption affects robot flocking, especially for the existed fault tolerant flocking.
