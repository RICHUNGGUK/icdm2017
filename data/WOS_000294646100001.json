To reduce the number of seeds, a number ofmobile-assisted approaches have been proposed. Current proposed mobile-assisted approaches for localization require special hardware or face route selection problem, however. In this paper, we propose a Mobile-Assisted Monte Carlo Localization (MA-MCL) for WSNs. Our approach relies on direct arriver and leaver information from a single mobile-assisted seed. It does not require any specially designed hardware due to the range-free technique, and the single mobile-assisted seed in our approach can move uncontrollably to avoid route selection problem based on Monte Carlo method. Evaluation results show that the accuracy of MA-MCL outperforms MSL*, MSL, and ADO when all of them use only a mobile seed for localization in the static sensor networks.", "paper_title": "MA-MCL: Mobile-Assisted Monte Carlo Localization for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000294646100001"}
