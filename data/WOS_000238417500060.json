We study the system first by a deterministic fluid model and then by a more detailed Markov chain analysis that allows estimating the life time of the system. In addition, the underlying topology of the network is modelled by a simple geometry. Using the resulting spatio-temporal model we assess how much the resource usage of the network can be reduced, e.g., by selecting the nearest seed for download instead of a random one.", "paper_title": "Analyzing the dynamics and resource usage of P2P file sharing by a spatio-temporal model", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500060"}
