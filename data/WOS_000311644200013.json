In particular, we use a hybrid finite-difference and finite-volume framework that combines the level-set finite difference discretization of Min and Gibou (2007) [13] with the treatment of Robin boundary conditions of Papac et al. (2010) [19] on uniform grids. We present numerical results in two and three spatial dimensions on the diffusion equation and on a Stefan-type problem. In addition, we present an application of this method to the case of the simulation of the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier in the context of epitaxial growth.
