A distributed feed-forward structure and bulk-driven operational transconductance amplifier are used in order to achieve efficient operation at a supply voltage of 0.8 V. Instead of conventional low-voltage amplifier architectures, our design uses folded-cascode amplifiers, although they are not used in most low-voltage circuits. A wide input swing is achieved by using the bulk-driven approach, and the drawback of the limited voltage swing of the cascoded output stage is overcome by the distributed feed-forward modulator. The designed modulator has a dynamic range of 49 dB at a 0.8-V supply voltage and consumes only 816 nW of power for the 250-Hz bandwidth. The core chip size of the modulator is 1000 mu m 9 500 mu m by using the 0.18-mu m standard CMOS process.", "paper_title": "A 0.8-V 816-nW delta-sigma modulator for low-power biomedical applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000275398000011"}
