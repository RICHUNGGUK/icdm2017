Most of the existing codes rely on pseudopotentials in which only valence electrons are treated explicitly. The pseudopotential method can be problematic for systems with localized d- or f-electrons, even for ground-state density-functional theory (OFT) calculations. The situation can become more severe in GW calculations, because pseudo-wavefunctions are used in the computation of the self-energy and the core-valence interaction is approximated at the DFT level. In this work, we present the package FHI-gap, an all-electron GW implementation based on the full-potential linearized augmented planewave plus local orbital (LAPW) method. The FHI-gap code can handle core, semicore, and valence states on the same footing, which allows for a correct treatment of core-valence interaction. Moreover, it does not rely on any pseudopotential or frozen-core approximation. It is, therefore, able to handle a wide range of materials, irrespective of their composition. Test calculations demonstrate the convergence behavior of the results with respect to various cut-off parameters. These include the size of the basis set that is used to expand the products of Kohn-Sham wavefunctions, the number of k points for the Brillouin zone integration, the number of frequency points for the integration over the imaginary axis, and the number of unoccupied states. At present, FHI-gap is linked to the WIEN2k code, and an implementation into the exciting code is in progress. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
