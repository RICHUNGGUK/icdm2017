In this paper we consider a simple yet well-studied process algebra, the Basic Parallel Processes (BPP), and investigate for this class of processes the minimal ordinal a such that The main tool in our investigation is a novel proof of Dickson's Lemma. Unlike classical proofs, the proof we provide gives rise to a tight ordinal bound, of omega(n), on the order type of non-increasing sequences of n-tuples of natural numbers. With this we are able to reduce a longstanding bound on the approximation hierarchy for weak bisimilarity approximate to over BPP, and show that approximate to = approximate to (omega)omega.", "paper_title": "Weak bisimulation approximants", "paper_id": "WOS:000241587300024"}
