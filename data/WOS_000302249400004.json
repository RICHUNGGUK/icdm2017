However, current standard DDRx DIMM memory interfaces are not well tailored to achieve high energy efficiency and performance in modern chip-multiprocessor- based computer systems. Their suboptimal performance and energy inefficiency can have a significant impact on system-wide efficiency since much of the system power dissipation is due to memory power. New memory interfaces, better suited for future many-core systems, are needed. In response, there are recent proposals to enhance the energy efficiency of main-memory systems by dividing a memory rank into subsets, and making a subset rather than a whole rank serve a memory request. We holistically assess the effectiveness of rank subsetting from system-wide performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability perspectives. We identify the impact of rank subsetting on memory power and processor performance analytically, compare two promising rank-subsetting proposals, Multicore DIMM and mini-rank, and verify our analysis by simulating a chip-multiprocessor system using multithreaded and consolidated workloads. We extend the design of Multicore DIMM for high-reliability systems and show that compared with conventional chipkill approaches, rank subsetting can lead to much higher system-level energy efficiency and performance at the cost of additional DRAM devices. This holistic assessment shows that rank subsetting offers compelling alternatives to existing processor-memory interfaces for future DDR systems.", "paper_title": "Improving System Energy Efficiency with Memory Rank Subsetting", "paper_id": "WOS:000302249400004"}
