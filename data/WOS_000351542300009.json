While some substantial progress has been made in this area, there are still several challenges ranging from content evaluation to personalized content generation. In this paper, we present a novel PCG framework based on machine learning, named learning-based procedure content generation (LBPCG), to tackle a number of challenging problems. By exploring and exploiting information gained in game development and public player test, our framework can generate robust content adaptable to end-user or target players on-line with minimal interruption to their gameplay experience. As the data-driven methodology is emphasized in our framework, we develop learning-based enabling techniques to implement the various models required in our framework. For a proof of concept, we have developed a prototype based on the classic open source first-person shooter game, Quake. Simulation results suggest that our framework is promising in generating quality content.", "paper_title": "Learning-Based Procedural Content Generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351542300009"}
