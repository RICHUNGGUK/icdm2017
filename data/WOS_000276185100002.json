The tabu search approach proposed is based on a non-standard formulation using linear system infeasibility. The search space is the set of bases defined on the matrix that describes the linear system. The moves are performed by pivoting on a specified row and column. On real machine learning databases, our approach compares favorably with implementations based on parametric programming and irreducible infeasible constraint sets. Additional computational results for randomly generated instances confirm that our method provides a suitable alternative to the mixed integer programming formulation that is solved by a commercial code when the number of attributes m increases.
