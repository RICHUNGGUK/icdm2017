The decay times in an equation were provided to evaluate afterglow behaviors for material properties. In this study, we searched associated equations and found useful cues from constants in the equations indicating photoluminescence behaviors affected by the experimental conditions as well as the physical properties of a sample. As the boundary conditions are set for an equation, the relationships among the equation's parameters correspond to physical behaviors, such as the initial and long-term intensity and the refraction point. Different thick-film patches were created for various experimental tests, and experimental data was collected from other resources. The results demonstrate that there is a high correlation among the physical parameter alpha(i) and the illuminate intensity, patch thickness, and phosphor density. We report that the tau(i) in the decay curve equation represents the slope change of the curve profile and affects only the declining rate of the curve and not its position, i.e., light intensity. That is, tau(i) may not be the dominant factor in the equation for evaluating the afterglow behavior of a phosphor material. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
