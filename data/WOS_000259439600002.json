This property is very interesting because aromaticity can remain despite the deformation. Theoretical calculations at the density functional theory level were carried out on two such structures containing vanadium and iron centres [(C5H5-V-H)(2)C6H6 and (CpFe)(2)C-6(CH3)(6)] in order to analyze the nature of the bonds as well as the magnitude of the prevalent aromaticity and how this depends on the electronic characteristics around each metal atom. The analysis of aromaticity was carried out on the basis of known methods, such as HOMA and FLU, with consistent results. The results also show features that suggest a possible catalytic behavior of the species under study.", "paper_title": "Electronic analysis of vanadium and iron complexes containing distorted aromatic rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000259439600002"}
