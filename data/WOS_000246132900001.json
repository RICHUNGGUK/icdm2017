Fuzzy TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) has become one of the most widely used fuzzy MADM methods. This paper proposes a new fuzzy TOPSIS to deal with the fuzzy MADM problem under group decisions. This approach employs triangular fuzzy numbers to represent linguistic values for indicating importance weights of chosen attributes and evaluating alternative candidates under different attributes. This approach can overcome the drawbacks shown in existing related Studies, and it can be applied in various domains. A numerical example is also given to demonstrate the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A new fuzzy TOPSIS for fuzzy MADM problems under group decisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000246132900001"}
