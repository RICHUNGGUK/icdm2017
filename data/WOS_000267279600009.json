Mainly based on the fetal electrocardiogram (fECG), it provides the long-term fetal heart rate (fHR) and assessment of the fetal QRS morphology. But the fECG component in ADS is obscured by the maternal ECG (mECG). thus removal of the mECG from ADS improves fECG analysis. This study demonstrates the performance of the event-synchronous interference canceller (ESC) in mECG removal from ADS data, recorded during pregnancy and labor. Its advantage as a compensation method for extended ADS processing is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
