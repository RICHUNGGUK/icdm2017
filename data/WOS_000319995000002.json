In this paper, we consider a cavity optomechanical system where the cavity field is driven by an external field. In the limit of weak mirror-cavity couplings, we calculate analytically the reflection and transmission rates for cavity field and discuss the effects of mirror-cavity coupling on reflection and transmission.", "paper_title": "SINGLE PHOTON REFLECTION AND TRANSMISSION IN OPTOMECHANICAL SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000319995000002"}
