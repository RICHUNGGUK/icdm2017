For a fixed effort oil Alice's part, Bob increases his resources oil the basis of the results for each round (victory. tie or defeat) with the aim of reducing the probability of defeat to below a given threshold. We read this goal in terms of computing a confidence interval for the probability of losing and realize that the moves ill some contests may bring in in indeterminacy trap: in certain games Bob cannot simultaneously have both a low probability-of-defeat measure and it narrow confidence interval. We use the inferential mechanism called twisting argument to compute the above interval oil the basis of two joint statistics. Careful use of such statistics allows us to avoid indeterminacy.
