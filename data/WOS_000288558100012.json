Taking the relationship among the time-varying delay, its upper bound and their difference into account and using It's differential formula, some improved LMI-based delay-dependent stability criteria for stochastic neural networks are obtained without ignoring any terms, which guarantee systems globally robustly stochastically stable in the mean square. Finally, three numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the benefits of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Improved delay-dependent stability analysis for uncertain stochastic neural networks with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000288558100012"}
