The acknowledgement of inherent imprecision in the technical coefficients that describe these interrelationships has led to analysis in both stochastic and fuzzy frameworks. The stochastic approach has enabled the composition of descriptive moments (including mean, standard deviation) on evaluated multiplier values used to inform policy on individual sectors. This paper investigates analogous fuzzy multipliers and their moments within fuzzy closed Leontief input-output systems, utilising two forms for the levels of fuzziness inherent in the systems considered. In particular, we consider the fuzzy defined versions of the following multipliers: output, truncated output and simple household input multipliers. The emphasis is on the visual representation of the empirical results, with the study offering a benchmark elucidation for this type of fuzzy analysis. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
