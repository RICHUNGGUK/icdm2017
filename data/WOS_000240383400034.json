A case-based temperature prediction model is developed for the laminar cooling process using case-based reasoning (CBR) and the dynamical process model. The model parameters for the current operating condition are found by retrieving the most similar cases from the case base according to the current operating condition and reusing the solutions of the retrieved cases. The resulting model can predict the through-thickness temperature evolutions of the moving strip during the cooling process. Experimental studies based on industrial data from a steel company show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach.", "paper_title": "Case-based modeling of the laminar cooling process in a hot rolling mill", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400034"}
