The proposal technique can be utilized as pre-process of various urban planning issues, such as evaluation of facilities location, estimation of road reliability and reduction of air pollution and so on. The proposal model considers the planner stance and user stance in traffic dynamics. From the user stance, it assumed that their path is selected by the traffic resistance, and form the planner stance, they want to minimize the average traffic volume. Thus the formulated model consists of the gravity model about transportation, the flow control and path selection. To solve the problem the maximization of entropy and genetic algorithm are applied. From the results of numerical examples, it is shown that the proposal method can provide a useful evaluation to target network.", "paper_title": "Evaluation and assignment of traffic volume for urban planning based on planner and user stances", "paper_id": "WOS:000255957800015"}
