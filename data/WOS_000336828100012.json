In view of this, the paper first proposes a new PID controller design based on dynamic matrix control (DMC) optimization and then tests it on the residual oil outlet temperature in an industrial coke furnace. The resulting PID controller shows that it has the superior character of DMC algorithm and, at the same time, the simple structure as a traditional PID controller. Since model predictive control is effective in dealing with long time delays and model/plant mismatches, the control performance under the proposed PID is improved compared with typical PID controllers.
