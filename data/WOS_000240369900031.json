This is achieved through the use of biased stochastic multi-particle collisions which depend on local velocities and densities and conserve momentum and kinetic energy. The equation of state is derived and it is shown that the requirement of thermodynamic consistency imposes a severe restriction on the choice of collision probability, p(A). The consequences of various choices for p(A) are discussed in detail. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
