Each expert has a view of the system and she uses domain specific languages in order to express solutions to the problems she is concerned with. In this way, the final system can be seen as a combination of a number of complementary views, each of which focuses on problems of a different nature. However, such views are expressed with different specification tools so that they have to be integrated to produce a common design that is complete and consistent. Creating a common language encompassing multi-disciplinary design views is a challenging endeavor but it might impose a cognitive overload to each member of the group who is exposed to unfamiliar concepts of other disciplines in her design view. Alternatively, this paper describes an approach called MODUWEB that consists of letting each designer use the tool she is proficient in for her design tasks and then complementary design perspectives are integrated using meta-modeling techniques. MODUWEB also includes a number of constraints and semantic rules that guarantee the completeness and consistency of the resulting model.", "paper_title": "A Meta-modeling based Approach for the Multi-Disciplinary Design of Web Educational Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000269281800003"}
