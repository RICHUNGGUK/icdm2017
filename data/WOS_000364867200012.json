The main idea of the method is to treat ice as a set of discrete objects with very simple properties, and to model the system mechanics mainly as a set of discrete contact and failure events. In this way it becomes possible to parallelize the problem, so that a very large number of ice floes can be modeled. This approach is called the Ice Event Mechanics Modeling (IEMM) method which builds a system solution from a large set of discrete events occurring between a large set of discrete objects. The simulator is developed using the NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). This paper also describes the execution of experiments to evaluate the performance of the simulator and to validate the numerical modeling of ship operations in pack ice. Our results show speed up of 11 times, reducing simulation time for a large ice field (9,801 floes) from over 2 hours to about 12 minutes.", "paper_title": "Hyper-Real-Time Ice Simulation and Modeling Using GPGPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000364867200012"}
