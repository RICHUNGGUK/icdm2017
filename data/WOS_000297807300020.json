Almost all known low ML decoding complexity STBCs can be obtained via this approach. New full- diversity STBCs with low ML decoding complexity and cubic shaping property are constructed, via codes over K, for number of transmit antennas N = 2(m), m >= 1, and rates R > 1 complex symbols per channel use. When R = N, the new STBCs are information- lossless as well. The new class of STBCs have the least knownML decoding complexity among all the codes available in the literature for a large set of (N, R) pairs.", "paper_title": "Low ML Decoding Complexity STBCs via Codes Over the Klein Group", "paper_id": "WOS:000297807300020"}
