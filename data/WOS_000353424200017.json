Nanotubes are special type of fullerene graphs determined by a vector (p, q). We show that the diameter of a (p, q)-nanotubical fullerene graph is essentially n/(p+q). In addition, we determine the diameter of (9, 0)-isolated pentagon nanotubes.", "paper_title": "On Diameter of Nanotubical Fullerene Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000353424200017"}
