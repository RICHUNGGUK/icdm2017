These formulas rely on plane binary trees. We extend all the results, in particular the relation between the probability and the complexity of a function, to more general formula structures: non-binary or non-plane trees. These formulas satisfy the natural properties of associativity and commutativity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
