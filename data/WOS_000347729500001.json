Automated tools and methods may reuse some modules to develop malware variants, so these reused modules can be used to classify malware or to identify malware families. Therefore, similarities may exist among malware variants can be analyzed and used for malware variant detections and the family classification. This paper proposes a new malware family classification method by converting binary files into images and entropy graphs. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively distinguish malware families.", "paper_title": "Malware analysis using visualized images and entropy graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000347729500001"}
