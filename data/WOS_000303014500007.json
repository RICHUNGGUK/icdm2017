Specifically, an annotation-based programming model, called Mint, and its accompanying source-to-source translator are used to automatically generate CUDA source code and simplify the exploration of performance tradeoffs.", "paper_title": "Accelerating a 3D Finite-Difference Earthquake Simulation with a C-to-CUDA Translator", "paper_id": "WOS:000303014500007"}
