A popular trend in this research stream is examination of the impact of performance confirmation on usefulness (or playfulness) and satisfaction in the context of organizational information system usage or free website access. However, studying the positive attitude of consumers alone is inadequate, especially when access to the products or services is not without cost. That is, costs or sacrifices should be taken into account so as to clarify the antecedents of continuance intention. Based on this idea, this study took the \"net value\" concept from the value-based model and incorporated it into ECT in order to provide a more comprehensive viewpoint. We argue that continuance intention is determined by net value, a thorough comparison of benefits and costs, and satisfaction, which is also a function of net value. After collecting data from 172 IPTV customers, we confirmed all proposed hypotheses. The results show that perceived net value, a function of perceived sacrifices and perceived benefits, is a strong predictor of satisfaction and continuance intention. Discussions and implications for academics and practitioners are also provided. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
