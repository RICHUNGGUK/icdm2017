The decoder with EC engine is designed to reduce the power consumption and memory bandwidth requirement since memory accesses are reduced. In the motion compensator, a boundary judgment scheme for reference pixel fetching is proposed to provide seamless integration in HDTV video decoder for the block-based EC engines. Furthermore, a buffer sharing mechanism is adopted to reduce extra memory requirement involved by EC. The reference pixel fetching unit costs only 17.3 K logic gates when the working frequency is set to 166.7 MHz. On average, when decoding HD1080 video sequence, 30% memory access reduction and 24% memory power consumption saving are achieved when a near lossless EC algorithm is integrated in the video decoder. In other words, the proposed motion compensator makes the EC engine an integral part of a memory reduced decoder without extra cost. Additionally, since the work in this paper is based on EC schemes, the EC design criterion are discussed, and several useful rules on the selection of EC algorithm are addressed for the video decoder of corresponding VLSI architecture.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of motion compensator in memory reduced HDTV decoder with embedded compression engine", "paper_id": "WOS:000300189700010"}
