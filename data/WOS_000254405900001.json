The proposed BPC algorithm adopts the techniques of coding pass prediction and parallel & pipeline to reduce the number of accessing memory and to increase the ability of concurrently processing of the system, where all the coefficient bits of a code block could be coded by only one scan. A new parallel bit plane architecture (PA) was proposed to achieve word-level sequential coding. Moreover, an efficient high-speed architecture (HA) was presented to achieve multi-word parallel coding. Compared to the state of the art, the proposed PA could reduce the hardware cost more efficiently, though the throughput retains one coefficient coded per clock. While the proposed HA could perform coding for 4 coefficients belonging to a stripe column at one intra-clock cycle, so that coding for an NxN code-block could be completed in approximate N (2/4) intra-clock cycles. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed designs have high throughput rate with good performance in terms of speedup to cost, which can be good alternatives for low power applications.", "paper_title": "High performance word level sequential and parallel coding methods and architectures for bit plane coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000254405900001"}
