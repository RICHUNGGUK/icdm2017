The idea is to autocomplete typed text into ontological categories instead of words in a vocabulary. The idea has been implemented and its application for semantic indexing and content-based information retrieval in multi-facet search is proposed. Four operational semantic portals on the web using the implementation are presented as application cases.", "paper_title": "Semantic autocompletion", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800072"}
