The measurements from diffusion MRI provide unique clues for extracting orientation information of brain white matter fibers and can be potentially used to infer the brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), currently the most widely used technique, fails to extract multiple fiber orientations in regions with complex microstructure. In order to overcome this limitation of DTI, a variety of reconstruction algorithms have been introduced in the recent past. One of the key ingredients in several model-based approaches is deconvolution operation which is presented in a unified deconvolution framework in this paper. Additionally' some important computational issues in solvin the deconvolution problem that are not addressed adequately in previous studies are described in detail here. Further, we investigate several deconvolution schemes towards achieving stable, sparse, and accurate solutions. Experimental results on both simulations and real data are presented. The comparisons empirically suggest that nonnegative least squares method is the technique of choice for the multifiber reconstruction problem in the presence of intravoxel orientational heterogeneity.", "paper_title": "A unified computational framework for deconvolution to reconstruct multiple fibers from diffusion weighted MRI", "paper_id": "WOS:000250897700006"}
