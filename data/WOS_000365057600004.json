Simultaneously, the dominant mode of content access in Internet is materializing as IP-based broadband wireless networks with advanced user devices and ubiquitous mobile systems. Current caching-based solutions largely focus on improving the efficiency of content delivery while mostly overlooking energy efficiency aspects. However, the expanding networking infrastructure is expected to be more energy-efficient conforming to \"green communications\" concept while serving burgeoning traffic demands. Motivated by this concern, we study caching at the edge of an infrastructure-based mobile network supporting ICN with a focus on energy consumption of the considered system. We devise a greedy heuristic for cache management which incorporates energy reward, popularity, Time-To-Live (TM) and delay (i.e. chunk loss due to delay sensitivity) factors. Our numerical analysis proves the energy savings achieved by the proposed greedy approach with low-complexity operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
