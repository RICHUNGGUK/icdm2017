We show that the existence of a particular family of subsets allows the recycling of random bits for constant-round private protocols. More precisely, we show that after a 1-round initialization phase during which random bits are distributed among n players, it is possible to perform each of the k XOR computations using two rounds of communication. For t <= c root n/log n, for any c < 1/2, we design a protocol that uses O(kt(2) log n) random bits.", "paper_title": "Low-randomness constant-round private XOR computations", "paper_id": "WOS:000251572200002"}
