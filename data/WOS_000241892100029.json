A lower complex filter banks are desired for their effective implementation. In this paper, we address a problem how to design low complex filter banks. A perfect restructure (PR) filter banks can be factorized by lifting steps and the procedure of factorization are described as multi-fork tree-structure. A heuristic-searching algorithm was proposed for finding the optimization PR filter banks with low dynamical coefficients. The given examples show the proposed method is effective.", "paper_title": "Heuristic searching algorithm for design structurally perfect reconstruction low complex filter banks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100029"}
