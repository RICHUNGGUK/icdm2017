Bounds on the dimension of the auxiliary system needed to optimally distinguish quantum Operations are known in several situations. For instance, the dimension of the auxiliary space never needs to exceed the dimension of the input space [23, 14] of the operations for optimal distinguishability, while no auxiliary system whatsoever is needed to optimally distinguish unitary operations [2, 6]. Another bound, which follows front work of R. Timoney [24]. is that optimal distinguishability is always possible when the dimension of the auxiliary system is twice the number of operators needed to express the difference between the quantum operations in Kraus form. This paper provides an alternate proof of this fact that is based oil concepts and tools that are familiar to quantum information theorists.", "paper_title": "Distinguishing quantum operations having few Kraus operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000258699300010"}
