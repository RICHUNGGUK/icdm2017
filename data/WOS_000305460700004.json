However, the traditional PF algorithm based on sequential importance sampling with re-sampling will degenerate if the latest observation appear in the tail of the prior PDF or if the observation likelihood is too peaked in comparison with the prior. In this paper, we propose an improved particle filter which makes full use of the latest observation in constructing the proposal distribution. The quality prediction function is proposed to measure the quality of the particles, and only the high quality particles are selected and used to generate the coarse proposal distribution. Then, a centroid shift vector is calculated based on the coarse proposal distribution, which leads the particles move towards the optimal proposal distribution. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm under the challenging background conditions.
