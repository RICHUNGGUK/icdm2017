This analysis becomes more crucial when a high level of quality of service is required. The performance of a multi-hop amplify-and-forward relaying system on Nakagami-0.5 channels is considered. First, it is shown that the harmonic mean of independent gamma random variables with shape parameter 0.5 has again gamma distribution with the same shape parameter. Then, using this fact, closed-form expressions giving accurate approximations for the outage probability, the average symbol error probability, and the ergodic capacity of the multi-hop relaying system are derived. The analytical results are verified by simulations.", "paper_title": "Multi-Hop Amplify-and-Forward Relaying on Nakagami-0.5 Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696100008"}
