Using VE for sensorimotor training is more challenging, in particular with the difficulty of transferring the task learned in the virtual world to the real. Of special concern for the successful transfer is the adequate combination of training experience protocols and the delivery modes of multimodal feedback. Analyzing feedback in terms of information exchange, this work discusses different feedback combinations and their application to virtual reality training of rowing skills.", "paper_title": "Feedback, Affordances, and Accelerators for Training Sports in Virtual Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000289932700004"}
