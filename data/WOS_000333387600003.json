For a long time, the only known non-trivial approach to approximate this problem is the tree-embedding method initiated by Bartal (FOCS 1996). In this paper, we give a thoroughly different approximation approach for the problem with approximation ratio , where q is the number of source terminals in the problem instance. Our approach is based on a mixed strategy of LP-rounding and the greedy method. When the number q (which is always at most n) is relatively small (say, q=o(log(2) n)), our approximation ratio is better than the currently known best ratio O(logn), where n is the number of vertices in the input graph.", "paper_title": "A new approximation algorithm for the Selective Single-Sink Buy-at-Bulk problem in network design", "paper_id": "WOS:000333387600003"}
