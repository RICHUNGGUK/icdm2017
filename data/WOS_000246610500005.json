A formulation of this method with Lagrange multipliers defined on (semi-)infinite space is presented and analyzed in a domain decomposition context. The implementation aspects of this method in a parallel industrial acoustic software (SYSNOISE) are described in details. Numerical results show the computational efficiency of this method on acoustic scattering problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
