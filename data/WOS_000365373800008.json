In this paper, a model for classification of proteins in the COG categories based on characteristic amino acid n-grams is proposed. A novel method, based on Boolean algebra, for extracting n-grams which characterize proteins belonging to a certain COG category is presented. The presented method significantly reduces the number of processed n-grams, which implies the reduction of required storage space and processing time. The obtained results show that the proteins of a certain COG category contain n-grams which satisfy specific patterns; such n-grams are unique, related to different COG categories. The model for classification based on the proposed method assigns a correct COG category to a protein with the confidence of 96%.", "paper_title": "n-Gram Analysis of COG Categorized Protein Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000365373800008"}
