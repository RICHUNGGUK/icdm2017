The problem is discretized by a convergent, unconditionally stable finite element method. A multigrid preconditioned Uzawa type method for the solution of the algebraic system resulting from the discretized Maxwell's equations is constructed. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on numerical experiments and the results are compared to those obtained by simplified models. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
