The choice of activation function is the main challenge in the analysis of CVNNs. Therefore, we chosen the real-imaginary-type activation function for the considered CVNNs. Some new sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that existence of [(2 alpha+1)(2 beta+ 1)](n)(alpha, beta >= 1) equilibrium points in which [(alpha+1)(beta+1)](n) equilibrium points are locally mu-stable and the remaining equilibrium points [(2 alpha+1)(2 beta+1)](n) - [(alpha+1)([beta+1)(n) are unstable for the considered CVNNs. Based on our main results, we can derive some stability conditions such as multiple exponential stability, multiple power stability, multiple log-stability and multiple log-log-stability. Finally, numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of our theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
