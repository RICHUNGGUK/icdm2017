The fully integrated passive transponder, whose reading distance more than 3 m at 4 W (36 dBm) EIRP with an antenna gain less than 1.5 dBi, is powered by the received RF energy. There are no external components, except for the antenna. The transponder IC includes matching network, rectifier, regulator, power on reset circuit, local oscillator, bandgap reference, AM demodulator, backscatter, control logic and memory. The IC is fabricated using Chartered 0.35 mu m two-poly four-metal CMOS process with Schottky diodes and EEPROM supported. The die size is 1.5 mm x 1.0 mm.", "paper_title": "Design and analysis of a low power passive UHF RFID transponder IC", "paper_id": "WOS:000286933900007"}
