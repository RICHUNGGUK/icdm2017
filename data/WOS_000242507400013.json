Both methods provide accurate visual quality control under buffer constraints. Frames of the same scene usually have the similar rate-distortion (R-D) characters. The proposed methods predict the R-D models of uncoded frames forwardly or bilaterally according to those of coded frames. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms offer visual quality improvements over similar competing methods and save a large amount of memory simultaneously.", "paper_title": "Two efficient rate control algorithms for motion JPEG2000", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507400013"}
