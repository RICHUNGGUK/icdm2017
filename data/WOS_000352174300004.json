An increasing number of users has led to the requirement of a job scheduling process, which can benefit them through optimizing their utility functions. On the other hand, resource providers are exploring strategies suitable for economically efficient resource allocation so that they can maximize their profit through satisfying more users. In such a scenario, economic-based resource management strategies (economic models) have been found to be compelling to satisfy both communities. However, existing research has identified that different economic models are suitable for different scenarios in Grid computing. The Grid application and resource models are typically very dynamic, making it challenging for a particular model for delivering stable performance all the time. In this work, our focus is to develop an adaptive resource management architecture capable of dealing with multiple models based on the models' domains of strengths (DOS). Our preliminary results show promising outcomes if we consider multiple models rather than relying on a single model throughout the life cycle of a Grid. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
