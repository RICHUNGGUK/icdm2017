In the decision making process, to deal with fuzziness and hesitation, the decision criteria provided by decision makers may take the form of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In this paper, we propose an automatic ranking approach for MCGDM under an intuitionistic fuzzy environment. We first propose a new method for the construction of an intuitionistic fuzzy outranking relation to exploit a ranking problem. Then we extend the intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE III method to take into account group decision techniques and develop an automatic approach to achieving group opinion satisfaction, which can avoid forcing the decision makers to modify their decision matrices. Finally, a numerical example for supplier evaluation is provided to elucidate the details of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "An automatic ranking approach for multi-criteria group decision making under intuitionistic fuzzy environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000359162800004"}
