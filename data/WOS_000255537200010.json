In designing and analyzing cryptosystems and protocols, mathematical concepts are critical in supporting the claim that the intended cryptosystem is secure. Most early cryptographic algorithms are based either on factorization or on discrete logarithm problem. Such systems generally adopt rather simple mathematics, and, therefore, need extensive secondary index computation. This study discusses quantum cryptosystems, protection of system security, and optimization of system efficiency. Quantum cryptography detects intrusion and wiretap. In quantum mechanics, a wiretap is neither external nor passive; rather it modifies its entity based on the internal component of the system. The status of the quantum system changes once a wiretap is detected. Hence, only the designer of the system can discover the quantum status of the system; an eavesdropper can neither determine the quantum state nor duplicate the system. The quantum cryptosystem can achieve unconditional security, and thus guarantees secure communication. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
