In these two cases, the nonlinearity of these functions is a main concept. Carlet, Olejar and Stanek gave an asymptotic lower bound for the nonlinearity of most of them, and I gave an asymptotic upper bound which was strictly larger. In this article, I improve the bounds and get an exact limit for the nonlinearity of most of Boolean functions. This article is inspired by a paper of G. Halasz about the related problem of real polynomials with random coefficients.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic nonlinearity of Boolean functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000237657200004"}
