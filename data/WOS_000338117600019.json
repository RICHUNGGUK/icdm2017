As examples we give lexicodes over and . It is shown that this construction produces many optimal codes over rings and also good binary codes. Some of these codes meet the Gilbert bound. We also obtain optimal self-dual codes, in particular the octacode.", "paper_title": "Lexicodes over rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000338117600019"}
