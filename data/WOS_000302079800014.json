In this paper, three types of generalized cyclotomy of order two are described and three classes of cyclic codes of length n(1)n(2) and dimension (n(1)n(2) + 1)/2 are presented and analyzed, where n(1) and n(2) are two distinct primes. Bounds on their minimum odd-like weight are also proved. Some of the codes presented in this paper are among the best cyclic codes.", "paper_title": "Cyclotomic Constructions of Cyclic Codes With Length Being the Product of Two Primes", "paper_id": "WOS:000302079800014"}
