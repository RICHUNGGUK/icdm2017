The current study argues that this approach demands improvements for two reasons: (1) this tactic may be biased, since past studies have only examined the single trait of innovativeness and its impact on an individual adoption intention and (2) the organisational implementation intention might be more important than the individual adoption intention, but the former has been largely ignored in the existing literature. Based on the case of business intelligence (BI) systems and data from 62 senior managers, this study is a pioneer in that it empirically reveals that managers' individual adoption intention is distinct from their organisational implementation intention. Further, while managers' innovativeness may be a significant determinant of their individual adoption intention towards BI systems, the issue of whether managers actually implement BI systems in their organisations is dominated by their involvement characteristics. Fruitful suggestions are proposed for practitioners and scholars.", "paper_title": "Distinguishing the adoption of business intelligence systems from their implementation: the role of managers' personality profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000341807700008"}
