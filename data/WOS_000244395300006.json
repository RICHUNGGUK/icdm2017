By constructing a novel Lyapunov functional, new sufficient criteria for the existence of a unique equilibrium and global exponential stability of the network are derived. These criteria are all independent of the magnitudes of delays, and so the delays under these conditions are harmless. Those results are shown to generalize the previous global exponential stability results derived in the literature. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
