The mutual information criterion may be used in that context, but it suffers from the difficulty of its estimation through a finite set of samples. Efficient estimators are not designed specifically to be applied in a classification context, and thus suffer from further drawbacks and difficulties. This paper presents an estimator of mutual information that is specifically designed for classification tasks, including multi-class ones. It is combined to a recently published stopping criterion in a traditional forward feature selection procedure. Experiments on both traditional benchmarks and on an industrial functional classification problem show the added value of this estimator. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
