However, the original authentication scheme for SIP-based service typically uses HTTP Digest authentication protocol, which is s not providing security at an acceptable level. In this paper, we propose a secure and practical password-only authenticated key agreement scheme for SIP using elliptic curve cryptography(ECC). Our scheme is remarkable efficient and quite simple to use. And yet we can provide the rigorous proof of the security for it. Therefore, the end result is more suited to be a candidate for SIP authentication scheme. In addition, we also suggest an extended scheme capable of providing anonymity, privacy, and location privacy to protect the user's personal information and his real identity.", "paper_title": "Practical authentication scheme for SIP", "paper_id": "WOS:000313413100005"}
