Due to its extensibility it also serves as a development framework for knowledge intensive applications. On the surface, OntoWiki is a generic user interface for arbitrary RDF knowledge graphs. It supports the navigation through RDF knowledge bases using SPARQL-generated lists, tables and trees (e.g. class trees and taxonomies). All resources are automatically represented as hyperlinks and backlinks are created whenever feasible, thus enabling users to easily traverse entire knowledge graphs. Since all collections of resources displayed in OntoWiki are generated by SPARQL queries, they can be further refined by applying additional filters. In order to explore large datasets, a comprehensive statistical data management and visualization method was integrated. We render an architectural overview and explain the navigation, exploration and visualization features provided for RDF based information and derived statistics. To showcase the versatility of OntoWiki and its various deployments in the Linked Data Web, we describe some large-scale use cases in the domains of enterprise data integration, governmental data publication and digital humanities. This article is the first comprehensive presentation of OntoWiki summarizing the advancements after the initial publication in 2006 [4].", "paper_title": "OntoWiki - An authoring, publication and visualization interface for the Data Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000357875500002"}
