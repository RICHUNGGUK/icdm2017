In this study, we propose a multi-object virtual machine location selection algorithm (MOVMLSA) based on group information, doubly linked list structure and genetic algorithm. On the basis of the collaboration of multi-dimensional resources, a fitness function is designed using fuzzy logic control parameters, which can be used to optimize search space solutions. In the location selection process, an orderly information code based on group and resource information can be generated by adopting the memory mechanism of biological immune systems. This approach, along with the dominant elite strategy, enables the updating of the population. The tournament selection method is used to optimize the operator mechanisms of the single-point crossover and X-point mutation during the population selection. Such a method can be used to obtain an optimal solution for the rapid location selection of virtual machines. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in reducing the number of used physical machines and in improving the resource utilization of physical machines. The algorithm improves the utilization degree of multi-dimensional resource synergy and reduces the comprehensive unit cost of resources.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Virtual Machine Location Selection Mechanism in Distributed Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000370180200003"}
