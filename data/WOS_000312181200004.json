Initially, revolutionaries and then spies occupy vertices. In each subsequent round, each revolutionary may move to a neighboring vertex or not move, and then each spy has the same option. The revolutionaries win if m of them meet at some vertex having no spy (at the end of a round); the spies win if they can avoid this forever. Let sigma T (G, m. r) denote the minimum number of spies needed to win. To avoid degenerate cases, assume [V(G)] >= r - m + 1 >= [r/m] >= 1. The easy bounds are then [r/m] <= sigma (G, m, r) <= r - m + 1. We prove that the lower bound is sharp when G has a rooted spanning tree T such that every edge of G not in T joins two vertices having the same parent in T. As a consequence, sigma (G, m, r) <= gamma (G) [r/m], where gamma(G) is the domination number; this bound is nearly sharp when gamma(G) <= m. For the random graph with constant edge-probability p, we obtain constants c and c' (depending on m and p) such that sigma (G, m, r) is near the trivial upper bound when r < c In n and at most c' times the trivial lower bound when r > c' In n. For the hypercube Q(d) with d >= r, we have sigma (G, m, r) = r - m + 1 when m = 2, and for m >= 3 at least r - 39m spies are needed. For complete k-partite graphs with partite sets of size at least 2r, the leading term in sigma (G. m, r) is approximately k/k-1 r/m. when k >= m. For k = 2, we have sigma (G, 2, r) = [[7r/2]-3/5] and sigma (G, 3, r) = [r/2], and in general 3r/2m -3 <= sigma (G, m, r) <= (1+1/root 3)r/m. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
