The standard interpretation for such configurations induces a fixed-point constraint on the function modeling the component involved. We define strictly causal functions formally, and show that the corresponding fixed-point problem does not always have a well defined solution. We examine the relationship between these functions and the functions that are strictly contracting with respect to a generalized distance function on signals, and argue that these strictly contracting functions are actually the functions that one ought to be interested in. We prove a constructive fixed-point theorem for these functions, introduce a corresponding induction principle, and study the related convergence process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
