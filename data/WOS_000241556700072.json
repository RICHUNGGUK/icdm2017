Due to the large volume of multi-spectral data associated with the technique, it is often difficult to find the best combination of parameters to maximize the contrast between different tissue types. This paper presents a novel framework for the characterization of tissue compositions based on the use of time resolved fluorescence imaging without the explicit modeling of the decays. The composition is characterized through soft clustering based on manifold embedding for reducing the dimensionality of the datasets and obtaining a consistent differentiation scheme for determining intrinsic constituents of the tissue. The proposed technique has the benefit of being fully automatic, which could have significant advantages for automated histopathology and increasing the speed of intraoperative decisions. Validation of the technique is carried out with both phantom data and tissue samples of the human pancreas.", "paper_title": "Tissue characterization using dimensionality reduction and fluorescence imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700072"}
