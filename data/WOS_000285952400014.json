This paper shows that dim(beta) (S) and its dual Dim(beta)(S), the strong dimension of S with respect to beta, can be used in conjunction with randomness to measure the similarity of two probability measures alpha and beta on Sigma. Specifically, we prove that the divergence formula dim(beta)(R) = Dim(beta)(R) = H(alpha)/H(alpha) + D(alpha parallel to beta) holds whenever alpha and beta are computable, positive probability measures on Sigma and R is an element of Sigma(infinity) is random with respect to alpha. In this formula, H(alpha) is the Shannon entropy of alpha, and D(alpha parallel to beta) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between alpha and beta. We also show that the above formula holds for all sequences R that are a-normal (in the sense of Borel) when dim(beta)(R) and Dim(beta)(R) are replaced by the more effective finite-state dimensions dim(beta)(R) and Dim(FS)(beta)(R). In the course of proving this, we also prove finite-state compression characterizations of dim(FS)(beta)(S) and Dim(FS)(beta)(S).
