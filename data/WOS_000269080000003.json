To analyze and compare these complex three-dimensional structures it is important to develop suitable methods. We review the so called tree-edit-distance known from theoretical computer science and use this distance to define dissimilarity measures for neuronal cells. This measure intrinsically respects the tree-shape. It compares only those parts of two dendritic trees that have similar position in the whole tree. Therefore it can be interpreted as a generalization of methods using vector valued measures. Moreover, we show that our new measure, together with cluster analysis, is a suitable method for analyzing three-dimensional shape of hippocampal and cortical cells.", "paper_title": "The Tree-Edit-Distance, a Measure for Quantifying Neuronal Morphology", "paper_id": "WOS:000269080000003"}
