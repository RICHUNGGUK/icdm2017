The objectives are to minimize the makespan, total machine load, and total completion time. We show that all the problems are strongly NP-hard with an arbitrary number of machines and NP-hard in the ordinary sense with a fixed number of machines. For the former two problems. we prove that there exists no polynomial time approximation algorithm with a constant worst-case bound when the number of machines is arbitrary unless P = NP. When the number of machines is fixed, we propose two similar fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for the former two problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
