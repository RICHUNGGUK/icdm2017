Current prototyping methods lack facilities to simulate such flexible touch screen displays and the interaction with them. In this paper, we present a technique that provides product developers a tool to interactively simulate products featuring flexible displays, using Augmented Reality and Haptics. This GPU-based algorithm is computationally inexpensive and efficient to deform a polygonal mesh in real time while maintaining an acceptable haptic feedback. The implementation of the algorithm has been found to be successful when applied to a variety of product simulations. This simulation tool can enhance or even replace traditional prototyping and facilitate testing of the prototype at various stages of the design cycle.", "paper_title": "Prototyping flexible touch screen devices using collocated haptic-graphic elastic-object deformation on the GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000300657600005"}
