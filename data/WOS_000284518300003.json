We investigate the interpolation of geometric Hermite data consisting of end points, tangents, and curvatures by monotone helical quintics. Based on the Hopf map model for spatial Pythagorean-hodograph curves, which subsume polynomial helices, we show that the geometric Hermite interpolation can be determined by solving a certain univariate polynomial equation of degree twelve.
