This improved GA presents an effective and accurate fitness function, improves genetic operators of conventional genetic algorithms and proposes a new genetic modification operator. Moreover, the improved GA, compared with conventional GAs, is better at avoiding the problem of local optimum and has an accelerated convergence rate. The use of a co-evolution mechanism takes into full account the cooperation between populations, which avoids collision between mobile robots and is conductive for each mobile robot to obtain an optimal or near-optimal collision-free path. Simulations are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the improved GA and the effectiveness of CIGA. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
