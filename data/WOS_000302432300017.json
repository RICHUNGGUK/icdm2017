Most service firms realize that, in order to evolve an efficient and effective service supply chain, service supply chain management needs to be assessed for its performance. A literature review was conducted on performance measurement issues of service supply chains. This paper develops a framework of service supply chain performance measurement. Based on the strategic, tactical and operational level performance in a service supply chain, measures and metrics are discussed. The emphasis is on performance measures dealing with service supply chain processes such as demand management, customer relationship management, supplier relationship management, capacity and resource management, service performance, information and technology management and service supply chain finance. And to prioritize service supply chain performance measurement indicators to improve service supply chain performance, a methodology based on the extent fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is stressed. The developed framework of service supply chain performance measurement is applied to the hotel supply chain. The results of this study are useful both to practitioners in the service supply chain and to researchers carrying out further studies in the field. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
