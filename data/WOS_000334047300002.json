The decoupling procedure in differential and algebraic part is based on the projector and matrix chain which leads to the definition of tractability index. The differential part can be reduced by using any MOR method, we use Krylov-based projection methods to illustrate our approach. The reduction on the differential part induces a reduction on the algebraic part. In this paper, we present the method for index-1 differential-algebraic equations. We implement numerically this procedure and show numerical evidence of its validity.", "paper_title": "Index-aware model order reduction for differential-algebraic equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000334047300002"}
