However, establishing a SPL is not a simple matter, and can affect all aspects of the organization, since the approach is complex and involves major investment and considerable risk. These risks can have a negative impact on the expected ROI for an organization, if SPL is not sufficiently managed. This paper presents a mapping study of Risk Management (RM) in SPL Engineering. We analyzed a set of thirty studies in the field. The results points out the need for risk management practices in SPL, due to the little research on RM practices in SPL and the importance of identifying insight on RM in SPL. Most studies simply mention the importance of RM, however the steps for managing risk are not clearly specified. Our findings suggest that greater attention should be given, through the use of industrial case studies and experiments, to improve SPL productivity and ensure its success. This research is a first attempt within the SPL community to identify, classify, and manage risks, and establish mitigation strategies.", "paper_title": "RISK MANAGEMENT IN SOFTWARE PRODUCT LINE ENGINEERING: A MAPPING STUDY", "paper_id": "WOS:000322397000006"}
