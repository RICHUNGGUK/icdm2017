Here we develop a true or exact (as opposed to one based on time binning) principal components analysis for preliminary processing of multivariate point processes. We provide a maximum likelihood estimator, an algorithm for maximization involving steepesi ascent on two Stiefel manifolds, and novel constrained asymptotic analysis. The method is illustrated with a simulation and compared with a binning approach.", "paper_title": "Point-Process Principal Components Analysis via Geometric Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000312036200004"}
