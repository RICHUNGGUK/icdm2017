The process of creating and evaluating projects is an initial activity in implementing six sigma. This paper aims at proposing a comprehensive methodology for the evaluation and selection of the six sigma projects. For the evaluation of projects, reviewing the literature and decision team's opinion, we identified three main categories of criteria including business criteria, technological & process criteria and financial criteria which contain eight sub-criteria. For deriving the overall utility of projects, we designed an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system which is capable to consider interrelations among criteria. Then, applying a fuzzy weighted additive goal programming model, we obtained the optimal portfolio of projects which should be implemented. Finally, we applied the proposed model in a leading company in Iran to illustrate the applicability of the model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
