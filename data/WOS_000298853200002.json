In particular, it describes a method that allows decision-making (selecting the adaptation to perform) in situations where third-party pluggable multimedia conversion modules are involved and the multimedia adaptation planner does not know their exact adaptation capabilities. In this approach, the multimedia adaptation planner module is only responsible for a part of the required decisions; the pluggable modules make additional decisions based on different criteria. We demonstrate that partial decision-making is not only attainable, but also introduces advantages with respect to a system in which these conversion modules are not capable of providing additional decisions. This means that transferring decisions from the multi-step multimedia adaptation planner to the pluggable conversion modules increases the flexibility of the adaptation. Moreover, by allowing conversion modules to be only partially described, the range of problems that these modules can address increases, while significantly decreasing both the description length of the adaptation capabilities and the planning decision time. Finally, we specify the conditions under which knowing the partial adaptation capabilities of a set of conversion modules will be enough to compute a proper adaptation plan.", "paper_title": "Bounded non-deterministic planning for multimedia adaptation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298853200002"}
