The focus is on investigation of approaches that used in 3D video compression. 3D videos provide a more realistic and extended view that leads to achievement more details about the environment under study. Depth map based methods produce the best results in standard evaluations. We first review the process of creation three-dimensional video and then propose our taxonomy by classifying depth map based methods into three categories: a) hardware or software based depth estimation methods, b) level of algorithms and c) 2D/3D depth map production. Finally, a comparison is performed on software-based methods based on video quality measure to evaluate the performance of some well-known approaches in this area. The most popular benchmarks utilized in papers are also described in full detail.", "paper_title": "A taxonomy of depth map creation methods used in multiview video compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000339891300038"}
