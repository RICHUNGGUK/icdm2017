However, it is still unclear whether enterprise sites fully support their primary business activities. This paper proposes the use of organizational critical activities (OCAs) to help businesses align Web designs with business priorities and thus to achieve success. A case study is presented to demonstrate why identification of OCAs provides the opportunity to understand and monitor the effectiveness of Websites in supporting business activities. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) technique is used to analyze and understand the alignment of Websites with enterprise priorities. It is concluded that OCAs and IPA may assist enterprises in designing, implementing, and monitoring Websites in terms of supporting the activities that are crucial for business success.", "paper_title": "ALIGNING WEBSITES WITH ENTERPRISE SUCCESS: AN EVALUATIVE APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000208868900006"}
