In this paper, we present a data position permutation (DPP) method, which is based on a selected mapping (SLM) scheme, for reducing the PAPR in OFDMsystems. The candidate signal on each branch of the SLM scheme is generated by permuting the position and rotating the phase of the original data. In addition, a modified DPP method with lower bit error rate (BER) is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed method provides better performance with regard to complexity, spectrum efficiency, and BER as compared to that of the SLM-based dummy sequence insertion (SLM-DSI) method.
