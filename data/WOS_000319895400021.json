In this paper, we design a trust-based framework to more accurately evaluate an encounter's delivery competency, which can be flexibly integrated with a large family of existing data forwarding protocols designed for OppNets. As a case study, we integrate our proposed framework with PROPHET, and demonstrate its effectiveness against \"black hole\" attacks through experimental study. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
