Sliding resistance can comprise an element of cohesion and an element of frictional resistance. In this model only the cohesion is considered. The mechanism is modelled for a particular case of parallel sliding planes typical for layered rocks. The model consists of a number of identical basic elements comprising two springs, a St. Venant body and a dashpot. The basic elements only differ in their cohesion. The loading regime incorporating the influence of the delay time was modelled with one, two and 500 basic elements. The results showed that the recoverable stress magnitudes were in the range between the minimum and twice the maximum of cohesion. The model demonstrates the experimentally observed memory fading whereby the fidelity of stress reconstruction reduces with the increase in the time delay between the previous load the rock was subjected to and the measuring cycles.
