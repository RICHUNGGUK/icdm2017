The filter removes redundant values by eliminating nonhamiltonian edges from the associated graph. We identify nonhamiltonian edges by analyzing a smaller graph with labeled edges that is defined on a separator of the original graph. The complexity of the procedure for each separator S is approximately O(vertical bar S vertical bar(5)). We found that it identified all infeasible instances and eliminated about one-third of the redundant domain elements in feasible instances.", "paper_title": "A filter for the circuit constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400054"}
