The file sharing is a peer-to-peer (P2P) computing model that allows users to share and exchange files. However, it does not meet the growing need of sharing existing widespread data-sources. During the last decade, many research and development efforts have been deployed pertaining to proposing approaches for accessing remote, heterogeneous and autonomous data sources. We propose a middleware that allows non-expert users to share and integrate their data. Data are export and deployed as services. As such, they are easily discovered, uniformly accessible using standard SOAP requests and would be integrated through service composition. This paper focuses on the description of the architecture of the proposed middleware.", "paper_title": "DSM: A DATA SERVICE MIDDLEWARE FOR SHARING DATA IN PEER-TO-PEER COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000311584500018"}
