To this end, we introduce convex combinations of measurable sets, and quasiconcave and concave functions on sigma-algebras, which conform with the standard results in convex analysis. We formulate the convexity and the continuity axioms for preference relations on sigma-algebras with a metric topology and show the existence of utility functions for convex continuous preference relations. We also show that monotone continuous preference relations are representable by fuzzy measures.
