Therefore, semisupervised learning algorithms have aroused considerable interests from the data mining and machine learning fields. In recent years, graph-based semisupervised learning has been becoming one of the most active research areas in the semisupervised learning community. In this paper, a novel graph- based semisupervised learning approach is proposed based on a linear neighborhood model, which assumes that each data point can be linearly reconstructed from its neighborhood. Our algorithm, named Linear Neighborhood Propagation ( LNP), can propagate the labels from the labeled points to the whole data set using these linear neighborhoods with sufficient smoothness. A theoretical analysis of the properties of LNP is presented in this paper. Furthermore, we also derive an easy way to extend LNP to out-of-sample data. Promising experimental results are presented for synthetic data, digit, and text classification tasks.", "paper_title": "Label propagation through linear Neighborhoods", "paper_id": "WOS:000251003300005"}
