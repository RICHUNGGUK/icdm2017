For this kind of applications, as it is for traditional static database schemes, density estimation is a fundamental block for data analysis. A novel online approach for probability density estimation based on wavelet bases suitable for applications involving rapidly changing streaming data is presented. The proposed approach is based on a recursive formulation of the wavelet-based orthogonal estimator using a sliding window and includes an optimised procedure for reevaluating only relevant scaling and wavelet functions each time new data items arrive. The algorithm is tested and compared using both simulated and real world data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
