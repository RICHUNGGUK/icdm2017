Inter/intra-cell layout is the second stage of designing a cellular manufacturing system, preceded by the cell formation stage. It involves laying out the cells in the shop floor (Inter-cell layout) and locating the machines in the cells (Intra-cell layout). The dynamic environment implies a multi-period planning horizon in which the best-designed cell layout for the current period may not be efficient for the subsequent periods and, therefore, rearrangement of the cell's layout is required. The objective is to minimise the total costs of rearrangement and inter/intra-cell material flows. An electromagnetism-like (EM-like) algorithm and a genetic algorithm (GA) are implemented to solve the proposed model. Also, a hybrid algorithm based on the EM-like algorithm and GA is proposed. Statistical tests are carried out to evaluate the performance of the algorithms using a number of numerical examples separated in the small, medium and large-sized problems. The results show the superiority of the hybrid EM-GA algorithm in comparison with other algorithms. Finally, concluding remarks are provided.", "paper_title": "A hybrid electromagnetism-like algorithm for dynamic inter/intra-cell layout problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000332271300001"}
