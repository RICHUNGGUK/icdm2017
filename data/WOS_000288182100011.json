The application of the proposed approach to the Spanish Port Agency is presented. The overall amount of inefficiency currently found in the system allows for the determination of potential total output increases ranging from 24% to 114% without additional resources. Considering inputs reallocation would allow for an additional 20% output expansion. The acquisition of additional input resources would make feasible to expand outputs further, to levels whose exact values monotonously depend on the capital budget considered. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
