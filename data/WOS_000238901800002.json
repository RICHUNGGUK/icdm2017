We show that as the number of hops along a path increases, the path duration distribution can be accurately approximated by an exponential distribution under a set of mild conditions, even when the link duration distributions are not identical. Then, we develop an approximate model for computing the distribution of link duration under it Random Waypoint (RWP) mobility model. and demonstrate that the path duration distribution converges to an exponential distribution with increasing number of hops. Simulation results obtained using ns-2 simulator are provided to validate the analysis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
