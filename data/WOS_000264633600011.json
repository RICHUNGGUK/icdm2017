The model simulates strategic situations when people are in opinion discussion. Heterogeneous agents adjust their behaviors to the environment during discussions, and their interacting strategies evolve together with opinions. In the proposed game, we take into account payoff discount to join a discussion, and the situation that people might drop out of an unpromising game. Analytical and emulational results show that evolution of opinion and strategy always tend to converge, with utility threshold, memory length, and decision uncertainty parameters influencing the convergence time. The model displays different dynamical regimes when we set differently the rule when people are at a loss in strategy.", "paper_title": "CO-EVOLUTION OF OPINION AND STRATEGY IN PERSUASION DYNAMICS: AN EVOLUTIONARY GAME THEORETICAL APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000264633600011"}
