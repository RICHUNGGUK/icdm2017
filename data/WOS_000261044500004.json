In this paper, a method for computing one-sided offset approximations of freeform curves with NURBS format as tool paths is presented. The approach first uses line segments to approximate the progenitor curve with one-sided deviations. Based on the obtained line approximating curve and its offsets, a unilateral tolerance zone (UTZ) is constructed subsequently. Finally, a C(1)-continuous and completely interference-free NURBS offset curve is generated within the UTZ to satisfy the required tolerance globally. Since all of the geometric computations involved are linear, the proposed method is efficient and robust. Interference-free tool path generation thus can be achieved in NURBS based NC machining.
