We have addressed this problem with specific relevance to a class of hyperbranched macromolecules known as dendrimers by describing a new concept and developing a method that translates monomeric linear sequences into a full atomistic model of a hyperbranched molecule. Such molecular-modeling-based advances will enable modeling studies of important biological interactions between naturally occurring macromolecules and synthetic macromolecules. Our results also suggest that it should be possible to apply this sequence-based methodology to generate hyperbranched structures of other dendrimeric structures and of linear polymers.", "paper_title": "From sequence to 3D structure of hyperbranched molecules: application to surface modified PAMAM dendrimers", "paper_id": "WOS:000296301700003"}
