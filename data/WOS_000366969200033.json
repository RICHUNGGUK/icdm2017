Resource provisioning in the cloud providers has come along availability of workloads in a given time. Most cloud providers conduct inquiries with a limited amount of resources that may be cause to reject the request of customers at the peak of workloads. Cloud federation is an approach to share resources, enhance the scalability and availability. High energy consumption is one of the current challenges for cloud providers; also it should be discussed and researched about providers' profit as an important issue. We have presented an approach in this paper to reduce power consumption for IaaS Providers, by choosing the most appropriate host and allocating the best virtual machine which leads to satisfy users requests, save energy and reduce the cost of resources. Simulation results show that the proposed approach, compared to the other similar approaches, causes to increase utilization and turns off idle servers to decrease consumed power which followed by an increase in providers' profit.", "paper_title": "Resource Management of IaaS Providers in Cloud Federation", "paper_id": "WOS:000366969200033"}
