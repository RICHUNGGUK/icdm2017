One of the problems is that business managers generally lack sufficient assurance that the controls over e-processes are effective and efficient and that information announced to customers is correct and reliable. Powerful metamodeling is therefore required. The objective of this research is to develop an e-process audit mechanism by applying automatic model checking to check consistency between e-process flows implemented and those originally designed; to detect errors in the structure and contents of Web applications; and to assist the internal control and assurance managers with their frequent monitoring of the internal controls of Web applications. A prototype has been developed to evaluate the feasibility of the mechanism and has been applied in a real e-commerce case. The results show that it proved useful for the internal control and assurance purposes in the case company.", "paper_title": "Metamodeling to Control and Audit E-Commerce Web Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000309115900005"}
