A short block-move is an operation on a permutation that moves an element at most two positions away from its original position. In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding a minimum-length sorting sequence of short block-moves for a given permutation, and devise a (1 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for this problem, where E is the number of elements divided by the number of inversions in the permutation. The algorithm mostly relies on a new structure in the permutation graph called an umbrella, which can be optimally sorted in O(n(2)) time. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
