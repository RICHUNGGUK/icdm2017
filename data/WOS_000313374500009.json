By selecting the appropriate stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions of stochastic FTB of MJNNs are presented and proved. The FTB criteria are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the developed approaches. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
