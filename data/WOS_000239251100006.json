We develop a unified strategy through which checking self-stabilization is shown to be decidable for lossy vector addition systems with states, one-counter machines, and conflict-free Petri nets. For lossy counter machines and lossy channel systems, in contrast, the self-stabilization problem is shown to be undecidable.", "paper_title": "Decidability analysis of self-stabilization for infinite-state systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239251100006"}
