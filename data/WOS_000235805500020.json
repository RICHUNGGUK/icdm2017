A recent result established the NP-completeness of deciding whether a digraph is k-oriented colorable; we extend this result to the classes of bipartite digraphs and circuit-free digraphs. Finally, we investigate the approximation of this problem: both positive and negative results are devised.", "paper_title": "Oriented coloring: Complexity and approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000235805500020"}
