Since the population is able to extract the disparity map only in a limited range, using the map to drive vergence control means to limit its functionality inside this range. The model directly extracts the disparity-vergence response by combining the outputs of the disparity detectors without explicit calculation of the disparity map. The resulting vergence control yields to stable fixation and has small response time to a wide range of disparities. Experimental simulations with synthetic stimuli in depth validated the approach.
