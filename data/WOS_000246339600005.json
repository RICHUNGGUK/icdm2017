It discusses and demonstrates how body mounted accelerometers can be used in context aware computing systems and for measuring aspects of human performance, which may be used for teaching and demonstrating skill acquisition, coaching sporting activities, sports and human movement research, and teaching subjects such as physics and physical education. Analysis is restricted to considerations as to how raw data can be used, and how simple calculations of quantities of data in the time domain, can be used. The limitations of the use of such data are discussed.", "paper_title": "Uses of accelerometer data collected from a wearable system", "paper_id": "WOS:000246339600005"}
