The TABOA scheme adapts the beacon interval and superframe duration to change the active period in the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC structure according to the intrinsic characteristics of different terrains and traffic loads. Our contribution is to evaluate the performance of the IEEE 802.15.4 network in different terrains via simulation setups that closely model reality and figure out the optimal beacon interval and superframe duration in the different 3D terrains.", "paper_title": "TABOA: TERRAIN-AWARE BEACON ORDER ADAPTATION SCHEME IN 3D ZIGBEE SENSOR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000318518300018"}
