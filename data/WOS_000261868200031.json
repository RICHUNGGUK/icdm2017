In this paper, an overview of e-learning standardization state of the art is provided and the relationship between Learning Management System (LMS) functionalities and current e-learning standards is presented. Some lacks are found and the importance of defining new standards to cover several LMS aspects is justified. This work describes new e-service specifications for LMS final user application functionalities in order to cover such lacks. In addition, a web-based authoring tool has been implemented according to these new specifications, generating XML files. In this way. interoperability between different new LMS aspects is enabled.
