As the Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem famously states, the vertex set of Omega (n) coincides with the set of all nxn permutation matrices. Here we consider a higher-dimensional analog of this basic fact. Let be the polytope which consists of all tristochastic arrays of order n. These are nxnxn arrays with nonnegative entries in which every line sums to 1. What can be said about 's vertex set? It is well known that an order-n Latin square may be viewed as a tristochastic array where every line contains n-1 zeros and a single 1 entry. Indeed, every Latin square of order n is a vertex of , but as we show, such vertices constitute only a vanishingly small subset of 's vertex set. More concretely, we show that the number of vertices of is at least , where L (n) is the number of order-n Latin squares. We also briefly consider similar problems concerning the polytope of nxnxn arrays where the entries in every coordinate hyperplane sum to 1, improving a result from Kravtsov (Cybern. Syst. Anal., 43(1):25-33, 2007). Several open questions are presented as well.", "paper_title": "On the Vertices of the d-Dimensional Birkhoff Polytope", "paper_id": "WOS:000329619100005"}
