However, all major algorithms proposed in the literature require high computational power and memory availability, making large data sets very hard to analyze on a single CPU. A facility for achieving a Whole-Genome Linkage Analysis has been set up as a web application upon a highly distributed infrastructure: the EGEE Grid. Test cases have been run with 10,000 to one million SNPs per Chip and, after validation, the application has been effectively used for a study on cardiac conduction disorders.", "paper_title": "Grid Based Genome Wide Studies on Atrial Flutter", "paper_id": "WOS:000283375400002"}
