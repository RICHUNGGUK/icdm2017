For effective learning through practical experience, problem solving and knowledge construction should be highly integrated and reciprocally reinforcing. However, both knowledge construction and problem solving are complex cognitive processes, which cannot be easily captured and mastered. Temporal problem-soltfing experience can be forgotten, and knowledge embedded in problem-solving experience may not be transferable to new problems. This study aimed to address the challenge via proposing a computer-based learning environment, where a visualization-based cognitive tool was designed to make thinking and learning in a problem context visible and to connect problem-solving and knowledge-construction activities throughout the learning process. An online learning program using the proposed learning environment was delivered to thirty-five students from two medical schools. The design of the proposed learning environment and its effects on problem-based learning are examined with implications for further studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
