In this study, we augment the theory of planned behavior to include evaluative variables that are not fully captured in attitude and to enhance the specificity of the model to mobile commerce. More specifically, we develop, operationalize and empirically test a model for explaining the adoption intention of transactional B2C mobile commerce. The model is empirically tested with mobile device users who have not adopted mobile commerce yet. The empirical results provide strong support for the theoretical model, shedding light on the significance and relative importance of specific adoption factors. The theoretical and empirical implications of these results are discussed.", "paper_title": "Drivers for transactional B2C m-commerce adoption: Extended theory of planned behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000255702100012"}
