Contributions to this aim are provided by the completed project POSICOSS (5th FP) and the running follow-up project COCOMAT (6th FP), both supported by the European Commission. As all important contribution to cost reduction a decrease in structural weight can be reached by exploiting considerable reserves in primary fibre composite fuselage structures through an accurate and reliable simulation of post-buckling up to collapse. The POSICOSS team developed fast procedures for the post-buckling analysis of stiffened fibre composite panels, created comprehensive experimental data bases and derived suitable design guidelines. COCOMAT builds up on the POSICOSS results and considers in addition the simulation of collapse by taking degradation into account. The results comprise an extended experimental data base, degradation models, and improved certification and design tools as well as extended design guidelines. One major task of POSICOSS and COCOMAT is the development of improved analysis tools that are validated by experiments performed within the framework of the projects. Because the new tools must comprise a wide range of various aspects a considerable number of different structures had to be tested. These structures were designed under different objectives (e.g. large post-buckling region). For the design process, the consortiums applied state-of-the-art simulation tools and brought in their own design experience. This paper deals with the design process as performed within both projects and with the applied analysis procedures. It is focused on the DLR experience in the design and analysis of stringer-stiffened CFRP panels gained within the scope of these two projects. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
