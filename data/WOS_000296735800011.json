Conventional wafer inspections are usually performed using human visual judgment. A large number of people visually inspect wafers and hand-mark the defective regions. This requires considerable personnel resources and misjudgment may be introduced due to human fatigue. In order to overcome these shortcomings, this study develops an automatic inspection system that can recognize defective LED dies. An artificial neural network is adopted in the inspection. Actual data obtained from a semiconductor manufacturing company in Taiwan were used in the experiments. The results show that the proposed approach successfully identified the defective dies on LED wafers. Personnel costs and misjudgment due to human fatigue can be reduced using the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Wafer defect inspection by neural analysis of region features", "paper_id": "WOS:000296735800011"}
