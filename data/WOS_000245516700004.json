Design/methodology/approach - The Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equation was solved with the Reynolds stress model to get the mean fluid velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy in the turbulent flow of a contraction with rectangular cross-section. The turbulent velocity fluctuations were represented as a Fourier series with random coefficients. Then the slender-body theory was used to predict the fiber orientation distribution, orientation tensor, additional shear stress and first normal stress difference of suspensions in the flow. Findings - It is found that the longer fibers tend to align the streamline easily. Increased contraction ratio results in higher fiber alignment in the direction of flow. The fibers are weakly and strongly aligned in the direction of flow in the region near the inlet and the exit, respectively. Fibers are significantly more aligned in the plane of the contraction than in the x-z plane. Contraction ratio and fiber length were shown to strongly and weakly affect the distributions of additional shear stress and first normal stress difference. Originality/value - It is the first time that the fiber orientation distribution and rheological properties of turbulent fiber suspensions flowing through a contraction have been computed numerically. The computational approach and results are valuable to the design and operation of contraction used in the industrial processes.", "paper_title": "Computing orientation distribution and rheology of turbulent fiber suspensions flowing through a contraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000245516700004"}
