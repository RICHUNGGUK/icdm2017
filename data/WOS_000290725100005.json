The objective is to dynamically assign the servers to the stations in order to maximize the throughput of the system. The form of the optimal policy for M <= 3 was derived in two previous papers. In one of those papers, Andradttir and Ayhan (Operations Research 53:516-531, 2005) provide a conjecture on the form of the optimal policy for M >= 4. We prove their conjecture in this paper, showing that the optimal policy is defined by monotone thresholds and the ratios of the service rates among the servers. For M > 1, we also prove that the optimal policy always uses the entire intermediate buffer.", "paper_title": "Throughput maximization for two station tandem systems: a proof of the Andradttir-Ayhan conjecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000290725100005"}
