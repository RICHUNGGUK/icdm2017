In this paper we show it is a NP-hard problem by reduction to an equivalent previously-known problem, called breakpoint graph decomposition (BGD), which calls for a largest collection of edge-disjoint alternating cycles in a breakpoint graph. To obtain a better approximation algorithm for the SBD problem, we made a suitable modification to Lin and Jiang's algorithm which was initially proposed to approximate the BGD problem, and then carried out a rigorous performance analysis via fractional linear programming. The approximation ratio thus achieved for the SBD problem is , for any positive epsilon.", "paper_title": "On sorting unsigned permutations by double-cut-and-joins", "paper_id": "WOS:000316020900001"}
