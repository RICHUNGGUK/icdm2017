The presented work follows the logical line rather than any physical interpretation in the framework of quantum mechanics. The basic algebraic structure, which is used as a model for noncompatible random events is an orthomodular lattice. On the orthomodular lattice, a dynamical structure is introduced coupled with mappings which have similar properties as s(n)-maps on the orthomodular lattice. This construction leads to the definition of an L-process with the Markov property on the orthomodular lattice. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
