This system adopts hybrid architecture, and diverse real-time traffic services are provided in a centralized or decentralized way. Grid technology is introduced to provide the high performance computing platform for massive traffic data processing and real-time traffic service presenting. Moreover, the computation and communication capacity of the IVC network is developed and exploited to provide decentralized traffic services to drivers. Therefore, the system load is balanced among grid nodes and in-vehicle terminal, and better performance is achieved. At last, a prototype is implemented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectivity.
