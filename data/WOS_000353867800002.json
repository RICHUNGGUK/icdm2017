They use aggregation techniques for stability study associated to the Benrejeb arrow form matrix for system description. In addition, suitable choice of outputs feedback brings the problem of synchronization of two non-identical hyperchaotic maps to two identical hyperchaotic maps one. The considered case of synchronization of third order hyperchaotic Henon-Baier Klein maps shows the efficiency of the proposed approach to recover secure transmission of an image and a text.", "paper_title": "On Observer Synchronization of Non-identical Discrete-time Hyperchaotic Maps Using Arrow Form Matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000353867800002"}
