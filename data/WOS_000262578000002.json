This problem confines the application of most existing automated planning methods to products composed of only a limited number of components. The presented method of assembly plan generation belongs to the approach called \"disassembly\" and is founded on a new representation of the assembly process, with introduction of a new concept, the equivalence of binary trees. This representation allows to generate the minimal list of all non-redundant (really different) assembly plans. Plan generation is directed by assembly operation constraints and plan-level performance criteria. The method was tested for various assembly applications and compared to other generation approaches. Results show a great reduction in the combinatorial explosion of the number of plans. Therefore, this simplifying approach of assembly sequence modeling allows to handle more complex products with a large number of parts.", "paper_title": "Optimal assembly plan generation: a simplifying approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000262578000002"}
