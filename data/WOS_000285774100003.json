The sampling/importance resampling (SIR) algorithm is known to be useful in this context. Moreover, the quasi-random sampling/importance resampling (QSIR) scheme, based on quasi-Monte Carlo methods, is a more recent modification of the SIR algorithm and was empirically shown to have better convergence. By making use of quasi-Monte Carlo theory, we derive upper bounds for the error of the QSIR scheme. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
