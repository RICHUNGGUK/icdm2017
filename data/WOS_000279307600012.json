In view of the generally improved recently robot stiffness, it is desirable to perform the milling operation in regions of the robot's workspace where manipulability, both kinematic and dynamic, is highest, thereby exhausting the robot's potential to cope with the process. In addition, by selecting the most suitable initial pose of the robot with respect to the workpiece, a reduction in the range of necessary joint torques may be reached, to the extent of alleviating the heavy requirements on the robot. Two genetic algorithms (GAs) are employed to tackle these problems. The values of several robot variables, such as joint positions and torques, which are needed by the genetic algorithms, are calculated using inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics models. In addition, initial positions and poses leading to singularities along the milling path are penalized and, thus, avoided. The first GA deals solely with robot kinematics to maximize manipulability. The second GA takes into account milling forces, which are computed numerically according to the particular milling parameters, to minimise joint torque loads. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
