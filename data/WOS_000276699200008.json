Here we present a uniformly polynomial-time algorithm for both problems: the running time is f(k)a <...n (alpha) for some constant alpha not depending on k and some f depending only on k. For large values of n, such an algorithm is much better than trying all the O(n (k) ) possibilities. Therefore, the chordal deletion problem parameterized by the number k of vertices or edges to be deleted is fixed-parameter tractable. This answers an open question of Cai (Discrete Appl. Math. 127:415-429, 2003).", "paper_title": "Chordal Deletion is Fixed-Parameter Tractable", "paper_id": "WOS:000276699200008"}
