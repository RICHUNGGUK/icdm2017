The intensive transient excitations are modeled as combinations of deterministic and nonstationary random excitations. The emphases are on (i) spatially nonhomogeneous and homogeneous stochastic shell structures with large spatial variations, (ii) large nonlinear responses with finite strains and finite rotations, (iii) intensive deterministic and nonstationary random disturbances, and (iv) the large responses of a specific spherical cap under intensive apex nonstationary random disturbance. The shell structures are approximated by the lower order mixed or hybrid strain based triangular shell finite elements developed earlier by the author and his associate. The novel approach consists of the stochastic central difference method, time coordinate transformation, and modified adaptive time schemes. Computed results of a temporally and spatially stochastic shell structure are presented. Computationally, the procedure is very efficient compared with those entirely or partially based on the Monte Carlo simulation, and it is free from the limitations associated with those employing the perturbation approximation techniques, such as the so-called stochastic finite element or probabilistic finite element method. The computed results obtained and those presented demonstrate that the approach is simple and easy to apply.
