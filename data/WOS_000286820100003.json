Similarly, products must be designed and marketed taking specific cultural characteristics into account. Much is known about decision processes, culture and cognition, design of products and interfaces for human interaction with machines, and organizational processes, but this knowledge is dispersed across several disciplines and research areas. This article reviews current work in these areas and proposes a research agenda for fostering increased understanding of the ways in which cultural differences influence decision making and action in design and use of digital media.", "paper_title": "Understanding and Improving Cross-Cultural Decision Making in Design and Use of Digital Media: A Research Agenda", "paper_id": "WOS:000286820100003"}
