The aim of this study is to propose a fuzzy multi-criteria decision model to evaluate the performances of banks. The largest five commercial banks of Turkish Banking Sector are examined and these banks are evaluated in terms of several financial and non-financial indicators. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods are integrated in the proposed model. After the weights for a number of criteria are determined based on the opinions of experts using the FAHP method, these weights are input to the TOPSIS method to rank the banks. The results show that not only financial performance but also non-financial performance should be taken into account in a competitive environment. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
