The total energy is minimized with respect to the power fractions of the power amplifier and the low noise amplifier, the bit resolution of the analog-to-digital converter, the input backoff of the power amplifier and the sensing time in spectrum sensing, for a fixed achievable number of bits per packet. Numerical results show that the optimal sensing time increases when the circuit energy is considered. They also show that the analog-to-digital converter consumes more energy and that it is advantageous to operate the power amplifier at high input backoffs in cognitive radios.", "paper_title": "Circuit-Aware Cognitive Radios for Energy-Efficient Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696700020"}
