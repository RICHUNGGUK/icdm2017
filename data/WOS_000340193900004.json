We generalize this analysis to multivariate fields with a data structure called the Joint Contour Net that quantizes the variation of multiple variables simultaneously. We report the first algorithm for constructing the Joint Contour Net, and demonstrate some of the properties that make it practically useful for visualisation, including accelerating computation by exploiting a relationship with rasterisation in the range of the function.", "paper_title": "Joint Contour Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000340193900004"}
