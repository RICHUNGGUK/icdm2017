For Q(p)(n), the number of edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles generated using these methods is n(p - 1)/2 which is the maximum possible since the degree of each node in Q(p)(n) is n(p - 1). In addition, for any integers p and n, p not necessarily a prime and n not necessarily a power of 2, how to generate the maximum number of edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles in Q(p)(n) is also described.", "paper_title": "Generalized Hypercubes: Edge-Disjoint Hamiltonian Cycles and Gray Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000333469900009"}
