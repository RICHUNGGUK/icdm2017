Usually, the coefficients used in mathematical models are subject to errors of measurement or vary with market conditions. Dealing with inaccuracy or uncertainty of the input data is made possible by means of the fuzzy set theory. Our purpose is to introduce a method of solving a linear fractional programming problem with uncertain coefficients in the objective function. We have applied recent concepts of fuzzy solution based on a-cuts and Pareto optimal solutions of a bi-objective optimization problem. As far as solving methods are concerned, the linear fractional programming, as an extension of linear programming, is easy enough to be handled by means of linear programming but complicated enough to elude a simple analogy. We follow the construction of the fuzzy solution for the linear case introduced by Dempe and Ruziyeva (2012), avoid the inconvenience of the classic weighted sum method for determining Pareto optimal solutions and generate the set of solutions for a linear fractional program with fuzzy coefficients in the objective function.", "paper_title": "Solving Method for Linear Fractional Optimization Problem with Fuzzy Coefficients in the Objective Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000312043600016"}
