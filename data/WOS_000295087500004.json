The preservation of mobility for senior citizens is one of the key issues in maintaining an independent lifestyle. Thus health technologies inside a car can contribute both to safety issues (supervision of driver fitness) as well as healthcare issues by monitoring vitals signs imperceptibly. In this paper, three embedded measurement techniques for non-contact monitoring of vital signals have been investigated. Specifically, capacitive electrocardiogram (cECG) monitoring, mechanical movement analysis (ballistocardiogram, BCG) using piezo-foils and inductive impedance monitoring were examined regarding their potential for integration into car seats. All three sensing techniques omit the need for electroconductive contact to the human body, but require defined mechanical boundary conditions (stable distances or, in the case of BCG, frictional connection). The physical principles of operation, the specific boundary conditions regarding automotive integration and the results during wireless operation in a running car are presented. All three sensors were equipped with local intelligence by incorporating a microcontroller. To eliminate the need for additional cabling, a wireless Bluetooth communication module was added and used to transmit data to a measurement PC. Finally, preliminary results obtained during test drives on German city roads and highways are discussed.", "paper_title": "The smart car seat: personalized monitoring of vital signs in automotive applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000295087500004"}
