Recently, the shift has been to improve the recognition rate for the nonfrontal face. In this work, a neural network paradigm based on the radial basis function approach is proposed to tackle the challenge of recognizing faces in different poses. Exploiting the symmetrical properties of human face, our work takes the advantage of the existence of even half of the face. The strategy is to maximize the linearity relationship based on the local information of the face rather than on the global information. To establish the relationship, our proposed method employs discrete wavelet transform and multi-color uniform local binary pattern (ULBP) in order to obtain features for the local information. The local information will then be represented by a single vector known as the face feature vector. This face feature vector will be used to estimate the frontal face feature vector which will be used for matching with the actual vector. With such an approach, our proposed method relies on a database that contains only single frontal face images. The results shown in this paper demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method even at low-resolution conditions.", "paper_title": "Neural Network-Based Approach for Face Recognition Across Varying Pose", "paper_id": "WOS:000365890200012"}
