The article first defines the partial restorability, justifies the feasibility of equipping a connection with partial restorability under the GMPLS control plane, and highlights the approach of evaluating the E2E availability for a pair of working and partially restorative Shared Risk Group (SRG)-disjoint shared backup Label Switched Paths (LSPs). Simulation is conducted to verify the proposed survivable routing architecture. The final results indicate that the proposed survivable routing framework has a great ability in meeting the E2E availability requirement by engineering the effective restoration fraction of each connection with a fine granularity.", "paper_title": "A General Availability - Aware Survivable Routing Architecture on GMPLS-Based Recovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000291504300009"}
