It is more and more difficult for customers to ensure a certain level of demand over a medium term horizon as their own customers ask them for personalisation and fast adaptation. It is thus necessary to develop methods and decision support systems to reconcile the order and book processes. In this context, this paper intends firstly to relate decision under uncertainty and the industrial point of view based on the notion of risk management. This serves as a basis for the definition of an approach based on simulation and decision theory that is dedicated to the design of cooperative processes in a customer-supplier relationship. This approach includes the evaluation. in terms of risk, of different cooperative processes using a simulation-dedicated tool. The evaluation process is based on an exploitation of decision theory concepts and methods. The implementation of the approach is illustrated on an academic example typical of the aeronautics supply chain. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
