For discrete memoryless systems, two optimally chosen classes and product distributions are found to be sufficient to attain the sphere-packing exponent in those cases where it is tight.", "paper_title": "A Derivation of the Source-Channel Error Exponent Using Nonidentical Product Distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000341980300011"}
