The relationship between this extension of Shi Fu-Gui's quasi-uniform molecular lattices (Shi's QUML) and the corresponding Kubiak-Sostak extension of Wang Guo-Jun's topological molecular lattices (Wang's TML) is discussed. QUML and TML denote the categories of Shi's QUML and Wang's TML, respectively. CD is the category of completely distributive lattices with complete lattice morphisms as morphisms. We prove that FQUML-the category of fuzzy quasi-uniform molecular lattices (the extension of Shi's QUML)-is a topological category over CDop and FTML-the category of fuzzy topological molecular lattices (the extension of Wang's TML)-can be embedded in FQUML. We also prove that FQUML is isomorphic to QUML(c)(M) when M is a completely distributive lattice with multiplicative property, where QUMLc(M) is the co-tower extension of QUML. Finally, we study the Kubiak-Sostak extension of Hutton's quasi-uniformities. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
