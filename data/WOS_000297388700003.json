There have been a number of recent research efforts to automatically draw Euler diagrams when the areas of the regions are not considered, leading to a range of different drawing techniques. By contrast, substantially less progress has been made on the problem of automatically drawing area-proportional Euler diagrams, although some partial results have been derived. In this paper, we considerably advance the state-of-the-art in area-proportional Euler diagram drawing by presenting the first method that is capable of generating such a diagram given any area-proportional specification. Moreover, our drawing method is sufficiently flexible that it allows one to specify which of the typically enforced well-formedness conditions should be possessed by the to-be-drawn Euler diagram.
