An initial rigid docking algorithm generates docking poses of the cytochrome c oxidase-cytochrome c552, candidates are then aggregated into a 512-DPPC membrane model and solvated in explicit solvent. Molecular dynamic simulations are performed to induce conformational changes to membrane-bound protein complexes. Lastly each protein-protein complex is optimized in terms of its hydrogen bond network, evaluated energetically and ranked. The protocol is directly applicable to other membrane-protein complexes, such as protein-ligand systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
