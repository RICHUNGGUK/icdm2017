Sixty subjects participated in a letter-search task in the experiment. The results showed that search speed depends on the illuminance but not light source. Search speed increased as the illuminance increase from 300, 700 to 1500 1x. Search speed also increased with the increase of character size, from character height of 1.4 min (9.6 min visual angle), 2.2 min (15.1 min visual angle) to 3.3 min (22.7 min visual angle), and the increase leveled off at 4.3 min (29.6 min visual angle). The effect of character size on accuracy was also significant. Accuracy increased with the increase of character size. However, the effect of illuminance and light source on accuracy was not statistically significant. Based on the results of this study, it seems that E-paper displays may need greater illumination (700 1x or higher), greater character size (3.3 mm or 22 min of visual angle). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
