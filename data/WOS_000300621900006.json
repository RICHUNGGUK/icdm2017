Here we extend this formalism by assuming, very generally, that the number of sources grows according to a function phi(t) and that the number of items in sources grows according to a function psi(t). We then prove formulae for the rank-frequency function g(r) and the size-frequency function f(j) in terms of the function phi(t) and psi(t). As a special case, we obtain Naranan's original result that f (j) is the law of Lotka if phi and psi are exponential functions. We also prove relations between the rank-and size-frequency functions of two systems where the second system is built on the same functions phi and psi as the first system but in reverse order. Results of phi = psi follow from this as a consequence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
