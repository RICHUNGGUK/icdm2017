The system enables a user both to walk about in and to interact with an extensive remote environment in a most intuitive way. Motion of the MTO is controlled by the user's locomotion while the MHI actively follows the user to provide an unrestricted workspace for haptic interaction by means of the MTO. Main topics of this article are location measurement and control of nonholonomic wheel-based platforms with respect to the specifics of their application as mobile bases for the MHI and MTO. Furthermore, the control architecture of the mobile telepresence system and sample experimental results are presented.", "paper_title": "Force-reflecting telepresence in extensive remote environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000248885500002"}
