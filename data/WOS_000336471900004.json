Requests for service must be satisfied within a given time window that comprises several time periods of the planning horizon. We propose an adaptive service policy that aims at estimating the best time period to serve each request within its associated time window in order to reduce distribution costs. The effectiveness of this policy is compared with that of two alternative basic policies through a series of computational experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
