First, the curves in the network are classified into two types: boundary curves and \"reference curves\". The boundary curves correspond to a set of rectangular (or triangular) topological type that; can be represented with tensor-product (or degenerate) B-spline surface patches. Next, in the interior of the patches, surface fitting points and cross boundary derivatives are estimated from the reference curves by constructing \"virtual\" isoparametric Curves. Finally, a discrete G(1) continuous B-spline surface is generated by a surface fitting algorithm. Several smooth Ship hullform surfaces generated from curve networks corresponding to actual ship hullforms demonstrate the quality of the method.", "paper_title": "Generation of discrete bicubic G(1) B-spline ship hullform surfaces from a given curve network using virtual iso-parametric curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000236292700019"}
