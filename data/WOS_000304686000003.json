In this paper, we will introduce the field force scheduling problem with priorities. Motivated by the rising popularity of mobile field force management solutions, we compare online and offline heuristics as well as hybrids to solve the problem. The results help understand the benefits of dynamic scheduling based on real-time position information as compared to traditional daily offline planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
