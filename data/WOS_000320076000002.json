Currently, most of the energy consumption of such technology is by cellular base stations, which are not energy efficient-at least in terms of the transmission energy to \"from-the-socket\" energy consumption ratio. This paper addresses the problem of energy efficiency in cellular networks by taking advantage of the principles of cognitive networking, which promotes the creation of intelligent networks capable of self-configuration with minimal human intervention. In particular, this paper uses the concept of fuzzy cognitive maps to decide upon opportunistic traffic and user reallocations between radio network equipment operating in different spectrum bands to enable power saving modes by some subsets of the radio network equipment, and to utilize spectrum of more appropriate propagation characteristics to save transmission energy. The feasibility and performance of the proposed approach is investigated through simulations. Significant energy savings of some 25-30% are shown over a 72-h period, and blocking rate under the concept is shown to remain reasonable albeit exhibiting a high variance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
