This pressure is put primarily on the analog circuit designers that in turn demand automated circuit design tools evermore vigorously. Such tools already exist in the form of circuit optimization software packages but they all suffer a common ailment - slow convergence. Even taking into account the increasing computational power of modern computers the convergence times of such optimization tools can range from a few days to even weeks. Different authors have tried diverse approaches for speeding up the convergence with varying success. In this paper authors propose a combined optimization algorithm that attempts to improve the speed of convergence by exploiting the positive properties of the underlying optimization methods. The proposed algorithm is tested on a number of test cases and the convergence results are discussed.", "paper_title": "A combined simplex-trust-region method for analog circuit optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000257387200009"}
