The process is based on the combined use of an artificial neural network for predicting the consequences of different control settings and a genetic algorithm for selecting the best combination. By this means, it is possible to find the optimal, or at least near-optimal, pump and valve settings for the present time-step as well as those up to a selected operating horizon, taking account of the short-term the electricity tariff structure and operational constraints such as minimum demand fluctuations, delivery pressures, etc. Thereafter, the near-optimal control settings for the present time-step are implemented. Having grounded any discrepancies between the previously predicted and measured storage levels at the next update of the monitoring facilities, the whole process is repeated on a rolling basis and a new operating strategy is computed. Contingency measures for dealing with pump failures, pipe bursts, etc., have also been included. The novelty of this approach is illustrated by the application to a small, hypothetical network. Its relevance to real networks is discussed in the subsequent papers on case studies.", "paper_title": "Development of a real-time, near-optimal control process for water-distribution networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243505900004"}
