The latter, previously studied mainly on the ground of computer science or operational research, gained by a confrontation with problems from the new area. In the paper, several complexity issues inspired by computational biology are presented.", "paper_title": "Complexity Issues in Computational Biology", "paper_id": "WOS:000305296900005"}
