Tabix features include few seek function calls per query, data compression with gzip compatibility and direct FTP/HTTP access. Tabix is implemented as a free command-line tool as well as a library in C, Java, Perl and Python. It is particularly useful for manually examining local genomic features on the command line and enables genome viewers to support huge data files and remote custom tracks over networks.", "paper_title": "Tabix: fast retrieval of sequence features from generic TAB-delimited files", "paper_id": "WOS:000287758400019"}
