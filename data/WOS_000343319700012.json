Low computational complexity here means not only fast speed but also less energy consumption. The sliding window object detection method with linear support vector machines (SVMs) is a general object detection framework. The computational cost is herein mainly paid in complex feature extraction and innerproduct-based classification. This paper first develops a distributed object detection framework (DOD) by making the best use of spatial-temporal correlation, where the process of feature extraction and classification is distributed in the current frame and several previous frames. In each framework, only subfeature vectors are extracted and the response of partial linear classifier (i.e., subdecision value) is computed. To reduce the dimension of traditional block-based histograms of oriented gradients (BHOG) feature vector, this paper proposes a cell-based HOG (CHOG) algorithm, where the features in one cell are not shared with overlapping blocks. Using CHOG as feature descriptor, we develop CHOG-DOD as an instance of DOD framework. Experimental results on detection of hand, face, and pedestrian in video show the superiority of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Distributed Object Detection With Linear SVMs", "paper_id": "WOS:000343319700012"}
