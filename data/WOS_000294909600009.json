Existing work in this paradigm focuses mainly on recognizing activities of single user. In this work, we focus on the fundamental problem of recognizing activities of multiple users using a wireless body sensor network, and propose a scalable pattern mining approach to recognize both single-and multiuser activities in a unified framework. We exploit Emerging Pattern-a discriminative knowledge pattern which describes significant changes among activity classes of data-for building activity models and design a scalable, noise-resistant, Emerging Pattern-based Multiuser Activity Recognizer (epMAR) to recognize both single- and multiuser activities. We develop a multimodal, wireless body sensor network for collecting real-world traces in a smart home environment, and conduct comprehensive empirical studies to evaluate our system. Results show that epMAR outperforms existing schemes in terms of accuracy, scalability, and robustness.", "paper_title": "Recognizing Multiuser Activities Using Wireless Body Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000294909600009"}
