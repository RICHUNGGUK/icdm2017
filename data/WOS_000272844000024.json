A key to the success of CS is the design of the measurement ensemble. This correspondence focuses on the design of a novel variable density sampling strategy, where the a priori information of the statistical distributions that natural images exhibit in the wavelet domain is exploited. The proposed variable density sampling has the following advantages: 1) the generation of the measurement ensemble is computationally efficient and requires less memory; 2) the necessary number of measurements for image reconstruction is reduced; 3) the proposed sampling method can be applied to several transform domains and leads to simple implementations. Extensive simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed sampling method.", "paper_title": "Variable Density Compressed Image Sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000272844000024"}
