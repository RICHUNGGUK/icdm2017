The proposal includes three sliding-mode algorithms for speed auto-regulation, path conditioning and redundancy resolution in order to fulfill velocity, workspace and C-space constraints, respectively. The proposed method only requires a few program lines and samplifies the robot user interface since it directly deals with the fulfillment of the constraints to find a feasible solution for the robot trajectory tracking in a short computation time. The proposed approach is evaluated in simulation on the freely accessible 6R robot model PUMA-560, for which the main features of the method are illustrated. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
