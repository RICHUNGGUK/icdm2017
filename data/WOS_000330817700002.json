When the weight of a vertex is set to 0, it is removed and its neighborhood becomes a clique. The player making the last move wins. This adaptation of Nim on graphs is called VERTEXNIM, and slightly differs from the game VERTEX NIMG introduced by Stockman in 2004. VERTEXNIM can be played on both directed or undirected graphs. In this paper, we study the complexity of deciding whether a given game position of VERTEXNIM is winning for the first or second player. In particular, we show that for undirected graphs, this problem can be solved in quadratic time. Our algorithm is also available for the game VERTEX NIMG, thus improving Stockman's exptime algorithm. In the directed case, we are able to compute the winning strategy in polynomial time for several instances, including circuits or digraphs with self loops. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
