In this context, the authors analyse the main determinants of user experience with a specific institution's products. Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive review of the scientific literature has justified the development of a behavioural model that explains satisfaction using a set of constructs or endogenous variables. Data was collected from a self-administered web survey in the authenticated section of the electronic banking service of a prestigious financial institution. Findings - The analysis tests the relationship between the proposed variables (accessibility, trust, ease of use and usefulness) and satisfaction with electronic banking. Research limitations/implications - The study was limited to the data of a single financial institution. Caution should therefore be exercised in generalising the results. The research results provide a number of valuable conclusions for financial institutions. Originality/value - This paper is a pioneer study of satisfaction with electronic banking, especially of the relationships between satisfaction and its main determinants.", "paper_title": "The determinants of satisfaction with e-banking", "paper_id": "WOS:000319640600008"}
