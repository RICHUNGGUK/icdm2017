Working principle of this novel device is that the switching displacement of the reflective beam of light can be linearly controlled by the displacement of the piezoelectric actuator. Accordingly, the 1xN switching task can be easily achieved. To realize the proposed concept, UV-LIGA technique was implemented to fabricate the components. Multiple-switching concept was demonstrated through experiments. Efficiency of the proposed optical switch was investigated by computer simulations. Optical efficiency of the proposed device can be optimized if its dimensions are adequately designed.", "paper_title": "Piezoelectric actuated multiple channels optical switch", "paper_id": "WOS:000237508700003"}
