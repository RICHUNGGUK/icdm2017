Economic theory, which is one-sided and fails, cannot manage these crises; the model suggests that crises should be solved using social responsibility (SR), human requisite holism (RH), and well-being (WB). Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative analysis using SR, Human RH, and WB, as well as dialectical systems theory, is applied. Field research involved Slovenian mid-sized enterprises. Findings - The current global socio-economic/environmental crisis reflects decision makers' one-sidedness and resulting oversights. SR supports their holism and honesty and fights their abuse of impact. SR can help solve crises by reducing human one-sidedness better, if SR is upgraded with increasing WB, not welfare alone. Both SR and WB support RH behavior. The innovative synergy between WB and SR leads to a solution of crises. Dialectical systems theory supports WB and SR. Research limitations/implications - The hypothesis is researched to the greatest extent possible, with qualitative analysis in desk and field research. Practical implications Findings support new requisitely holistic approach to managing socio-economic crises in politics and business. Originality/value - Available literature offers no similar concept.", "paper_title": "Social responsibility: a way of requisite holism of humans and their well-being", "paper_id": "WOS:000316432900020"}
