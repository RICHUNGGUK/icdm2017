Based on the soft ground/hard rock assumption of mixed-face conditions and the analysis of cutting force on each disc cutter and each drag bit, the time-varying excavation torque on the TBM cutterhead in mixed-face tunnelling is obtained. The dynamic excavation torque and cutterhead rotation speed are discussed and compared for TBM tunnelling in several typical mixed-face conditions, which are characterized by the area percentage of soft ground on the excavation face and the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of rock. The results show that the excavation torque may run up to a critical value and fluctuate greatly in extremely adverse excavation environments, which may lead to an unexpected TBM stoppage and even a catastrophic failure of the drive motor. To decrease the penetration per revolution in time through applying a lower advance velocity and a higher cutterhead revolution will significantly reduce the excavation torque and effectively avoid such situations.
