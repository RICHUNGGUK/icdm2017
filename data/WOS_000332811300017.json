We highlight important aspects of the application of the theory of sparse representation and dictionary learning to the problem of ultrasound image segmentation. Experiments were conducted following two directions for the generation of dictionaries for myocardium and blood pool regions; by manual extraction of image patches to build untrained dictionaries and by patch extraction followed by training of dictionaries. The results obtained from different learned dictionaries are compared. During classification of an image patch, instead of using features of the patch alone, features of neighboring patches are combined. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
