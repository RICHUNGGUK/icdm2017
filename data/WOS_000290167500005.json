Our algorithm uses variable splitting method to reduce computational cost. Moreover, the Barzilai-Borwein step size selection method is adopted in our algorithm for much faster convergence. Experimental results on clinical partially parallel imaging data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm requires much fewer iterations and/or less computational cost than recently developed operator splitting and Bregman operator splitting methods, which candeal with a general sensing matrix in reconstruction framework, to get similar or even better quality of reconstructed images.", "paper_title": "Computational Acceleration for MR Image Reconstruction in Partially Parallel Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000290167500005"}
