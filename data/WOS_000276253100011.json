In controlling the boundary layer flow separation, an integrated numerical model which includes both the baseline flow and the SJA is still in its initial stage of development. This paper reports preliminary results of simulating the interaction between a synthetic jet and a laminar separation bubble caused by adverse pressure gradient in a boundary layer. The computational domain was three-dimensional and Large-eddy simulation (LES) was adopted. The initial and boundary conditions were defined using or referring to our wind tunnel experimental results. Prior to numerically simulating the interaction between the synthetic jets and the baseline flow, a numerical model for simulating the separation bubble was developed and verified. In the numerical model including the SJA, the synthetic jet velocity at the exit of the SJA was defined as an input. The numerical model was further verified by comparing the simulation with experimental results. Based on reasonable agreement between the numerical and experimental results, simulations were carried out to investigate the dependency of flow control using synthetic jets on the forcing frequency, focused on the lower frequency range of the Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) instability, and on the forcing amplitude which was represented by the maximum jet velocity at the exit of the SJA. Supporting the hypothesis based on the experiment, LES results showed that the forcing frequency had stronger influence on SJA's effective elimination of the separation bubble than the forcing amplitude did.
