For this purpose, some computational tools (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Stepwise LDA (StepLDA), Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Gram-Schmidt supervised orthogonalization (SELECT)) were employed over the beer fingerprints obtained to characterize the aging stages as well as beer types. The selection of useful variables has been performed by means of SELECT, StepLDA, and GA. Based on the results, the two alcoholic beers and the two non-alcoholic beers heavily overlap but the aging treatments were clearly discriminated. However, the NIR coupled with the multivariate computational tools has demonstrated a good capability to discriminate and classify the aged beers satisfactorily in such a way, for all aging treatments, high classification accuracies were found.
