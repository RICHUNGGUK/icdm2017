In a focus group study, three mobile applications were selected by first-time users of smartphones. In both countries, the music player application was tested, wherein common patterns of accessing and sorting songs emerged. Whereas the Iranian users appeared to be more interested in social networking via use of an SMS service, the Turkish users tended to prefer to apply hierarchies to their own daily personal contacts. The results and analysis establish the existence of country specific issues and concerns, as well as reveal generic usability issues. The article concludes that the source of these issues is most likely due to a combination of certain contextual features endemic to both Iran and Turkey, not only to ethnic, religious, or cultural issues.", "paper_title": "Mobile Usability: Experiences From Iran and Turkey", "paper_id": "WOS:000316656800003"}
