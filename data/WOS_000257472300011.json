We model the minimum-energy cooperative path (MECP) problem and prove that this problem is NP-complete. We hence design an approximation algorithm called cooperative shortest path (CSP) algorithm that uses Dijkstra's algorithm as the basic building block and utilizes cooperative transmissions in the relaxation procedure. Compared with traditional non-cooperative shortest path algorithms, the CSP algorithm can achieve a higher energy saving and better balanced energy consumption among network nodes, especially when the network is in large scale. The nice features lead to a unique, scalable routing scheme that changes the high network density from the curse of congestion to the blessing of cooperative transmissions.", "paper_title": "Minimum energy cooperative path routing in all-wireless networks: NP-completeness and heuristic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000257472300011"}
