Many different methods were proposed to either enumerate sequences of set valued data (i.e., itemsets) or sequences containing dimensional items. However, in real-world scenarios, data sequences are described as combination of both multidimensional items and itemsets. These heterogeneous descriptions cannot be handled by traditional approaches. In this paper we propose a new approach called MMISP (Mining Multidimensional Itemset Sequential Patterns) to extract patterns from complex sequential database including both multidimensional items and itemsets. The novelties of the proposal lies in: (i) the way in which the data are efficiently compressed; (ii) the ability to reuse and adopt sequential pattern mining algorithms and (iii) the extraction of new kind of patterns. We introduce a case-study on real-world data from a regional healthcare system and we point out the usefulness of the extracted patterns. Additional experiments on synthetic data highlights the efficiency and scalability of the approach MMISP.", "paper_title": "A contribution to the discovery of multidimensional patterns in healthcare trajectories", "paper_id": "WOS:000334270900006"}
