We present two algorithms for this problem. The first algorithm computes a (5+ subset of)spanner of K with O(n) edges in O(n log n) time. The second algorithm computes a (3 + is an element of)-spanner of K with O(n log n) edges in O(n log n) time. The latter result is optimal: We show that for any 2 <= k <= n - circle minus(root n log n), spanners with O(n log n) edges and stretch factor less than 3 do not exist for all complete k-partite geometric graphs.", "paper_title": "SPANNERS OF COMPLETE k-PARTITE GEOMETRIC GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000208048500002"}
