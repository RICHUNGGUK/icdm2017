We demonstrate that the method has an exponential convergence rate spatially and a second-order accuracy temporally for the four classes of problems of linear/geometrically nonlinear elastostatics/elastodynamics. The method is parallelized through domain decomposition and message passing interface (MPI), and is scaled to over 2000 processors with high parallel performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
