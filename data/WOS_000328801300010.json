To this end, an integral model of flow in e-learning environments is proposed and tested. The empirical part of the research was based on both qualitative and quantitative techniques. The former consisted of seven in-depth interviews carried out with experts in e-learning environments and two different groups. The latter consisted of an online survey resulting in a sample of 2574 valid questionnaires. The theoretical model was tested and validated using the standard methodological procedure based on exploratory and confirmatory analyses. The results indicate that time distortions and focused attention are the most important direct antecedents of flow. The challenges posed by the environment were revealed as the main indirect conditioner of the experience, but other factors, such as personalization (a new variable not considered in previous flow studies in the e-learning context), were also found to be significant. In short, this papers sheds light on the processes of online browsing and, thus, on a more suitable design for an e-learning environment. Furthermore, two direct positive consequences of the flow experience are proved: positive affect (such as feeling happy, satisfied and cheerful) and student learning. In sum, it can be concluded that institutions are better off providing students with e-learning environments conducive to getting them into a flow state. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
