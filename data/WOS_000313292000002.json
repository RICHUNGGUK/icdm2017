Indoor location sensing includes presence detection and location calculation, for which a number of technologies and algorithms have been tested. To advance the research in this area, the paper proposes an improved radio frequency identification (RFID)-based location-sensing algorithm that uses virtual tags to increase cost effectiveness and robustness. A series of tests were conducted in a controlled environment, and the findings on algorithm parameter optimization, equipment deployment strategies, system accuracy/cost tradeoff, and robustness are presented in the paper. The results show that a mean accuracy of 1.94 +/- 0.17 m for stationary targets and 1.42 +/- 0.49 m for mobile targets can be achieved, and that the system holds promise for robustness. Virtual tags are proven to reduce cost and improve the system robustness. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000161.
