However, this paper proposes an original technique for extracting minutiae based on representing the ridge structure of a fingerprint image as a run length code (RLC). The essential idea is to detect minutiae by searching for the termination points or bifurcation points of ridges in the RLC, rather than in a fingerprint image. Experimental results and a comparative analysis show that the proposed method is fairly reliable and faster than a conventional thinning-based method. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
