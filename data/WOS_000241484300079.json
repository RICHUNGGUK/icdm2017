We propose a novel model of crowd behavior, based on Festinger's Social Comparison Theory, a social psychology theory known and expanded since the early 1950's. We propose a concrete framework for SCT, and evaluate its implementations in several crowd behavior scenarios. The results show improved performance over existing models.", "paper_title": "Modeling crowd behavior based on social comparison theory: Extended abstract", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300079"}
