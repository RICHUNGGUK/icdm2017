The technology, organization, and environment (TOE) framework is applied to gain insights concerning contextual influences on the adoption of patient tracking RFID, including some RFID-specific issues. The results of this study provide insights to health care organizations embarking on RFID. The resultant model is a step towards developing a theory of adoption of contained nomadic information environments, of which RFID is one instance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
