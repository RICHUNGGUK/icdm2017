PEVs can be either mobile loads or mobile storages dispersed in the network. In this paper, distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) technique is employed as a reliability-enhancing strategy to coordinate vehicleto-grid (V2G) provision of PEV fleets in a stochastic framework. Uncertainties associated with network load demand, energy price, wind power generation, and PEV fleet behavior are considered. The proposed stochastic optimization problem is solved with a self-adaptive evolutionary algorithm based on symbiotic organism search (SOS). Numerical studies on standard test system verify the efficacy of the proposed DFR to improve the system reliability and optimal dispatch of V2G.", "paper_title": "Reliability-Oriented Reconfiguration of Vehicle-to-Grid Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356180000012"}
