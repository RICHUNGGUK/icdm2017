The theoretical results were compared with time-differential perturbed gamma-gamma angular correlations (TDPAC) experiments reported in the literature using the Ag-111 -> Cd-111 probe. In the case of X=Ag+, a refinement of the structure was performed and the predicted equilibrium structures compared with available X-ray diffraction experimental data. Structural distortions induced by replacing Ag+ with Cd2+ were investigated as well as the electric-field gradient (EFG) tensor at the Cd2+ sites. Our results suggest that the EFG at Cd2+ sites corresponds to the Ag+ coordination sphere structure, i.e., before the structural relaxations of the molecule with X=Cd2+ are completed. The results are discussed in terms of the characteristics of the TDPAC Ag-111 -> Cd-111 probe and the time window of the measurement, and provide an interesting tool with which to probe molecular relaxations.", "paper_title": "Metal coordination study at Ag and Cd sites in crown thioether complexes through DFT calculations and hyperfine parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000351477800031"}
