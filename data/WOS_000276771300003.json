We therefore proposed and tested a model that measured the users' value and satisfaction perspectives by examining the influence of these factors in an empirical survey of 288 SNS members. At the same time, the differences due to their psychological state were explored. The causal model was validated using PLS-Graph 3.0; six out of eight study hypotheses were supported. The results indicated that perceived value significantly influenced the intention to pay SNS subscription fees while satisfaction did not. Moreover, extroverts thought more highly of the social value of the SNS, while introverts placed more importance on its emotional and price value. The implications of these findings are discussed.
