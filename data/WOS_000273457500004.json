Users as well as stakeholders, experts and entrepreneurs need to be able to create shared understanding about a system representation in various phases of a design process. In each of these phases it is important to align views and ensure that differences in understanding of the system are resolved. Visualization is of high importance in this process and thus a logic approach is to involve stakeholders in collaborative modeling. Technology like interactive whiteboards may provide new opportunities in the support of collaborative modeling. In this paper we offer insights from an exploratory research on experiences in using interactive whiteboards in collaborative modeling, based on semi-structured interviews.", "paper_title": "How Interactive Whiteboards Can be Used to Support Collaborative Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000273457500004"}
