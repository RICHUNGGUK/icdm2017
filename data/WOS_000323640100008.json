Messages are sequences over a finite field while keys are sequences over an extension field . A linear map from to itself is used to compute the output digest. Of special interest is the case q = 2. For this case, we show that there is an efficient way to implement using a tower field representation of . From a practical point of view, the focus of our constructions is small hardware and other resource constrained applications. For such platforms, our constructions compare favourably to previous work.", "paper_title": "A new multi-linear universal hash family", "paper_id": "WOS:000323640100008"}
