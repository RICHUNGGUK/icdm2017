Existing studies mainly concentrate on the importance of ankle joints in these prostheses. However, there are few studies that focus on the effects of prosthetic toe joints. Different from human feet, most prosthetic feet are single-segment structures without toe joints. In order to develop more human-like prostheses with ankle and toe joints, it is of great importance to investigate the effects of toe stiffness on ankle kinetics, as it contributes to the design and control optimizations. In this paper, we analyze the effects of toe stiffness on ankle kinetics in a robotic transtibial prosthesis we have built recently. Dynamic models of the prosthesis' ankle and toe joints are built. The imposed plantar pressures and objective joint angles of these models are obtained from locomotion experiments on able-bodied subjects. Simulation results indicate when the toe joint is fixed, the ankle energy consumption in one gait cycle is almost 1.2 times of that when the toe joint is driven to track the able-bodied toe motion. Experiments of the prosthesis prototype are carried out on an amputee subject with a transtibial amputation. The results show that compared with the fixed toe joint either the active toe joint or the passive toe joint can reduce the ankle output moment and power consumption. This means adding a toe joint to the foot can reduce the designing requirements of the ankle joint. In addition, the active toe joint can help the prosthesis perform more human-like behaviors compared with the passive toe joint. On the other hand, the passive toe joint can simplify the prosthesis structures and reduce the total weight compared with the active toe joint. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
