Recently bufferless deflection routers were proposed, aiming to reduce hardware cost in comparison to classic virtual channel based routers, by eliminating router buffers. We propose RIDER, a low cost deflection router based on an internal rotating ring structure with minimal number of buffers. We compare RIDER with 16 buffers to a wormhole router with 12 buffers, a virtual channel buffered router with 64 buffers, to CHIPPER, a bufferless deflection router with no buffers, and to MinBD, a buffered deflection router with four buffers.", "paper_title": "RIDER: Ring deflection router with buffers", "paper_id": "WOS:000356451900003"}
