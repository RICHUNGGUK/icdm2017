Simulation results show that the proposed design increases read static noise margin and I-ON/I-OFF of read path by 219% and 113%, respectively, at supply voltage of 300-mV over conventional 6T SRAM cell in a 90-nm CMOS technology. The proposed design lets us reduce the minimum operating voltage of SRAM (VDDmin) to 350 mV, whereas conventional 6T SRAM cannot operate successfully with an acceptable failure rate at supply voltages below 725 mV. We also compared our design with three other SRAM cells from recent literature. To verify the proposed design, a 256-kb SRAM is designed using new 9T and conventional 6T SRAM cells. Operating at their minimum possible V-DDs, the proposed design decreases write and read power per operation by 92% and 93%, respectively, over the conventional rival. The area of the proposed SRAM cell is increased by 83% over a conventional 6T one. However, due to large I-ON/I-OFF of read path for 9T cell, we are able to put 1k cells in each column of 256-kb SRAM block, resulting in the possibility for sharing write and read circuitries of each column between more cells compared with conventional 6T. Thus, the area overhead of 256-kb SRAM based on new 9T cell is reduced to 37% compared with 6T SRAM.", "paper_title": "A 256-kb 9T Near-Threshold SRAM With 1k Cells per Bitline and Enhanced Write and Read Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000008"}
