As a result, content production is focused upon meeting the needs of resources with higher demand, which limits the extent to which numerous and diverse content requirements of AHSs can be met. Open Corpus Slicing attempts to convert the wealth of information available on the web, into customisable information objects. This approach could provide the basis of an open corpus supply service meeting more diverse and unpredictable content requirements of AHSs. This paper takes a case study approach, focusing on an educational sector of adaptive hypermedia, to test out the effect of using Slicepedia, a service which enables the reuse and customisation of open corpus resources. An architecture and implementation of the system is presented along with two user-trial evaluations, involving 91 participants, which suggest that slicing techniques represent a valid content production supply for AHSs", "paper_title": "Slicepedia: Content-Agnostic Slicing Resource Production for Adaptive Hypermedia", "paper_id": "WOS:000331779200025"}
