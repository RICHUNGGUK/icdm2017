Pacejka model describes these forces that represent the reaction of the road onto the tire. This nonlinear model depends on correlated parameters such as the friction coefficient, the vertical load, and the cornering stiffness, which have to be identified from some measurements. The sensitivity of Pacejka model to these correlated parameters are studied using an approach based on polynomial chaos. It consists in decorrelating the parameters using the Nataf transformation and then, in expanding the model output onto polynomial chaos. The sensitivity indices are then obtained straightforwardly from the algebraic expression of the coefficients of the polynomial expansion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
