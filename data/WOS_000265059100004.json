Our inverse scattering schemes are based on a collection of so-called trace formulae. The speed c of propagation of sound, the density rho, and the attenuation gamma are the three parameters reconstructed by the algorithm, given that all of them are laterally invariant. For a medium whose parameters c, rho, and gamma have m >= 1 continuous derivatives, and data measured for frequencies between 0 and a > 0, the error of our scheme decays as 1/a(m-1) as a -> infinity. In this respect, the algorithm is similar to the Fourier Transform. Our results are illustrated with several numerical examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
