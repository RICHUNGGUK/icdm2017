In this paper, a modified ELM algorithm, called symmetric ELM (S-ELM), is proposed by incorporating a priori information of symmetry. S-ELM is realized by transforming the original activation function of hidden neurons into a symmetric one with respect to the input variables of the samples. In theory, S-ELM can approximate N arbitrary distinct samples with zero error. Simulation results show that, in the applications where there exists the prior knowledge of symmetry, S-ELM can obtain better generalization performance, faster learning speed, and more compact network architecture.", "paper_title": "Symmetric extreme learning machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000314844300014"}
