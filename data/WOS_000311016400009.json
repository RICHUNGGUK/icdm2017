The purpose of this paper is to construct a decision model for evaluating performances and improving professional services of marketing. To investigate the interrelationship and influential weights among criteria, this study uses a hybrid MCDM model including decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). DEMATEL-based analytic network process (called DANP). The empirical findings reveal that criteria have self-effect relationships based on DEMATEL technique. According to the network relation map (NRM), the dimension that professional services of marketing should improve first when carrying out ORM is online reputation. In the five criteria for evaluation, distributed reputation systems is the most important criterion impacting ORM, followed by employees and social responsibility. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
