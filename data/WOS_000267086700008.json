Although management of SLA is critical to wide adoption of web services technologies in the real world, support for it is very limited nowadays, especially in web service composition scenarios. There lacks adequate frameworks and technologies supporting various SLA operations such as SLA formation, enforcement, and recovery. This paper presents a novel agent-based framework which utilises the agents' ability of negotiation, interaction, and cooperation to facilitate autonomous SLA management in the context of service composition provision. Based on this framework, mechanisms for autonomous SLA operations are proposed and discussed. Results from simulations show that by integrating agents and web services the framework can address issues of SLA management drawn from sophisticated service composition scenarios.
