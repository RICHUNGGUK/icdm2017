In this paper, we propose a new rasterization pipeline with visibility culling; the proposed architecture performs the visibility culling at an early stage of the rasterization pipeline (especially at the traversal stage) by retrieving data in a pixel cache without any significant hardware logics such as the hierarchical z-buffer. If the data to be retrieved does not exist in the pixel cache, the proposed architecture performs a prefetch operation in order to reduce the miss penalty of the pixel cache. That is, the cache miss penalty can be reduced as the transfer of a missed cache block from the frame memory into the pixel cache can be handled simultaneously with the rasterization pipeline executions. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture can achieve a performance gain of about 32 percent compared with the conventional pretexturing architecture and about 7 percent compared to the hierarchical z-buffer visibility scheme.", "paper_title": "An effective visibility culling method based on cache block", "paper_id": "WOS:000238362900008"}
