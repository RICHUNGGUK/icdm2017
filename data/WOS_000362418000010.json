The flight control principle of these vehicles is similar to that of the helicopters. However, due to the all-rotating nature of these vehicles, their flight control mechanism must rely solely on attitude determination. Since the all-rotating aerial vehicles spin at very high angular velocities, the problem of attitude determination requires special attention. This paper deals with the feasibility issues of attitude determination for all-rotating UAVs, based on observations of the gravity and magnetic field vectors. It presents the analysis of magnetometer and accelerometer applicability on board the all-rotating UAV platform, revealing the problematic effects which arise from high spin velocities. The problem of attitude determination is simplified for steady flight, followed by the proposition of a method for eliminating the spin-induced acceleration and a corresponding calibration procedure. Both methods are evaluated in a controlled test environment simulating the steady flight conditions. Test results serve as a proof of concept, making the application of the proposed methods reasonable for future real-flight experimentation and analysis.", "paper_title": "Feasibility Study of Attitude Determination for All-Rotating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Steady Flight", "paper_id": "WOS:000362418000010"}
