Two new features distinguish this work from the prior delay-based temperature sensors. First, our sensor operates with simple, low-cost one-point calibration. Second, it uses delay-locked loops (DLLs) to convert inverter delays to digital temperature outputs: the use of DLLs enables low energy (0.24 mu J/sample) and high bandwidth (5 kilo-samples/s), facilitating fast thermal monitoring. After calibration, measurement errors for 15 chips fabricated in digital CMOS 0.13 mu m fall within -4.0 similar to 4.0 degrees C in a temperature range of 0 similar to 100 degrees C, where the temperature chamber used has a control uncertainty of +/- 1.1 degrees C. Microprocessor thermal profiling can be a potential application.", "paper_title": "Time-Domain CMOS Temperature Sensors With Dual Delay-Locked Loops for Microprocessor Thermal Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518900004"}
