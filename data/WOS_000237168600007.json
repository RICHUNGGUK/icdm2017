In order to model these situations, we consider several kinds of fuzzy controls, which can be modelled as different simple fuzzy games. An LP-game which is an extension of LP-games with committee control introduced in Curiel et al. [on balanced games and games with committee control, OR Spectrum 11 (1989) 83-88] is obtained and its core is studied. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
