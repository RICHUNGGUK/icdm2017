The heat of formation (HOF) and calculated density were estimated to evaluate the detonation properties using Kamlet-Jacobs equations.

The calculated results show that the N-NO2 bond is a trigger bond during thermolysis initiation process. The crystal structure obtained by molecular mechanics (MM) methods belongs to Pna2(1) space group, with cell parameters a = 12.840 , b = 9.129 , c = 14.346 , Z = 6 and rho = 2.292 g center dot cm(-3). Both the detonation velocity of 9.96 km center dot s(-1) and the detonation pressure of 47.47 GPa are better than those of CL-20. According to the quantitative standard of energetics and stability, as a high energy density compound (HEDC), cage-tetranitrotetraazabicyclooctane essentially satisfies this requirement.", "paper_title": "Theoretical studies on the crystal structure, thermodynamic properties, detonation performance and thermal stability of cage-tetranitrotetraazabicyclooctane as a novel high energy density compound", "paper_id": "WOS:000313077100004"}
