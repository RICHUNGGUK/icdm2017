In this paper, we focus on vector-valued data and derive from the Hodge decomposition of image flows a definition of TV regularization for vector-valued data that extends the standard componentwise definition in a natural way. We show that our approach leads to a convex decomposition of arbitrary vector fields, providing a richer decomposition into piecewise harmonic fields rather than piecewise constant ones, and motion texture. Furthermore, our regularizer provides a measure for motion boundaries of piecewise harmonic image flows in the same way, as the TV measure does for contours of scalar-valued piecewise constant images.", "paper_title": "Convex Hodge Decomposition and Regularization of Image Flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000263146200005"}
