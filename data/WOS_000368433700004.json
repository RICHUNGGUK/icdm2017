We prove that small-bias sets are hitting sets for the class of U-polynomials, though their size is larger than desired. Furthermore, we give two alternative proofs for the fact that small-bias sets induce rigid matrices. Finally, we construct rigid matrices from unbalanced expanders, with essentially the same size as the construction via small-bias sets.", "paper_title": "ON RIGID MATRICES AND U-POLYNOMIALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000368433700004"}
