Existing research studies have focused on ordinary Voronoi diagrams, and some vector-based algorithms have been developed to generate multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagrams (MWVDs) for points. An algorithm to construct MWVDs for points, polylines, and polygons is raster-based and has drawbacks. We propose a vector-based algorithm to generate and update MWVDs for points, polylines, and polygons. The MWVDs of two sites characterize the geometric features of multiplicatively weighted Voronoi regions, and the algorithm for Boolean operations on conic polygons is the computational preliminary to the MWVDs of N sites. The proposed algorithm is vector-based and can deal with sites with mixed spatial extents and various weights. We implement the algorithm in C# and present several examples of generating and updating MWVDs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
