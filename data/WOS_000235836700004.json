Our approach distinguishes from other attempts in that (1) we solve this problem for the whole class of well-structured transition systems using a forward algorithm. So, our algorithm has to deal with possibly infinite downward closed sets. (2) Whereas other approaches have a non generic representation for downward closed sets of states, which turns out to be hard to devise in practice, we introduce a generic representation requiring no additional effort of implementation.", "paper_title": "A complete abstract interpretation framework for coverability properties of WSTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000235836700004"}
