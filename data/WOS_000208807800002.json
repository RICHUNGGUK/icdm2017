Simulation models are useful tools to evaluate the impact of the wind power on the power system stability and on the power quality. Aggregate models reduce the simulation time required by detailed dynamic models of multiturbine systems. In this paper, a new behavioral model representing the aggregate contribution of several variable-speed-pitch-controlled wind turbines is introduced. It is particularly suitable for the simulation of short term power fluctuations due to wind turbulence, where steady-state models are not applicable. The model relies on the output rescaling of a single turbine dynamic model. The single turbine output is divided into its steady state and dynamic components, which are then multiplied by different scaling factors. The smoothing effect due to wind incoherence at different locations inside a wind farm is taken into account by filtering the steady state power curve by means of a Gaussian filter as well as applying a proper damping on the dynamic part. The model has been developed to be one of the building-blocks of a model of a large electrical system, therefore a significant reduction of simulation time has been pursued. Comparison against a full model obtained by repeating a detailed single turbine model, shows that a proper trade-off between accuracy and computational speed has been achieved. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
