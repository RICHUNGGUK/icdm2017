Path planning is a procedure which specifies motion trajectories of multiple mobile robots to form a robotic team with a desired pattern. Since protein crystals consist of a large number of protein molecules which come together to form a 3D lattice of uniform structure, it is hypothesized that each protein behaves like a mobile robot and takes adequate path to form a robotic team ( crystal). Based on this hypothesis, it is shown that trajectories of the proteins should be simple and local, which generates three rules of motion for the protein robots, i.e., ( a) each protein searches for its nearest neighbor, (b) each protein takes the shortest path to approach the nearest neighbor, and (c) multiple proteins may form a sub-team of proteins. It is then proven mathematically that the planned path according to the three rules is stable and able to crystallize the proteins. Interaction forces at the molecular level are analyzed to show that the simple and local motion of the proteins is physically warranted. Computer simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the new theory.", "paper_title": "Mobile robot team forming for crystallization of proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000247989800006"}
