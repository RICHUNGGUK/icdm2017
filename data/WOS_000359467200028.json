This architecture is designed as an embedded mode dispatch module. On the basis of this module, some unnecessary modes can be skipped or the mode decision process can be terminated in advanced. In order to maintain a higher compatibility, the FMD algorithms are unitedly designed as an unique module that can be easily embedded into a common video codec for H.265/HEVC. The input and output interfaces between the proposed module and other parts of the codec are designed based on simple but effective protocol. Hardware synthesis results on FPGA demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves a maximum frequency of about 193 MHz with less than 1% of the total resources consumed. Moreover, the proposed module can improve the overall throughput.", "paper_title": "Hardware Architecture of the Fast Mode Decision Algorithm for H.265/HEVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000359467200028"}
