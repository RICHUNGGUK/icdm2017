We extend to DA the ideas used by Almeida and Zeitoun to solve the analogous problem for the pseudovariety R applying also a representation by automata of implicit operations on DA, which was recently obtained by the author. Considering certain types of factors of an implicit operation on DA, we can prove that a pseudoword on DA is an omega-term if and only if the associated minimal DA-automaton is finite. Finally, we complete the result by effectively computing in polynomial time the minimal DA-automaton associated to an omega-term. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
