Based on the stability results and recently developed system designing method, the networks are constructed for storing and retrieving binary and non-binary patterns, and the network performances are analysed by numerical simulations. It is shown that the designed networks can act as information retrieval systems.", "paper_title": "Analysis and synthesis of Cohen-Grossberg networks with asymmetric connections", "paper_id": "WOS:000299483000001"}
