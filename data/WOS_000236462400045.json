This definition is based on a morphological and fuzzy pattern-matching approach, and consists in comparing an object to a fuzzy landscape representing the degree of satisfaction of an affinity relationship. It has good formal properties, it is flexible, it fits the intuition, and it can be used for structural pattern recognition under imprecision. Moreover, it also applies in 3D and for fuzzy objects issued from images.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy mathematical morphology approach to multiseeded image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236462400045"}
