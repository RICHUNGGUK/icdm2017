The advantage of controlling the discretization of operators near the boundary rather than boundary conditions is shown. Assimilating data that have been produced by the same model on a finer grid, in a model on a coarse grid, we have shown that optimal discretization allows us to correct such errors of the numerical scheme as under-resolved boundary layer and wrong wave velocity.
