The filter is it pipelined Takagi-Sugeno-Kang recurrent fuzzy network, consisting of it number of modules interconnected in a cascaded form. The participating modules are implemented through recurrent fuzzy neural networks with internal dynamics. The structure of the modules is evolved sequentially from input-output data. Extensive experimental results, regarding the lung sound category of crackles, are given, and it performance comparison with a series of other fuzzy and neural filters is conducted, underlining the separation capabilities of the proposed filter.
