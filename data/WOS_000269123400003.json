They generalize all major quantum error protection schemes, and therefore are especially versatile. This paper introduces numerous constructions of subsystem codes. It is shown how one can derive subsystem codes from classical cyclic codes. Methods to trade the dimensions of subsystem and co-subsystem are introduced that maintain or improve the minimum distance. As a consequence, many optimal subsystem codes are obtained. Furthermore, it is shown how given subsystem codes can be extended, shortened, or combined to yield new subsystem codes. These subsystem code constructions are used to derive tables of upper and lower bounds on the subsystem code parameters.", "paper_title": "CONSTRUCTIONS OF SUBSYSTEM CODES OVER FINITE FIELDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269123400003"}
