In such networks, user mobility may lead to Internet gateway changes and consequently, impact the performance of continuous media applications. In this article, we investigate the impact of user mobility on the performance of peer-to-peer video applications over wireless mesh networks. Peer-to-peer video streaming applications rely on the collaborative behavior of peers to assist the source in delivering multimedia content, reduce costs, and increase the scalability of video distribution. We identify practical issues related to mobility for P2P video streaming implementation in WMNs, such as addressing and forwarding strategies. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of different P2P streaming applications as the user walks in our WMN testbed. Results indicate mobile users benefit from the frequent short-lived connections established in modern P2P video sessions.", "paper_title": "ON THE IMPACT OF USER MOBILITY ON PEER-TO-PEER VIDEO STREAMING", "paper_id": "WOS:000262364300009"}
