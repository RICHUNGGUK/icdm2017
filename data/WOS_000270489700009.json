Earlier results show that obtaining a relatively short solution is possible in polynomial time. However, one problem arises here that if the equation has a short solution in given bounded range, the results outputted by earlier algorithms are often not the ones we are interested in. In this paper, we present a probability method based on lattice basis reduction to solve the problem. For a general multivariate modular linear equation with short solution in the given bounded range, the new method outputs this short solution in polynomial time, with a high probability. When the number of unknowns is not too large (smaller than 68), the probability is approximating 1. Experimental results show that Knapsack systems and Lu-Lee type systems are easily broken in polynomial time with this new method.", "paper_title": "Probability method for cryptanalysis of general multivariate modular linear equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000270489700009"}
