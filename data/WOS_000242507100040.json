The simple steepest descent algorithm is used to illustrate that the ILS algorithm can provide adequate reductions in an objective function at minimal cost with fast convergence. The power system stabilizer (PSS) with output limits is used as an example for a nonlinear controller to be tuned. The efficient computation to implement the ILS algorithm in the steepest descent method is available by using the hybrid system model with the differential-algebraic-impulsive-switched (DAIS) structure. The simulation results are given to show the performance improved by the ILS algorithm.", "paper_title": "Hybrid system based interpolation line search optimization applied to nonlinear controller in a power network", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100040"}
