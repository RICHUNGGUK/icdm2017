This methodology/model allows for the creation of systems that demonstrate flexibility, agility, and the ability to be rapidly re-tasked. The methodology/model will be illustrated through a case study in the area of robotic kit building. Through this case study, the knowledge model will be presented, and automatic tools for optimizing the knowledge representation for planning systems and execution systems will be discussed.
