Docking studies were also carried out in order to explore the surface recognition properties of L-aminoglucoside with respect to Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions under solvated and nonsolvated conditions. Although both of the stereoisomers possess similar physicochemical/antibiotic properties against Helicobacter pylori, the thermochemical values for these complexes showed that its high affinity for Mg2+ cations caused the hydration of Rho B. According to the results of the calculations, for Rho A-Ca2+(H2O)(6), Delta H = -72.21 kcal mol(-1); for Rho B-Ca2+(H2O)(6), Delta H = -72.53 kcal mol(-1); for Rho A-Mg2+(H2O)(6), Delta H = -72.99 kcal mol(-1) and for Rho B-Mg2+(H2O)(6), Delta H = -95.00 kcal mol(-1), confirming that Rho B binds most strongly with hydrated Mg2+, considering the energy associated with this binding process. This result suggests that Rho B forms a more stable complex than its isomer does with magnesium ion. Docking results show that both of these rhodostreptomycin molecules bind to solvated Ca2+ or Mg2+ through hydrogen bonding. Finally, Rho B is more stable than Rho A when protonation occurs.", "paper_title": "DFT and docking studies of rhodostreptomycins A and B and their interactions with solvated/nonsolvated Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions", "paper_id": "WOS:000326193200023"}
