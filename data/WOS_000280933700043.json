The mathematical model used to describe a computed tomography device is a large system of linear equations of the form AX = B. In this paper we propose the QR decomposition as a direct method to solve the linear system. QR decomposition can be a large computational procedure. However, once it has been calculated for a specific system, matrices Q and R are stored and used for any acquired projection on that system. Implementation of the QR decomposition in order to take more advantage of the sparsity of the system matrix is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
