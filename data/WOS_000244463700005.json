Most problems encountered in the execution of PCM projects are treated in an empirical manner. This paper develops a new fuzzy-neural approach to establish a knowledge base for dealing with the problems encountered in the execution of PCM projects. This knowledge base confirms the causal relationships of these problems. Further, the data are integrated into a database management system to facilitate search inquiries and to make the information available to applications by other users. In its use, a fuzzy semantic description of the problems in project execution occurring in the prior phases is utilized to deduce the corresponding influence of those problems upon the following phases. The influence is represented by the specific lagging percentage of estimated pricing progress. The case study of the planning and design phases is validated by experts, and the results of this approach are reasonable and acceptable in practice. This instrument is useful because it can yield fruitful results in public construction project management.", "paper_title": "PCM in Taiwan: A diagnosis knowledge-base in PCM plan/design phase", "paper_id": "WOS:000244463700005"}
