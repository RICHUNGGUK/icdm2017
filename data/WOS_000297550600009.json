Extensions cover both model structures and anatomical data focusing on the addition of an elbow part and muscle architecture parameters. The model was also extended with a new inverse-dynamics optimization cost function and combined inverse-forward-dynamics models. This study is an update on the developments of the model over the last decade including a qualitative validation of the different simulation architectures available in the DSEM. To validate the model, a dynamic forward flexion motion was performed by one subject, of which the motion data and surface EMG-signals of 12 superficial muscles were measured. Patterns of the model-predicted relative muscle forces were compared with their normalized EMG-signals. Results showed relatively good agreement between forces and EMG (mean correlation coefficient of 0.66). However, for some cases, no force was predicted while EMG activity had been measured (false-negatives). The DSEM has been used and has the potential to be used in a variety of clinical and biomechanical applications.", "paper_title": "Development of a comprehensive musculoskeletal model of the shoulder and elbow", "paper_id": "WOS:000297550600009"}
