Therefore, several software tools exist for modeling and simulating these models. However, each of these tools has its specific input language and a DEVS model described within a particular framework cannot be simulated by a different one. Moreover, the practitioners willing to use one of these tools must have non-trivial programming skills or must ask to a programmer to translate their models into the language of the desired tool. In this paper, we present CML-DEVS, a language that allows the conceptual, abstract or mathematical representation of DEVS models, in terms of mathematical and logical expressions without involving programming issues. Models described with CML-DEVS can be automatically translated (i.e. compiled) into the input language of different modeling and simulation tools. We also present a set of rules to translate CML-DEVS models into models that can be simulated with well-known DEVS frameworks such as DEVS-Suite and PowerDEVS. These rules allow the implementation of a multi-target compiler. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
