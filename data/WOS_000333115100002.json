To determine to which extent these abilities can be replicated with AI, we introduce a specialized version of the Turing test for hiding and seeking. We then develop a computer agent that passes the test by appearing indistinguishable from human behavior to a panel of human judges. We analyze the AI techniques that enable the agent to imitate human hide-and-seek behavior and their relative contribution to the agent's performance.", "paper_title": "Passing a Hide-and-Seek Third-Person Turing Test", "paper_id": "WOS:000333115100002"}
