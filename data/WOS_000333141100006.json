With the results of prediction, the corresponding measures can be used to reduce the influence of the vibrations. To accurately predict the vibrations induced by train in multi-story buildings, support vector machine (SVM) is used in this paper. Since the parameters in SVM are very vital for the prediction accuracy, shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) is used to optimize the parameters for SVM. The proposed model is evaluated with the data from field experiments. The results show SFLA can effectively provide better parameter values for SVM and the SVM models outperform a better performance than artificial neural network (ANN) for train-induced vibration prediction.", "paper_title": "TRAIN-INDUCED VIBRATION PREDICTION IN MULTI-STORY BUILDINGS USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE", "paper_id": "WOS:000333141100006"}
