White light emission was realized in an OLED with 1.15 wt.% DCJTB and 4 wt.% DPAVBi doping concentrations. A maximum luminance of 13,638 cd/m(2) and a current efficiency of 5.7 cd/A were obtained in the device. These results demonstrate that WOLEDs can be realized through solution-processed small molecular emitting layer, which reduced the cost of devices and avoided the complicated co-evaporation of multiple dopants and host materials in the vacuum deposition.
