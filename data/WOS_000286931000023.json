The approach consists of using the radon inverse as an approximation for the actual one, followed by an iterative refinement. Also, we analyze the problem of retrieving the attenuation map directly from the emission data, giving rise to a novel alternating method for the solution. We applied our approach to real and simulated XFCT data and compared its performance to previous inversion algorithms for the problem, showing its main advantages: better images than those obtained by other analytic methods and much faster than iterative methods in the discrete setting.", "paper_title": "Iterative Reconstruction in X-ray Fluorescence Tomography Based on Radon Inversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000286931000023"}
