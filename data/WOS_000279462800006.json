Based on this theorem, we prove in this note that every affine polynomial A(x) over F(2) with degree > 1, where A(x) = L(x) + 1 and L(x) = Sigma(n)(i=0) x(2i) is a linearized polynomial over F(2), is reducible except x(2) + x + 1 and x(4) + x + 1. We also give some explicit factors of some special affine pentanomials over F(2).", "paper_title": "A note on the reducibility of binary affine polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000279462800006"}
