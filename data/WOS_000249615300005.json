Many specific problems related to this kind of signal are discussed. Pertinent solutions, such as high pass filtering, offset cancellation, common mode rejection, low pass filtering and capacitive coupling between different stages are proposed.", "paper_title": "A novel fully integrated device dedicated to ECG signal measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000249615300005"}
