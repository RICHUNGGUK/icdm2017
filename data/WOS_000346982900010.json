Entity linking is the task to link entity mentions in text with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base. Potential applications include information extraction, information retrieval, and knowledge base population. However, this task is challenging due to name variations and entity ambiguity. In this survey, we present a thorough overview and analysis of the main approaches to entity linking, and discuss various applications, the evaluation of entity linking systems, and future directions.", "paper_title": "Entity Linking with a Knowledge Base: Issues, Techniques, and Solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000346982900010"}
