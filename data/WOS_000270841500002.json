Results are presented to validate the approach using two real-world data sets and also using data sets created specifically to stress test the approach. Simple graphical techniques are used to visualize the solution space. The paper also reports on experiments to determine the most suitable algorithm for this problem, comparing the results of the NSGA-II algorithms, a widely used multi objective evolutionary algorithm, and the Two-Archive evolutionary algorithm, a recently proposed alternative.", "paper_title": "A search based approach to fairness analysis in requirement assignments to aid negotiation, mediation and decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000270841500002"}
