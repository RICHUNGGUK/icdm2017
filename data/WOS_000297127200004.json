The proposed approach, namely GODE, employs similar schemes of opposition-based DE (ODE) for opposition-based population initialization and generation jumping with GOBL. Experiments are conducted to verify the performance of GODE on 19 high-dimensional problems with D = 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000. The results confirm that GODE outperforms classical DE, real-coded CHC (crossgenerational elitist selection, heterogeneous recombination, and cataclysmic mutation) and G-CMA-ES (restart covariant matrix evolutionary strategy) on the majority of test problems.", "paper_title": "Enhanced opposition-based differential evolution for solving high-dimensional continuous optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000297127200004"}
