Starting from the Laguerre-based reduction method for state space systems, two extensions are proposed for the reduction of systems of second-order structures. In addition, the connection between the classical moment matching and the Laguerre-based reduction approaches is investigated and their equivalence under specific conditions is presented.", "paper_title": "Krylov-based order reduction using Laguerre series expansion", "paper_id": "WOS:000259639800005"}
