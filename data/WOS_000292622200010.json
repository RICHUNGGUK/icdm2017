Many testbeds have been created to study networking protocols in wireless mesh networks. In this work, we describe QuRiNet, an outdoor wide-area wireless mesh network deployed in a natural reserve. QuRiNet comprises of over 30 wireless nodes, spread over 2000 acres of wilderness. QuRiNet provides the backbone infrastructure for transporting ecological and environmental data from the natural reserve to the on-campus laboratories. Mesh nodes in QuRiNet are powered by solar energy, and comprise of multiple radios per node. Physical link distances in QuRiNet range from hundreds to thousands of meters. A parallel goal of deploying QuRiNet is to create a novel platform for advanced research in wireless mesh networks. In this report, we share our experiences in the deployment and maintenance of QuRiNet in its unique setting. We also describe various research efforts that have been leveraging the QuRiNet testbed. Several interesting measurement results are reported, along with the impact of various network configurations and technological variations on the functionality of the testbed. QuRiNet has been used for a variety of experimental studies including: channel assignment, network monitoring, and mobility studies. Current and future study plans include experimental evaluations of various security and reliability research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
