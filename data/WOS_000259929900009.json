Several modes of acceptance, defined by final markings of the Petri net, are introduced. and their equivalence is shown. The class of languages obtained by A-free concurrent finite automata contains both the class of regular sets and the class of Petri net languages defined by final marking. and is contained in the class of context-sensitive languages.", "paper_title": "Petri Net Controlled Finite Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000259929900009"}
