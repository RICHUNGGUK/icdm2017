However, in this comment, we will point out there exists a design flaw in their proposed scheme, leading to an inherent vulnerability, and also show an inaccuracy in their formal security proof. We hope that by identifying the design flaw, similar mistakes can be avoided in future design of homomorphic MAC authentication for network coding.", "paper_title": "Comment on \"An Efficient Homomorphic MAC with Small Key Size for Authentication in Network Coding\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000349672000023"}
