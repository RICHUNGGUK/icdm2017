We outline an approach for selecting paths to monitor, detecting and confirming the existence of a failure, correlating multiple independent observations into a single failure event, and applying existing binary networking tomography algorithms to identify failures. We evaluate the ability of network tomography algorithms to correctly detect and identify failures in a controlled environment on the VINI testbed.", "paper_title": "Practical Issues with Using Network Tomography for Fault Diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000263599100010"}
