In this correspondence, we present a general linear equation of minimum weight 3 in F-2 that holds for all state lengths it. and all shifts i of sequences generated by the T-function x(i) = x(i-1)(2) V C + x(i-1) mod 2(n) proposed by Klimov and Shamir. It is surprising that these linear properties exist, and they indicate that the sequences generated by the T-functions have more structures than claimed by Klimov and Shamir.", "paper_title": "Linear properties in T-functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805700031"}
