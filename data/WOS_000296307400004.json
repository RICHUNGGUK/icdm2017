Some of the considered problems are tackled by evolutionary algorithms that use a representation which enables them to construct solutions in a dynamic programming fashion. We take a general approach and relate the construction of such algorithms to the development of algorithms using dynamic programming techniques. Thereby, we give general guidelines on how to develop evolutionary algorithms that have the additional ability of carrying out dynamic programming steps. Finally, we show that for a wide class of the so-called DP-benevolent problems (which are known to admit FPTAS) there exists a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme based on an evolutionary algorithm.
