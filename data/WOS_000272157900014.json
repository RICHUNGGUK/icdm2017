The robots were used in a foraging environment and showed that excellent communication among robots leads to a need for a social control mechanism for managing the robots, such as the Contract Net Protocol. The experiments also confirmed that a moderate benefit can be gained by using adaptive bidding within the framework of the Contract Net Protocol.", "paper_title": "Neural networks-based adaptive bidding with the contract net protocol in multi-robot systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272157900014"}
