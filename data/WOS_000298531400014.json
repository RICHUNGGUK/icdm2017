The algorithm creates an interpolated k-space \"super cell,\" which is broken into slices perpendicular to the desired magnetic field direction. Fermi surface orbits are located within each slice, and de Haas-van Alphen frequencies and effective masses are calculated. Orbits are then matched across slices, and extremal orbits determined. This technique has been successful in locating extremal orbits not previously noticed in the complicated topology of existing UPt3 band-structure data; these new orbits agree with experimental de Haas-van Alphen measurements on this material, and solidify the case for a fully-itinerant model of UPt3.
