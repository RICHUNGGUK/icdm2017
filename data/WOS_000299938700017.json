Passive RFID tags require RF communication to access memory data. This study is motivated by the volatility of RF communication, where instability is caused by intermittent connections and uncertain communication. If a given tag disappears from the communication area of the reader during the reading or writing of tag data, the operation is incomplete, resulting in an inconsistent state of tag data. To avoid this inconsistency, it is necessary to ensure that any operations on tag memory are completed. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous reprocessing model for finalizing any incomplete execution of read/write operations to remove inconsistent states. The basic idea is to resume incomplete operations autonomously by detecting a tag's re-observation from any reader. To achieve this, we present a concurrency control mechanism based on continuous query processing that enables the suspended tag operations to be re-executed. The performance study shows that our model improves the number of successful operations considerably in addition to suppressing inconsistent data access completely.", "paper_title": "A Reprocessing Model for Complete Execution of RFID Access Operations on Tag Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000299938700017"}
