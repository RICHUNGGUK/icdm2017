As a result, this paper proposes a novel biometric modality named typing behavior (TB) for continuous user authentication. Given a webcam pointing toward a keyboard, we develop real-time computer vision algorithms to automatically extract hand movement patterns from the video stream. Unlike the typical continuous biometrics, such as keystroke dynamics (KD), TB provides a reliable authentication with a short delay, while avoiding explicit key-logging. We collect a video database where 63 unique subjects type static text and free text for multiple sessions. For one typing video, the hands are segmented in each frame and a unique descriptor is extracted based on the shape and position of hands, as well as their temporal dynamics in the video sequence. We propose a novel approach, named bag of multi-dimensional phrases, to match the cross-feature and cross-temporal pattern between a gallery sequence and probe sequence. The experimental results demonstrate a superior performance of TB when compared with KD, which, together with our ultrarealtime demo system, warrant further investigation of this novel vision application and biometric modality.", "paper_title": "On Continuous User Authentication via Typing Behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000209737800006"}
