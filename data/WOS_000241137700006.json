PDAC is the method to take advantage of the robot inherent dynamics and to realize natural dynamic motion. We apply PDAC to a biped walk control. On the assumption that the sagittal and lateral motion can be separated and controlled individually, each motion is designed based on the given desired step-length and period. In order to stabilize walking, the landing position control according to the status is designed. In addition, a coupling method between these motions, which makes the period of each motion identical, is proposed. Finally, we show that the multi-locomotion robot realizes the 3-dimensional dynamic walking using the PDAC control.", "paper_title": "Multi-locomotion control of biped locomotion and brachiation robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137700006"}
