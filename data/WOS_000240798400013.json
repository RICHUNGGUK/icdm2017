This paper focuses on the chemical and mechanical effects related to the existence of different oxidation states of Si atoms in SiO(x) systems with various Si:O composition and topology, such as O atoms in Si, the Si-SiO(2) interface, and O vacancies in SiO(2). We compare the stress-strain relation in SiO(2) interfaces with (100), (111) and (110) surfaces, the relative stability of oxygen vacancies at different locations in Si-SiO(2) layers and defects in Si and SiO(2) crystals related to O migration. Our study is based on ab initio computations of molecular and periodic systems with both localized and plane wave basis sets.", "paper_title": "Computational design of silicon suboxides: chemical and mechanical forces on the atomic scale", "paper_id": "WOS:000240798400013"}
