Based on the theory of information fusion estimation, optimal control of nonlinear discrete control system is investigated. All information on control strategy, including ideal control strategy, expected object trajectory and dynamics of system, are regarded as measuring information of control strategy. Therefore, the problem of optimal control is transferred into the one of information fusion estimation. Firstly, the nonlinear information fusion estimation theorems are described. Secondly, an algorithm of nonlinear IFC theory is detailedly deduced. Finally, the simulation results of manipulator shift control are given, which show the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented algorithm.", "paper_title": "Primary exploration of nonlinear information fusion control theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000250557500003"}
