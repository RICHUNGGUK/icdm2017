However, a good classification method and a comprehensive comparison for these algorithms are absent. This is especially true for index based homology search algorithms. The paper briefly introduces main index construction methods. According to index construction methods, index based homology search algorithms are classified into three categories, i.e., length based index ones, transformation based index ones, and their combination. Based on the classification, the characteristics of the currently popular index based homology search algorithms are compared and analyzed. At the same time, several promising and new index techniques are also discussed. As a whole, the paper provides a survey on index based homology search algorithms.", "paper_title": "Survey on index based homology search algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000245559800004"}
