In this work, we developed a template-based segmentation system with integration of the 3D average brain model. 3D registration and warping are performed to obtain the initial contours of the snake algorithm for the segmentation procedure. 3D models can be reconstructed from the segmentation results to update the average brain model. The proposed segmentation system is fast and automatic to construct a more precise standard 3D Drosophila brain model.", "paper_title": "Template-based automatic segmentation of Drosophila mushroom bodies", "paper_id": "WOS:000253046500008"}
