It is assumed that (a) relative weights of demand nodes are either deterministic or imprecise, described by linguistic expressions and (b) potential facility site locations are limited to network nodes. The concept of coverage is extended to include a degree of node coverage which means that the borders between the subset of covered demand nodes and the subset of uncovered demand nodes are inexact. The acceptable service distance/travelling times from a facility site to demand nodes are modelled by fuzzy sets. Three new algorithms for choosing the best facility locations are developed which assume that (I) demands at all nodes are equally important, (2) relative weights of demand at nodes are deterministic and (3) weights of demand at nodes are imprecise and described by linguistic terms, respectively. The algorithms are based on searching among potential facility nodes by applying comparison operations on discrete fuzzy sets. It is shown how to extend the proposed algorithms from one-site to multi-site covering problems. Illustrative examples of selecting locations for logistics centres in a distribution company are given. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
