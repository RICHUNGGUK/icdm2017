These algorithms are designed to eliminate the need for a local feature size oracle during quality mesh generation of domains containing acute input angles. In keeping with Ruppert's algorithm, encroachment in these algorithms can be determined through only local information in the current Delaunay triangulation. The algorithms are practical to implement and several examples are given.", "paper_title": "DELAUNAY REFINEMENT ALGORITHMS FOR ESTIMATING LOCAL FEATURE SIZE IN 2D AND 3D", "paper_id": "WOS:000300109900002"}
