The damping amplitudes of this plate bonded with PZT actuators were obtained at different locations and under different control conditions by analyzing the distribution of the PZT plate's strain tensor in the first 4 modes. Furthermore, to reduce the unwanted disturbance and mitigate the errors from sensors, a base structure of the missile's strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) is also proposed. The results show that the vibration control can be enhanced by increasing the number of the PZT actuators bonded. This implies that the application of the PZT actuators to the base of a missile's SINS is an effective approach for damping control.", "paper_title": "Vibration analysis of base structure on SINS using PZT actuators", "paper_id": "WOS:000309698800006"}
