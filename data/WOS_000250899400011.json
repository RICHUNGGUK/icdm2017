These levels depend on whether decryption is allowed by (1) only one specified recipient, (2) every member of the group, (3) members of a specified subset acting cooperatively, and (4) members of any predetermined authorized subset, or any t out of n members, acting cooperatively. The newly proposed AGOC has the following merits: (1) every member of the receiving group needs to keep only one private key, (2) both ciphertexts and system parameters are of constant size, and (3) the scheme is secure against a chosen ciphertext attack in the random oracle model.
