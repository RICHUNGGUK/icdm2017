On the execution of Petri net, the proposed method can simultaneously use admissible heuristic functions and nonadmissible heuristic functions for A* algorithm. We also prove that the resulting combinational heuristic function is still admissible and more informed than any of its constituents. The experimental results of an example FMS and several sets of random generated problems show that the proposed search method performs better as we expected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
