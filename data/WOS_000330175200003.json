This study is motivated by its potential application to the design and control of data centers. The cost structure includes customer holding cost which is a non-decreasing convex function of the number of customers in the system, server operating cost which is a non-decreasing convex function of the chosen service rate, and system operating reward which is a non-decreasing concave function of the chosen arrival rate. We formulate the problem as a continuous-time Markov decision process and derive structural properties of the optimal control policies under both discounted cost and average cost criterions.", "paper_title": "Optimal arrival rate and service rate control of multi-server queues", "paper_id": "WOS:000330175200003"}
