Probabilistic data may be generated by automated data analysis/enrichment techniques such as entity resolution, information extraction, and speech processing. The legacy system may correspond to pre-existing web applications such as Flickr, Picasa, etc. The goal is to generate a deterministic representation of probabilistic data that optimizes the quality of the end-application built on deterministic data. We explore such a determinization problem in the context of two different data processing tasks-triggers and selection queries. We show that approaches such as thresholding or top-1 selection traditionally used for determinization lead to suboptimal performance for such applications. Instead, we develop a query-aware strategy and show its advantages over existing solutions through a comprehensive empirical evaluation over real and synthetic datasets.", "paper_title": "Query Aware Determinization of Uncertain Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000346167800017"}
