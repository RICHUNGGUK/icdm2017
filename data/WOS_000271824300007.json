Considered as a polynomial function of degree less than or equal to (n + 1) it \"blossoms\" into a \"new\" blossom which is now a function of (n + 1) variables. A classical formula expresses any value of this new blossom as a strictly convex combination of (n + 1) values of the initial one. We establish a similar formula for Chebyshevian blossoms.
