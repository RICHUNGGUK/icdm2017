In this article, we will show that any alternating group graph AG(n), where n >= 3 is an integer, contains 2n - 4 mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles. More specifically, let N = vertical bar V(AG(n))vertical bar, v(i). is an element of V (AG(n)) for 1 <= i <= N, and < v(1), v(2), ... , v(N), v(1)> be a Hamiltonian cycle of AG(n). We show that AG(n) contains 2n - 4 Hamiltonian cycles, denoted by C-l = < v(1), v(2)(l), ... , v(N)(l), v(1)> for 1 <= l <= 2n - 4, such that v(i)(l) not equal v(i)(l) for all 2 <= i <= N whenever l not equal l'. The result is optimal since each vertex of AG(n) has exactly 2n - 4 neighbors.", "paper_title": "Mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles in alternating group graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000308110100010"}
