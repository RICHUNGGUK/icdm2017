The nonlinear cyclic axial force-deformation simulation is done for braces with box sections. However, the structural model and simulation techniques described in this study may be applicable to braces with various section types using other commercially available structural analysis software capable of handling material and geometric nonlinearity. The developed nonlinear brace model is verified using available test results from the literature. It is found that the accuracy of the shapes of the analytical hysteresis loops and the energy dissipated compared to the experimental ones is satisfactory for analysis and design purposes in practice. The developed nonlinear brace structural model is then used to study the effect of various ground motion and structural parameters on the seismic response of single story, single bay concentrically braced frames with chevron braces.
