For this logic, we prove the expressive equivalence of omega-recognizable and MSO-definable infinitary formal power series over distributive lattices with negation function. Then we consider multi-valued Muller tree automata and a multi-valued MSO logic for trees over distributive lattices. For this logic, we establish a version of Rabin's theorem for infinitary tree series.", "paper_title": "Multi-valued MSO logics over words and trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000259604800002"}
