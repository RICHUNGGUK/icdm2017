In this paper, we propose detection and defense schemes to identify and defend against MAC-layer selfish misbehavior, respectively, in IEEE 802.11 multi-hop ad hoc networks. Specifically, the non-deterministic nature of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol imposes great challenges to distinguishing selfish nodes from well-behaved nodes. Most traditional selfish misbehavior detection approaches are for wireless local area networks (WLANs) only. They either rely on a large amount of historical data to perform statistical detection, or employ throughput or delay models that are only valid in WLANs for detection. In contrast, we propose a realtime selfish misbehavior detection scheme for multi-hop ad hoc networks. It requires only several samples, and hence is more efficient and can adapt to channel dynamics more quickly. Then, based on the proposed detection scheme, we design three selfish misbehavior defense schemes against three typical kinds of smart selfish nodes. We find that the smart selfish nodes cannot degrade normal nodes' performance much without getting detected. Extensive simulation results are finally presented to validate the proposed detection and defense schemes.", "paper_title": "MAC-Layer Selfish Misbehavior in IEEE 802.11 Ad Hoc Networks: Detection and Defense", "paper_id": "WOS:000354455400008"}
