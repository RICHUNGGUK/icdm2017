Much of prior research assumes that the WSN is supervised by a constantly present sink and sensors can quickly offload collected data. In this paper, we focus on Unattended WSNs (UWSNs) characterized by intermittent sink presence and operation in hostile settings. Potentially lengthy intervals of sink absence offer greatly increased opportunities for attacks resulting in erasure, modification, or disclosure of sensor-collected data. This paper presents an in-depth investigation of security problems unique to UWSNs (including a new adversarial model) and proposes some simple and effective countermeasures for a certain class of attacks.", "paper_title": "Data Security in Unattended Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270031000006"}
