Acoustic signals were collected from 61 children with ASD and 60 with a physiological murmur. The second heart sound (S2) and the spectrum of systolic murmur were analysed. A statistical model was designed using stepwise logistic regression analysis. Significant variables distinguishing pathological form normal findings were the interval between the first heart sound and the beginning of systolic murmur or the respiratory variation of S2, and the frequency of the murmur at its maximum intensity. The area under the ROC curve was 0.922; indicating very good fit of the model and the confidence interval was 0.872-0.971. The sensitivity of the model was 91% and the specificity 73%. The analysis of acoustic findings from the heart is a valuable tool in diagnosing ASD. The next step will be automating this process.", "paper_title": "Atrial septal defect: a diagnostic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000240378700001"}
