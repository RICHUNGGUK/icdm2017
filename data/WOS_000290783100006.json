The reconfiguration reduces the number of arithmetic units required in every processing element (PE) from 24 down to 10. The processor uses a 3D integrated memory that reduces the memory power consumption by 70% when compared to a 2D memory. The system processes a SAR image using a two-tier 3D integrated PE, which when compared to an equivalent 2D PE decreases the power consumed in the interconnect of each PE by 15.5% and the footprint by 49.2%, and allows the PE to operate 7.1% faster in simulation. Additionally, by using 3D integration in the memory one can reduce the power consumption of the memory by 70%. Furthermore, the authors show how the 3D aspects of the processor can be realised by using 2D tools, when used in conjunction with the proposed through-silicon via assignment algorithm.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable five-layer three-dimensional integrated memory-on-logic synthetic aperture radar processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000290783100006"}
