Another trend in chip multiprocessor design is incorporation of sophisticated on-chip interconnection networks. However, such networks are significant power-consumers. In this article, we address these two trends by presenting a power simulator for FinFET-based on-chip interconnection networks. It estimates both dynamic and leakage power. We present results for various FinFET design styles and temperatures (since leakage power changes drastically with temperature), and show that one FinFET design style may be much superior to another from the power consumption point of view.", "paper_title": "FinFET-Based Power Simulator for Interconnection Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000275539200002"}
