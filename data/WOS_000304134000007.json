Opinion mining for product positioning, in fact, is getting a more and more popular research field but the extraction of useful information from social media is not a simple task. In this work we merge AI and Semantic Web techniques to extract, encode and represent this unstructured information. In particular, we use Sentic Computing, a multi-disciplinary approach to opinion mining and sentiment analysis, to semantically and affectively analyze text and encode results in a semantic aware format according to different web ontologies. Eventually we represent this information as an interconnected knowledge base which is browsable through a multi-faceted classification website.", "paper_title": "Sentic Computing for social media marketing", "paper_id": "WOS:000304134000007"}
