Higher abstraction levels based on a macro-state decomposition of the landscape enable the study of larger systems; however, they are still restricted by huge memory requirements of exact approaches. Results: We present a highly parallelizable local enumeration scheme that enables the computation of exact macro-state transition models with highly reduced memory requirements. The approach is evaluated on RNA secondary structure landscapes using a gradient basin definition for macro-states. Furthermore, we demonstrate the need for exact transition models by comparing two barrier-based approaches, and perform a detailed investigation of gradient basins in RNA energy landscapes.", "paper_title": "Memory-efficient RNA energy landscape exploration", "paper_id": "WOS:000342913000006"}
