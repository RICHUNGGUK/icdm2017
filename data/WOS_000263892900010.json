A deficiency in the quality could lead to flutter or stall in the engines. In this study, two statistical methods; the Taguchi Method (TM) and the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) are used to evaluate air flow quality through the intake via fighter aircraft maneuvers. The three factors associated directly with aircraft maneuver ability are the Mach number (M), Angles of Incident (alpha) and Sideslip (beta). Desirable air quality can be described as having high pressure recoveries as well as low distortion at the Aerodynamic Interface Plane (AIP). The intake studied is the portside F-5E duct. Results show that an increase in the Mach number affects the streamwise diffusion of the fluid more than the changing the angles of attack and sides lip, resulting in lower pressure recovery. The secondary flow formation in the stream wise direction is unable to dissipate and increases in strength with increasing Mach number. The curvature in the z-axis is more pronounced than that existing in the x-axis, leading to the formation of more adverse pressure gradients forming and hence greater secondary flow strength. This results in a more distorted flow leading to the AIP. This observation is in tandem with the values of the DC (60) readings obtained. The F-5E's Taguchi's Method results show that Mach number had the greatest effect on pressure recovery, and AOA affected distortion most considerably. Results from ANOVA show that Factors A, B and C and Interactions AC and BC affect the distortion of airflow. However, Factor B or the angle of attack affects this distortion most significantly.
