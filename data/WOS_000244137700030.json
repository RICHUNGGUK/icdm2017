In this paper, one-class support vector machines (SVMs) using sequence-similarity kernels are adopted as the anomaly detectors. Edit distance-based kernel and common subsequence-based kernel are proposed to utilize the sequence information in the detection. Algorithms for efficient computation of the kernels are derived with the techniques of dynamic programming and bit-parallelism. The experimental results indicate that the proposed kernels can significantly outperform the standard RBF kernel. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
