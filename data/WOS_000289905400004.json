Different noise-aware sequential MTCMOS circuits are explored in this paper. A low-leakage data retention sleep mode is implemented with smaller centralized sleep transistors to suppress the ground bouncing noise produced during reactivation events in sequential MTCMOS circuits. Ground bouncing noise, leakage power consumption, data stability, and area overheads of different sequential MTCMOS circuits are evaluated with a 90-nm CMOS technology. The peak amplitude of ground bouncing noise is reduced by up to 94.16% with the noise-aware MTCMOS techniques as compared to the conventional Mutoh flip-flop. The application space of different data retention MTCMOS circuit techniques is identified with various design metrics in this paper.", "paper_title": "Ground Bouncing Noise Suppression Techniques for Data Preserving Sequential MTCMOS Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000289905400004"}
