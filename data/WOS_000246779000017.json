Initial assessment showed an increase in dry material in comparison with a diploid population. The aim was to evaluate whether the increased production of forage found in the tetraploid population Leonel was due to increased foliolae sizes. Design/methodology/approach - Three populations were studied L. glaber. diploid cytotype: seeds from a naturalised population of La Pampa Deprimida (Azul, Argentina); Tetraploid cytotype C1 seeds from the Leonel population, and Lotus corniculatus (Italia) seeds from Italy. Analysis of variance was carried out with a random design using a single factor, for the variables of area, length and width of the central foliolae. Linear and non-linear model families were determined to estimate the area of the central foliolae. The selection criteria applied were: the best R-2, good efficiency, the greatest simplicity of the model and its stability. Findings - The widths of the L. glaber diploid foliolae were less than those of L. corniculatus tetraploide and these were longer. The areas of the L glaber foliolae were greater than those of the tetraploid L. corniculatus, and the areas of the foliolae of the diploid cytotype were slightly superior to the induced tetraploid cytotype L. Leoner. The best model was that which estimated the area of the central foliolae according to their width. Practical implications - Non-destructive estimates of foliar area were obtained for different species of the Lotus genus. The methodology chose provides a useful example of a systemic approach. Originality/value - The variables studied are significant morphophysiological characteristics that can be used in programmes for the genetic improvement of L. glaber and L. corniculatus.", "paper_title": "A systems study of lotus's leaf area", "paper_id": "WOS:000246779000017"}
