To solve the problem efficiently, we set up an optimization model which can effectively tackle the following three issues: (1) how many and which processors are required in computation; (2) in which order the load fractions are distributed to processors; (3) how much the load fraction should be distributed to each processor. For this model, a novel genetic algorithm is proposed, and the convergence of the proposed algorithm to a globally optimal solution with probability one is proved. Finally, the experiments on several examples indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "NEW MODEL AND GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR DIVISIBLE LOAD SCHEDULING IN HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000327353700010"}
