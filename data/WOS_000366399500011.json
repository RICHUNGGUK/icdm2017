An optimization model is defined and the BS placement problem is transformed to a lexicographical stratified programming (LSP) model for a given trajectory, according to different accuracy requirements. The feasible region for BS deployment is obtained from the positioning system requirement, which is also solved with signal coverage problem in BS placement. The LSP mathematical model is formulated with the average geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) as the criterion. To achieve an optimization solution, a tolerant factor based complete stratified series approach and grid searching method are utilized to obtain the possible optimal BS placement. Because of the LSP model utilization, the proposed algorithm has wider application scenarios with different accuracy requirements over different trajectory segments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better BS placement result than existing approaches for a given trajectory.", "paper_title": "Base Station Placement for Wireless Sensor Network Positioning System via Lexicographical Stratified Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399500011"}
