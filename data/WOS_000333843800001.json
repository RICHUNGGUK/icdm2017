In resource constraint networks, the advantages of cooperation can be further exploited by optimally allocating the energy and bandwidth resources among users in a cross-layer way. In this paper, we investigate the problem of transmission power minimization and network lifetime maximization using cooperative diversity for wireless sensor networks, under the constraint of a target end-to-end transmission reliability and a given transmission rate. By utilizing a cross-layer optimization scheme, distributive algorithms which jointly consider routing, relay selection, and power allocation strategies are proposed for the reliability constraint wireless sensor networks. We demonstrate through simulations that the proposed cross-layer cooperative strategies achieve significant energy savings and prolong the network lifetime considerably.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Optimization Scheme Using Cooperative Diversity for Reliable Data Transfer in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333843800001"}
