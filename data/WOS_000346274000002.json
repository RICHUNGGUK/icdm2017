In this paper we study Kan-injectivity in general categories enriched in posets. As an example, omega-CPO's are precisely the posets that are Kan-injective with respect to the embeddings omega hooked right arrow omega + 1 and 0 hooked right arrow 1. For every class H of morphisms, we study the subcategory of all objects that are Kan-injective with respect to H and all morphisms preserving Kan extensions. For categories such as Top(0) and Pos, we prove that whenever H is a set of morphisms, the above subcategory is monadic, and the monad it creates is a Kock-Zoberlein monad. However, this does not generalise to proper classes, and we present a class of continuous mappings in Top(0) for which Kan-injectivity does not yield a monadic category.", "paper_title": "Kan injectivity in order-enriched categories", "paper_id": "WOS:000346274000002"}
