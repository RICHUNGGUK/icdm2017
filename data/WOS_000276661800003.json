First, we provide a weak convergence result for the limiting behavior of closed queueing networks, which is exploited to derive a sufficient and necessary condition establishing the existence of a single bottleneck. Then, we derive the new framework proposing efficient algorithms for the identification of queueing networks bottlenecks by means of linear programming. Our analysis reduces the computational requirements of existing techniques and, under general assumptions, it is able to handle load-dependent stations. We also establish a primal-dual relationship between our approach and a recent technique. This connection lets us extend the dual to deal with load-dependent stations, which is non-intuitive, and provides a unified framework for the enumeration of bottlenecks. Theoretical and practical insights on the asymptotic behavior of multiclass networks are shown as an application of the proposed framework. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
