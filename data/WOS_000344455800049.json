Our method applies context-sensitivity only when and where doing so is likely to improve the precision that matters for resolving given queries. The idea is to use a pre-analysis to estimate the impact of context-sensitivity on the main analysis's precision, and to use this information to find out when and where the main analysis should turn on or off its context-sensitivity. We formalize this approach and prove that the analysis always benefits from the pre-analysis-guided context-sensitivity. We implemented this selective method for an existing industrial-strength interval analyzer for full C. The method reduced the number of (false) alarms by 24.4%, while increasing the analysis cost by 27.8% on average. The use of the selective method is not limited to context-sensitivity. We demonstrate this generality by following the same principle and developing a selective relational analysis.", "paper_title": "Selective Context-Sensitivity Guided by Impact Pre-Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000344455800049"}
