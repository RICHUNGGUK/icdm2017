In this work, we prove that ISN P systems can compute and accept any set of Turing computable numbers by using one type of neurons, thus can achieve Turing universality. Such systems are called homogenous ISN P systems. The results give a positive answer to an open problem left in (Pan and Pun, Int J Comput Commun 4(3):273-282, 2009) that \"whether the number of types of neurons in universal SN P systems can be decreased by using inhibitory synapses\". The obtained result is optimal in the sense of having minimal number of types of neurons in Turing universal SN P systems.", "paper_title": "Homogenous Spiking Neural P Systems with Inhibitory Synapses", "paper_id": "WOS:000357726600012"}
