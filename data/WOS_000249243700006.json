At first, linear networked control systems are considered. Under certain conditions, a stable adaptive fault diagnosis observer is proposed. Then based on the fault estimation information, a fault tolerant controller is designed to recover the system performance. An extension to a class of nonlinear systems is also made. Finally, simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fault identification and fault-tolerant control for a class of networked control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243700006"}
