Research shows that flexibility cannot only be achieved by looking at technological requirements and agreements. Also other agreements should be considered which express other (political, legal and economic) design rationalities and values. Moreover, flexibility is also influenced by the structure and dynamics of the power and trustworthiness of the relationships between the organizations involved.", "paper_title": "Flexibility of information architecture in e-government chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000241160200022"}
