The proposed method could be used on the field data directly and the obtained clusters represent the different working conditions of the power plant pulverizing system. For APSO-BZ, the particle position is updated based on the attractor which equals the random modified value of the own optimal or the global optimal. The boundary zoomed strategy is presented for letting a particle flying outside of the search space be relocated based on the positions of the particle and the attractor. Moreover, the sum of the symmetrical compactness of each cluster is adopted as the fitness function for APSO-BZ. Three real-life datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository and a field dataset of a real power plant pulverizing system are adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experiments results verify that the proposed method has higher clustering capability and avoids the premature convergence under a certain extent. Moreover, the proposed method would implement the working conditions classification more correctly. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
