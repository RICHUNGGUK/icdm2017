Our system converts image of the background and objects into line drawing, and then finds places in which to hide transformed versions of the objects using rotation-invariant shape context matching. During the hiding process, each object is subjected to a slight deformation to enhance its similarity to the background. The results were assessed by a panel of puzzle-solvers.", "paper_title": "A Hidden-picture Puzzles Generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000262666000020"}
