To do so, a simple functional equation between fuzzy preference's element and priority weight is derived firstly, then, based on the equation, three methods are proposed to prove that the normalizing rank aggregation method is simple and effective for deriving the priority vector. Finally, a numerical example is used to illustrate the proposed methods. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.
