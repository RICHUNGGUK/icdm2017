Various synthesizer architectures, including the integer and fractional-N synthesizers, and frequency-to-digital converters (FDC) based digital frequency synthesizers are described. Design specifications for several loop parameters such as noise shaper order in the feedback modulator, loop filter bandwidth, VCO phase noise are based on modulation accuracy and frequency resolution specifications. Advantages of digital loop filter based Delta Sigma frequency synthesizers are analyzed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
