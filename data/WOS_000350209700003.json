Using three case studies as guidance, we show how disrupting household practices-either through changing the technology, task or division of labor-can provide valuable insight into current and future technology usage, and can guide the design of future technologies. Based on our case studies, we outline best practices and challenges with respect to the pragmatics of disruptive research methods.", "paper_title": "Disruption as a Research Method for Studying Technology Use in Homes", "paper_id": "WOS:000350209700003"}
