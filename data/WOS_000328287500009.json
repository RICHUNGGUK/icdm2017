The study points out that by mixing five standard raw materials (end-members) it is possible to obtain mortar binders with the almost same chemical compositions of those determined on the historic and archaeological mortar samples studied in some recent scientific papers. An advanced function of the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, the Solver add-in, was used for the calculation of the right amount of each raw material to be mixed for producing the new binders. This approach could be useful to provide an optimal solution in the process of restoration of ancient monuments, where it is necessary to replace the historic mortars with new highly compatible repair mortars.", "paper_title": "Replicating the chemical composition of the binder for restoration of historic mortars as an optimization problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000328287500009"}
