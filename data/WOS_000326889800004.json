The charging cost for EVs generally differ from each other in choosing the charging time interval (hourly), since the hourly electricity prices are different in the market. In this paper, the problem is formulated into an optimal control one and solved by dynamic programming. Optimization aims to find the economically optimal charging solution for each vehicle. In this paper, a nonlinear battery model is characterized and presented, and a given future electricity prices is assumed and utilized. Simulation results indicate that daily charing cost is reduced by smart charing.", "paper_title": "Optimal control of an electric vehicle's charging schedule under electricity markets", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800004"}
