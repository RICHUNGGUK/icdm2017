Through the exploitation of instantaneous channel gains, the first policy can maximize the sum rate of the system. However, the instantaneous channel gains may be unavailable in a rapid time-varying system, where the first policy is inoperable. Consequently, a robust power control policy which requires only mean channel gains is proposed to maximize the upper bound of the average sum rate, and the properties of this policy are investigated. Simulation results show that, by comparison with the policy in which all the nodes use their peak transmit power, the proposed power control policies can provide considerable system performance improvement. Furthermore, the performance difference between the two proposed policies is negligible when the relay is close to one source.", "paper_title": "Power control for two-way amplify-and-forward relaying over Rayleigh fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000289803000003"}
