In real-time control systems, tasks could be faulty due to various reasons. Faulty tasks may compromise the performance and safety of the whole system and even cause disastrous consequences. In this paper, we describe On-demand Real-TimE GuArd (ORTEGA), a new software fault tolerance architecture for real-time control systems. ORTEGA has high fault coverage and reliability. Compared with existing real-time fault tolerance architectures, such as Simplex, ORTEGA allows more efficient resource utilications and enhances flexibility. These advantages are achieved through the on-demand detection and recovery of faulty tasks. ORTEGA is applicable to most industrial control applications where both efficient resource usage and high fault coverage are desired.", "paper_title": "ORTEGA: An Efficient and Flexible Online Fault Tolerance Architecture for Real-Time Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262989100003"}
