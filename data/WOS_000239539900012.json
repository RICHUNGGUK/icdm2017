Nevertheless, there exist several classes of tasks where use of this approach may be complicated (problems characterized by geometrical incommensurability of individual subdomains, motion, etc.). In such cases, application of the integrodifferential. approach may be an advantage. The paper seeks to present the theoretical background of the method. Design/methodology/approach - The mathematical model consists of a system of integrodifferential equations for current densities in electrically conductive domains. Findings - The methodology is illustrated on an example. All computations are realized by a code developed and written by the authors. Originality/value - The presented algorithm based on the integrodifferential approach makes it possible to solve problems that are only hardly solvable by classical differential methods.", "paper_title": "Computation of general nonstationary 2D eddy currents in linear moving arrangements using integrodifferential approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000239539900012"}
