However, conventional NMF learning methods require the entire dataset to reside in the memory and thus cannot be applied to large-scale or streaming datasets. In this paper, we propose an efficient online RSA-NMF algorithm (OR-NMF) that learns NMF in an incremental fashion and thus solves this problem. In particular, OR-NMF receives one sample or a chunk of samples per step and updates the bases via robust stochastic approximation. Benefitting from the smartly chosen learning rate and averaging technique, OR-NMF converges at the rate of O(1/root k) in each update of the bases. Furthermore, we prove that OR-NMF almost surely converges to a local optimal solution by using the quasi-martingale. By using a buffering strategy, we keep both the time and space complexities of one step of the OR-NMF constant and make OR-NMF suitable for large-scale or streaming datasets. Preliminary experimental results on real-world datasets show that OR-NMF outperforms the existing online NMF (ONMF) algorithms in terms of efficiency. Experimental results of face recognition and image annotation on public datasets confirm the effectiveness of OR-NMF compared with the existing ONMF algorithms.", "paper_title": "Online Nonnegative Matrix Factorization With Robust Stochastic Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000305397900007"}
