Our approach efficiently exploits the massive computational capabilities of modern CPUs and GPUs commonly found in off-the-shelf computer systems. The algorithm is specifically tailored to be highly scalable on both the CPU and the GPU sides. We can compute discrete and continuous external and self-collisions of non-penetrating rigid and deformable objects consisting of many tens of thousands of triangles in a few milliseconds on a modern PC. Our approach is orders of magnitude faster than earlier CPU-based approaches and up to twice as fast as the most recent GPU-based techniques.", "paper_title": "Fast and Scalable CPU/GPU Collision Detection for Rigid and Deformable Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000282019900011"}
