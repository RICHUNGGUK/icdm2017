In order to capture the equivalence relation between these systems, a notion of alternating approximate bisimilarity is introduced. This paper aims to establish a modal characterization for alternating approximate bisimilarity. Based on this result, we provide a link between specifications satisfied by the samples of control systems with disturbances and their finite abstractions. Moreover, a simple example is given to illustrate the application of such link in the design of controller of control systems.", "paper_title": "A modal characterization of alternating approximate bisimilarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000336398200002"}
