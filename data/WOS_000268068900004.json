Our approach proceeds within the framework of computational algebraic geometry. First we argue and propose a plausible protocol for automatic discovery, and then we present some algorithmic criteria, as well as the meaning (regarding the algebraic geometry of the varieties involved in the given statement), for the protocol success/failure.
