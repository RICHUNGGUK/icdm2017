A mathematical model is presented to aid an operations manager in an MTO environment to select a set of potential customer orders to maximize the operational profit such that all the selected orders are fulfilled by their deadline. With a given capacity limit on each source for each resource type, solving this model leads to an optimal capacity plan as required for the selected orders over a given (finite) planning horizon. The proposed model considers regular time, overtime, and outsourcing as the sources for each resource type. By applying this model to a small MTO operation, this paper demonstrates a contrast between maximal capacity utilization and optimal operational profit. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
