First, a brief review of AFS theory is presented and a completely distributive lattice, the E(#)I algebra, is proposed. Secondly, two kinds of E(#)I algebra representations of fuzzy concepts are derived in detail, In order to represent the membership functions of fuzzy concepts in the interval [0, 1], the norm of AFS algebra is defined and studied. Finally, the relationships of various representations with their advantages and drawbacks are analyzed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
