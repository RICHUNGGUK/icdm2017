This approach combines the perceptual information of three natures - colour, texture, and homogeneity - in order to segment natural colour images. These low-level features are extracted using a multiple scale neural architecture we previously proven in [1,20]. Present approach incorporates the human knowledge to a hierarchical categorisation process, where the features of the three natures are independently categorised. The final segmentation is achieved through pattern refinement cycles. The approach is compared to other two significant natural scene segmentation methods, achieving better results in a global evaluation. These comparisons are performed using the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
