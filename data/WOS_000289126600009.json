To begin with, the uncertain linguistic variables can be transformed into the trapezoidal fuzzy number, and the prospect value function of the trapezoidal fuzzy number based on the decision-making reference point of each attribute and the weight function of interval probability can be constructed; then the prospect value of attribute for every alternative is calculated through prospect value function of the trapezoidal fuzzy number and the weight function of interval probability, and the weighted prospect value of alternative is acquired by using weighted average method according to attribute weights, and all the alternatives are sorted according to the expected values of the weighted prospect values; Finally, an illustrate example is given to show the decision-making steps, the influence on decision making for different parameters of value function and different decision-making reference point, and the feasibility of the method.
