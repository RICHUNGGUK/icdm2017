The elevation behavior of an oil-water interface is demonstrated experimentally, using a transparent acrylic cylindrical container (176 mm in inner diameter, 450 mm in height) with the bottom half (100 mm) filled with deionized water and the top half (between 50 and 150 mm) with an immiscible oil (viscosity 1 or 5 cSt). Copper fragments are inserted into each liquid (at top and bottom) to serve as electrodes, i.e., the oil layer is negatively charged, and the water layer is positively charged. A high-DC-voltage power supply provides potential difference of the order between about 1 and 30 kV. As a result, three kinds of behavior are observed, i.e.: (1) rotary motion on the interface in lower electric field supplied about E = 0.013 kV/mm; (2) fluctuation on the interface in medium electric field supplied about E = 0.021 kV/mm; (3) elevation of the interface in higher electric field supplied between E = 0.04 and 0.65 kV/mm (which depends on the depth of the oil layer).", "paper_title": "Behavior of an oppositely charged oil-water interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000276609500003"}
