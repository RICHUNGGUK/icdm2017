Based on these novel techniques, the radio resource management (RRM) strategies, such as access control, also need to be developed. This paper proposes the maximum utility principle access control (MUPAC) basing on Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm for multi-antenna cellular network architectures. In the accessing process of the proposed algorithm, the shortest path in Dijkstra's Algorithm is replaced by the cost of accessing process, which is represented by utility function. Taking Generalized Distributed Cellular Architecture - Group Cell as an example, MUPAC is described in details with the utility function, maximum utility principle, flow chart of accessing process. Performance evaluation and analyses verify the merits of MUPAC algorithm in improving system capacity, accessing success probability, and efficiency of system resources usage.
