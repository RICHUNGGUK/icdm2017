This paper develops NPI for multinomial data when the total number of possible categories for the data is known. We present the upper and lower probabilities for events involving the next observation and several of their properties. We also comment on differences between this NPI approach and corresponding inferences based on Walley's Imprecise Dirichlet Model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
