By applying mixed interpolation methods with arbitrary nodes for approximating real functions and the eigenvalues of the given matrix A, we propose a definition for computing the matrix function f (A). We will show the existence and uniqueness of the proposed definition. By using this definition, we present various practical techniques for computing the matrix function f (A). Finally some numerical examples and an application are given to show the applicability and the efficiency of the presented techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
