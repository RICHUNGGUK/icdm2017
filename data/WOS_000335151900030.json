Simple and intuitive as it appears, the conjecture has remained open since its proposal in 2004, and is now a well-known unsolved problem in the field of network coding. Based on a recently proposed tool of space information flow, we present a geometric framework for analyzing the multiple-unicast conjecture. The framework consists of four major steps, in which the conjecture is transformed from its throughput version to cost version, from the graph domain to the space domain, and then from high dimension to 1-D, where it is to be eventually proved. We apply the geometric framework to derive unified proofs to known results of the conjecture, as well as new results previously unknown. A possible proof to the conjecture based on this framework is outlined.", "paper_title": "A Geometric Perspective to Multiple-Unicast Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000335151900030"}
