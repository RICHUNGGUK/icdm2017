Capabilities: Phylocom calculates numerous metrics of phylogenetic community structure and trait similarity within communities. Hypothesis testing is implemented using several null models. Within the same framework, it measures phylogenetic signal and correlated evolution for species traits. A range of utility functions allow community and phylogenetic data manipulation, tree and trait generation, and integration into scientific workflows.", "paper_title": "Phylocom: software for the analysis of phylogenetic community structure and trait evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000258959600020"}
