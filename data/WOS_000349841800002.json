The purpose of this study is to investigate the whole search processes of seventh graders. 11 participants were assigned to three tasks that varied in difficulty. The findings demonstrated that search patterns can change according to types of tasks. Especially the number of page visits and correct hits, the way keywords used, and task completion success differed across task type. Although the statistical analysis did not generate significant relationships, qualitative analysis demonstrated that time spent, scan type, number of keywords, and reading styles differed for all tasks.", "paper_title": "Students' Web Search Strategies With Different Task Types: An Eye-Tracking Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000349841800002"}
