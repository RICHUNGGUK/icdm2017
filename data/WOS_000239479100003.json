In addition to that, such specifications can be exploited to guide the generation of code. What is needed at this level is a general methodology that accompanies the translation process, which in particular should help understanding whether and when it is more appropriate to implement a software component as a thread or as a monitor. The objective of this paper is to develop a systematic approach to the synthesis of correctly coordinating monitors from arbitrary process algebraic specifications that satisfy some suitable constraints. The whole approach will be illustrated by means of the process algebraic specification of a cruise control system.", "paper_title": "Synthesizing concurrency control components from process algebraic specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000239479100003"}
