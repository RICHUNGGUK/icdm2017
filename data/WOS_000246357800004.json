An adaptive online training algorithm is optimized to improve the transient response of the network via so-called conic sector theorem. Furthermore, L-2-stability of weight estimation error of RNN is guaranteed such that the robustness of the controller is ensured in the presence of uncertainties. In consideration of practical applications, the algorithm is developed in the discrete-time domain. Simulations for a seven-link robot model are presented to justify the advantage of the proposed approach. We give comparisons between the standard PD control and the proposed RNN compensation method.", "paper_title": "Robust recurrent neural network control of biped robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000246357800004"}
