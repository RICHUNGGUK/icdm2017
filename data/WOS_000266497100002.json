The best existing solutions to the SLAM problem are based on probabilistic techniques, mainly derived from the basic Bayes Filter. A recent approach is the use of Rao-Blackwellized particle filters. The FastSLAM solution factorizes the Bayes SLAM posterior using a particle filter to estimate over the possible paths of the robot and several independent Kalman Filters attached to each particle to estimate the location of landmarks conditioned to the robot path. Although there are several successful implementations of this idea, there is a lack of applications to indoor environments where the most common feature is the line segment corresponding to straight walls. This paper presents a novel factorization, which is the dual of the existing FastSLAM one, that decouples the SLAM into a map estimation and a localization problem, using a particle filter to estimate over maps and a Kalman Filter attached to each particle to estimate the robot pose conditioned to the given map. We have implemented and tested this approach, analyzing and comparing our solution with the FastSLAM one, and successfully building feature based maps of indoor environments.", "paper_title": "Dual FastSLAM: Dual Factorization of the Particle Filter Based Solution of the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000266497100002"}
