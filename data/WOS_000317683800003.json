The focus of this paper is on how to prevent generating the flexible hinges during the process of topology optimization of compliant mechanisms. In the proposed method, two types of mean compliances are introduced and built in the proposed multi-objective function for topology optimization of hinge-free compliant mechanisms with multiple outputs, therefore, the spring model widely used for topology optimization of compliant mechanisms is no longer needed. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Topology optimization of hinge-free compliant mechanisms with multiple outputs using level set method", "paper_id": "WOS:000317683800003"}
