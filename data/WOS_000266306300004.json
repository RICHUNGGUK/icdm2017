We present a novel concept of collaborative workflow design which combines cooperation and workflow model analysis. Workflow analysis is simplified using workflow metrics, which help identifying problematic aspects of the workflow model. Our findings are implemented in a collaborative workflow design system, which is easily accessible on the Web, but provides a desktop-like user experience. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
