This paper studies attribute reduction in fuzzy decision systems based on generalized fuzzy evidence theory. The definitions of several kinds of attribute reducts are introduced. The relationships among these reducts are then investigated. In a fuzzy decision system, it is proved that the concepts of fuzzy positive region reduct, lower approximation reduct and generalized fuzzy belief reduct are all equivalent, the concepts of fuzzy upper approximation reduct and generalized fuzzy plausibility reduct are equivalent, and a generalized fuzzy plausibility consistent set must be a generalized fuzzy belief consistent set. In a consistent fuzzy decision system, an attribute set is a generalized fuzzy belief reduct if and only if it is a generalized fuzzy plausibility reduct. But in an inconsistent fuzzy decision system, a generalized fuzzy belief reduct is not a generalized fuzzy plausibility reduct in general. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
