This experiment investigates how pointing is affected by whether the target location is precued so that users know it in advance or nonprecued so that users learn it only at the onset of pointing trials. The study investigates this for young, adult, and elderly participants pointing with mouse and touchpad. Target precuing affects the trial completion time, the reaction time, the sheer movement time, and multiple movement kinematics. In addition, target precuing interacts with the use of either mouse or touchpad, with target distance, and with target size, but surprisingly little with participant age. Because the target location was always made known to participants no later than at the onset of the pointing trial, the effects of target precuing must be due to the different possibilities for mental and motor preparations.", "paper_title": "The Effect of Target Precuing on Pointing With Mouse and Touchpad", "paper_id": "WOS:000317284100003"}
