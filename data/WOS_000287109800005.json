Conventional methods on curve cases are to minimize integral(1)(0) parallel to A(t) - C(t)parallel to(2)dt, where C(t) and A(t) are the given curve and the approximation curve, respectively. A much better solution is to minimize integral(1)(0) parallel to A(phi(t)) - C(t)parallel to(2)dt, where A(phi(t)) is the closest point to point C(t), that produces a similar effect as that of the Hausdorff distance. This paper uses a piecewise linear function L(t) instead of t to approximate the function phi(t) for a constrained multi-degree reduction of Bezier curves. Numerical examples show that this new reparameterization-based method has a much better approximation effect under Hausdorff distance than those of previous methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
