The model is based on a real-valued function v on a (finite) family of sets which yields the constraints of a combinatorial linear program. Moreover, v gives rise to a ranking and selection procedure for the elements of the ground set N and thus implies a greedy algorithm for the linear program. It is proved that the greedy algorithm is guaranteed to produce primal and dual optimal solutions if and only if an associated functional on R-N is concave. Previous matroid-type greedy models are shown to fit into the present general context. In particular, a general model for combinatorial optimization under supermodular constraints is presented which guarantees the greedy algorithm to work.", "paper_title": "A ranking model for the greedy algorithm and discrete convexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000301454100016"}
