The radii of the uniqueness balls of the singular points of vector fields are estimated under the assumption that the vector fields satisfy the gamma-condition, and the results due to Wang and Han in [Criterion a and Newton's method under weak conditions, Chinese J. Numer. Appl. Math. 19(2) (1997) 96-105] are extended. Moreover, applications to analytic vector fields are given. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
