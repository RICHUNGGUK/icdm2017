Our proposed approach combines a greedy hill-climbing algorithm and a cyclic permutation method. When searching for optimal ER-fMRI designs, the proposed approach focuses only on a promising restricted class of designs with equal frequency of occurrence across stimulus types. The computational time is significantly reduced. We demonstrate that our proposed approach is very efficient compared with a recently proposed genetic algorithm approach. We also apply our approach in obtaining designs that are robust against misspecification of error correlations.", "paper_title": "A fast algorithm for constructing efficient event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000340102000008"}
