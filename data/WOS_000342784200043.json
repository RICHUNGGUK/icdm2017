Inspired by the observation that various image derivatives have great but different effects on visual perception. we perform respective comparison on different orders of image derivatives. To obtain an overall image quality score, we adaptively integrate the results of different comparisons via a perception-inspired strategy. Experimental results on public databases demonstrate that the proposed method is more competitive than some state-of-the-art methods, benchmarked against subjective assessment given by human beings.", "paper_title": "Image Quality Assessment Based on Multi-Order Visual Comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784200043"}
