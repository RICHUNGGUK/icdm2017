To achieve an efficient vulnerability analysis, we have made a prospective study to establish the importance of areas based on two popular ranking algorithms - PageRank and HITS. These areas are analysed using a flexible method of semi-supervised clustering. This approach enables better control because it works top-down from the whole network to the detail of a particular area; and provides valuable additional support for assessing vulnerability in WSNs.
