The new transmission conditions include also derivative information, not just function values, and optimized Schwarz methods can be used without overlap. In this paper, we present a new optimized Schwarz method without overlap in the 2d case, which uses a different Robin condition for neighbouring subdomains at their common interface, and which we call two-sided Robin condition. We optimize the parameters in the Robin conditions and show that for a fixed frequency omega, an asymptotic convergence factor of 1-O(h(1/4)) in the mesh parameter h can be achieved. If the frequency is related to the mesh parameter h,h= O(1/omega(gamma)) for gamma >= 1, then the optimized asymptotic convergence factor is 1-O(omega((1-2y)/8)). We illustrate our analysis with 2d numerical experiments.
