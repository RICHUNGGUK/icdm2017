Consequently, as the squint angles get large, the performance of focusing will deteriorate significantly. This paper, however, abandons those traditional solutions to the bi-static imaging problems and introduces a novel method, based on the space model of bi-static platforms. First, a precise range model is established. Then, a new chirp scaling algorithm for bi-static SAR using the precise range model is advanced. It is theoretically proven that this is an analytic solution of the bi-static chirp scaling algorithm. Images can be focused accurately even with large squint angles. At last simulations with large squint angles are made to verify the validity of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Chirp scaling algorithm for bi-static SAR using a precise range model", "paper_id": "WOS:000268788700010"}
