A tracking strategy is referred to as partial when the tracking portfolio is solely formed by a subset of stocks, so enabling a substantial cost reduction in comparison with full tracking. Three criteria are usually employed in the literature when building the tracking portfolio: tracking error variance, excess return and tracking portfolio variance. This paper considers a new parameter for use with the above: frontier curvature. This criterion is not defined for a particular portfolio, but for all the portfolios that define the tracking frontier. The main implication is that a manager can satisfy different investment profiles with the same subset of stocks. The manager will therefore reduce transaction costs as all the portfolios on the frontier contain the same stocks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
