Higher frequencies, along with stringent EMC regulations, are driving the need for developing EMI-aware design methodologies in early and sign-off phases of design cycles. This article discusses the significant challenges of scale, connectivity, turnaround time, and accuracy needed in developing such a flow. In particular, the numerical effect of violating established EMI guidelines is quantified in the flow, enabling cutting-edge designs that are less conservative and still satisfy EMI constraints. The role of rigorous large-scale 3D full-wave electromagnetic simulation in developing such a full-system EMI prediction and early design flow is discussed. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
