The proposed method uses a coarse-to-fine strategy with different appearance features to describe facial shape and texture. Considering the damage to continuity between neighboring groups caused by fixed divisions during age group classification, a dynamic grouping technique is employed to allow non-fixed groups. Based on the given group, an ordinal hyperplane ranking (OHRank) model is employed to transform age estimation into a series of binary enquiry problems that can take advantage of the intrinsic correlation and ordinal information of age. A set of experiments on FG-NET are presented and the results demonstrate the validity of our solution.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Age Estimation based on Dynamic Grouping and OHRank", "paper_id": "WOS:000345331400016"}
