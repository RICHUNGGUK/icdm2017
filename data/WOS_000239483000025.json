It consists of three parts: a new spectral peak analysis based feature extraction, speaker clustering and model selection using VQ, and MLP based speaker identification. The feature vector reflects the speaker specific characteristics and has a long-term feature for which makes it text-independent. The proposed method has a computational efficient for feature extraction and identification. To evaluate the proposed method, we calculated the correct identification ratio (CIR), the average CIR of the proposed and GMM method was 92.27% and 85.78% for 5 seconds segments in 15-speaker identification. Experimental results, we have achieved a performance comparable to GMM-method.", "paper_title": "A new text-independent speaker identification using Vector Quantization and Multi-layer Perceptron", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000025"}
