Due to architectural modification, the improved adder only selects and transmits carry signals; it therefore is named conditional carry adder (CCA). This 32-bit adder focuses on reducing the numbers of internal nodes and logical gates, while maintaining high speed. The 32-bit conditional sum adder uses 186 multiplexers, and the proposed 32-bit CCA only uses 129 multiplexers. Consequently, the proposed adder is attractive for use in low-power arithmetic systems. Conventional single-end static CMOS and differential-end CPL circuits were used to implement and compare the proposed 32-bit CCA. Experimental and control chips were designed and fabricated using 0.5 mu m CMOS technology. Simulations and measurements under various supply voltages showed that the 32-bit CCA achieved high performance in low-voltage high-speed applications.", "paper_title": "Improved 32-bit conditional sum adder for low-power high-speed applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000239532700017"}
