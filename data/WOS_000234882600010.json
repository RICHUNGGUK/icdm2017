With the continuous OWN and WOWA ideas recently proposed by Yager, an improvement on the continuous OWN and WOWA operator is proposed. The properties of WOWA are also extended from discrete to the continuous case. Based on these properties, two families of parameterized RIM quantifiers for WOWA operator are proposed, which have exponential generating function and piecewise linear generating function respectively. One interesting property of these two kinds of RIM quantifiers is that for any aggregated set (or variable) under any weighted (distribution) function, the aggregation values are always consistent with the orness (optimistic) levels, so they can be used to represent the decision maker's preference, and we can get the preference value of fuzzy sets or random variables with the orness level of RIM quantifier as their control parameter.", "paper_title": "Some properties of the weighted OWA operator", "paper_id": "WOS:000234882600010"}
