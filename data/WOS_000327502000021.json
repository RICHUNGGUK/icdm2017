In order to further improve the identification efficiency of tag anti-collision algorithms in RFID systems, several types of dynamic framed slotted ALOHA (DFSA) anti-collision algorithms are analyzed, and a new anti-collision algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm has the ability of identifying the time slot distribution which is selected by the tags within a reader's interrogation range in advance. Then the free time slots will be skipped when the reader queries each time slot. Also, the colliding tags will be immediately processed with additional time slots. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm takes fewer total number of time slots and has a higher efficiency of tag identification compared to the other four DFSA anti-collision algorithms.", "paper_title": "AN ALOHA-BASED IMPROVED ANTI-COLLISION ALGORITHM FOR RFID SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000327502000021"}
