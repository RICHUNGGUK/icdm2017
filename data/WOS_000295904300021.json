In this new proposed video transmission network, the DVT is worked directly with the DFED, which is quite different from the conventional DVT, and the DFED is known to have the advantage of simple and efficient decoder. Also, our recent proposed low-cost H.264/AVC based DVC solution, named as the Padding Based DVC, requires lower computational complexity (CC) and hardware cost at the encoder side, compared with the conventional DVC schemes. In fact, it uses pad data (blocks and pixels) at decoder from reference frame for those skip blocks at encoder with sum of absolute differences (SAD) and DC classification. Hence, with the new proposed video network configuration, we could further shift the CC from the portable device to the network side, and this enables us to lower the cost of portable device and the overall video network system. The experimental results for the uplink path show that the proposed scheme can achieve desired video quality and outperform the conventional DVC schemes for most test video sequences.", "paper_title": "NOVEL VIDEO TRANSMISSION NETWORK WITH LOW COST H.264/AVC BASED DISTRIBUTED VIDEO CODING", "paper_id": "WOS:000295904300021"}
