The system dynamically monitors circuit performance with a delay line and provides a substantially constant minimum supply voltage for digital processors to properly operate at a given frequency. In addition, the system adjusts the supply voltage to the required minimum under different process, voltage, and temperature and load conditions. The design issues of the fully digital power delivery system are discussed and addressed. This digital FSM scheme significantly reduces the complexity of control-loop implementation (<1800 gates) and power consumption (< 100 mu W at 1.2 V) compared to other approaches based on proportional-integral-differential control. The power delivery control system is fabricated in a 0.13-mu m CMOS process and its core die size is 160 X 110 mu m(2).", "paper_title": "A high-efficiency fully digital synchronous buck converter power delivery system based on a finite-state machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000237209800002"}
