These methods are generally grounded on the invariance of systems under rigid motions. In order to decompose further, other invariance groups (e.g., scalings) have recently been considered. Geometric decomposition is grounded on the possibility to replace a solved subsystem with a smaller system called boundary. This article shows the central property that justifies decomposition, without assuming specific types of constraints or invariance groups. The exact nature of the boundary system is given. This formalization brings out the elements of a general and modular implementation.", "paper_title": "A formalization of geometric constraint systems and their decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000275414900003"}
