As these queries are often ambiguous or incomplete, search engines tend to return results whose rankings reflect a community of intent. Moreover, search engines are designed to satisfy the needs of the general populace, not those of a specific searcher. To address these issues, we propose two methods that use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to build a Clustered User Interest Profile (CUIP), for each user, from the tags annotated by a community of users to web resources of interest. A CUIP consists of clusters of semantically or syntactically related tags, each cluster identifying a topic of the user's interest. The matching cluster, to the given user's query, aids in disambiguation of user search needs and assists the search engine to generate a set of personalized search results. A series of experiments was executed against two data sets to judge the clustering tendency of the cluster structure CUIP, and to evaluate the quality of personalized search. The experiment results indicate that the CUIP based personalized search outperforms the baseline search and is better than the other approaches that use social bookmarking services for building a user profile and use it for personalized search.
