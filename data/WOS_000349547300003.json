Following this line of thought, we propose the Communicating Ants for Clustering with Backtracking strategy (CACB) algorithm, which is based on a dynamic and an adaptive aggregation threshold and a backtracking strategy where artificial ants are allowed to turn back in their previous aggregation decisions. The CACB algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that generates compact dendrograms since it allows the aggregation of more than two clusters at a time. Its high performance is experimentally shown through several real benchmark data sets and a content-based image retrieval system.", "paper_title": "A bio-inspired hierarchical clustering algorithm with backtracking strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000349547300003"}
