In contrast to previous work on the subject, it is not assumed that the ideal in question is principal. In particular, it is shown that the corresponding inverse norm sum depends not only on the regulator and discriminant of the number field, but also on the values of the ideal class Dedekind zeta functions. Along the way, we derive an estimate of the number of elements in a given ideal with a certain algebraic norm within a finite hypercube. We provide several examples which measure the accuracy and predictive ability of our theorems.", "paper_title": "PROBABILITY ESTIMATES FOR FADING AND WIRETAP CHANNELS FROM IDEAL CLASS ZETA FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000367402000001"}
