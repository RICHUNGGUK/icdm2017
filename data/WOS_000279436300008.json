Based on the MCLS, prescription regression (all regression coefficients are nonnegative and their sum is 1), and generalized linear regression model (the dependent variables is unknown), a definite linear algorithms is constructed. The data example of SEM with multilayer construction is provided to illustrate the algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
