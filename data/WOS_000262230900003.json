Although the emerging Grid computing paradigm is scalable and flexible, achieving both efficiency and quality of service provisioning in Grids is a challenging task but is necessary for the wide adoption of Grids. Grid middleware should also be robust to uncertainties such as those in user-estimated runtimes of Grid applications. In this paper, we present a complete middleware framework for Grids that achieves user satisfaction by providing QoS guarantees for Grid applications, cost effectiveness by efficiently utilizing resources and robustness by intelligently handling uncertain runtimes of applications.
