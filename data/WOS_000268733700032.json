The non-measurable state variables, as the torsional torque and the load machine speed are estimated using multilayer feed-forward neural networks. The main stages of the design methodology of these neural estimators are presented. The optimal brain damage method is implemented for the structure optimization of each neural network. Then signals estimated by neural estimators are tested in the electrical drive control structure with additional feedbacks from the estimated shaft torque and the difference between the motor and the load speeds. The simulation results show good accuracy of both presented neural estimators for the wide range of changes of the reference speed and the load torque. The simulation results are then verified by laboratory experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
