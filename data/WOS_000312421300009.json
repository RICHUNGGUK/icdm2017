To test this premise, vernacular urban forms have been analyzed to identify patterns of built morphology which might have developed as a response to prevailing climatic conditions. This approach is often based on visual analysis and subjective and qualitative recognition of climate-related patterns. The current paper presents an alternative approach, using a quantitative methodology to support the systematic and automated recognition of urban morphological patterns. A parametric GIS model was developed for automated recognition of urban objects, employing the ability of C-IS to recognize contextual relations among objects and perform a context-based recognition using basic rules that apply to the organization of urban form. The model was statistically tested for its accuracy with satisfying results. A case study is presented to demonstrate the workability of the model and its potential as a quantitative and systematic tool for quantitatively describing the morphology of urban surfaces for urban climate analysis. As a parametric model, it can be modified and applied to a large number of case studies for developing and updating databases of urban morphology, and these can serve as a basis for the recognition of morphological patterns in urban form.
