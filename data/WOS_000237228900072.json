We model fluctuating crosstalk or nonlinear interactions among building blocks via higher-order Walsh coefficients. The fluctuating crosstalk behaves like exogenous noise and can be handled by increasing the population size and run duration. This behavior holds until the strength of the crosstalk far exceeds the underlying fitness variance by a certain factor empirically observed. Our results also have implications for the relative performance of building-block-wise mutation over crossover.", "paper_title": "Fluctuating crosstalk as a source of. deterministic noise and its effects on GA scalability", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900072"}
