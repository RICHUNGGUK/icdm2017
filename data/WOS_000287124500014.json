First, a set of nonlinear equalities and inequalities are generated using similarity operations with respect to stability constraints. Second, a fitness function is proposed to solve the mentioned set by G As for eigenvalues assignment in a prescribed region. In the next step, to achieve time-response improvement of systems, some terms are added to the primary fitness function. These terms are obtained by using a relationship between frequency response and time parameters. Then, the presented method is evaluated in a challenge example to show the superiority of our method to the existing methods in terra of the norm of feedback matrix, rise-time and overshoot.", "paper_title": "STABILIZATION OF SIMULTANEOUS LINEAR MULTIVARIABLE SYSTEMS WHILE IMPROVING TIME-RESPONSE USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500014"}
