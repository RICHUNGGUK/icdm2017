This algorithm converts decisions into bitwise logic operation so that W (CPU word size) test patterns are searched independently. Multiple objectives for different quality metrics can therefore be achieved in a single test generation process. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 and IWLS'05 benchmark circuits show that SWK test sets are better in many quality metrics than traditional 50-detect test sets, while the length of the former is shorter. Also, patterns selected from large N-detect pattern pool cannot achieve the same or higher quality than patterns generated by SWK.", "paper_title": "A Parallel Test Pattern Generation Algorithm to Meet Multiple Quality Objectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000296015200016"}
