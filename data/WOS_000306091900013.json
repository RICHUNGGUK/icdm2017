In this paper, two length models along with two parameter estimation methods and two alternative parametrisations for statistical machine translation (SMT) are presented. More precisely, we incorporate explicit bilingual length modelling in a state-of-the-art log-linear SMT system as an additional feature function in order to prove the contribution of length information. Finally, a systematic evaluation on reference SMT tasks considering different language pairs proves the benefits of explicit length modelling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
