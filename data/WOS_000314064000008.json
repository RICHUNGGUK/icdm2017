Our goal is to illustrate the advantages and difficulties encountered when deploying GPU technology to perform sparse linear algebra computations. Techniques for speeding up sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) kernels and finding suitable preconditioning methods are discussed. Our experiments with an NVIDIA TESLA M2070 show that for unstructured matrices SpMV kernels can be up to 8 times faster on the GPU than the Intel MKL on the host Intel Xeon X5675 Processor. Overall performance of the GPU-accelerated Incomplete Cholesky (IC) factorization preconditioned CG method can outperform its CPU counterpart by a smaller factor, up to 3, and GPU-accelerated The incomplete LU (ILU) factorization preconditioned GMRES method can achieve a speed-up nearing 4. However, with better suited preconditioning techniques for GPUs, this performance can be further improved.", "paper_title": "GPU-accelerated preconditioned iterative linear solvers", "paper_id": "WOS:000314064000008"}
