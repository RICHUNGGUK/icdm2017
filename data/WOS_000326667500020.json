By defining related reference sequences, we find that these sequences possess very low k-error linear complexity for some certain values of the parameter k even though they have high linear complexity. Moreover, we point out that (p - 1)-tuple distributions of all these sequences are not span. Thus they should be selected carefully for use in stream cipher systems.", "paper_title": "Some Notes on the Generalized Cyclotomic Binary Sequences of Length 2p(m) and p(m)", "paper_id": "WOS:000326667500020"}
