The dynamic analysis here employs results from the theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side as introduced by Filippov. And by using differential inclusions theory, the Lyapunov functional method and the inequality technique, some new sufficient conditions ensuring exponential anti-synchronization of two chaotic delayed memristive neural networks are derived. The new proposed results here are very easy to verify and they also improve the earlier publications. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the new scheme.
