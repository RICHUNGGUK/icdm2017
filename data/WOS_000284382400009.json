We show optimality of the algorithms under certain sub- and supermodular assumptions and monotone constraints. For supermodular lattice polyhedra with submodular constraints, our algorithms offer the farthest reaching generalization of Edmonds' polymatroid greedy algorithm currently known.", "paper_title": "Two-Phase Greedy Algorithms for Some Classes of Combinatorial Linear Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000284382400009"}
