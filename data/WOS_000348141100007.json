Cognitive radio technology can be used to facilitate the deployment of smart grid systems. In this paper, we propose a data collection and dissemination framework for cognitive radio smart grid systems to fully utilize wireless resources while maintaining a reliably connected and efficient topology for each channel. In the proposed framework, each sensor node selects a channel considering the primary user (PU) channel utilization and network connectivity. In this way, the data collection and dissemination can be performed with a high reliability and short delay while avoiding a harmful effect on primary users. We use computer simulations to evaluate the proposed framework.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Dynamic Channel Assignment and Routing Framework for Cognitive Sensor Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141100007"}
