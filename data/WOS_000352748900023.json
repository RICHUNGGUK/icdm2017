Both metaheuristics are based on the TREE local search method introduced in Sakuraba and Yagiura (2010) that is the only method ever applied to a set of large-sized instances that are in line with the scale of nowadays real applications. By providing diversification and intensification features, the introduced methods improve all best known solutions of the large-sized instances set. Extensive numerical experiments show that the introduced methods are capable of tackling sparse and dense large-scale instances with up to 8000 vertices and 31,996,000 edges in a reasonable amount of time; while they also performs well in practice when compared with other state-of-the-art methods in a benchmark with small and medium-scale instances.
