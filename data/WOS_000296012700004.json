These algorithms are based on both the Fletcher-Reeves version of the nonlinear conjugate gradient method and a polynomial preconditioner type based on block two-stage methods. The behavior of these algorithms is analyzed when incomplete LU factorizations are used in order to obtain the inner splittings of the block two-stage method. As our illustrative example we have considered a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation, known as the Bratu problem. The reported experiments show the performance of the algorithms designed in this work on two multicore architectures.", "paper_title": "Parallel nonlinear preconditioners on multicore architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000296012700004"}
