Our verification of the steady-state distribution is based on the global balance equation for the system, which takes the form of a partial differential equation. The M(n)/G/infinity model is important for studying admission-control led, multi-server systems, e.g., communication networks with call/flow admission policies. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
