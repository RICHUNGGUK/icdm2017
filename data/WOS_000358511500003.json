Several alternative definitions are discussed, which are shown to be equivalent to the classical definition of noninterference with respect to transitive policies. Rushby's unwinding conditions for intransitive noninterference are shown to be sound and complete for one of these definitions, TA-security. Access control systems compatible with a policy are shown to be TA-secure, and it is also shown that TA-security implies that the system can be interpreted as an access control system.", "paper_title": "What, indeed, is intransitive noninterference?", "paper_id": "WOS:000358511500003"}
