Ideally, the performance of an application running inside a virtual machine (VM) shall be independent of co-located applications and VMs that share the physical machine. However, adverse interference effects exist and are especially severe for data-intensive applications in such virtualized environments. In this work, we present TRACON, a novel Task and Resource Allocation CONtrol framework that mitigates the interference effects from concurrent data-intensive applications and greatly improves the overall system performance. TRACON utilizes modeling and control techniques from statistical machine learning and consists of three major components: the interference prediction model that infers application performance from resource consumption observed from different VMs, the interference-aware scheduler that is designed to utilize the model for effective resource management, and the task and resource monitor that collects application characteristics at the runtime for model adaption. We implement and validate TRACON with a variety of cloud applications. The evaluation results show that TRACON can achieve up to 25 percent improvement on application throughput on virtualized servers.", "paper_title": "TRACON: Interference-Aware Scheduling for Data-Intensive Applications in Virtualized Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000334673200024"}
