Based on the frame structure of hierarchical coding technology, the probability of each frame allocated to the most appropriate Access Category (AC) was dynamically updated according to its importance and traffic load of each AC. Simulation results showed the superior performance of the proposed AMM by comparing with three other existing mechanisms in terms of three objective metrics.", "paper_title": "IPB-frame Adaptive Mapping Mechanism for Video Transmission over IEEE 802.11e WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000334996900002"}
