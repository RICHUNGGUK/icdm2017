The method integrates color feature with multiscale nonlinear structure tensor texture (MSNST) feature and then uses GrabCut method to obtain the segmentations. The MSNST feature is used to describe the texture feature of an image and integrated into GrabCut framework to overcome the problem of the scale difference of textured images. In addition, we extend the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to MSNST feature and GMM based on MSNST is constructed to describe the energy function so that the texture feature can be suitably integrated into GrabCut framework and fused with the color feature to achieve the more superior image segmentation performance than the original GrabCut method. For easier implementation and more efficient computation, the symmetric KL divergence is chosen to produce the estimates of the tensor statistics instead of the Riemannian structure of the space of tensor. The Conjugate norm was employed using Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) technique as the distance measure in the color space for more discriminating power. An adaptive fusing strategy is presented to effectively adjust the mixing factor so that the color and MSNST texture features are efficiently integrated to achieve more robust segmentation performance. Last, an iteration convergence criterion is proposed to reduce the time of the iteration of GrabCut algorithm dramatically with satisfied segmentation accuracy. Experiments using synthesis texture images and real natural scene images demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Image Segmentation Based on GrabCut Framework Integrating Multiscale Nonlinear Structure Tensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000269715500012"}
