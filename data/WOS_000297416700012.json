Here we approach melody harmonization with piano accompaniment as a machine learning task in a probabilistic framework. A series of piano accompaniment figures are collected from the massive existing sample scores and converted into a set of meta-structure. After the procedure of samples training, a model is formulated to generate a proper piano accompaniment figure for a harmonizing unit in the context. This model is flexible in harmonizing a melody with piano accompaniment. The experimental results are evaluated and discussed.", "paper_title": "Harmonizing Melody with Meta-Structure of Piano Accompaniment Figure", "paper_id": "WOS:000297416700012"}
