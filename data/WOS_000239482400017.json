We present our approach to accomplish dynamic B2B integrations based on the WSMX SWS environment. We particularly show how WSMX can be made to support the RosettaNet e-business framework and how it can add dynamics to B2B interactions by automating mediation of heterogeneous messages. This is illustrated through a purchasing scenario. The benefits of applying SWS technologies include more flexibility in accepting heterogeneity in B2B integrations and easing back-end integrations. This allows for example to introduce more competition into the purchasing process within e-business frameworks.", "paper_title": "Semantic web services enabled B2B integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000239482400017"}
