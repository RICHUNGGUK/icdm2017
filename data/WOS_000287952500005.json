A novel method to segment pores in a wood microscopic image is proposed in this paper. The method has three steps. In the first step, structuring elements with several sizes are employed in a mathematical morphology algorithm to enhance the pores and remove other tissues in a wood microscopic image. Then the best structuring element size is determined according to the results obtained from the previous step. Finally, a binary image that includes only pores is obtained by an adaptive thresholding. Experimental results show the efficiency of the method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
