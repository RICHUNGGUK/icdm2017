In order to evaluate the quality of a document there has been a plethora of attempts, some of which have considered the use of semantic analysis for extracting conclusions upon documents around the web. In turn, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has been under development in order to cope with the changes of search engines and the web. SEO's aim has been the creation of effective strategies for optimal ranking of websites and webpages in search engines. Current work probes on semantic analysis of web content. We further elaborate on LDArank, a mechanism that employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for the semantic analysis of web content and the generation of optimal content for given queries. We apply the new proposed mechanism, LSHrank, and explore the effect of generating web content against various SEO factors. We demonstrate LSHrank robustness to produce semantically prominent content in comparison to different semantic analysis based SEO approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
