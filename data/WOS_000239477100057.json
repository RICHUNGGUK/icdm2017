In this paper, we propose an intelligent ChatBot system, based on instant messaging, for student on-line coaching in an English learning environment. The proposed ChatBot facilitates synchronous communication with students by using ready reference materials including, dictionaries, authorized conversation material with speaking, and a question-answering function. The agent records and analyzes conversations so that the teacher can assess students' progress. Our contribution in this paper is that we integrate the NLP Tool and AIML into an instant messaging-based ChatBot for English as a Second Language programs.", "paper_title": "Using instant messaging to provide an intelligent learning environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100057"}
