This paper empirically tests this assertion using Maslow's three higher order needs as the base. A survey delivered in the virtual world Second Life examines needs in real-life and the virtual world and personal characteristics. Using ANOVA the paper tests for differences in needs between the two environments and according to personal characteristics. The study finds that real-life needs significantly dominate virtual world needs. However, the pattern of needs in Second Life is different to real-life needs and emphasizes higher order needs, particularly self-actualization. This is particularly the case for the most innovative users of technology Needs in real-life are still the key motivator for consumers, but the results also demonstrate the notion of an 'altered reality' for some respondents.", "paper_title": "WHO NEEDS REAL-LIFE?
