The central idea of \"keeping healthy lifestyle\", that grounds the development of PHI systems, needs to be extended to the digital family group, where the middle generation (the \"parents\") manages the responsibility of taking care and improving the health of the weaker members (children and grandparents). The family environment is also a fundamental indicator of disease risk. We modelled, designed, and implemented a prototype for the health data management in a multigenerational family environment.
