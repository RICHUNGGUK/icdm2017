After presenting the theoretical BER performance formula of single carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) in the form of double integral, a closed-form approximate upper bound of BER performance was derived, as well as specific analytical expressions for approximate BER performance bounds under typical modulations. Analysis and simulation show that the derived approximate BER bound highly approaches the theoretical one. The bound also indicates that the research about the preferable equalization methods is still necessary.", "paper_title": "Bit Error Rate Performance Bounds of SC-FDE under Arbitrary Multipath Mobile Communication Channels in Transportation", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572000016"}
