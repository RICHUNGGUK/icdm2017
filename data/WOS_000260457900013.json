Furthermore, the most important mode in development of deep tissue injury (DTI) is compression. Therefore, an inverse numerical-experimental approach using a finite spherical indentation test is proposed. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach indentation tests are applied to bio-artificial muscle (BAM) tissue. BAMs are cultured in vitro with (n=20) or without (n=12) myoblast cells to quantify the effect of the cells on the passive transverse mechanical properties. Indentation tests are applied up to 80% of the tissue thickness. A non-linear Neo-Hookean constitutive model is fitted to the experimental results for parameter estimation. BAMs with cells demonstrated both stiffer and more non-linear material behaviour than BAMs without cells.", "paper_title": "The non-linear mechanical properties of soft engineered biological tissues determined by finite spherical indentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000260457900013"}
