A CPM/CAM device with no resistive CAM-type components is presented. In the CPM mode the electric motor functions conventionally, but in the CAM mode, intelligent use of the motor simulates resistive components by driving the motor to exert a force opposing the patient's muscle activity, so as to simulate the effect of a spring load. The system easily connects to the Internet or other data links for automatic monitoring of home patients, hospital networks, research stations, or telemedicine applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
