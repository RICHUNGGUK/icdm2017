Our team won both of these competitions, and in this paper we share our lessons learned and insights. We emphasize the aspects that pertain to the general practice and methodology of medical data mining, rather than to the specifics of each modeling competition. We concentrate on three topics: information leakage, its effect on competitions and proof-of-concept projects; consideration of real-life model performance measures in model construction and evaluation; and relational learning approaches to medical data mining tasks.", "paper_title": "Medical data mining: insights from winning two competitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000276276100006"}
