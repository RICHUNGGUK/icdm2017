Same for traditional power plants, VPP should provide electricity generation to power grid according to the command electricity generation coming from power grid control center. Different from traditional power plants, VPP controls geographically distributed DER agents, which aggregate various local DER, such as small-scale engines, turbines or storages. Moreover, the number of DER Agents in VPP probably changes in pace with DER Agents plug in and plug out. In this paper, a distributed optimization algorithm is projected to solve VPP bi-level optimal dispatch considering uncertain agents number. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively solve bi-level optimal dispatch with changing lower agents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
