The dual objectives are to effectively design multimedia data streams schema and to efficiently process continuous queries on sensor-based multimedia data streams. To further improve query processing, we introduce the concept of ontological filtering. A software tool to add multimedia functional dependencies to ontology is developed. Based upon multimedia functional dependency analysis and ontological filtering, query processing algorithms, illustrative examples and experimental results for sensor-based multimedia data streams continuous querying are presented to demonstrate the practical applications of our approach.", "paper_title": "PROCESSING CONTINUOUS QUERIES ON SENSOR-BASED MULTIMEDIA DATA STREAMS BY MULTIMEDIA DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS AND ONTOLOGICAL FILTERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000302023200005"}
