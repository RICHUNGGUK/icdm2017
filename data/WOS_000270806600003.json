This paper presents a number of system issues and design considerations for a ZigBee RF receiver, namely IEEE 802.15.4, for coexistence with wireless devices in the 2.4-GHz ISM-band. With regard to IEEE 802.15.4, the paper analyzes receiver performance requirements for; system noise figure (NF), system third-order intercept point (system-IIP3), local oscillator phase noise and selectivity. Based on some assumptions, the paper illustrates the relationship between minimum detectable signal (MDS) and various situations that involve the effects of electromagnetic interference generated by other wireless devices. We infer the necessity of much more stringent specification requirements than the published standard for various wireless communication field environments", "paper_title": "System Design Considerations for a ZigBee RF Receiver with regard to Coexistence with Wireless Devices in the 2.4GHz ISM-band", "paper_id": "WOS:000270806600003"}
