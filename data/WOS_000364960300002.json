We show that this allows a very efficient description of array manipulations and constructions. This is demonstrated by translating the technical polynomial construction of the almost perfect arrays given by Arasu and de Launey to a concise algebraic description.", "paper_title": "An algebra of arrays and almost perfect watermarks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364960300002"}
