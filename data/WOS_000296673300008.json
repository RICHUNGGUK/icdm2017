It is observed that BP threshold value, the maximal erasure probability of the channel for which decoding error probability converges to zero, of spatially-coupled codes, in particular spatially-coupled MacKay-Neal code, is close to the theoretical limit for the relay channel. Empirical results suggest that spatially-coupled protograph-based LDPC codes have great potential to achieve theoretical limit of a general relay channel.", "paper_title": "Spatially Coupled Protograph-Based LDPC Codes for Decode-and-Forward in Erasure Relay Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300008"}
