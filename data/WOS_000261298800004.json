The completeness of the axiomatization against the measure-heoretic semantics is carried out using a variant of the LindenbaumHenkin technique. The independence of the axioms is analysed, and the almost-everywhere quantifier is compared with related notions of generalized quantification. A suitable fragment of the logic is translated to FOL and validity is shown to be preserved.", "paper_title": "Complete Axiomatization of Discrete-Measure Almost-Everywhere Quantification", "paper_id": "WOS:000261298800004"}
