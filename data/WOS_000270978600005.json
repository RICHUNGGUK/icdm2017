The design problem is formulated as an additive, growth-like, evolutionary topology optimization problem. The initial design of the presented method is a casting part which is placed in a suitable environmental mould box. The method is composed of three stages: determining the feeder-neck connection point on the casting surface, constructing the feeder-neck and the feeder growth. During the growth stage, the feeder topology is changed gradually until satisfying some predefined criteria. The design of multiple feeders is also considered in this work. In the presented method, feeders are designed in a descending order of their sizes. The success of the proposed method is supported by an illustrative example.", "paper_title": "Feeder growth: a new method for automatic optimal feeder design in gravity casting processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000270978600005"}
