Such contention losses, usually do not mean a situation of congestion. In this paper, we propose for the first time, a loss recovery mechanism using Forward Error Correction (FEC) to recover bursts that are lost due to contention. Using FEC, for every K bursts, N-K redundant bursts are also sent to the destination. This redundancy can be used to recover from losses in the K data bursts. Our mechanism can also be used to recover from losses due to network component (link/node) failures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism by comparing with no protection and I + I protection using simulation studies. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
