It is characterized by the collaborative search in which each particle is attracted toward the global best position (gbest) in the swarm and its own best position (pbest). However, all of particles' historical promising pbests in PSO are lost except their current pbests. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel composite PSO algorithm, called historical memorybased PSO (HMPSO), which uses an estimation of distribution algorithm to estimate and preserve the distribution information of particles' historical promising pbests. Each particle has three candidate positions, which are generated from the historical memory, particles' current pbests, and the swarm's gbest. Then the best candidate position is adopted. Experiments on 28 CEC2013 benchmark functions demonstrate the superiority of HMPSO over other algorithms.", "paper_title": "Composite Particle Swarm Optimizer With Historical Memory for Function Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000361751900028"}
