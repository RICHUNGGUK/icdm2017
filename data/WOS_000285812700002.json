But a systematic mechanism that can be easily adopted to assess and interpret PSP effect is scarce within the existing literature. Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the possibility of devising a feasible assessment model that ties up critical software engineering values with the pertinent PSP metrics. Method: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to establish such an assessment model (we called a Plan-Track-Review model). Both mean and median approaches along with a set of simplified procedures were used to assess the commonly accepted PSP training effects. A set of statistical analyses further followed to increase understanding of the relationships among the PSP metrics and to help interpret the application results. Results: Based on the results of this study, PSP training effect on the controllability, manageability, and reliability of a software engineer is quite positive and largely consistent with the literature. However, its effect on one's predictability on project in general (and on project size in particular) is not implied as said in the literature. As for one's overall project efficiency, our results show a moderate improvement. Our initial finding also suggests that a prior stage PSP effect could have an impact on later stage training outcomes. Conclusion: It is concluded that this Plan-Track-Review model with the associated framework can be used to assess PSP effect regarding a disciplined software development. The generated summary report serves to provide useful feedback for both PSP instructors and students based on internal as well as external standards. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
