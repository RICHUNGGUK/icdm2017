As for the curves with efficient endomorphisms, Hasan suggested several countermeasures on anomalous binary curves, and Ciet, Quisquater and Sica proposed a countermeasure on CLV curves. Ciet et al.'s method is based on random decomposition of a scalar, and it is a two-dimensional generalization of Coron's method, Hasan's and Ciet et al.'s countermeasures are applied only to a small class of elliptic curves. In this paper, we enlarge the class of DPA-resistant curves by proposing a DPA countermeasure applicable to any curve where the M-obenius expansion method can be used. Our analysis shows that our countermeasure can produce a probability of collision around O(2 -20) with only 15.4-34.0% extra computation for scalar multiplications on various practical settings.", "paper_title": "A DPA countermeasure by randomized Frobenius decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000236882500021"}
