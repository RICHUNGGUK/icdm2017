We address it with an algorithm based on the optimistic paradigm and on the Good-Turing missing mass estimator. We prove two different regret bounds on the performance of this algorithm under weak assumptions on the probabilistic experts. Under more restrictive hypotheses, we also prove a macroscopic optimality result, comparing the algorithm both with an oracle strategy and with uniform sampling. Finally, we provide numerical experiments illustrating these theoretical findings.", "paper_title": "Optimal Discovery with Probabilistic Expert Advice: Finite Time Analysis and Macroscopic Optimality", "paper_id": "WOS:000315981900009"}
