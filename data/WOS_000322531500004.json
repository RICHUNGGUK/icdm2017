The most popular technique is the Collaborative Filtering (CF) based on a user-item matrix. However, it cannot well capture the relationship between Web services and providers. To address this issue, we first design a cube model to explicitly describe the relationship among providers, consumers and Web services. And then, we present a Standard Deviation based Hybrid Collaborative Filtering (SD-HCF) for Web Service Recommendation (WSRec) and an Inverse consumer Frequency based User Collaborative Filtering (IF-UCF) for Potential Consumers Recommendation (PCRec). Finally, the decision-making process of bidirectional recommendation is provided for both providers and consumers. Sets of experiments are conducted on real-world data provided by Planet-Lab. In the experiment phase, we show how the parameters of SD-HCF impact on the prediction quality as well as demonstrate that the SD-HCF is much better than extant methods on recommendation quality, including the CF based on user, the CF based on item and general HCF. Experimental comparison between IF-UCF and UCF indicates the effectiveness of adding inverse consumer frequency to UCF.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Collaborative Filtering algorithm for bidirectional Web service recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000322531500004"}
