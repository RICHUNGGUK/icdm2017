The proposed joint coded-FSK detection scheme with low complexity advantage can outperform the conventional separated coded-FSK detection scheme. It is due to the joint scheme with time diversity gain to enhance the detection performance. Moreover, the proposed joint algorithms with floating-point and fixed-point designs are realized in the software-defined-ratio (SDR) platform. Based on the measurement results via SDR equipments, it is confirmed that the implementation of VHDL hardware circuit design of the proposed joint detection scheme can provide robust performance over high mobility Rician multipath fading channel environment.", "paper_title": "Top Down Implementation of Joint MODEM and CODEC Transceiver Design for DSRC Coded-FSK Systems Over High Mobility Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000350369600005"}
