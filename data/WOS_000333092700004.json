In this paper, we study the data retrieval scheduling problem for multi-item requests in multi-channel broadcast environments. To maximize the number of downloads given a deadline, we define a problem called largest number data retrieval (LNDR). We prove the decision problem of LNDR is NP-hard, and we investigate approximation algorithm for it. We also define another problem called minimum cost data retrieval (MCDR), which aims at downloading a set of requested data items with the least response time and energy consumption. We prove MCDR is NP-hard to approximate to within any non-trivial factor. Therefore, we investigate heuristic algorithm for it. Finally we provide simulation results to demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Data Retrieval Scheduling for Multi-Item Requests in Multi-Channel Wireless Broadcast Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000333092700004"}
