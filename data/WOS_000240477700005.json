Three publishing models compete for the market. Professional publishing houses publish in print and/or online in a \"reader-pays\" model, or follow the open access model of \"author-pays\", while a number of periodicals are bound to learned societies. The present study aims to compare the three business models of publishing, with regards to publication speed. 28 topically similar biomedical journals were compared. Open access journals have a publication lag comparable to journals published by traditional publishers. Manuscript submitted to and accepted in either of these two types of periodicals are available to the reader much faster than manuscripts published in journals with strong ties to specialized learned societies.", "paper_title": "Publication lag in biomedical journals varies due to the periodical's publishing model", "paper_id": "WOS:000240477700005"}
