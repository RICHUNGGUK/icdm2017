Recently, mobile field has drawn much attention and it is used for most means of living for users like purchase of commodity, payment, and user certification. The mobile economy also grows by this trend, but hacking accidents or financial crimes are also in full swing. It is expected that the service for mobile in the future will increase more than ever, but in security aspects we still use problematic certification and security system. Data control service in the future is expected to do a lot with the service, which basically stores all services in phones as well as service providers through cloud service. Data control service will lead to the expansion of IoT (Internet of Things) service, as it substitutes existing off-line backup and safely provide user data regardless of location or kinds of devices. That is, users can use data from the devices connected to the Internet without copying or moving to devices users want to use. To use this data safely, establishing a certification system of users will be an ever more important factor. Therefore, this treatise is going to suggest the plan that we can conduct the certification in a safer way among several threats. In particular, mobile hacking is a very serious and important issue, as it could directly lead to monetary loss. When certification is insufficient, the possibility of a third party reaping benefits through hacking is greater. This treatise is going to suggest a model that service providers can provide safe certification service by performing verification of transaction and data through electronic certification. Building of a combined and safe certification system upon recent FinTech boom is a very important factor and this study is going to suggest various structures in aspects of security and convenience.", "paper_title": "A Study on Service Architecture for Secure Authentication System", "paper_id": "WOS:000369380900002"}
