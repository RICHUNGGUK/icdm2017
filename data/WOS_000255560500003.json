In fact Martin-Lof came rather close to the formulation of this criterion around 1970 (see [41 and [7], p. 98); a version of it that involves both plain and prefix complexity(1) was proven by Gacs in 1980 ([2], remark after corollary 5.4 on p. 391). We provide a simple proof of this criterion that uses only elementary arguments very close to the original proof of Levin-Schnorr criterion of randomness (1973) in terms of monotone complexity ([3, 6]).", "paper_title": "A simple proof of Miller-Yu theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000255560500003"}
