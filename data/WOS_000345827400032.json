Our primary motivation for developing this system is to aid researchers and clinician-scientists in determining the clinical significance of genetic variations. To achieve this goal, Cordova provides an interface to review and manually or computationally curate genetic variation data as well as share it for clinical diagnostics and the advancement of research.", "paper_title": "Cordova: Web-based management of genetic variation data", "paper_id": "WOS:000345827400032"}
