Lines and spheres in space are all projected into conics in the central catadioptric image planes, and such conics are called line images and sphere images, respectively. We discovered that there exists an imaginary conic in the central catadioptric image planes, defined as the modified image of the absolute conic (MIAC), and by utilizing the MIAC, the novel identical projective geometric properties of line images and sphere images may be exploited: Each line image or each sphere image is double-contact with the MIAC, which is an analogy of the discovery in pinhole camera that the image of the absolute conic (IAC) is double-contact with sphere images. Note that the IAC also exists in the central catadioptric image plane, but it does not have the double-contact properties with line images or sphere images. This is the main reason to propose the MIAC. From these geometric properties with the MIAC, two linear calibration methods for central catadioptric cameras using sphere images as well as using line images are proposed in the same framework. Note that there are many linear approaches to central catadioptric camera calibration using line images. It seems that to use the properties that line images are tangent to the MIAC only leads to an alternative geometric construction for calibration. However, for sphere images, there are only some nonlinear calibration methods in literature. Therefore, to propose linear methods for sphere images may be the main contribution of this paper. Our new algorithms have been tested in extensive experiments with respect to noise sensitivity.", "paper_title": "Identical projective geometric properties of central catadioptric line images and sphere images with applications to calibration", "paper_id": "WOS:000253755300006"}
