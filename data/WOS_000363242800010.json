However, actively learning the system conflicts directly with any given control objective for it will disturb the system during exploration. This paper presents a receding horizon approach to dual control, where a multiobjective optimization problem is solved repeatedly and subject to constraints representing system dynamics. Balancing a standard finite-horizon control objective, a knowledge gain objective is defined to explicitly quantify the information acquired when learning the system dynamics. Measures from information theory, such as entropy-based uncertainty, Fisher information, and relative entropy, are studied and used to quantify the knowledge gained as a result of the control actions. The resulting iterative framework is applied to Markov decision processes and discrete-time nonlinear systems. Thus, the broad applicability and usefulness of the presented approach is demonstrated in diverse problem settings. The framework is illustrated with multiple numerical examples.", "paper_title": "An Information-Based Learning Approach to Dual Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000363242800010"}
