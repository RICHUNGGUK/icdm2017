On this basis, an individual interaction model based on individual credibility is proposed in this paper. After conducting a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that large individual credibility favors the enhancement of extremism, and advances the appearance of large clusters. This work explains the formation conditions of an extreme individual, and indicates that the formation of an extreme individual is related to its own credibility. The conclusion of this paper contributes toward a greater understanding of information dissemination and opinion evolution in online social networks.", "paper_title": "Opinion Interaction Model of the Bounded Rationality Individual with Credibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000359612800008"}
