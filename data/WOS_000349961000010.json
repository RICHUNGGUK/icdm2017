We present a residual-type a posteriori error analysis with respect to a curl-conforming edge element approximation of the optimal control problem. Here, the lowest order edge elements of N,d,lec's first family are used for the discretization of the state and the control with respect to an adaptively generated family of simplicial triangulations of the computational domain. In particular, the a posteriori error estimator consists of element and face residuals associated with the state equation and the adjoint state equation. The main results are the reliability of the estimator and its efficiency up to oscillations in terms of the data of the problem. In the last part of the paper, numerical results are included which illustrate the performance of the adaptive approach.", "paper_title": "Adaptive edge element approximation of H(curl)-elliptic optimal control problems with control constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000349961000010"}
