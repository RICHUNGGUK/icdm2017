The deficient-DOF space of PUMA 560, made up with the singularity and joint limitation, affects the maneuverability and stability of the master-slave manipulation system. In this work, the deficient-DOF space in the mapped workspace with master slave control is investigated as a main factor of the workspace mapping. Meanwhile, the orthogonal experiment design method is introduced and two rounds of orthogonal experiments are carried out for this mapping problem, which is simultaneously characterized by many other variables At last the simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the scheme of the mapping is feasible and the orthogonal experiment design method is effective. It is a novel application and exploration of the orthogonal experiment design method in the mechanical or robot optimal design. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
