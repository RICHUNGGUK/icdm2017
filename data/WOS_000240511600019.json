This result is obtained thanks to a hardware-friendly kernel, which greatly simplifies the SVM feed-forward phase computation and, at the same time, maintains good classification performance respect to the conventional Gaussian kernel.", "paper_title": "Feed-forward support vector machine without multipliers", "paper_id": "WOS:000240511600019"}
