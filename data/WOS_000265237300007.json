Both methods allow us to study the thermodynamic behavior of water at temperatures, where other numerical approaches - both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics - are seriously hampered by the large increase of the correlation times. The cluster algorithm also allows us to emphasize that the liquid-liquid phase transition corresponds to the percolation transition of tetrahedrally ordered water molecules.
