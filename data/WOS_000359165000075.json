The fusing mechanism is so crucial that can significantly affect the performance of 3D model classification. In this paper, a powerful model for 3D model classification, which can novelly integrate several graphs, is proposed. This mechanism is based on graph fusion and modifies each graph's weight in a boost manner. Each graph's weight in the fusion graph can be dynamically calculated according to its performance. Finally, a fusion graph is acquired to 3D model classification. We conduct the experiments on the publicly available 3D model databases: Princeton shape benchmark (PSB) and SHREC'09, and the experimental results demonstrate the powerful performance of the proposed method.
