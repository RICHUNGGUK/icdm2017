The proposed method is performed in two steps. First, images with a staircasing effect are generated by a bilateral filter. Second, moire patterns are generated with an improved bilateral filter called an anti-bilateral filter. The characteristic of the anti-bilateral filter is to emphasize gradual boundaries.", "paper_title": "Generation of Moire-Picture-Like Color Images by Bilateral Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000323236700030"}
