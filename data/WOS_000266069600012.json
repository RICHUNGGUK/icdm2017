A fast nonasymptotic algebraic identification method developed in continuous time is used to identify the unknown system parameter and update the designed certainty equivalence GPI controller. In order to verify this method, several informative simulations and experiments are shown.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Controller for Single-Link Flexible Manipulators Based on Algebraic Identification and Generalized Proportional Integral Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000266069600012"}
