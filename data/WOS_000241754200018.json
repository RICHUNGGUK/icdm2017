Contextual ontologies are now crucial for users who intend to exchange information in a domain. Existing ontology languages are not capable of defining such type of ontologies. The objective of this paper is to formally define a contextual ontology language to support the development of contextual ontologies. In this paper, we use description logics as an ontology language and then we extend it by introducing a new contextual constructor.", "paper_title": "Contextual ontologies - Motivations, challenges, and solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241754200018"}
