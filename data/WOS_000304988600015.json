We then derive a strategy for saving energy based on locking more energy-consuming kernel routines of mu C/OS-II into the cache and reassigning cache locations to reduce cache contention between frequently invoked kernel functions. The proposed method saves about 37 percent of the energy otherwise consumed by the mu C/OS-II kernel, leading to reductions of up to 5.9 percent in the total energy consumption, which includes the energy consumed by the application.
