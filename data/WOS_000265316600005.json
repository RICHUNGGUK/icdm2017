To extend the network lifetime, power management and energy-efficient communication techniques at all layers become necessary. In this paper, we present solutions for the data gathering and routing problem with in-network aggregation in WSNs. Our objective is to maximize the network lifetime by utilizing data aggregation and in-network processing techniques. We particularly focus on the joint problem of optimal data routing with data aggregation en route such that the above mentioned objective is achieved. We present Grid-based Routing and Aggregator Selection Scheme (GRASS), a scheme for WSNs that can achieve low energy dissipation and low latency without sacrificing quality. GRASS embodies optimal (exact) as well as heuristic approaches to find the minimum number of aggregation points while routing data to the Base-Station (BS) such that the network lifetime is maximized. Our results show that, when compared to other schemes, GRASS improves system lifetime with acceptable levels of latency in data aggregation and without sacrificing data quality.
