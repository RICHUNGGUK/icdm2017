The resulting time dependent nonlinear coupled set of governing equations for film thickness and pressure is solved on different parallel computing platforms using a purpose written portable and scalable parallel multigrid algorithm in order to achieve the fine-scale resolution required to guarantee mesh independent solutions. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated via the solution of three problems: one to establish the convergence characteristics viz, the partitioning and message passing strategies adopted, taking flow over a well-defined trench topography as a benchmark against existing experimental and corresponding numerical predictions; two, flow through a sparsely distributed set of occlusions with computations performed on different parallel architectures; three, free-surface planarisation with respect to flow over complex topography - the first an engineered functional substrate, the second a naturally occurring surface.
