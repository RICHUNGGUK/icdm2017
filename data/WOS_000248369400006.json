Design/methodology/approach - The metallic nanoparticle is modeled as a dielectric body dispersive in frequency with assigned dielectric constant. The electric field is expressed as function of the charge distribution through an integral formulation. By imposing the boundary conditions on the nanoparticle surface, the equations for the induced charge in the nanoparticle is obtained. The numerical solution of such equations allows to treat arbitrary geometries and to estimate the effects of deviations from ideality on the resonance values. Findings - Plasmon resonances in metallic nanoparticles can be safely studied with an electro-quasistatic approximation. The resonance frequencies depend greatly on the details of the geometry of the nanoparticles. Research limitations/implications - The free-space wavelength is supposed to be much greater than the largest characteristic dimension of the nanoparticles. Consequently, a electro-quasistatic model is used to evaluate the distribution of the charges induced in the metallic nanoparticle. Originality/value - Two methods are presented for the evaluation of the resonance frequencies starting from the numerical solution for a given geometry.", "paper_title": "Analysis of plasmon oscillations in metallic nanoparticles", "paper_id": "WOS:000248369400006"}
