This article investigates the improvement of the recognition rate of emotions using visuo-haptic feedback compared to facial and haptic expressions alone. Four experiments were conducted in which the recognition rates of emotions using facial, haptic and visuo-haptic expressions were tested. The first experiment evaluates the recognition rate of emotions using facial expressions. The second experiment collects a large corpus of 3D haptic expressions of certain emotions and subsequently identifies the relevant haptic expression for each emotion. The third experiment evaluates the selected haptic expressions through statistical and perceptive tests to retain the ones that result in the most accurate identification of the corresponding emotion. Finally, the fourth experiment studies the effect of visuo-haptic coupling on the recognition of the investigated emotions. Generally, emotions with high amplitudes of pleasure are better recognized in the visual modality. However, emotions with high activation are better recognized in the haptic modality. These results also highlighted the finding that participants are not equally aided by each modality when recognizing emotions efficiently. Beyond the recognition rate, multimodal expressions improved the sensation of presence and expressivity.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Combining Kinesthetic and Facial Expression Displays on Emotion Recognition by Users", "paper_id": "WOS:000342443300007"}
