As PHY data rates increase, however, the over head of media access control (MAC) progressively degrades data throughput efficiency. This trend reflects a fundamental aspect of the current MAC protocol, which allocates the channel as a single resource at a time. This paper argues that, in a high data rate WLAN, the channel should be divided into separate subchannels whose width is commensurate with PHY data rate and typical frame size. Multiple stations can then contend for and use subchannels simultaneously according to their traffic demands, there by increasing over all efficiency. We introduce FICA, a fine-grained channel access method that embodies this approach to media access using two novel techniques. First, it proposes a new PHY architecture based on OFDM that retains orthogonality among subchannels while relying solely on the coordination mechanisms in existing WLAN, carrier-sensing and broadcasting. Second, FICA employs a frequency-domain contention method that uses physical layer RTS/CTS signaling and frequency domain back off to efficiently coordinate subchannel access. We have implemented FICA, both MAC and PHY layers, using a software radio platform, and our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the FICA design. Further, our simulation results suggest FICA can improve the efficiency ratio of WLANs by upto 400% compared to existing 802.11.", "paper_title": "Fine-grained Channel Access in Wireless LAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000284879800014"}
