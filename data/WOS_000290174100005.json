The implemented QoS adaptation method allows dynamic updates of session parameters, maximizing the QoE and turning the solution suitable for live multimedia streaming, independently of the cast mode (unicast or multicast). The new SIP signaling structure, for session and media control, was developed following an All-SIP approach and a hybrid SIP+RTSP approach, both suited for an IMS environment, in order to compare the system behavior and performance using either approach. The details of both the IPTV Application Server and the IPTV Client prototypical implementations are described, as well as the results of field tests carried out across different Fixed and Mobile access networks for each of the signaling structures. The proposed IPTV architecture revealed to be suitable for scalable converged networks, due to its flexible multimedia delivery of personalized streams over a variety of network infrastructures, namely, Mobile radio networks.", "paper_title": "IPTV architecture for an IMS environment with dynamic QoS adaptation", "paper_id": "WOS:000290174100005"}
