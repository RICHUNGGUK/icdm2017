The paper discusses the model, addresses challenges of portable implementations, and demonstrates that ARMCI delivers high performance on a variety of platforms. Special emphasis is placed on the latency hiding mechanisms and ability to optimize noncontiguous data transfers.", "paper_title": "High performance remote memory access communication: The ARMCI approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000238259800004"}
