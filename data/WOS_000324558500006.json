KelpFusion is a hybrid representation that bridges hull techniques such as Bubble Sets and Euler diagrams and line-and graph-based techniques such as LineSets and Kelp Diagrams. We describe an algorithm based on shortest-path graphs to compute KelpFusion visualizations. Based on a single parameter, the shortest-path graph varies from the minimal spanning tree to the convex hull of a point set. Shortest-path graphs aim to capture the shape of a point set and smoothly adapt to sets of varying densities. KelpFusion fills enclosed faces based on a set of simple legibility rules. We present the results of a controlled experiment comparing KelpFusion to Bubble Sets and LineSets. We conclude that KelpFusion outperforms Bubble Sets both in accuracy and completion time and outperforms LineSets in completion time.", "paper_title": "KelpFusion: A Hybrid Set Visualization Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000324558500006"}
