ISMC is chosen to stabilize the T-S fuzzy system because of its superior capability in treating uncertainties. Individual integral sliding surfaces are designed in different operating regions of the T-S fuzzy system. Conditions on the existence of the sliding mode in the associated region are given. The chattering phenomenon around region boundaries is analyzed, and the prevention of such chattering is discussed. An illustrative example is finally given to show the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Piecewise Integral Sliding-Mode Control for T-S Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000286932000006"}
