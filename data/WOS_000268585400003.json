In particular, we focus on different classes of planar graphs, of which grid graphs are an important special case. Our main results are: Reachability in graphs of genus one is logspace-equivalent to reachability in grid graphs (and in particular it is logspace-equivalent to both reachability and non-reachability in planar graphs). Many of the natural restrictions on grid-graph reachability (GGR) are equivalent under AC(0) reductions (for instance, undirected GGR, outdegree-one GGR, and indegree-one-outdegree-one GGR are all equivalent). These problems are all equivalent to the problem of determining whether a completed game position in HEX is a winning position, as well as to the problem of reachability in mazes studied by Blum and Kozen (IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), pp. 132-142, 1978). These problems provide natural examples of problems that are hard for NC1 under AC(0) reductions but are not known to be hard for L; they thus give insight into the structure of L. Reachability in layered planar graphs is logspace-equivalent to layered grid graph reachability (LGGR). We show that LGGR lies in UL (a subclass of NL). Series-Parallel digraphs (on which reachability was shown to be decidable in logspace by Jakoby et al.) are a special case of single-source-single-sink planar directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); reachability for such graphs logspace reduces to single-source-single-sink acyclic grid graphs. We show that reachability on such grid graphs AC(0) reduces to undirected GGR. We build on this to show that reachability for single-source multiple-sink planar DAGs is solvable in L.", "paper_title": "Planar and Grid Graph Reachability Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000268585400003"}
