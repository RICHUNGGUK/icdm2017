The current methods to help visually impaired persons to read the natural scene text, menus and book covers have three problems. First, they assumed that the blind persons are standing still and the captured scene is not moving. Second, the blind persons do not know that the menu or the book cover is captured by the camera. Third, these methods cannot \"see\" business cards to help the blind persons. The proposed method includes moving detection, thumb detection motion blur detection and text detection methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the time complexity. The reduced rates for training and testing sets are 83.18% and 77.08%, respectively. The text detection rates for training and testing sets are 93.44% and 94.58%, respectively. The fps is 53 for 320 x 240 video frames. The program size is 102KB and can be run on mobile devices.", "paper_title": "TEXT DETECTION IN MOVING BUSINESS CARDS FOR HELPING VISUALLY IMPAIRED PERSONS USING A WEARABLE CAMERA", "paper_id": "WOS:000328117000010"}
