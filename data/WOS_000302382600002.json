After the entry of the cylinder into water, the hydrophobic surface of the cylinder forms an air cavity behind it, whereas the hydrophilic surface is perfectly wetted. As a result, the resulting cavities are found to independently grow and break off from the cylinder even for the Type (c).", "paper_title": "Water entry of stripe-coated hydrophobic circular cylinders", "paper_id": "WOS:000302382600002"}
