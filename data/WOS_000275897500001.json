Simulated and real (standard real mixture and limon oil) GC-MS data were used to evaluate the feasibility of this method. The MCR-FMIN solutions have been obtained based on the rotation of principal component analysis (PCA) solutions using the non-linear optimization algorithms. Calculation of the initial values of R rotation matrix using model free analysis methods such as fixed-size moving window-evolving factor analysis (FSMW-EFA), evolving latent projective graphs (ELPGs), and heuristic evolving latent projection (HELP) was proposed for faster convergence and avoiding to be stuck in local minima in MCR-FMIN algorithm. The band boundaries of feasible solutions (MCR-BANDS) obtained using MCR-FMIN were calculated for simulated data to assess the reliability of the method. In addition, the results of this method were compared with those of two most common self-modeling curve resolution (SMCR) methods of multivariate curve resolution-alternating least square (MCR-ALS) and HELP. A reasonable result can be obtained by selecting proper constraints, such as non-negativity. unimodality, normalization, and selectivity. However, when the number of components or the level of noise in each peak cluster increase, the convergence of algorithm becomes difficult and the results are not reliable. For quick and accurate analysis of co-eluted multi-component problematic GC-MS data MCR-FMIN can be considered as an alternative method to the MCR-ALS and HELP methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier FIN.
