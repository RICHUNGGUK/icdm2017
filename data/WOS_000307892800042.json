Even though this construction's original analyses show that it is secure against some attacks, the absence of formal security proofs in a strong security model still brings uncertainty on its robustness. In this paper, aiming to give a better understanding of the security level provided by different authentication algorithms based on this design strategy, we formally analyze two ALRED variants-the MARVIN message authentication code and the LETTERSOUP authenticated-encryption scheme,-bounding their security as a function of the attacker's resources and of the underlying cipher's characteristics.", "paper_title": "Revisiting the Security of the ALRED Design and Two of Its Variants: Marvin and LetterSoup", "paper_id": "WOS:000307892800042"}
