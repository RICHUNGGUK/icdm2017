The growth of services in Electronic Mediated Environment (EME) has changed the manner in which firms and consumers interact. Drawing on such theoretical foundations as trust, risk perceptions, trying, emotion, and satisfaction, this study proposes an integrative research model to investigate the relationships among these constructs in the EME context. We collected data from 415 consumers and found that consumer innovativeness and emotion are significant antecedents of trust, risk perception of service, perceived benefits, and service quality. These important factors will influence consumer satisfaction in EME. This empirical investigation breaks a new ground for future studies to understand and gauge the influence of innovativeness and emotion in emerging IT artifacts such as EME services.
