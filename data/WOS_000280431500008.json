Different modelling tools can be used to carry out simulations that will lead to saving costs in the development of fusion devices. The use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to look for approximate configurations offers a great approach for optimization processes, and avoids the use of brute force algorithms. However, since these applications require a high computational cost to perform their operations, the use of the grid arises as an ideal environment to carry out these tests. The distributed paradigm of the grid, as well as the number of computational resources, represents an excellent alternative to execute these tools. In this work we join these three ideas and present promising results.
