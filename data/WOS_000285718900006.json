Unlike the case of functions on the discrete cube, where there is a clear definition of influence, in the general case several definitions have been presented in different papers. We propose a family of definitions for the influence that contains all the known definitions, as well as other natural definitions, as special cases. We show that the proofs of the BKKKL theorem and of other results can be adapted to our new definition. The adaptation leads to generalizations of these theorems, which are tight in terms of the definition of influence used in the assertion.", "paper_title": "On the Influences of Variables on Boolean Functions in Product Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000285718900006"}
