The objective of this work is to introduce a support didactic material for use in computational classes of Chemical Reaction Engineering. The development of the work is based on a direct implementation of examples of the well-known Fogler's textbook \"Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering\" in an equation-based dynamic simulator: EMSO. The problems were implemented in a way to preserve the structure of the problem as described in the textbook. The results are illustrated by graph plots generated in the simulator, allowing comparisons with the results presented in the textbook and detailed analyses for effects of variables in the problem. The problems are easily modified, allowing the student to analyze several possibilities, changing equations and values of variables, for example, and observing the results.
