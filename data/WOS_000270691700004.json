We array the d-dimensional spins in the d-1-dimensional hypercubic lattice points, and apply the magnetic anisotropy in the dth direction. Even though the long-range dipolar interaction is truncated to the nearest-neighbor interaction, the model exhibits the reorientation transition. The effects of the exchange interaction on the dipolar system are also studied.", "paper_title": "A MEAN-FIELD APPROACH TO A DISCRETE DIPOLAR SPIN MODEL WITH UNIAXIAL MAGNETIC ANISOTROPY", "paper_id": "WOS:000270691700004"}
