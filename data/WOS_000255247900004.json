Based on the theory of Hopf bifurcation in delay system, we obtain a simple relationship between the parameters when the system has a periodic solution. Numerical simulations show that the assumption is a rational condition, choosing parameter in the determined region can control hyperchaotic Lu system well, the chaotic state is transformed to the periodic orbit. Finally, we consider the differences between the analysis of the hyperchaotic Lorenz system, hyperchaotic Chen system and hyperchaotic Lu system.", "paper_title": "Hopf bifurcation analysis of some hyperchaotic systems with time-delay controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000255247900004"}
