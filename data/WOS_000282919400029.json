The objective, however, has been mainly the induction of displacement In this paper, a TMD with passive elements is synthesized for optimal acceleration and/or jerk reduction. In order to use conventional feedback control; passive elements of the TMD are presumed active. replacing velocity/displacement feedback components Using H-2 norm and output feedback control, we obtain feedback yams for the system and then use them as the coefficients of passive elements It is thereby shown that we can. reduce jerk and/or acceleration excessively compared to the design based on displacement reduction Also, using these elements parallel with force actuator in a combined passive-active system: results in further reduction of the required power. The overall performance of three types of passive, active and passive-active systems are finally compared", "paper_title": "A TMD DESIGN APPROACH FOR REDUCTION OF ACCELERATION AND JERK USING H-2 SYNTHESIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400029"}
