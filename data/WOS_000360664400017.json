The double-sampling fully-balanced SI bilinear integrator and current mirror are employed as the building cells. By sharing the implementation circuit for approximation poles of the real and the imaginary part, the proposed structure only has the same circuit complexity as that of real-valued wavelet filter, which is very suitable for small-size and low-power application. The complex Morlet wavelet is selected as an example to elaborate the design procedure. Simulation results confirm that the presented complex wavelet filter structure can generate the real and imaginary coefficients of complex wavelet transform accurately with simple synthesis method and explicit design formulas.", "paper_title": "Structure and realization of pole-shared switched-current complex wavelet filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000360664400017"}
