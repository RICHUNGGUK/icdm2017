Embedded logic analysis, which employs on-chip storage units to acquire data in real time from the internal signals of the circuit-under-debug, has emerged as a powerful technique for improving observability during in-system debug. However, as the amount of data that can be acquired is limited by the on-chip storage capacity, the decision on which signals to sample is essential when it is not known a priori where the bugs will occur. In this paper, we present accelerated algorithms for restoring circuit state elements from the traces collected during a debug session, by exploiting bitwise parallelism. We also introduce new metrics that guide the automated selection of trace signals, which can enhance the real-time observability during in-system debug.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for State Restoration and Trace-Signal Selection for Data Acquisition in Silicon Debug", "paper_id": "WOS:000262816900010"}
