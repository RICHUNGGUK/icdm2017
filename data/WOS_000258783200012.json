Further more, we present a model for the evolution of complex networks, in which the system dynamics motivated by four mechanisms: the addition of new nodes with preferential attachment, the addition of new nodes with intrinsic attachment, the addition of newlinks with preferential attachment and the addition of new intrinsic links. The model yields scale-free behavior for the degree distributions as confirmed in many real networks. With continumm theory, we get the analytical expressions of the degree distribution and the scaling exponent gamma. The analytical expressions are in good agreement with the numerical simulation results.", "paper_title": "Evolving model of scale-free networks with intrinsic links", "paper_id": "WOS:000258783200012"}
