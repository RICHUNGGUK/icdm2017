In this work, we propose a rather unexplored framework in which the message is encoded in measurement settings rather than in their outcomes. In particular, we study two different variants of such secure communication protocols in which the message alphabet corresponds to measurement settings of mutually unbiased bases.", "paper_title": "Encoding secret information in measurement settings", "paper_id": "WOS:000338135100008"}
