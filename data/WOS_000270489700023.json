It shows that compared with thicker (300 nm) a-GaN film, better FE performance is obtained on ultrathin (5 nm) a-GaN film with a threshold field of 0.78 V/A mu m, which is the lowest value ever reported. Furthermore, the current density reaches 42 mA/cm(2) when the applied field is 3.72 V/A mu m. These experimental results unambiguously confirm Binh's theoretical analysis (Binh et al. Phys Rev Lett, 2000, 85(4): 864-867) that the FE performance would be prominently enhanced with the coating of an ultra-thin wide band-gap semiconductor film.", "paper_title": "Field emission properties of amorphous GaN ultrathin films fabricated by pulsed laser deposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000270489700023"}
