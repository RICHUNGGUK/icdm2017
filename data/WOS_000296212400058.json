It is assumed that the considered impulsive neural networks have norm-bounded parametric uncertainties and time-varying delays and the state variables on the impulses may relate to the time-varying delays. By using Lyapunov functions together with Razumikhin technique or with differential inequalities, some new robust exponential stability criteria are provided. Some examples and their simulations, including examples that the stability of which can not be tackled by the existing results, are also presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the advantage of the obtained results.
