The result is applied to the exponential kernel and Student's kernel. To establish these results we develop a general theory regarding mixtures of kernels. We analyze the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of the mixture in terms of the RKHS's of the mixture components and prove a type of Jensen inequality between the approximation error function for the mixture and the approximation error functions of the mixture components.
