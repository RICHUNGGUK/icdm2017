It is designed in a 65 nm CMOS SOI process, which improves passive devices behavior. The proposed VCO achieves a frequency tuning range (FTR) of 9.7 % and a phase noise of -110.86 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz of the carrier. All integrated passive components (including transmission lines and a transformer-based balun) are modeled using advanced electromagnetic (EM) field solvers. The power consumption of the proposed VCO is as low as 1.1 mW when biased by a 0.8-V supply voltage. The FoM of this millimeter wave circuit, whose core occupies a silicon footprint of only 0.047 mm(2), is -184.07 dBc/Hz.", "paper_title": "An ultra low power consumption millimeter-wave voltage controlled oscillator in a 65 nm CMOS-SOI technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000323652500002"}
