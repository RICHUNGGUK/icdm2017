Based on the assumption of k+1 square roots, the scheme is proven, without random oracles, to be secure against the existential forgery under an adaptive chosen-message attack. It is also proven that its IND-CPA security also implies its IND-CCA2 security. A comparison is made with existing schemes from the viewpoint of computational cost and the size of ciphertexts.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT ONLINE/OFFLINE SIGNCRYPTION SCHEME", "paper_id": "WOS:000281749900008"}
