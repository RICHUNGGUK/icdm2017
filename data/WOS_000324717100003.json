This is done by taking the integral of a scoring function multiplied by a distribution function. Examples are provided by considering several distribution functions and two scoring functions, where the distribution function can take any form and the scoring function is non-decreasing.", "paper_title": "Modelling Continuous Percentile Rank Scores and Integrated Impact Indicators (I3)", "paper_id": "WOS:000324717100003"}
