Such new approach allows to preserve the precision and efficiency of the combination of linguistic information in the case of either equidistant or unbalanced label model. Some basic operators on imprecise 2-tuple labels are presented together with their extensions for imprecise 2-tuple labels. We also give simple examples to show how precise and imprecise qualitative information can be combined for reasoning under uncertainty. It is concluded that DSmT can deal efficiently with both precise and imprecise quantitative and qualitative beliefs, which extends the scope of this theory.", "paper_title": "Fusion of imprecise qualitative information", "paper_id": "WOS:000283087200008"}
