Such an approach applies Coloured Petri Net modeling language (CPN) for supporting simulation and analysis. The proposed approach offers three basic contributions for embedded system analysis field:(i)code modeling, a probabilistic model for scenarios exploration being presented, (ii) formalism, a formal and widespread modeling language (CPN) being applied, with previously validated engines and algorithms for simulation;(iii) flexibility, the proposed approach enabling modeling of different micro-controllers at different abstraction levels.", "paper_title": "Analyzing software performance and energy consumption of embedded systems by probabilistic modeling: An approach based on coloured Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425800015"}
