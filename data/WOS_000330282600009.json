Subsequent efforts have shown that the performance of CS can be improved by exploiting additional structure in the locations of the nonzero signal coefficients during inference or by utilizing some form of data-dependent adaptive measurement focusing during the sensing process. To the best of our knowledge, our own previous work was the first to establish the potential benefits that can be achieved when fusing the notions of adaptive sensing and structured sparsity. In that work, we examined the task of support recovery from noisy linear measurements, and established that an adaptive sensing strategy specifically tailored to signals that are tree-sparse can significantly outperform adaptive and non-adaptive sensing strategies that are agnostic to the underlying structure. In this paper, we establish fundamental performance limits for the task of support recovery of tree-sparse signals from noisy measurements, in settings where measurements may be obtained either non-adaptively (using a randomized Gaussian measurement strategy motivated by initial CS investigations) or by any adaptive sensing strategy. Our main results here imply that the adaptive tree sensing procedure analyzed in our previous work is nearly optimal, in the sense that no other sensing and estimation strategy can perform fundamentally better for identifying the support of tree-sparse signals.", "paper_title": "On the Fundamental Limits of Recovering Tree Sparse Vectors from Noisy Linear Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600009"}
