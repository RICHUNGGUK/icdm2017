Service-oriented and event-driven architectures (SOA and EDA) are the complementary paradigms for building such distributed information systems based on software interactions as their characteristics of modularity, loose-couplings, and flexibility. However, given the rapid change of the web environment (including the dynamic behavior of the users), these paradigms are not yet able to empower a built system adapting its behavior according to the changes in its environment or in parts of the system itself. This paper presents an architecture of adaptive integration of EDA and SOA based on the novel concept of value-centric processing and communication of events grounded on value theory. This architecture has also been used on a case study of distributed care service delivery. In the architecture, value models are devised to represent events consumed and develop a value-centric mechanism for this adaptive integration. We have also implemented the system and simulated certain representative scenarios in order to justify the claimed values of this adaptive integration on the case study. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
