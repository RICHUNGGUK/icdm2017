In this scenario many techniques are emerging for inspecting network traffic and discriminating between anomalous and normal behaviors to detect undesired or suspicious activities. Unfortunately, the concept of normal or abnormal network behavior depends on several factors and its recognition requires the availability of a model aiming at characterizing current behavior, based on a statistical idealization of past events. There are two main challenges when generating the training data needed for effective modeling. First, network traffic is very complex and unpredictable, and second, the model is subject to changes over time, since anomalies are continuously evolving. As attack techniques and patterns change, previously gained information about how to tell them apart from normal traffic may be no longer valid. Thus, a desirable characteristic of an effective model for network anomaly detection is its ability to adapt to change and to generalize its behavior to multiple different network environments. In other words, a self-learning system is needed. This suggests the adoption of machine learning techniques to implement semi-supervised anomaly detection systems where the classifier is trained with \"normal\" traffic data only, so that knowledge about anomalous behaviors can be constructed and evolve in a dynamic way. For this purpose we explored the effectiveness of a detection approach based on machine learning, using the Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machine to combine the expressive power of generative models with good classification accuracy capabilities to infer part of its knowledge from incomplete training data.
