Traditionally, this involves applying scenarios, usability analysis, or the use of metrics for risk analysis. In this paper, we present an approach that uses the information from incident investigations to inform the development of safety-cases that can, in turn, be used to inform a formal system model, represented using Petri nets and the ICO formalism. The foundations of the approach are first detailed and then exemplified using a fatal mining accident case study.", "paper_title": "Incident and accident investigation techniques to inform model-based design of safety-critical interactive systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238085600005"}
