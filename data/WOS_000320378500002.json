Am. Stat. Assoc. 94:1275-1285, 1999a). Applying the empirical likelihood method (Owen in Biometrika 75:237-249, 1988), a new estimated empirical log-likelihood ratio statistic for the index parameter of the SICRM is proposed. To increase the accuracy of the confidence region, a new profile empirical likelihood for each component of the relevant parameter is obtained by using maximum empirical likelihood estimators (MELE) based on a new and simple estimating equation for the parameters in the SICRM. Hence, the empirical likelihood confidence interval for each component is investigated. Furthermore, corrected empirical likelihoods for functional components are also considered. The resulting statistics are shown to be asymptotically standard chi-squared distributed. Simulation studies are undertaken to assess the finite sample performance of our method. A study of real data is also reported.", "paper_title": "Profile empirical-likelihood inferences for the single-index-coefficient regression model", "paper_id": "WOS:000320378500002"}
