This study investigated an analytical model of soil-structure interaction to assess the settlement of dwellings built on swelling soils when droughts occur. The building behavior was investigated with the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, and the ground behavior was investigated with a Winkler-derived model based on the state surface approach. The analytical model results were compared to those of a finite element analysis using the Barcelona Expansive Model (BExM) performed with Code_Bright. The analytical model was then used to assess the settlement transmission ratio for a typology of clayey soils and different parameters of building. The results indicated that the final deflection of the building increased with the building length and soil suction. The building deflection due to the suction variations was inversely proportional to the load, the rigidity of the building and the embedding depth of the foundation. Increasing these parameters made the building less vulnerable to shrinkage and swelling action. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
