Each parameter in the chaotic neuron has its influence upon the distinct dynamics estimated throughout experimental design. Based on this analysis, values of parameters are set to illustrate the existence of behaviors such as bifurcation, deterministic chaos and crisis. The existence of the chaotic dynamics is confirmed by calculation of Lyapunov exponents. C-BAM family also presented diversity of patterns recalled, including the occurrence of excursions over all stored memories for some sets of parameters. Hence, C-BAM family can access patterns that original BAM family cannot.", "paper_title": "Dynamic behaviors in chaotic bidirectional associative memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000250646000010"}
