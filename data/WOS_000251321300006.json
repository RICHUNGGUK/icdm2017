From the compressed domain, the proposed scheme extracts textural features from wavelet coefficients, which describe the relative homogeneity of localized areas of the retinal images. Since the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is shift-variant, a shift-invariant DWT was explored to ensure that a robust feature set was extracted. To combat the small database size, linear discriminant analysis classification was used with the leave one out method. 38 normal and 48 abnormal (exudates, large drusens, fine drusens, choroidal neovascularization, central vein and artery occlusion, histoplasmosis, arteriosclerotic retinopathy, hemi-central retinal vein occlusion and more) were used and a specificity of 79% and sensitivity of 85.4% were achieved (the average classification rate is 82.2%). The success of the system can be accounted to the highly robust feature set which included translation, scale and semi-rotational, features. Additionally, this technique is database independent since the features were specifically tuned to the pathologies of the human eye.", "paper_title": "Shift-invariant discrete wavelet transform analysis for retinal image classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000251321300006"}
