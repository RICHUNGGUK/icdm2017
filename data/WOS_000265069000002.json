Very often, however, the difference between these types of models is not clear and causes confusion and erratic use of the terms. The aim of tills paper is to clarify the concept of model through a Study of some of the more common ones used in ISs. Tills proposal is presented through an ontology, where we show how we conceptualize models according to their role in the development of an IS: the model understood as the representation of a domain or as a reality serving as an example.", "paper_title": "The concepts of model in information systems engineering: a proposal for an ontology of models", "paper_id": "WOS:000265069000002"}
