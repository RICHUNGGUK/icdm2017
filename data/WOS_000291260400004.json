This paper is to introduce a new type of two-dimensional dyadic wavelet transform and its application so that dyadic wavelet can be studied and used widely furthermore. (1) Two-dimensional stationary dyadic wavelet transform (2D-SDWT) is proposed, it is defined by approximation coefficients, detail coefficients in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions, which is essentially the extension of two-dimensional stationary wavelet transform for orthogonal/biorthogonal wavelet filters. (2) epsilon-decimated dyadic discrete wavelet transform (DDWT) is introduced and its relation with 2D-SDWT is given, where epsilon is a sequence of 0's and 1's. (3) Mallat decomposition algorithm based on dyadic wavelet is introduced as a special case of epsilon-decimated DDWT, and so a face recognition algorithm based on dyadic wavelet is proposed, and experimental results are given to show its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "TWO-DIMENSIONAL STATIONARY DYADIC WAVELET TRANSFORM, DECIMATED DYADIC DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM AND THE FACE RECOGNITION APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000291260400004"}
