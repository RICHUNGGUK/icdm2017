Roughly speaking, we consider different bounds for the directional or partial derivatives of f is an element of C-k(D-d) and ask whether the curse of dimensionality holds for the respective classes of functions. We always assume that D-d subset of R-d has volume one and we often assume additionally that D-d is either convex or that its radius is proportional to root d. In particular, D-d can be the unit cube. We consider various values of k including the case k = infinity which corresponds to infinitely differentiable functions. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions, and in some cases a full characterization for the curse of dimensionality. For infinitely differentiable functions we prove the curse if the bounds on the successive derivatives are appropriately large. The proof technique is based on a volume estimate of a neighborhood of the convex hull of n points which decays exponentially fast in d. For k = infinity, we also study conditions for quasi-polynomial, weak and uniform weak tractability. In particular, weak tractability holds if all directional derivatives are bounded by one. It is still an open problem if weak tractability holds if all partial derivatives are bounded by one. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
