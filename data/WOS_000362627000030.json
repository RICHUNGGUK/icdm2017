The method is based on cut sets and comparison relation on interval values. Three parts are involved in the paper. Firstly, a new formula of cut sets of interval values is introduced. Then with the help of the formula, a new comparison relation on interval values is presented, and applied to the issue of ranking fuzzy numbers using fuzzy attitude functions. Secondly, some numerical examples are used not only to demonstrate the procedure of the proposed method but also to compare with previous methods Finally, by use of the ranking method, a fuzzy attitude-based decision model is introduced to solve fuzzy decision making problems. Some examples are given for illustration. The achievements in the presented work will provide an effective ranking method with good results for decision making problems.", "paper_title": "A possibility-based method for ranking fuzzy numbers and applications to decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627000030"}
