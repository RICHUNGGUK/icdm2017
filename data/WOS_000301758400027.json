Here, we generated facial images with different proportions using computer software, hence avoided the influence of hairstyle, facial expression as well as skin tone and texture on the perception of facial attractiveness. By analyzing the relationship between the facial proportions of 432 computer generated facial images and their attractiveness ratings, here we identified the optimum proportions for an attractive female face and further established a model of predicting facial attractiveness from four principle components of facial proportions with good predictability (R-2=0.64).
