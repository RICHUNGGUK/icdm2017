It is therefore necessary to have a regression test suite that is easily administered and configured, as well as a way to easily view and interpret the test suite results. We describe the methodology for verification of FLASH, a highly capable multiphysics scientific application code with a wide user base. The methodology uses a combination of unit and regression tests and an in-house testing software that is optimized for operation under limited resources. Although our practical implementations do not always comply with theoretical regression-testing research, our methodology provides a comprehensive verification of a large scientific code under resource constraints.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Ongoing verification of a multiphysics community code: FLASH", "paper_id": "WOS:000347533400005"}
