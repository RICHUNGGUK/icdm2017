The antenna is composed of a circular radiation patch, a microstrip-fed line, and a partial ground. By etching an arc-shaped slot on the radiation patch and a C-like slot on the feed line, dual notched frequency bands at 3.3-3.7 GHz for WiMAX and 5.15-5.825 GHz for WLAN are achieved. And, the two notched bands can be adjusted independently by varying the length of the slots. Moreover, the band-notched characteristics can be reconfigurable by shorting the corresponding slots. So, the antenna is capable of operating in one of multiple modes which makes it an excellent candidate for UWB applications. Meanwhile, experimental results indicate that the antenna has an available impendence bandwidth from 2.9 to 11 GHz which covers the UWB frequency band, and nearly omnidirectional patterns, stable gains, small group delay in operating band except rejected bands.
