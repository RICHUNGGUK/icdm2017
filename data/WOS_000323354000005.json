The proposed circuits possess many advantages, such as high sensitivity, high immunity against disturbances, simple structure, and so on. This integrator not only de fines a minimum time for the burst length and a minimum time between the bursts, but also achieves the same minimum number of pulses in different frequencies. The frequency-tunable dynamic pulse integrator is a combined structure of the center frequency modulation and a new type of pulse integrator. The center frequency modulation is implemented by using zener zap anti-fuse trim and a second-order band-pass filter (BPF) with bipolar operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) cell. The integrator also describes the characteristics of variable-error tolerance to prevent the output envelope error due to the lack of individual pulses. The results of simulation are shown that the center frequency is available from 33 to 40 kHz and 56 kHz in typical application by Cadence respectively. Moreover, the minimum burst length is 10 pulses and minimum bursts gap time is 14 pulses in typical application.", "paper_title": "DYNAMIC PULSE INTEGRATING CIRCUIT FOR INFRARED RECEIVERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000323354000005"}
