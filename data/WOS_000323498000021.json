We show that there is a supervisory policy that enforces liveness in an arbitrary instance N(m(0)), where N is an element of G, if and only if there is a similar policy for an FCPN that results when the construction procedure enunciated in this paper is executed with N and its controllable transition set as input. Since the existence of a supervisory policy in an arbitrary partially controlled FCPN is decidable, it follows that the existence of similar policies for any N(m(0)), where N is an element of G, is also decidable. Furthermore, when it exists, the minimally restrictive supervisory policy that enforces in a member of G is characterized by a right-closed set of markings.", "paper_title": "On a Decidable Class of Partially Controlled Petri Nets With Liveness Enforcing Supervisory Policies", "paper_id": "WOS:000323498000021"}
