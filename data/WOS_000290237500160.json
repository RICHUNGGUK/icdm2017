In contrast with the previous studies considered ample capacity for DCs, we consider the capacity for each DC. The presented model minimizes the total cost in such a way that some DCs are selected in order to supply demands of all the customers. To tackle such an NP-hard problem, we propose an artificial immune algorithm (AIA) and a genetic algorithm (GA) based on the spanning tree and Prufer number representation. We introduce a new method to calculate the affinity value by using an adjustment rate. Furthermore, we apply the Taguchi experimental design method to set the proper values of AIA and GA parameters in order to improve their performances. Finally, we investigate the impact of increasing the problem size on the performance of our proposed algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
