A ring resonator is chosen as a canonical structure and modeled with both rectangular- and cylindrical-FDTD packages. Calibration against analytical exact solution derived in terms of cylindrical Bessel functions is also performed. It is shown that rectangular-FDTD with periodic boundary condition, where the computation domain is reduced, can also be applied in modeling circular structures.", "paper_title": "Comparison of rectangular and cylindrical FDTD representations on a ring resonator problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000256836200010"}
