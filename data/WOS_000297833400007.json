We present a sufficient condition to recognize when a G-graph is a Cayley graph. The relation between G-graphs and Cayley graphs allows us to consider some applications to the hamiltonicity of Cayley graphs. In the last section we illustrate our results by showing that some new classes of Cayley graphs are hamiltonian. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
