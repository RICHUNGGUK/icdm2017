The model based on the Galois group theory will allow us to group different candidates depending on the common characteristics that meet a certain level. Design/methodology/approach - Identification and definition both the requirements of an offered job position and the characteristics of the candidates applying for that position. From here, the authors have been grouping those requirements and characteristics and then calculating numeric values of the relations between candidates and requirements which are derived from language semantics. Findings - Choosing the most adequate candidate for an offered job position among other candidates within the strategic HR and personal selection processes. Originality/value - The paper presents interesting results presenting a different model taking into account Galois group theory and fuzzy linguistic variables.", "paper_title": "A personal selection model using Galois group theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000324449300007"}
