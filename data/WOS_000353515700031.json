The rate region is achieved by a simple scheme that separates the lossy vector quantization from the lossless spatial compression. The converse is established by extending and combining three analysis techniques that have been employed in the past to obtain partial results for the problem.", "paper_title": "Rate Region of the Vector Gaussian One-Helper Source-Coding Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000353515700031"}
