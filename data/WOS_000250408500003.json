Many see this as value added for science publishing that can enhance and inform secondary examination of data and results. Still others worry that data sharing is an undue burden for researchers with little long term value to science. But examples of how data sharing can be done successfully do exist. The fMRI Data Center, established at Dartmouth College in 2000 and now based at the University of California Santa Barbara, has worked to facilitate the open sharing of neuroimaging data from peer-reviewed papers to foster progress in cognitive science. The fMRI study on the representation of objects in the human occipital and temporal cortex, published in 2000 in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (JOCN), marked the first deposition in the new database. Despite initial concerns about fMRI data sharing, this data set was frequently downloaded. We describe the original results of distributed brain activation patterns elicited by faces and objects in the human visual system, and overview several secondary analyses by independent investigators. A philosopher tested Husserl's temporal components of consciousness, whereas other brain imagers deployed new analytic tools, from Dynamic Causal Modeling, which estimates the neural interactions between cortical regions, to a novel method for constructing reproducibility maps. These re-analyses revealed new findings not reported in the original study, provided new perspectives on visual perception, generated new predictions, and resulted in new collaborations and publications in high profile journals.", "paper_title": "Mapping the human brain: New insights from fMRI data sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000250408500003"}
