A crucial issue in wireless networks is the energy consumption, because of the nonlinear attenuation properties of radio signals. Another crucial issue is the trade-off between reaching more nodes in a single hop by using higher power versus reaching fewer nodes in that single hop by using lower power. Given a wireless network with a specified source node that broadcasts messages to all other nodes in the network, the minimum energy broadcast (MEB) problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach CBEEB(clustering-based energy-efficient broadcast) for the MEB problem based on clustering. Theoretical analysis indicates the efficiency and effectiveness of CBEEB. Simulation results show that CBEEB has better performance compared with the existing heuristic approaches.", "paper_title": "Clustering-Based Energy-Efficient Broadcast Tree in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000308334500017"}
