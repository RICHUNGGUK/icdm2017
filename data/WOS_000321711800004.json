This method utilises new features related to the function for the programming of the look up tables (LUTs), the utilisation (by logic activation/deactivation) of the nets in a interconnect configuration as well as the primary (unused) input/outputs (IOs) of the FPGAs. A new LUT programming function is introduced; the proposed method retains the original interconnect configuration and modifies the function of the LUTs using the so-called 1-bit sum function (1-BSF); the 1-BSF detects all possible stuck-at and bridging faults (of all cardinalities) by utilising the all zeros' vector and a walking-1 test set. As validated by simulation for benchmark circuits (implemented on the Xilinx Virtex4 and Virtex5), the proposed method (with a polynomial time complexity) results in a single test configuration with 100% coverage. These results also show that the proposed method requires a larger number of test vectors and an availability of unused IOs.", "paper_title": "Single-configuration fault detection in application-dependent testing of field programmable gate array interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000321711800004"}
