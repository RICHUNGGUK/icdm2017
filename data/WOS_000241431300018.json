It actually requires building and managing complex, distributed architectures in order to reach the quality of service that is needed. In this paper, we argue that using edge computing in the domain of Internet services has a number of advantages. However, this approach relies on complex and hard to administrate environments. We believe that autonomic computing techniques constitute a key element for the dynamic management of edge servers. In the paper, we present an autonomic manager that meets the market needs and that has been tested in collaboration with Bull SA.", "paper_title": "Autonomic management of edge servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000241431300018"}
