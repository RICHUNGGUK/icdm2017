One of the most critical processes in CBSD is the selection of a set of software components from in-house or external repositories that fulfil some architectural and user-defined requirements. However, there is a lack of quality models and metrics that can help evaluate the quality characteristics of software components during this selection process. This paper presents a set of measures to assess the Usability of software components, and describes the method followed to obtain and validate them. Such a method can be re-used as a pattern for defining and validating measures for further quality characteristics. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
