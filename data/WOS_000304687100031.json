In this paper, the main existing models for determining the OWA operator weights are outlined and the concept of the Bayesian entropy is introduced. Based upon the Bayesian entropy the maximum Bayesian entropy approach for obtaining the OWA operator weights is proposed. In this model it is assumed, according to previous experiences or from theoretical considerations that a decision maker may have reasons to consider a given prior OWA vector. Finally the new model is solved according to the prior OWA vector with specific level of orness comparing the results with other methods. The results demonstrate the efficiency of our model in generating the OWA operator weights. An applied example is also presented to illustrate the applications of the proposed model.
