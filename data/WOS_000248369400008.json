Design/methodology/approach - The equations describing propagation of waves through these parallel or series meshes are equivalent to the Maxwell equations for TE gamma or TM gamma modes in a spherical cavity with lossy dielectric material between the external conducting surfaces, respectively. Findings - The transmission line meshes are used for a numerical study of the natural electromagnetic noise due to lightning discharges in the Earth-ionosphere cavity. Originality/value - The numerical algorithm finds values for Schumann resonances very close to the experimental ones, which allows us to affirm that this methodology is a valid numerical tool for predicting these resonances on other planets or moons as well.", "paper_title": "Transmission line meshes for computational simulation of electromagnetic modes in the Earth's atmosphere", "paper_id": "WOS:000248369400008"}
