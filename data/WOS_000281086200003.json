Extended algebraic immunity (EAI) extends the concept of algebraic immunity, whose point is that a Boolean function f may be replaced by another Boolean function f (c) called the algebraic complement of f. In this paper, we study the relation between different properties (such as weight, nonlinearity, etc.) of Boolean function f and its algebraic complement f (c) . For example, the relation between annihilator sets of f and f (c) provides a faster way to find their annihilators than previous report. Next, we present a necessary condition for Boolean functions to be of the maximum possible extended algebraic immunity. We also analyze some Boolean functions with maximum possible algebraic immunity constructed by known existing construction methods for their extended algebraic immunity.", "paper_title": "On extended algebraic immunity", "paper_id": "WOS:000281086200003"}
