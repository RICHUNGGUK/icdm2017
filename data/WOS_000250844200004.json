The modified system, which essentially realizes direct adaptive control scheme, deals very well for SISO plants, and does not need any pre training. It is adaptive and robust with respect to changes in the environment since it leams to produce appropriate control actions on line. An additional advantage of BELBIC is its simplicity as well as low computational load. The performance of the system is demonstrated via application on previously studied benchmarks involving optimization and adaptive control in nonlinear systems with MLP-backpropagation (BP) nets.", "paper_title": "Intelligent adaptive control of non-linear systems based on emotional learning approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000250844200004"}
