An adaptive disturbance-observer-based output feedback control is employed to provide a solution to the control problem, wherein the parameters are tuned online by using fuzzy logic systems to compensate for equivalent disturbance, and the stability condition of the closed-loop system is also derived. The suggested method does not require exact prior knowledge of the system and needs a few parameters to tune. The simulation results of a two-link electrically driven space manipulator show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Adaptive Disturbance-Observer-Based Robust Tracking Control of Electrically Driven Free-Floating Space Manipulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000337155400003"}
