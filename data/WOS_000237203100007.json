Our tool consists of three main functions: graphical editing of RDF descriptions, graphical editing of RDFS descriptions, and meta-model management facilities. In this paper, we focus on the meta-model management, a key concept which is defined as the appropriate management of the correspondence between a model and its meta-model: especially, the class and property in the meta-model, and the type of RDF resource and property in the model. The above facilities are implemented based on the plug-in system. We provide basic plug-in modules for checking the consistency of RDFS classes and properties. The prototyping tool, called MR3 (Meta-Model Management based on RDFs Revision Reflection), is implemented by Java language. Through an experiment using MR3, we show how MR3 contributes to the Semantic Web paradigm from the standpoint of RDFs description management.", "paper_title": "A graphical RDF-based meta-model management tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000237203100007"}
