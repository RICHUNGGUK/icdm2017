Starting with dyadic wavelets and exploiting the control provided in the form of free parameters, one can custom-design dyadic as well as bi-orthogonal wavelets adapted to a particular application. To validate the usefulness of the schemes, two construction methods have been proposed for designing dyadic wavelet filters with higher number of vanishing moments; using these design techniques, spline dyadic wavelet filters have been custom-designed for denoising of digital images, which exhibit enhanced denoising effects.", "paper_title": "The dyadic lifting schemes and the denoising of digital images", "paper_id": "WOS:000257762000001"}
