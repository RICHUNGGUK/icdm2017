Stability is a major requirement in practice, because projections are often affected by noise due to the nature of measurements. Reconstruction from projections taken along more than two directions is known to be a highly unstable task. Contrasting this result we prove several theorems showing that reconstructions from two directions closely resemble the original picture when the noise level is low and the original picture is uniquely determined by its projections.
