To our knowledge this is the first OT reduction to these problems only. We present two different constructions for oblivious transfer, one based on cut-and-chose arguments and another one which is based on a novel generalization of Bennett-Rudich commitments which may be of independent interest. Finally, we also present a variant of our protocol which is based on the Niederreiter cryptosystem.", "paper_title": "Oblivious Transfer Based on the McEliece Assumptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000300472000017"}
