This method does not require depth information or dense correspondences. Given the specification of the target display and a sparse set of correspondences, our method efficiently deforms the input stereoscopic images for display adaptation by solving a least-squares energy minimization problem. This can be used to adjust stereoscopic images to fit displays with different real estates, aspect ratios and comfort zones. In addition, with slight modifications to the energy function, our method allows users to interactively adjust the sizes, locations and depths of the selected objects, giving users aesthetic control for depth perception. User studies show that the method is effective at editing depth and reducing occurrences of diplopia and distortions.", "paper_title": "Content-Aware Display Adaptation and Interactive Editing for Stereoscopic Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000293710300001"}
