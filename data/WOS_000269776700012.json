The traditional IP multicast, a pure network-layer solution, is bandwidth efficient in data delivery but not scalable in managing the multicast tree. The more recent overlay multicast establishes the data-dissemination structure at the application layer; however, it induces redundant traffic at the network layer. We propose an application-oriented multicast (AOM) protocol, which exploits the application-network cross-layer design. With AOM, each packet carries explicit destinations information, instead of an implicit group address, to facilitate the multicast data delivery; each router leverages the unicast IP routing table to determine necessary multicast copies and next-hop interfaces. In our design, all the multicast membership and addressing information traversing the network is encoded with bloom filters for low storage and bandwidth overhead. We theoretically prove that the AOM service model is loop-free and incurs no redundant traffic. The false positive performance of the bloom filter implementation is also analyzed. Moreover, we show that the AOM protocol is a generic design, applicable for both intra-domain and inter-domain scenarios with either symmetric or asymmetric routing.", "paper_title": "Design of a Scalable Multicast Scheme With an Application-Network Cross-Layer Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000269776700012"}
