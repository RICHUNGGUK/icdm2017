Throughput is a key performance measure to be optimized when executing them. In this paper we propose a new task replication methodology for optimizing throughput for an image processing application in the field of medicine. The results show that by applying the proposed methodology we are able to achieve the desired throughput in all cases, in such a way that the input frames can be processed at any given rate.", "paper_title": "Exploiting throughput for pipeline execution in streaming image processing applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500099"}
