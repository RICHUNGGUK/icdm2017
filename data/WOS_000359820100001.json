A preprocessed ROF (PROF for short) is a ROF in which we are allowed to replace each variable x(i) with a univariate polynomial T-i (x(i) ). In this paper, we study the problems of designing deterministic identity testing algorithms for models related to preprocessed ROFs. Our main result gives PIT algorithms for the sum of k preprocessed ROFs, of individual degrees at most d (i.e., each T-i (x(i) ) is of degree at most d), that run in time (nd)(O(k)) in the white-box setting and in time (nd)(O(k+log n)) in the black-box setting. We also obtain better algorithms when the formulas have a small depth that lead to an improvement in the best PIT algorithm for multilinear depth-3 Sigma II Sigma(k) circuits. Our main technique is to prove a hardness of representation result, namely a theorem showing a relatively mild lower bound on the sum of k PROFs. We then use this lower bound in order to design our PIT algorithm.", "paper_title": "READ-ONCE POLYNOMIAL IDENTITY TESTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000359820100001"}
