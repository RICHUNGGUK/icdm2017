Our method uses much less space compared to the existing ones and is quite accurate. The metric can be utilized to increase the diagnosability of incompletely specified test sets via don't care filling. The X-filling approach can be integrated with test pattern generation tools to aid in better diagnostic pattern set generation.", "paper_title": "A Metric for Test Set Characterization and Customization Toward Fault Diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000325975600016"}
