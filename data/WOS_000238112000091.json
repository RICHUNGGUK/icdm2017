Our novel clustering algorithm uses the reward and penalty mechanism for the adaptation of the fuzzy neural networks prototypes for every training sample. This new clustering algorithm can on-line partition the input data, pointwise update the clusters, and self-organize the fuzzy neural structure. No prior knowledge of the input data distribution is needed for initialization. All rules are self-created, and they automatically grow with more incoming data. Our learning algorithm shows that supervised clustering algorithms can be used for the structure learning for the on-line self-organizing fuzzy neural networks. The control of the inverted pendulum is finally used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning algorithm.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy neural networks with structure learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000091"}
