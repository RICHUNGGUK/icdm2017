Our contribution is twofold. First, we prove exact recovery with high probability of random K-sparse signals within [K(1+ epsilon)] iterations of the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). This result shows that in a probabilistic sense, the OMP is almost optimal for exact recovery. Second, we prove the Lebesgue-type inequalities for the weak Chebyshev greedy algorithm, a generalization of the weak orthogonal matching pursuit to the case of a Banach space. The main novelty of these results is a Banach space setting instead of a Hilbert space setting. However, even in the case of a Hilbert space, our results add some new elements to known results on the Lebesgue-type inequalities for the restricted isometry property dictionaries. Our technique is a development of the recent technique created by Zhang.", "paper_title": "Sparse Approximation and Recovery by Greedy Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000341982200022"}
