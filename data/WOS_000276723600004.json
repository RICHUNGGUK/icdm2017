As a result, this implicit error correction has zero overhead, unlike the direct application of error-correcting codes, which increase content bitrate in the same proportion as target error probability. The findings in this paper indicate that our proposal outperforms previous approaches with explicit error correction (error protection within content segments) in terms of transmission bandwidth for the same packet loss probability. We present an analytical approach that can be used to tune implicit error correction (coding matrix selection), which we validate with simulations. We also simulate the impact of the coding schema on two different nVoD protocols, fast broadcasting (FB) and recursive frequency splitting (RFS). Finally, we show the benefits of applying this schema to a real scenario with WiMax transport.", "paper_title": "A zero-overhead error-correcting nVoD schema", "paper_id": "WOS:000276723600004"}
