This paper presents a technique to achieve very high compression ratio by using the optimized four-segment linear difference method. The proposed technique results in the ROM compression ratio of about 117.3:1 and the word size reduction of 6 bits for the design of a DDFS with 11-bit sine amplitude output. This high compression ratio result is very promising to meet the requirement of low power consumption and low hardware complexity in digital VLSI technology.", "paper_title": "An Improved Linear Difference Method with High ROM Compression Ratio in Direct Digital Frequency Synthesizer", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125700012"}
