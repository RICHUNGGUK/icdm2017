This method, however, fails if the histogram is unimodal or close to unimodal. Ng (Ng, H.F., 2006. Automatic thresholding for defect detection. Pattern Recognition Lett. 27 1644-1649) proposed a modified method, called as valley-emphasis method, which weighs the objective function of the Otsu method with the valley point of the histogram for defect detection. In this paper, a revised valley-emphasis thresholding method is presented using the neighborhood information of the valley point. Experiment results show that the proposed method has the proper segmentation results in defect detection and provides better segmentation results than that of valley-emphasis method and Otsu method.
