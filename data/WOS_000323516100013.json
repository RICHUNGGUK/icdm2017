In this paper, we present a versatile prebond TSV test method applicable before wafer thinning when the deep end of the TSV is inaccessible as buried in the still-thick wafer. Technical merits include: 1) the ability to handle both the resistive open fault and the leakage fault in the same test structure; 2) a capability that allows an user to have a better measure of the severity of the fault; and 3) an all-digital and easy to implement design-for-testability circuit.", "paper_title": "Oscillation-Based Prebond TSV Test", "paper_id": "WOS:000323516100013"}
