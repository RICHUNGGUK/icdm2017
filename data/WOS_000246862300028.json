Optimal solutions are characterized by using directional derivatives of the mutual information. As the central result, the optimal power assignment is obtained as the level crossing points of a set of simple monotone functions. The well-known water-filling principle for sum power constraints is retrieved as the limiting case p = 1. A nested Newton type algorithm is given for finding numerical solutions.", "paper_title": "Eigenvalue-based optimum-power allocation for Gaussian vector channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000246862300028"}
