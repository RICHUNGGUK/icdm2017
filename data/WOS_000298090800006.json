The process included accuracy verification for the computational tools using available experiment data. Numerical models for the Boeing 767200ER aircraft and the structural system for the top 20 stories of WTC-1 were developed for the simulations. A second aircraft model, simpler yet comparable in effect, was developed and used for a parametric sensitivity analysis. Results from these simulations and published by other researchers indicate that while the observed impact damage to tower exterior framing can be estimated accurately, the unseen impact damage to the core structure of the tower could not be estimated with high confidence. Although the computational tools helped in developing an understanding as to what might have happened as the aircraft penetrated and disintegrated into the structure, they were not able to reduce the uncertainty in the core damage estimate. However, reflecting insight from the behavior of the Pentagon building under the impact loads it received on the same day and studying the effects of elevated temperature on mechanical properties of steel in light of experimental data, the uncertainty in the core structural damage estimate was found to be of negligible importance with regards to the ultimate fate of the tower. It is demonstrated that through use of numerical simulations and engineering reasoning, a dominant factor in the collapse of the tower could be proposed with confidence. It was the loss of fire-proofing in the tower core during aircraft impact that left the core vulnerable to ensuing thermal loads and resulted in the eventual collapse of the tower.", "paper_title": "Using Numerical Simulations and Engineering Reasoning under Uncertainty: Studying the Collapse of WTC-1", "paper_id": "WOS:000298090800006"}
