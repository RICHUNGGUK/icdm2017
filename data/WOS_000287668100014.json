Such a representation seems interesting when no optimal normal basis exists for the field. We express the product of two field elements as Toeplitz or Hankel matrix-vector products. This provides a parallel multiplier which is subquadratic in space and logarithmic in time. Using the matrix-vector formulation of the field multiplication, we also present sequential multiplier structures with linear space complexity.", "paper_title": "Low Space Complexity Multiplication over Binary Fields with Dickson Polynomial Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000287668100014"}
