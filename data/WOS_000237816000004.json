Over roughly the same period, researchers at the Illinois Genetic Algorithm Laboratory (IlliGAL) at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign have developed GA design theory and advanced GA techniques called competent genetic algorithms-GAs that solve hard problems quickly, reliably, and accurately. Recently, under the guidance and direction of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the two laboratories have formed a collaboration, the common goal of which is to apply simple, competent, and hybrid GA techniques to challenging antenna problems. This paper is composed of two parts. The first part of this paper summarizes previous research conducted by AFRL at Hanscom for which SGAs were implemented to obtain acceptable solutions to several antenna problems. This research covers diverse areas of interest, including array pattern synthesis, antenna test-bed design, gain enhancement, electrically small single bent wire elements, and wideband antenna elements. The second part of this paper starts by briefly reviewing the design theory and design principles necessary for the invention and implementation of fast, scalable genetic algorithms. A particular procedure, the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA) is then briefly outlined, and the remainder of the paper describes collaborative efforts of AFRL and IlliGAL to solve more difficult antenna problems. In particular, recent results of using hBOA to optimize a novel, wideband overlapped subarray system to achieve -35 dB sidelobes over a 20% bandwidth. The problem was sufficiently difficult that acceptable solutions were not obtained using SGAs. The case study demonstrates the utility of using more advanced GA techniques to obtain acceptable solution quality as problem difficulty increases., (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
