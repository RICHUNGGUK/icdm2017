This paper introduces new random sampling reduction using precomputation techniques. The computation cost O(k(2) log(2) k(k/6)(k/4) + nk log k) is almost independent of the lattice dimension number. The new method is therefore especially advantageous to find a short lattice vector in higher dimensions. The arithmetic operation number of our new method is about 20% of the random sampling reduction with 200 dimensions, and with 1000 dimensions it is less than 1% (similar or equal to 1/130) of that of the random sampling reduction with representative parameter settings under reasonable assumptions.", "paper_title": "Random Sampling Reduction with Precomputation", "paper_id": "WOS:000314080500016"}
