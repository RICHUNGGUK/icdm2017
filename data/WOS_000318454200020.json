This paper proposes three new coding techniques to mitigate the OOB radiation of an OFDM system with high order modulation schemes, without introducing much complexity or transmission of side information, at the cost of small system throughput degradation compared to other existing methods. In these methods, a few subcarriers at the edge of the signal spectrum that have main contribution in OOB radiation are coded such that either modulate with minimum signal magnitude of the constellation or cancel out the OOB radiation of their adjacent subcarrier. With these methods, up to 11.5 dB OOB suppression is achieved at the maximum costs of 40% system throughput reduction, and 1.2 dB peak to average power ratio (PAPR) augmentation, when coding is applied to the 40% of total subcarriers at each edge of the signal spectrum.
