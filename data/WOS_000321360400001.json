Temporal resampling is implemented to effectively convert the Doppler scaling effects to Doppler frequency shifts. Under the assumption that the channels between all the transmitter and receiver pairs experience the same Doppler frequency, a variation of the recently proposed generalization of the sparse learning via iterative minimization (GoSLIM) algorithm, referred to as GoSLIM-V, is employed to estimate the frequency modulated acoustic channels. GoSLIM-V is user parameter free and is easy to use in practical applications. This paper also considers turbo equalization for retrieving the transmitted signal. In particular, this paper reviews the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) based soft-input soft-output equalizer involved in the turbo equalization scheme and adopts a fast implementation of the equalizer that achieves negligible detection performance degradation compared to its direct implementation counterpart. The effectiveness of the considered MIMO UAC scheme is demonstrated using both simulated data and measurements recently acquired during the MACE10 in-water experiment.", "paper_title": "Enhanced Mobile Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Underwater Acoustic Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000321360400001"}
