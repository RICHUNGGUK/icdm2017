Applying the fuzzy set theory, a hierarchical fuzzy hybrid structure consisting of a fuzzy discrete event dynamic system and a continuous variable dynamic system is constructed, which not only captures the hybrid continuous/discrete dynamics but also handles the uncertainties in states and state transitions. The identification of continuous and discrete components is developed, and the hybrid control is then synthesised by fuzzy IF-THEN rules embedded in the fuzzy interface. An example of the optimisation of a production line in manufacturing shows the efficacy of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A framework of fuzzy hybrid systems for modelling and control", "paper_id": "WOS:000274620400002"}
