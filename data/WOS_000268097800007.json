To address this challenge, we must first understand the power and energy characteristics of high performance computing applications. In this paper, we use a power-performance profiling framework called Power-Pack to study the power and energy profiles of the HPC Challenge benchmarks. We present detailed experimental results along with in-depth analysis of how each benchmark's workload characteristics affect power consumption and energy efficiency. This paper summarizes various findings using the HPC Challenge benchmarks, including but not limited to: 1) identifying application power profiles by function and component in a high performance cluster; 2) correlating applications' memory access patterns to power consumption for these benchmarks; and 3) exploring how energy consumption scales with system size and workload.", "paper_title": "ENERGY PROFILING AND ANALYSIS OF THE HPC CHALLENGE BENCHMARKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268097800007"}
