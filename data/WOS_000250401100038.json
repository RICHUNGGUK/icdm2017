There are many different ways to enhance depth perception, such as shading, contours, and shadows. Artists and illustrators frequently employ halos for this purpose. In this technique, regions surrounding the edges of certain structures are darkened or brightened which makes it easier to judge occlusion. Based on this concept, we present a flexible method for enhancing and highlighting structures of interest using GPU-based direct volume rendering. Our approach uses an interactively defined halo transfer function to classify structures of interest based on data value, direction, and position. A feature-preserving spreading algorithm is applied to distribute seed values to neighboring locations, generating a controllably smooth field of halo intensities. These halo intensities are then mapped to colors and opacities using a halo profile function. Our method can be used to annotate features at interactive frame rates.", "paper_title": "Enhancing depth-perception with flexible volumetric halos", "paper_id": "WOS:000250401100038"}
