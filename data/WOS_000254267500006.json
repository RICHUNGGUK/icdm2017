Design/methodology/approach - By looking at other sources, the paper considers the current state of the academic peer-review process, discusses Wikipedia and reflects on dynamic content creation and management applications currently in use in academia. Findings - The traditional peer review process must be updated to match the rapid creation and diffusion of knowledge that characterises the 21st century. The Wikipedia concept is a potential model for more rapid and reliable dissemination of scholarly knowledge. The implications of such a concept would have a dramatic effect on the academic community. Originality/value - This paper promotes a radical idea for changing the methods by which academic knowledge is both constructed and disseminated.", "paper_title": "Wikipedia and academic peer review - Wikipedia as a recognised medium for scholarly publication?", "paper_id": "WOS:000254267500006"}
