The difficulties mainly include: (1) The light is much weaker than in sunny days, therefore it is more difficult to design an efficient classification mechanism; (2) Since a pedestrian always be partly covered, only using its global features (e.g. appearance or motion) may be mis-detected; (3) The mirror images on wet road will cause a lot of false alarms. In this paper, based on our pervious work, we introduce a new system for pedestrian detection in rainy or snowy weather. Firstly, we propose a cascaded classification mechanism; and then, in order to improve detection rate, we adopt local appearance features of head, body and leg as well as global features. Besides that, a specific classifier is designed to detect mirror images in order to reduce false positive rate. The experiments in a single optical camera based pedestrian detection system show the effeteness of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "Optical camera based pedestrian detection in rainy or snowy weather", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000147"}
