Mechanistic studies of the biogenesis of natural products have been mainly explored by means of theoretical calculations, and taking into account experimental structures of reagents and products. Using a hybrid meta density functional theory method (mPW1B95), we studied the mechanisms associated with the biogenesis of five neo-clerodanes isolated from Salvia mycrophylla. The reaction mechanisms presented here explain the formation of the five neo-clerodanes and coincides with the formulated biogenetic hypothesis.", "paper_title": "A theoretical biogenesis overview of diterpenes isolated from Salvia microphylla", "paper_id": "WOS:000384976900001"}
