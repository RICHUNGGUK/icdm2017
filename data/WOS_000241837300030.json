In this paper, we extend the motion patterns applicable for calibration with the motion of 1D objects. We show that a 1D object with three or more markers, rotating around one marker which is moving in a plane, provides constraint equations on camera intrinsic parameters. A stick moving under gravity without other forces acting on performs such a motion. Simulated tests show the feasibility and numerical robustness of this method. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
