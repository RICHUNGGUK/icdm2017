Also, a number of combination rules are proposed. Different voting schemes are discussed and compared in order to study the performance of the ensemble in each task. The ensembles have been trained on real data available for bench-marking and also applied to a case study related to statistical description models of melodies for music genre recognition.", "paper_title": "Comparison of classifier fusion methods for classification in pattern recognition tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100077"}
