However, (optimal) maximum a-posteriori (MAP) detection suffers from excessively high computational complexity, which prevents its deployment in practical systems. Hence, many algorithms have been proposed in the literature that trade-off performance versus detection complexity. In this paper, we propose a flexible N-Way MIMO detector that achieves excellent error-rate performance and high throughput on graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed detector includes the required QR decomposition step and a tree-search detector, which exploits the massive parallelism available in GPUs. The proposed algorithm performs multiple tree searches in parallel, which leads to excellent error-rate performance at low computational complexity on different GPU architectures, such as Nvidia Fermi and Kepler. We highlight the flexibility of the proposed detector and demonstrate that it achieves higher throughput than existing GPU-based MIMO detectors while achieving the same or better error-rate performance.", "paper_title": "GPU Acceleration of a Configurable N-Way MIMO Detector for Wireless Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340053200002"}
