We introduce a typed version of Go!, called Multiobject Gol for both multiplicative linear logic (MLL) and multiplicative exponential linear logic (MELL) with units. We present a categorical setting that includes our previous (untyped) Gol models, as well as more general models based on monoidal *-categories. Our development of multiobject Gol depends on a new theory of partial traces and trace classes, which we believe is of independent interest, as well as an abstract notion of orthogonality (which is related to work of Hyland and Schalk). We develop Girard's original theory of types, data and algorithms in our setting, and show his execution formula to be an invariant of cut elimination (under some restrictions). We prove soundness theorems for the MGoI interpretation (for Multiplicative and Multiplicative Exponential Linear Logic) in partially traced *-categories with an orthogonality. Finally, we briefly discuss the relationship between our Gol interpretation and other categorical interpretations of GoI.", "paper_title": "Towards a typed Geometry of Interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000278636600006"}
