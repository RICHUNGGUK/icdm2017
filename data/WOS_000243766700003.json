First, the problem of aliasing in decimated bandpass images on directional decomposition is addressed. MDFB is then designed to suppress the aliasing effect as well as to minimize the reduction in frequency resolution. Second, an entropy-based measure on energy signatures is proposed to classify structured and random textures. With the use of this measure for texture pre-classification, an optimized retrieval performance can be achieved by selecting the MDFB-based method for retrieving structured textures and a statistical or model-based method for retrieving random textures. In addition, a feature reduction scheme and a rotation-invariant conversion method are developed. The former is developed so as to find the most representative features while the latter is developed to provide a set of rotation-invariant features for texture characterization. Experimental works confirm that they are effective for texture retrieval. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
