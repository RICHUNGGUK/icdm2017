Centralized robust adaptive controls are introduced to guarantee the motion, and force trajectories of the constrained object converge to the desired manifolds with prescribed performance. The stability of the closed-loop system and the boundedness of tracking errors are proved using Lyapunov stability synthesis. The tracking of the constraint trajectory/force up to an ultimately bounded error is achieved. The proposed adaptive controls are robust against relative motion disturbances and parametric uncertainties and are validated by simulation studies.", "paper_title": "Robust Adaptive Control of Cooperating Mobile Manipulators With Relative Motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000262562700011"}
