Upon selection of a particular prokaryotic organism and gene, two levels of visual gene context information are provided on a single dynamic page: (i) a graphical representation of a user defined portion of the chromosome centered on the gene of interest and (ii) the DNA sequence of the query gene, of the immediate neighboring genes and the intergenic regions each identified by a consistent color code. The aminoacid sequence is provided for protein-coding query genes. Query results can be exported as a rich text format (RTF) word processor file for printing, archival or further analysis.", "paper_title": "BAGET: a web server for the effortless retrieval of prokaryotic gene context and sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000252903700018"}
