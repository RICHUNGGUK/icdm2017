The designed controller achieves the global asymptotic stability. Based on the appropriate state transformation of time-delay systems and the Lyapunov method, the problem of controller design can be converted into the problem of finding a parameter which can be obtained by appraising the nonlinear terms of the systems. Finally, three simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the control algorithm proposed in this article.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic stabilisation for a class of feedforward input-delay systems with ratios of odd integers", "paper_id": "WOS:000320099900001"}
