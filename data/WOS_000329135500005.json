The task involves partitioning the limited on-chip SPM for actor code and data buffer, and executing actors in such a manner that the physical SPM is time shared with different actors and buffers (formally defined as code overlay and data overlay, respectively). In our setup, a traditional minimum buffer schedule could result in very high code overlay overhead and therefore may not be optimal. To reduce the number of direct memory access (DMA) transfers, actors need to be grouped into segments. Prefetching of code and data overlay that overlaps DMA transfers with actor executions also need to be exploited. The efficiency of the our heuristic was evaluated by compiling ten stream applications onto one synergistic processing engine (SPE) of an IBM Cell Broadband Engine. We compare the performance results of our heuristic approach with a minimum buffer scheduling approach and a 3-stage ILP approach, and show that our heuristic is able to generate high quality solutions with fast algorithm run time.", "paper_title": "Scheduling of Synchronous Data Flow Models onto Scratchpad Memory-Based Embedded Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000329135500005"}
