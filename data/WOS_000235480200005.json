A fuzzy PI controller is developed, which is a discrete time version of a conventional one. Its data base as well as the constant PI control gains are optimally designed by using a genetic algorithm for simultaneously satisfying the following specifications: overshoot and settling time minimizations and output response smoothing. A neural gain scheduler is designed, by the backpropagation algorithm, to tune the optimal parameters of the fuzzy PI controller at some operating points. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed structure for a DC servomotor adaptive speed control system used as an actuator of robotic manipulators.
