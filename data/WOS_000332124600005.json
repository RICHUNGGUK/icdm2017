Recently, a new communication technique called Web Sockets has appeared for implementing Web services that offer a true server-push mechanism. In this paper we present a system based on it to manage agent communications, and we motivate its use in an Assistive Technologies use case. A new Web Socket Message Transport Protocol is described and an implementation for the Jade platform is presented. Subscription based agent interaction for the use case is presented, along with a comparison between Web Socket and HTTP Message Transport Protocols.", "paper_title": "A Push-Based Agent Communication Model Empowering Assistive Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000332124600005"}
