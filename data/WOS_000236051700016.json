We therefore present an approach to model, visualize and analyze those interdependencies. Methods: The approach is based on the concepts defined in 3LGM(2), a meta-model to describe health information systems (HIS). An information process is defined as a sequence of functions using or updating information; a communication path as a sequence of communication links between interfaces belonging to application systems. The search for communication paths belonging to an information process is interpreted as an all-pairs shortest-paths problem. To solve this problem the Floyd-Warsholl algorithm is applied. Results:The resulting algorithm has been implemented as function of the 3LGM(2) tool, a tool to create 3LGM(2) compliant models. With it, it is possible to interactively define information processes at the domain layer and to analyze step by step whether the infrastructure at the logical tool layer is sufficient to communicate necessary data between application systems. Conclusions: The presented approach enables the representation and analysis of dependencies between information processes and communication paths. With it, the HIS architecture is directly associated with the business needs. This is an important condition for the systematic planning of hospital information systems.", "paper_title": "Modeling interdependencies between information processes and communication paths in hospitals", "paper_id": "WOS:000236051700016"}
