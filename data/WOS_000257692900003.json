The theoretical background is well-established. Nevertheless, improvement of various aspects of these radars is still required. Signal processing is one of the crucial points of the system which determines the capabilities of the radar. In this study a zero crossing detector implementation, which can be efficiently used for target detection and range calculation in short range FMCW range detector is proposed. The duration between consecutive zero-crossings are used as the data instead of the number of cycles per unit time. Experimental evaluation of its performance is also given.", "paper_title": "Zero crossing counter for accuracy improvement of FMCW range detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000257692900003"}
