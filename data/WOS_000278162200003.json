Most cluster systems rely on security products like firewalls for their security, but they cannot guarantee security of intra-cluster communications, which can be a weak spot that hackers exploit for further security attacks. A recent study by Lee and Kim (2007)[22] proposed a security framework to protect intra-cluster communications by encrypting and authenticating all packets with fine-grained security where any two communicating processes dynamically generate and share a cryptographic key, called a session key. However, the fine-grained Security scheme can incur serious performance degradation in large-scale cluster systems since it may take a long time to access session keys. To solve this problem, we propose to incorporate a session key cache inside a cluster interconnect card to speed up accesses to the session keys and build an analytical cluster traffic model to estimate the behavior of the cache in large-scale cluster systems. For further performance improvement, we propose a prefetching scheme speculating job scheduler's decision without OS interventions. Simulation results indicate that the session key cache with the prefetching scheme decreases the network latency by 50% on average, compared to the configurations without the enhancements.
