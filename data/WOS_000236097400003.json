A new strategy, based on the use of a series of two-level saturated designs, allowed to reduce the number of trials without compromising the quality of the achieved results. This approach revealed very fruitful in a practical case aiming at selecting a proper binder for nuclear waste encapsulation, and at investigating factors which influence the stability of the resulting solidified waste forms.
