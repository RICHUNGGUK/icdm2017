This study focuses on the use of Hierarchical Linear Modeling methods in psychiatric research. Evaluation includes 207 documents published until 2007, included and indexed in the ISI Web of Knowledge databases; analyses focuses on the 194 articles in the sample. Bibliometric methods are used to describe the publications patterns. Results indicate a growing interest in applying the models and an establishment of methods after 2000. Both Lotka's and Bradford's distributions are adjusted to the data.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical linear models in psychiatry: A bibliometric study", "paper_id": "WOS:000268881700016"}
