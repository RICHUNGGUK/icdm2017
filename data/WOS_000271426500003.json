Grids span multiple management domains with different service provisioning strategies. In this paper, we present a decentralised strategy of service discovery that utilises a selective service capacity state dissemination and an experience-based confidence model. The model provides a measure of the likelihood that a discovery request forwarded to a peer node would lead to a match between the requested capacity and the node's available service capacity. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms both the Flooding as well as the random forwarding discovery schemes.", "paper_title": "Confidence-based grid service discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000271426500003"}
