In this paper, we study the problem in both the randomized and the quantum query models and give new lower and upper bound techniques in both models. The lower bound technique works for any graph that contains a product graph as a subgraph. Applying it to the Boolean hypercube {0, 1}(n) and the constant-dimensional grids [n](d), two particular product graphs that recently drew much attention, we get the following tight results: RLS({0, 1}(n)) = Theta(2(n)/(2)n(1/2)), QLS({0, 1}(n)) = Theta(2(n/3)n(1/6)), RLS([n](d)) = Theta(n(d/2)) for d >= 4, QLS([n](d)) = Theta(n(d/3)) for d >= 6. Here RLS(G) and QLS(G) are the randomized and quantum query complexities of Local Search on G, respectively. These improve the previous results by Aaronson [in Proceedings of the Thirty-Sixth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2004, pp. 465-474], Ambainis (unpublished), and Santha and Szegedy [in Proceedings of the Thirty-Sixth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2004, pp. 494-501]. Our new algorithms work well when the underlying graph expands slowly. As an application to [n](2), a new quantum algorithm using O(root n(log log n)(1.5)) queries is given. This improves the previously best known upper bound of O(n(2/3)) (see Aaronson [in Proceedings of the Thirty-Sixth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2004, pp. 465-474]), and implies that Local Search on grids exhibits different properties in low dimensions.", "paper_title": "TIGHT BOUNDS FOR RANDOMIZED AND QUANTUM LOCAL SEARCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000270193400007"}
