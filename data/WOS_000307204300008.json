Moreover, the number of possible configurations in the 26-neighbourhood of a (26,6)-surface voxel is estimated to rise up to 10,580. In addition, we show that S-kk is the largest set of discrete surfaces that can be defined within the framework for Digital Topology in (Ayala et al., 2002). (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
