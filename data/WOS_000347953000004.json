In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-partitioning approach to analyzing stability of 2-D discrete state-space systems. A piecewise constant matrix function is introduced to approximate the solution to the frequency-dependent Lyapunov inequality, whose solvability is known to be equivalent to stability of a 2-D state-space model. Then by the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov Lemma, new stability conditions are derived for the Roesser model and the Fornasini-Marchesini (FM) first and second models, respectively. Stability criteria in the paper simultaneously overcome the drawbacks of the simple 2-D Lyapunov inequality approach and the existing necessary and sufficient conditions: (1) They are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are generally less conservative than the existing simple 2-D Lyapunov inequality-based results, and could be improved by increasing the partitioning number; (2) Since each of the LMIs corresponds to a simple 2-D Lyapunov inequality, they are more suitable for further development for system synthesis than the existing necessary and sufficient conditions, which is demonstrated by an illustrative application to state-feedback control of an uncertain FM second model.", "paper_title": "A frequency-partitioning approach to stability analysis of two-dimensional discrete systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000347953000004"}
