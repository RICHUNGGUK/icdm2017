We first derive the relationship between the transmission probability and the minimum contention window size of a vehicle, and the relationship between the velocity and the minimum contention window size of a vehicle in a non-saturated state. Based on the analytical model, the minimum contention window size of a vehicle for a given velocity can be determined in order to achieve fair access among different vehicles. Moreover, an analytical model is also developed for analyzing the throughput performance of the fair channel access protocol in a non-saturated state. The effectiveness of the analytical models is justified through simulation results.", "paper_title": "Performance modeling and analysis of IEEE 802.11 DCF based fair channel access for vehicle-to-roadside communication in a non-saturated state", "paper_id": "WOS:000347777300001"}
