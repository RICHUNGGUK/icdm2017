This period of transition, with new Office of National Coordinator for HIT leadership, upcoming Meaningful Use Stage III definitions, and increasing congressional oversight, is opportune to consider needed course corrections in HIT strategy. This article describes current problems and recommended changes in HIT policy, including approaches to usability, interoperability, and quality measurement. Recommendations refrain from interim measures, such as electronic health record adoption rates, and instead focus on measurable national value to benefit the economy, to reduce healthcare costs, and to improve clinical efficiency and care quality.", "paper_title": "Re-examining health IT policy: what will it take to derive value from our investment?", "paper_id": "WOS:000352771500024"}
