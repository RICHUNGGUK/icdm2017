Sufficient conditions for the asymptotical stability of an impulsive control system are derived. Comparison has been made between it and a typical feedback control method. Numerical simulations are cited to illustrate the methodology and to verify the theoretical results. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
