Majority of ABE methods follow uniform weighting in adaptation procedure. In this research we investigated non-uniform weighting through kernel density estimation. After an extensive experimentation of 19 datasets, 3 evaluation criteria, 5 kernels, 5 bandwidth values and a total of 2090 ABE variants, we found that: (1) non-uniform weighting through kernel methods cannot outperform uniform weighting ABE and (2) kernel type and bandwidth parameters do not produce a definite effect on estimation performance. In summary simple ABE approaches are able to perform better than much more complex approaches. Hence,-provided that similar experimental settings are adopted-we discourage the use of kernel methods as a weighting strategy in ABE.", "paper_title": "Kernel methods for software effort estimation Effects of different kernel functions and bandwidths on estimation accuracy", "paper_id": "WOS:000313069300001"}
