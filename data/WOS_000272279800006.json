The objective is to minimize the total number of ATMs to cover all customer demands within a given geographical area. First, a mathematical model of this optimization problem is formulated. A novel heuristic algorithm with unique features is then developed to efficiently solve this problem. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of this algorithm in solving the ATM placement problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
