We consider the following inductive inference problem: given A(epsilon), A(0), A(1), A(00),... learn, in the limit, a DFA for SUBSEQ(A). We consider this model of learning and the variants of it that are usually studied in inductive inference: anomalies, mindchanges, and teams.", "paper_title": "The complexity of learning SUBSEQ(A)", "paper_id": "WOS:000242124000011"}
