In the context of the potential availability of valid information on the Web, we have developed a question-and-answer system, which enables construction practitioners to seek for information by posing questions in English or French, instead of entering a list of relevant keywords. Based on a modular systems approach using natural language, relevant answers to questions are selected and presented in a convivial way, thus improving and speeding up the classical Web search procedure. Our system consists of two main components: An intelligent robot that traverses a Web space and decides whether a page is construction oriented or not, and a question-answer (Q-A) component (comprising three modules) that uses a domain-specific thesaurus to extract meaningful parts of a question and to detect, process, and present paragraph passages extracted from relevant Web pages. The robot is trained on positive and unlabeled examples using a machine learning approach, while the Q-A component uses natural language processing techniques. In our experiments, we show that our automatically collected database consists of approximately 16% of noise, while the performance of the Q-A component is 65.45% in mean reciprocal rank.", "paper_title": "Providing answers to questions from automatically collected web pages for intelligent decision making in the construction sector", "paper_id": "WOS:000251800400002"}
