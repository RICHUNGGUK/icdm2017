The proposed method is based on a trained support vector machine (SVM) that defines an optimized non-linear decision rule involving the subband SNRs of the input speech. It is analyzed the classification rule in the input space and the ability of the SVM model to learn how the signal is masked by the background noise. The algorithm also incorporates a noise reduction block working in tandem with the voice activity detector (VAD) that has shown to be very effective in high noise environments. The experimental analysis carried out on the Spanish SpeechDat-Car database shows clear improvements over standard VADs including ITU G.729, ETSI AMR and ETSI AFE for distributed speech recognition (DSR), and other recently reported VADs.", "paper_title": "Speech event detection using support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200046"}
