In this paper, we prove that in planar digraphs the edge-disjoint min-min problem remains NP-complete and admits no K-approximation for any K > 1 unless P = NP. As a by-product, we show that this problem remains NP-complete even when all edge costs are equal (i.e., strongly NP-complete). To our knowledge, this is the first NP-completeness proof for the edge-disjoint min-min problem in planar digraphs.
