AdaBoost is the most successful boosting algorithm that solved many practical difficulties of the earlier boosting algorithms. In this paper, we propose an improvement of AdaBoost, called DR-AdaBoost, in which a double-rule learning technique is used for improving the performance of AdaBoost. The DR-AdaBoost algorithm is evaluated with some classification problems of the UCI repository and it is also applied to a natural language processing task, text chunking. All experimental results show DR-AdaBoost outperforms AdaBoost. The improvement is significant, especially for those classification problems in which features are relevant.", "paper_title": "Double rule learning in boosting", "paper_id": "WOS:000256710400016"}
