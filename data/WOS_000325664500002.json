Although several approaches reported in the literature address this issue, complex cross-tree relationships involving attributes in extended feature models have not been handled. In this article, we introduce a mapping from extended feature models to constraint logic programming over finite domains. This mapping is used to translate into constraint logic programs; basic, cardinality-based and extended feature models, which can include complex cross-tree relationships involving attributes. This translation enables the use of off-the-shelf constraint solvers for the automated analysis of extended feature models involving such complex relationships. We also present the performance results of some well-known analysis operations on an example translated model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
