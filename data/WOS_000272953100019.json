We extend this result to surfaces and bivariate functions. An algebraic decomposition is presented that reformulates the surface self-intersection problem using an alternative set of constraints, while removing the redundant components. Extensions to higher dimensions are also briefly discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
