Several researchers have voiced an intuition that self-assembly phenomena are related to the field of distributed computing. This paper formalizes some of that intuition. We construct tile assembly systems that are able to simulate the solution of the wait-free consensus problem in some distributed systems. (For potential future work, this may allow binding errors in tile assembly to be analyzed, and managed, with positive results in distributed computing, as a \"blockage\" in our tile assembly model is analogous to a crash failure in a distributed computing model.) We also define a strengthening of the \"traditional\" consensus problem, to make explicit an expectation about consensus algorithms that is often implicit in distributed computing literature. We show that solution of this strengthened consensus problem can be simulated by a two-dimensional tile assembly model only for two processes, whereas a three-dimensional tile assembly model can simulate its solution in a distributed system with any number of processes.", "paper_title": "Distributed agreement in tile self-assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000288255800021"}
