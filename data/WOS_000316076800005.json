We give error bounds in terms of the smoothness of f and the characteristics of the triangulation. Then, the preceding theoretical results are compared with similar results in the literature. Finally, several examples are proposed for illustrating various applications of the quasi-interpolants studied in the paper.", "paper_title": "Error bounds on the approximation of functions and partial derivatives by quadratic spline quasi-interpolants on non-uniform criss-cross triangulations of a rectangular domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000316076800005"}
