Various research prototypes for humanoid robots have been designed and are going through evolution over these years. These humanoids have been successfully participating in various robotic soccer competitions. In this paper, three major research and development aspects of the above humanoid research are discussed. The paper focuses on various practical and theoretical considerations involved in processing architecture, gait generation and vision systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
