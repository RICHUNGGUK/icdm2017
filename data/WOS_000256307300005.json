This paper proposes the maximum entropy principle for fuzzy variables, that is, out of all the membership functions satisfying given constraints, choose the one that has maximum entropy. The problem is what is the specific formulation of the maximum entropy membership function. The purpose of this paper is to solve this problem by Euler-Lagrange equation.", "paper_title": "Maximum entropy principle for fuzzy variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000256307300005"}
