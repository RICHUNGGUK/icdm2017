We find the light-tailed asymptotics for the stationary distributions of the number of customers at embedded epochs and at arbitrary time. Using these tail asymptotics we propose a method for calculating the stationary distributions of the number of customers at embedded epochs and at arbitrary time. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate our results.
