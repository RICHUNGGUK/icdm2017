One can extend toric codes to the so-called generalized toric codes. This extension consists of evaluating elements of an arbitrary polynomial algebra at the algebraic torus instead of a linear combination of monomials whose exponents are rational points of a convex polytope. We study their multicyclic and metric structure, and we use them to express their dual and to estimate their minimum distance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
