In this paper an optimisation model is established to achieve an optimal resource allocation plan ensuring that all jobs are finished in a given time interval with a minimum number of resources and without any buffer overflow. A branch-and-bound algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Two theorems are proved and applied in the algorithm to improve its pruning efficiency. A real industrial application is implemented for Gienow Windows and Doors Ltd. based on this model and algorithm. Experimental results show that this method is effective.", "paper_title": "Optimal resource allocation for hybrid flow shop in one-of-a-kind production", "paper_id": "WOS:000273870800004"}
