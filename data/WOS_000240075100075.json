This paper proposes a new ensemble learning method based on two level hypothesis tests for incremental learning in concept changing environments. We analyze the classification error as a stochastic variable, and introduce hypothesis test as mechanism for adaptively selecting classifiers. Hypothesis tests are used to distinguish between useful and useless individual classifiers and to identify classifier to be updated. Classifiers deemed as useful by the hypothesis test are integrated to form the final prediction. Experiments with simulated concept changing scenarios show that the proposed method could adaptively choose proper classifiers and adapt quickly to different concept changes to maintain its performance level.", "paper_title": "Adaptive classifier selection based on two level hypothesis tests for incremental learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100075"}
