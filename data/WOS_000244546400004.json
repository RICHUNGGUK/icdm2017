In this paper, we aim to execute independent tasks efficiently on HPCEs. We consider the problem to find a schedule that maximizes the throughput of task execution for a huge number of independent tasks. First, for HPCEs where the network forms a directed acyclic graph, we show that we can find, in polynomial time, a schedule that attains the optimal throughput. Secondly, for arbitrary HPCEs, we propose an (3/2 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for any constant epsilon (epsilon > 0). In addition, we also show that the framework of our approximation algorithm can be applied to other collective communications such as the gather operation.", "paper_title": "Scheduling for independent-task applications on heterogeneous parallel computing environments under the unidirectional one-port model", "paper_id": "WOS:000244546400004"}
