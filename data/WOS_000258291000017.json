In this paper, we give an alternative proof of this result for second order automata. Our construction of automaton for recognizing pre(H)*(C) is explicit. The termination of saturation procedure used is obvious. It gives EXPTIME bound on size of the automaton recognizing pre(H)*(C) if there is no alternation present in H and in the automaton recognizing C.", "paper_title": "An alternative construction in symbolic reachability analysis of second order pushdown systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258291000017"}
