This is a nonconvex optimization problem and difficult to solve. In this work, we focus on a multi-commodity extension and consider the situation where K distinct commodities are shipped subject to capacity constraints between each customer and facility pair. Customer locations, demands and capacities for each commodity, and bundle restrictions are known a priori. The transportation costs, which are proportional to the distance between customers and facilities, depend on the commodity type. We address several location-allocation and discrete approximation heuristics using different strategies. Based on the obtained computational results we can say that the alternate solution of location and allocation problems is a very efficient strategy; but the discrete approximation has excellent accuracy.
