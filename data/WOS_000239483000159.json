By introducing time delay neurons, the neural network identifier and controller of ultrasonic motors are constructed. Both of them are trained online by using an improved back-propagation algorithm. The usefulness and validity of the presented algorithm is examined by the experiments.", "paper_title": "A dynamic time delay neural network for ultrasonic motor identirication and control", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000159"}
