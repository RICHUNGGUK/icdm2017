Thermal creep arises from tangential temperature gradients, which may be significant in the entrance region of channels, and affects the velocity and temperature fields particularly in low Reynolds number flows. In the present work, the Navier-Stokes and energy equations coupled with velocity-slip and temperature-jump conditions applied at the channel walls are solved numerically using a control-volume technique. Despite the constant wall temperature, tangential temperature gradients form in the gas layer adjacent to the wall due to the temperature-jump condition. The effects of slip/jump and thermal creep on the flow patterns and parameters are studied in detail for a wide range of channel aspect ratios and, Knudsen and Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, the effects of variable properties on velocity-slip and, friction and heat transfer coefficients are also examined.", "paper_title": "ENTRANCE EFFECTS OF THERMAL CREEP ON FLUID HEATING IN RECTANGULAR MICROCHANNELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000321269400006"}
