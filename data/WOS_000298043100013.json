This may be the result of several factors: the systems are developed from a technical perspective, are rarely evaluated in the field, and/or lack consideration of the end user and the constraints of the OR. We introduce the Data, Visualization processing, View (DVV) taxonomy which defines each of the major components required to implement a mixed reality IGS system. We propose that these components be considered and used as validation criteria for introducing a mixed reality IGS system into the OR. A taxonomy of IGS visualization systems is a step toward developing a common language that will help developers and end users discuss and understand the constituents of a mixed reality visualization system, facilitating a greater presence of future systems in the OR. We evaluate the DVV taxonomy based on its goodness of fit and completeness. We demonstrate the utility of the DVV taxonomy by classifying 17 state-of-the-art research papers in the domain of mixed reality visualization IGS systems. Our classification shows that few IGS visualization systems' components have been validated and even fewer are evaluated.", "paper_title": "DVV: A Taxonomy for Mixed Reality Visualization in Image Guided Surgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000298043100013"}
