Still, they are rarely used in practice due to the challenge of optimization. Recently, iteratively reweighed l(1) minimization (IRL1) has been proposed as a way to tackle a class of nonconvex functions by solving a sequence of convex l(2)-l(1) problems. We extend the problem class to the sum of a convex function and a (nonconvex) nondecreasing function applied to another convex function. The proposed algorithm sequentially optimizes suitably constructed convex majorizers. Convergence to a critical point is proved when the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property and additional mild restrictions hold for the objective function. The efficiency and practical importance of the algorithm are demonstrated in computer vision tasks such as image denoising and optical flow. Most applications seek smooth results with sharp discontinuities. These are achieved by combining nonconvexity with higher order regularization.", "paper_title": "On Iteratively Reweighted Algorithms for Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization in Computer Vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000352213100011"}
