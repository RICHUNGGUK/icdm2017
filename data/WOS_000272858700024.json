In these conditions, in fact, the fluid dynamics of the wave and current motions and, as a consequence, the responses of the movable bed are significantly different from those expected for a linear superposition of a current with a sinusoidal wave. Thus, wave nonlinearity and the wave-current interaction effects become important factors that need to be considered. A model should be also able to reproduce the fluid dynamics under shallow water conditions over significant slopes and time-bed-level changes. This paper presents a 1DH mathematical formulation of a hydrodynamic model and its numerical solution. The model is able to reproduce all characteristic shallow water phenomena, including: (i) wave-wave and wave-current interaction effects; (ii) important ratios between the current and wave velocities; (iii) significant bed slopes and sudden time-bed-level changes, and (iv) friction stresses at the bottom and at the free surface. Different orders of mathematical approximations and appropriate application examples are also presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
