In the physical meaning, occurrence of degeneracy in a Fuzzy Minimal Cost Flow Network is investigated. To prevent of falling into Cycling phenomenon in optimization process, we defined two new techniques of Cycling prevention proper to fuzzy environment.", "paper_title": "DEGENERACY IN FUZZY LINEAR PROGRAMMING AND ITS APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000297519100005"}
