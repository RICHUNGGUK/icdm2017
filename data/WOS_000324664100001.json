First, we obtained the temperature and magnetic field corresponding to the tricritical point of the model by using a refinement process based on optimization of the coefficient of determination in the log-log fit of magnetization decay as a function of time. With these estimates in hand, we obtained the dynamic tricritical exponents theta and z and the static tricritical exponents nu and beta by using the universal power-law scaling relations for the staggered magnetization and its moments at an early stage of the dynamic evolution. Our results at the tricritical point confirm that this model belongs to the two-dimensional Blume-Capel model universality class for both static and dynamic behaviors, and they also corroborate the conjecture of Janssen and Oerding for the dynamics of tricritical points.
