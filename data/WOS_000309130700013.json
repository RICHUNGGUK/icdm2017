The approach, suitable for the DAC nonlinearity correction in Sigma-Delta modulators, obtains better results than dynamic element matching. The key of the proposed technique is an off-line self-measurement of mismatches with the available hardware. The results significantly improve when redundant DAC capacitors are introduced. Hence, the capacitors are selected from a set that is larger than required. An affordable silicon area overhead introduced by the redundant capacitors avoids extra power consumption, that is unavoidable in other methods during the normal operation of the converter.", "paper_title": "Optimum selection of capacitive array for multibit Sigma-Delta modulators without DEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000309130700013"}
