There is evident need of using Learning Objects in various multimedia settings. With new shift in technology and the grasp of learning methods, multimedia is gaining on importance as a standard tool for education. Since Learning Objects consist of content and presentation, the presentation part creates a reusability issue with every new multimedia environment. Systems that are based on multimedia can reach high levels of presentational complexity. Integrating existing Learning Objects in to different presentational multimedia forms can prove very difficult. This is emphasized when it comes to games, since they are one of the most complex multimedia platforms. For that reason our proof of concept will use educational games as a subject, by honoring that if the concept is applicable in complex setting, it can be successfully applied in simple ones as well.", "paper_title": "Learning object repurposing for various multimedia platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000316483000015"}
