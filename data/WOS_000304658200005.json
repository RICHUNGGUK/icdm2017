From the basic information theory for MIMO channels, we derived a simple energy efficiency defined as number of bits per Watt. we then identified three approaches to improve the optimal energy efficiency with a higher capacity, which include alleviating channel fading loss, mitigating the interference, and increasing the number of antennas. We considered the scenario of a single cell with distributed antennas to jointly investigate above three factors. We first proposed a beam forming based energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm, which can achieve the optimal energy efficiency with a higher capacity through adaptively allocating resources and managing interferences. Due to the computational complexity of this algorithm and real-time processing requirement, we further proposed a low-complexity antenna-selection based resource allocation algorithm, which is more tractable and only with slightly performance loss. Finally, we compared different network configurations with these algorithms by extensive simulations, the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms in distributed antenna configurations achieve better energy efficiency at a high operational throughput point.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in Mobile Networks with Distributed Antenna Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000304658200005"}
