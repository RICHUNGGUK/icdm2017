We are interested in detecting and estimating the change-point and studying the asymptotic properties of the estimator and the test statistic. We apply the method to two practical data series to investigate the presence of change in H . Simulations and data examples confirm the validity of the test and estimation.", "paper_title": "Testing and estimating for change in long memory parameter", "paper_id": "WOS:000234635000003"}
