We define a similarity measure between a simulated image of a 3D box, including the box shadow, and a captured image that is classified into background/foreground/shadow. The similarity Measure is used in all optimization procedure to find the optimal box state. It is shown in a number of experiments and examples how the combination shadow detection/simulation improves the estimation compared to just using detection or simulation, especially when the shadow detection or the simulation is inaccurate. We also describe a tracking system that utilizes the estimated 3D boxes, including highlight detection, spatial window instead of a time based window for predicting heading, and refined box size estimates by weighting accumulated estimates depending oil view. Finally, we show example results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
