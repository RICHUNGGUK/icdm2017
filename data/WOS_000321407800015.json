This new design was developed in order to increase AC machine energetic performance by assembling non-segmented shifted grain-oriented steel sheets which make it possible to reduce iron losses. Experimental results on induction machine efficiency increase are presented and justified using reluctance network simulations. An analysis, finally, shows and explains how this structure behaves considering acoustic magnetic noise in a Pulse Width Modulation supply case. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
