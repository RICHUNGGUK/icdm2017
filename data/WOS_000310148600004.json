Previously, an iterative MRI reconstruction with separate magnitude and phase regularization was proposed for applications where magnitude and phase maps are both of interest, but it requires fully sampled data and unwrapped phase maps. In this paper, CS is combined into this framework to reconstruct magnitude and phase images accurately from undersampled data. Moreover, new phase regularization terms are proposed to accommodate phase wrapping and to reconstruct images with encoded phase variations, e. g., PRF-shift thermometry and velocity mapping. The proposed method is demonstrated with simulated thermometry data and in vivo velocity mapping data and compared to conventional phase corrected CS.", "paper_title": "Separate Magnitude and Phase Regularization via Compressed Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000310148600004"}
