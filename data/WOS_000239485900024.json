However, instantiation is often conducted in manual and ad-hoc fashion, largely replying on domain knowledge and experience. Hence, it can easily lead to technical problems in precisely specifying decision model consisting of product-specific variation points and variants, and in handling inter-variant conflicts/dependency. To overcome this difficulty, it is desirable to develop a systematic process which includes a set of systematic activities, detailed instructions, and concrete specification of artifacts. In this paper, we first propose a meta-model of a core asset to specify its key elements. Then, we represent a comprehensive process that defines key instantiation activities, representations of artifacts, and work instructions. With the proposed process, one can instantiate core assets more effectively and systematically.", "paper_title": "A variability-centric approach to instantiating core assets in product line engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485900024"}
