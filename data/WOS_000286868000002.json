Syndrome and data qubits form a checkerboard pattern. Information about errors is obtained by repeatedly measuring each syndrome qubit after appropriate interaction with its four nearest neighbor data qubits. Changes in the measurement value indicate the presence of chains of errors in space and time. The standard method of determining operations likely to return the code to its error-free state is to use the minimum weight matching algorithm to connect pairs of measurement changes with chains of corrections such that the minimum total number of corrections is used. Prior work has not taken into account the propagation of errors in space and time by the two-qubit interactions. We show that taking this into account leads to a quadratic improvement of the logical error rate.", "paper_title": "SURFACE CODE QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION INCORPORATING ACCURATE ERROR PROPAGATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000286868000002"}
