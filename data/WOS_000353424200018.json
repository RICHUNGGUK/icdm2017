Several statistical methods have been proposed to compare biological sequences, but challenge remains. This paper proposed a novel position-specific statistical model based on base-specific position matrices and Markov model to describe randomness degree and local dynamic distribution in specific positions. We illustrated its application in analysis of chromosomes 1 of eight species, human coding/ non-coding sequences and phylogenetic relationships. The experiment results demonstrate that nucleotides' distributions in the first position from right of the nucleotide C and left of the nucleotide G are extremely uneven, and most of conserved patterns in non-coding sequences are relatively longer and more conservative than that in coding sequences. This understanding can then be used to guide development of more powerful methods for sequence analysis.", "paper_title": "Position-Specific Statistical Model of DNA Sequences and Its Application for Similarity Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000353424200018"}
