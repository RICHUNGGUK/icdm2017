This paper proposes OppCode, a new opportunistic networkcoding-based flooding architecture for multipacket dissemination in WSNs, where both unreliable and correlated links commonly exist. Instead of flooding a single packet each time, each node encodes multiple native packets chosen from a specific fixed-size page to an encoded packet and then rebroadcasts it further. The key idea consists of two parts. One is opportunistically coding decision, in which each node grasps every possible coding opportunity greedily to maximize its aggregate coding gain of all neighbors based on the probabilistic estimation of packets each neighbor already has. The other is paged collective acknowledgements (ACKs), in which one rebroadcast acts as not only an implicit ACK of successful disseminations of all packets in the entire page for the sender, but also probabilistic ACK to update page-scale per-packet coverage estimations for its neighbors in a batch. Experiments based on extensive simulations and 21-node testbed show that OppCode significantly increases performance of multipacket flooding in terms of reliability, transmission overhead, delay, and load balance.", "paper_title": "OppCode: Correlated Opportunistic Coding for Energy-Efficient Flooding in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000366141100037"}
