In this paper, we present an innovative approach and show how movement analysis of sleeping subjects can be used to enable new lifestyle related applications. The first application we propose shows how a sleeping subject's movement pattern can be used to build an intelligent wake-up light system. The second application targets an intelligent baby monitor that informs parents about changes of their baby's pose in its sleep. For the two proposed systems, we present design considerations and initial results showing the potential of camera-based movement analysis in sleep related applications outside the common interest.", "paper_title": "Lifestyle applications from sleep research", "paper_id": "WOS:000351242100006"}
