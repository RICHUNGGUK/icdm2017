The multiplication-by-l map [l] has degree l(2), therefore the complexity to directly evaluate [l(p) is O(l(2)). For a small prime l (= 2, 3) such that the additive binary representation provides no better performance, this represents the true cost of application of scalar multiplication. If an elliptic curve admits an isogeny W of degree l then the costs of computing p(P) should in contrast be O(l) field operations. Since we then have a product expression [l] = phi phi, the existence of an l-isogeny phi on an elliptic curve yields a theoretical improvement from O(l(2)) to O(l) field operations for the evaluation of [f](P) by naive application of the defining polynomials. In this work we investigate actual improvements for small of this asymptotic complexity. For this purpose, we describe the general construction of families of curves with a suitable decomposition [l] = phi phi, and provide explicit examples of such a family of curves with simple decomposition for [3]. Finally we derive a new tripling algorithm to find complexity improvements to triplication on a curve in certain projective coordinate systems, then combine this new operation to non-adjacent forms for l-adic expansions in order to obtain an improved strategy for scalar multiplication on elliptic curves.", "paper_title": "Efficient scalar multiplication by isogeny decompositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238186800013"}
