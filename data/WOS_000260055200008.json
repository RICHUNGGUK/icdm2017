This paper discusses the design of a fuzzy alarm system regarding the intensity degradation of ROSETTA's laser gyroscopes. The fuzzy alarm system proposed makes use of a novel fuzzy inference scheme, incorporating the technique of Choquet integration. This research work was done in the scope of an ESA project, as a proof-of-concept for a new fuzzy inference scheme.", "paper_title": "FUZZY ALARM SYSTEM FOR LASER GYROSCOPES DEGRADATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000260055200008"}
