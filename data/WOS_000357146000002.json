This model accounts for the joint development of visual encoding and eye control. Sparse coding models encode the incoming data at two different spatial resolutions and capture the statistics of the input in spatio-temporal basis functions. A reinforcement learner controls eye velocity so as to maximize a reward signal based on the efficiency of the encoding. We consider the embodiment of the approach in the iCub simulator and real robot. Motion perception and smooth pursuit control are not explicitly expressed as tasks for the robot to achieve but emerge as the result of the system's active attempt to efficiently encode its sensory inputs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is self-calibrating and robust to strong perturbations of the perception-action link. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
