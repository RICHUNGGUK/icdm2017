It is based on updateable views which provide universal mappings of stored objects onto virtual ones. The mechanism preserves fall transparency of virtual objects either for retrieval and any kind of updating. It provides foundation for three-level database architecture and correspondingly three database development roles: (1) a database programmer defines stored objects, i.e. their state and behavior; (2) a database administrator (DBA) creates views and interfaces which encapsulate stored objects and possibly limit access rights on them; (3) an application programmer or a user receives access and updating grants from DBA in the form of interfaces to views. We present a concrete solution that we are developing as a platform for grid and Web applications. The solution is supported by an intuitive methodology of schema development, determining the perspectives and responsibilities of each participant role.", "paper_title": "Three-level object-oriented database architecture based on virtual updateable views", "paper_id": "WOS:000241754200009"}
