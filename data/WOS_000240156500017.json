Their performance highly depends on the distinctive information in the biometrics. Identical twins having the closest genetics-based relationship are expected to have maximum similarity in their biometrics. Classifying identical twins is a challenging problem for some automatic biometric systems. PaImprint has been studied for personal identification for over seven years. Most of the previous research concentrates on algorithm development. In this paper, we systemically examine palmprints from the same DNA for automatic personal identification and to uncover the genetically related palmprint features. The experimental results show that the three principal lines and some portions of weak lines are genetically related features but our palms still contain rich genetically unrelated features for classifying identical twins.
