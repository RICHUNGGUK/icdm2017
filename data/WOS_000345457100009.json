We thus obtain a new characterisation of PSPACE, which raises interesting questions about the definition of space complexity for P systems. We then propose an alternative definition, where the size of the alphabet and the number of membrane labels of each P system are also taken into account. Finally we prove that, when less than a logarithmic number of membrane labels is available, moving the input objects around the membrane structure without rewriting them is not enough to even distinguish inputs of the same length.", "paper_title": "Constant-Space P Systems with Active Membranes", "paper_id": "WOS:000345457100009"}
