It consists in finding the path with the lowest accumulated cost between two locations in a raster model of a cost surface, which results in a string-like, thin and long sequence of cells. In this article, a new extension of raster-based least-cost path modelling is proposed. The new modelling approach allows the computation of paths or corridors with a fixed width, larger than one cell. These swaths are called wide paths and may be useful in circumstances where the detail level of the raster cost surfaces is higher than the width of the desired path or corridor. The wide path model presented in the article is independent of the choice of least-cost algorithms, because the transformation from regular to wide paths is applied to the construction of nodes and edges of an induced graph. The article gives the foundations and discusses the particularities of such paths, regardless of the imposed width, and explores the difference from the usual least-cost path model. Test cases were included, one hypothetical and the other with real data. The results are coherent and indicative of the applicability of wide paths.", "paper_title": "An extension of GIS-based least-cost path modelling to the location of wide paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000278668800002"}
