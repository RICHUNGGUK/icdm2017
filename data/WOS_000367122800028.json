However, these are two conflicting objectives when the image is processed by histogram equalization approaches. Current available methods may not provide results simultaneously satisfying both requirements. In this work, a pipe-lined approach including color channel stretching, histogram averaging and re-mapping is developed. By using stretching, color information from a scene is restored. Averaging against a uniform distribution enables the output image to recover the information lost. Furthermore, histogram re-mapping reduces artifacts that often arise from the equalization procedure. The technique also employs a search process to find optimal algorithmic parameters, such that the mean brightness difference between the input and output images is minimized. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested with a set of images captured in adverse environments and compared against available methods. High performing qualitative and quantitative results were obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
