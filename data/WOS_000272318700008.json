Furthermore, multicast communication is a key technology for wireless mesh networks. Multicast provides efficient data distribution among a group of nodes. However, unlike other wireless networks, such as sensor networks and MANETs, where multicast algorithms are designed to be energy efficient and to achieve optimal route discovery among mobile nodes, wireless mesh networks need to maximize throughput. This paper proposes two multicast algorithms: the Level Channel Assignment (LCA) algorithm and the Multichannel Multicast (MCM) to improve the throughput for multichannel and multi-interface mesh networks. The algorithms build efficient multicast trees by minimizing the number of relay nodes and total hop count distances of the trees. The algorithms use dedicated channel assignment strategies to reduce the interference to improve the network capacity. We also demonstrate that using partially overlapping channels can further diminish the interference. Furthermore, additional interfaces help to increase the bandwidth, and multiple gateways can further shorten the total hop count distance. Simulations show that those algorithms greatly outperform the single-channel multicast algorithm. We also observe that MCM achieves better throughput and shorter delay while LCA can be realized in distributed manner.", "paper_title": "Efficient Multicast Algorithms for Multichannel Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000272318700008"}
