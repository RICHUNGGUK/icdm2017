Attributes Impact on combination values by yielding sets with fewer objects (such as one or two objects), which increases both the lower and upper approximations. It also increases the decision rules, and degrades the precision of decisions. Our approach redefines the value set of attributes through expert knowledge by reducing the independent data set and reclassifying it. This approach is based on an empirical study. The results demonstrate that the redefined combination values of attributes can contribute to the precision of decisions in insurance marketing. Following an empirical analysis, we use a hit test that incorporates 50 validated sample data into the decision rule so that the hit rate reaches 100%. The results of the empirical study indicate that the generated decision rules can cover all new data. Consequently, we believe that the effects of attributes on combination values can be fully applied in research into insurance marketing. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
