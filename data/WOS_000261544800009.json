For this model, the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of its parameters, as well as the corresponding observed Fisher Information Matrix, are derived. The likelihood equations do not lead to closed-form expressions for the MLE, and they need to be solved by using an iterative procedure, such as the Newton-Raphson method. We also present a simplified estimator, which is easier to compute, and hence is suitable to use as an initial estimate in the iterative process for the determination of the MLE. We then evaluate the bias, and mean square error of these estimates; and provide asymptotic, and bootstrap confidence intervals for the parameters of the Weibull simple step-stress model. Finally, the results are illustrated with some examples.", "paper_title": "Inference for a Simple Step-Stress Model With Type-II Censoring, and Weibull Distributed Lifetimes", "paper_id": "WOS:000261544800009"}
