To examine the influence of different approaches on simulated results, comparisons between material point simulation based on Taylor model and that based on elastic plastic self consistent (EPSC) model are conducted. Furthermore, comparisons between CPFEM based on single crystal scheme and that based on polycrystal scheme are also carried out. In addition, all the formulations are validated by comparing the predicted textures with experimental results during uniaxial compression for AZ31 magnesium alloy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
