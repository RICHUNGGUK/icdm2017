However, aspect-oriented code generation from models is an area that is currently underdeveloped. Objective: In this study we provide a survey of existing research on aspect-oriented modeling and code generation to discover current work and identify needs for future research. Method: A systematic mapping study was performed to find relevant studies. Classification schemes have been defined and the 65 selected primary studies have been classified on the basis of research focus, contribution type and research type. Results: The papers of solution proposal research type are in a majority. All together aspect-oriented modeling appears being the most focused area divided into modeling notations and process (36%) and model composition and interaction management (26%). The majority of contributions are methods. Conclusion: Aspect-oriented modeling and composition mechanisms have been significantly discussed in existing literature while more research is needed in the area of model-driven code generation. Furthermore, we have observed that previous research has frequently focused on proposing solutions and thus there is need for research that validates and evaluates the existing proposals in order to provide firm foundations for aspect-oriented model-driven code generation.
