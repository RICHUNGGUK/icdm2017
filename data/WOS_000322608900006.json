Design/methodology/approach - The residual based error estimator used in this paper verifies the mathematical property of global and local error estimation (reliability and efficiency). Findings - This estimator used is based on the evaluation of quantities weakly verified in the case of harmonic A-phi formulation. Originality/value - In this paper, it is shown that the proposed estimator, based on the mathematical developments, is hardness in the case of the typical applications.", "paper_title": "A posteriori error estimator for harmonic A-phi formulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000322608900006"}
