However, it has been reported that PMA involves repeat evaluations of probabilistic constraints therefore it is prohibitively expensive for many large-scale applications. In order to overcome these disadvantages, the purpose of this paper is to propose an efficient PMA-based reliability analysis technique using radial basis function (RBF). Design/methodology/approach - The RBF is adopted to approximate the implicit limit state functions in combination with latin hypercube sampling (LHS) strategy. The advanced mean value method is applied to obtain the most probable point (MPP) with the prescribed target reliability and corresponding probabilistic performance measure to improve analysis accuracy. A sequential framework is proposed to relocate the sampling center to the obtained MPP and reconstruct RBF until a criteria is satisfied. Findings - The method is shown to be better in the computation time to the PMA based on the actual model. The analysis results of probabilistic performance measure are accurately close to the reference solution. Five numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Originality/value - The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new reliability analysis technique using reconstructed RBF approximate model. The originalities of this paper may lie in: investigating the PMA using metamodel techniques, using RBF instead of the other types of metamodels to deal with the low efficiency problem.", "paper_title": "An efficient PMA-based reliability analysis technique using radial basis function", "paper_id": "WOS:000341732900004"}
