Recent developments with MRI analysis of structural connectivity, anatomical brain segmentation, cortical surface parcellation, and functional imaging have yielded fantastic advances in our ability to probe the neurological structure-function relationship in vivo. To date, the image analysis efforts in each of these areas have typically focused on a single modality. Here, we extend the cortical reconstruction using implicit surface evolution (CRUISE) methodology to perform efficient, consistent, and topologically correct analyses in a natively multi-parametric manner. This effort combines and extends state-of-the-art techniques to simultaneously consider and analyze structural and diffusion information alongside quantitative and functional imaging data. Robust and consistent estimates of the cortical surface extraction, cortical labeling, diffusion-inferred contrasts, diffusion tractography, and subcortical parcellation are demonstrated in a scan-rescan paradigm. Accompanying this demonstration, we present a fully automated software system complete with validation data.", "paper_title": "System for Integrated Neuroimaging Analysis and Processing of Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000313065000008"}
