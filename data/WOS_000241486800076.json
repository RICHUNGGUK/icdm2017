SWD belongs to a group of interest-point-like operators aiming at detecting repeatedly distinguished entities regardless of their semantics. The speed and the robustness of landmark detection and the precision of landmark localization are main issues. The target landmarks are blobs which correspond to local maxima/minima of intensity (positive and negative peaks). The detector is based on the phase of the first harmonic wave in the moving window. The localization is a result of an integral transformation rather than a derivative. Thus, the blob detector is inherently robust to noise. The SWD provides subpixel localization of blobs together with the estimate of its precision, the measure of the strength/significance and the estimate of the size/scale for each blob.", "paper_title": "Stable Wave Detector of blobs in images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241486800076"}
