The goal is to provide an effective computational tool for the optimization of a large-scale transit route network to minimize transfers with reasonable route directness while maximizing service coverage. The methodology includes representation of transit route network solution search spaces, representation of transit route and network constraints, and a stochastic search scheme based on an integrated simulated annealing and genetic algorithm solution search method. The methodology has been implemented as a computer program, tested using previously published results, and applied to a large-scale realistic network optimization problem.", "paper_title": "Simulated annealing-genetic algorithm for transit network optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000234190700006"}
