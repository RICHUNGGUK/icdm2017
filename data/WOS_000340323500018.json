This paper introduces the characteristic model-based modeling method into ATC system and develops an all-coefficient adaptive control. Two characteristic models, namely speed characteristic model and position characteristic model, are established for analyzing both train traction and cruising dynamical characteristics. Control strategies are proposed using single speed feedback and speed/position hi-feedback. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, showing that control objective and required dynamic performance are well satisfied. Moreover, the system shows robustness against time-varying model uncertainties and unknown operational environment dynamics.", "paper_title": "Characteristic model-based all-coefficient adaptive control for automatic train control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340323500018"}
