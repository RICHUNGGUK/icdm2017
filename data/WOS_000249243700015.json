But in traditional relevance feedback methods, both relevant and non-relevant assigned information were required for the retrieval system. For the sake of practicality and convenience, this paper assumes that users only need to label the images from the previous query as relevant, which generates a new vector as feedback information. Through the feature space transformation, it is an adjustment in the spatial resolution of the feature space. The spatial resolution around relevant samples is contracted. Meanwhile, the analysis of the user's intention together with relevant forecast of the interested objects in the database make it possible for the less similar vectors to get closer to the query vector and thus increasing query precision. In this paper, a prototype system is introduced of an image database and experimental illustration to 51,138 image files. Compared with the traditional relevance feedback approach, our method is shown to obviously improve the retrieval feedback performance.", "paper_title": "Incorporate feature space transformation to content-based image retrieval with relevance feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243700015"}
