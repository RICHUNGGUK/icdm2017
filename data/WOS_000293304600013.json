We also give an approach to construct similarity measures using entropy measures for interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. In particular, the proposed entropy measure for interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets can yield a similarity measure. Several illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed formulas. We apply the similarity measure to solve problems on pattern recognitions, multi-criteria fuzzy decision making and medical diagnosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
