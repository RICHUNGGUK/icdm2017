At these bands, the adjacent satellite interference problem, which is especially pronounced for mobile terminals, is further aggravated by propagation effects, predominantly rain attenuation. The statistical characterization of the resulting CNIR is of paramount importance in the design of new broadband systems based on digital video broadcasting via satellite 2 extension (DVB-S2x). The statistical derivations are validated by using a CNIR time-series synthesizer developed based on the theory of stochastic differential equations.", "paper_title": "Statistical Characterization of Adjacent Satellite Interference for Earth Stations on Mobile Platforms Operating at Ku and Ka Bands", "paper_id": "WOS:000373738600021"}
