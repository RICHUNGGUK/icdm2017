As an important problem of information retrieval in wireless networks, data retrieval arises in many applications such as e-commerce and ubiquitous data sharing. During data retrieval conflicts arise for channel switching when the requested data items are broadcast in the same time slot or adjacent time slots across two channels, which we call 2-slot conflict as they occur in two continuous time slots. Although various solutions are proposed for resolving single (same) slot conflicts, little work is known for resolving 2-slot conflicts. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for solving the data retrieval problem under 2-slot conflicts in single antenna and multiple antennae respectively. Our algorithm adopts a novel approach to convert a wireless data broadcast system into a DAG, and applies the greedy set cover algorithm to solve this problem. We have validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm through implementation in a simulation environment, and show that our algorithm outperforms the known methods.", "paper_title": "Efficient Data Retrieval Algorithms for Avoiding 2-Slot Conflicts in Wireless Data Broadcast", "paper_id": "WOS:000364500200015"}
