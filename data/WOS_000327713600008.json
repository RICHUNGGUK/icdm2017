The method is based on the introduction of collaborative interactions and flexibility clauses in contracts between all the DC ecosystem entities. The included entities are all the actors along the energy production-consumption chain, from the energy provider to the Information Technology customer. The collaborative approach also integrates the interaction between federated DCs. In this paper, we find a detailed description of the architecture that enables interaction between the DC ecosystem parties, which is designed to be progressively deployed, allowing traditional and 'greened' services to coexist, and without modification of the existing DC automation and framework systems.", "paper_title": "A Novel Collaboration Paradigm for Reducing Energy Consumption and Carbon Dioxide Emissions in Data Centres", "paper_id": "WOS:000327713600008"}
