The weighted sum of entropies of the multi-reaches is adopted to construct the Lyapunov function. The time derivative of the Lyapunov function is expressed by the water depth variations at the gate boundaries, based on which a class of boundary feedback controllers is presented to guarantee the local asymptotic closed-loop stability. The advantage of this approach is that only the water level depths at the gate boundaries are measured as the feedback.", "paper_title": "Lyapunov-based boundary feedback control in multi-reach canals", "paper_id": "WOS:000268192800010"}
