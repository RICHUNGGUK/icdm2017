By transforming the stochastic system into an interconnected system with different structure case, the state feedback H. control problem is studied by using the almost disturbance decoupling technique, or gamma-dissipative theory. The H-infinity, controller is designed directly by solving a Lyapunov-like inequality or Stochastic Lur'e equations instead of HJIs.", "paper_title": "H-infinity CONTROLLER DESIGN FOR A CLASS OF SISO NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS WITHOUT SOLVING HJIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271918900019"}
