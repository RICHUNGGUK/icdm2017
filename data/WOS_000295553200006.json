Design/methodology/approach - A computer-aided telephone survey was conducted to collect data to validate the proposed model in rural Australia. Findings - It was found that relative advantage, utility outcomes, and facilitating conditions play a crucial role in explaining broadband adoption behavior amongst rural Australian households. Practical implications - The key challenges to stakeholders involved in promoting broadband adoption in these settings are discussed in light of the findings. Originality/value - A more realistic approach at household level was adapted to investigate broadband adoption in a rural setting. The theoretical framework offers a comprehensive view of broadband adoption applicable to rural Australia.", "paper_title": "Understanding broadband adoption in rural Australia", "paper_id": "WOS:000295553200006"}
