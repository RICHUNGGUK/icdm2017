TSEILL has three temporal modal operators: [F] (any time in the future), [N] (next time) and [P] (past), some spatial modal operators [l(i)] (locations), two epistemic modal operators; [K] (know) and (K), and a linear modal operator ! (exponential). A basic normal modal intuitionistic affine logic (BIAL) and its normal extensions are also defined, and the completeness theorems for these logics are proved with respect to Kripke semantics. In the proposed semantic framework of these normal extensions, a simple correspondence can be given between frame conditions and Lemmon-Scott axioms. A dynamic intuitionistic affine logic (DIAL) is proposed as an affine version of (test-free) dynamic logic, and the completeness theorem for this logic is shown with respect to Kripke semantics. Finally, some intuitive interpretations, such as resource and informational interpretations, are given for the proposed logics and semantics. By using these logics, semantics and interpretations, various kinds of fine-grained resource-sensitive reasoning can be expressed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
