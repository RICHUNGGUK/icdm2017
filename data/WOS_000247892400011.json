Coding schemes using soft-decision decoded binary convolutional codes or turbo codes are considered, both with or without bit-interleaving. Performances of several soft metrics are examined for each coding scheme. It is shown that when multiple access interference is the main source of errors, the product metric offers the best performance among the soft metrics considered for all coding schemes. Furthermore, the application of soft-decision decoded convolutional codes or turbo codes without bit-interleaving is shown to allow for a much larger number of simultaneously transmitting users than hard-decision decoded Reed-Solomon codes. Finally, it is observed that when soft-decision decoding techniques are employed, synchronous networks attain better performance than asynchronous networks.", "paper_title": "Soft-decislon decoding in asynchronous FH/SSMA networks using MFSK modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000247892400011"}
