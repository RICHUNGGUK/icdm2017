For the selection of the best variables the Elimination Selection-Stepwise Regression Method (ES-SWR) is utilized. The predictive ability of the model is evaluated against a set of 13 compounds. Based on the produced QSAR model and an analysis on the domain of its applicability, the effects of various structural modifications on biological activity are investigated. The study leads to a number of guanidine derivatives with significantly improved predicted activities.", "paper_title": "Investigation of substituent effect of 1-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-piperidinyl phenylacetamides on CCR5 binding affinity using QSAR and virtual screening techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000238342700002"}
