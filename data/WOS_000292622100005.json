We investigate the connections of the aforementioned distance measures and further develop a number of hesitant ordered weighted distance measures and hesitant ordered weighted similarity measures. They can alleviate the influence of unduly large (or small) deviations on the aggregation results by assigning them low (or high) weights. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate these distance and similarity measures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
