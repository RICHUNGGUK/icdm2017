It can be operated on a basic low-end microcontroller and does not require any data tables. Also, it does not have the limitation of the motor having to start from standstill. The algorithm was tested using a small robot programmed to move and change acceleration 'on the run'. The theoretical foundations for further improving the timing accuracy of the algorithm were also derived. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
