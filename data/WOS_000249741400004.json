In this paper, we formalize a set-theoretic model for computing such a similarity measure. Roughly speaking, in this model we have k > 1 partitions (clusters) of the same data set each containing the same number of sets and the goal is to align the sets in each partition to minimize a similarity measure. For k = 2, a polynomial-time solution was proposed by Gusfield (Information Processing Letters 82 (2002) 159-164). In this paper, we show that the problem is MAX-SNP-hard for k = 3 even if each partition in each cluster contains no more than 2 elements and provide a 2-2/k-approximation algorithm for the problem for any k.
