Sufficient conditions are given ensuring that all automorphisms of a Goppa code are inherited from the automorphism group of the curve. In some cases, these conditions are also necessary. The cases of curves with large automorphism groups, notably the Hermitian and the Deligne-Lusztig curves, are investigated in detail.", "paper_title": "On automorphism groups of certain Goppa codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000253199200015"}
