BSS algorithms have been developed based on an assumption that all sources have non-Gaussian distributions. Most of the instances, these algorithms separate speech signals with super-Gaussian distributions. However, in real world examples there exist speech signals which are sub-Gaussian. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to measure the separation qualities of both super-Gaussian and sub-Gaussian distributions. This study measures the impact of the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) of the signals on the outcomes of both sub and super-Gaussian distributions. This paper also reports the study of impact of mixing environment on the source separation. Simulation improves the results of the separated sources by 7 dB to 8 dB, and also confirms that the separated sources always have super-Gaussian characteristics irrespective of PDF of the signa ls or mixtures.", "paper_title": "Measure of Quality of Source Separation for Sub- and Super-Gaussian Audio Mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000314001900005"}
