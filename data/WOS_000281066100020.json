Li, High order central scheme on overlapping cells for magneto-hydrodynamic flows with and without constrained transport method, J. Comput. Phys. 227 (2008) 7368-7393] to the fourth-order. Central finite-volume schemes on overlapping grid are used for both the volume-averaged variables and the face-averaged magnetic field. The magnetic field at the cell boundaries falls within the dual grid and is naturally continuous so that our method eliminates the instability triggered by the discontinuity in the normal component of the magnetic field. Our fourth-order scheme has much smaller numerical dissipation than the third-order scheme. The divergence-free condition of the magnetic field is preserved by our fourth-order divergence-free reconstruction and the constrained transport method. Numerical examples show that the divergence-free condition is essential to the accuracy of the method when a limiter is used in the reconstruction. The high-order, low-dissipation, and divergence-free properties of this method make it an ideal tool for direct magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence simulations.
