It is shown that, similarly to the standard 1-D case, this lemma can be studied through the lens of S-procedure. Furthermore, by virtue of this lemma, we will examine robust stability, bounded and positive realness of multidimensional systems.", "paper_title": "On the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma and the multidimensional models", "paper_id": "WOS:000259819500011"}
