Drawing on institutional theory, we examined how different institutional forces experienced by retailer's suppliers were related to their relational investment on inter-organizational information sharing. Data collected from 130 major Taiwanese suppliers was used in our empirical analyses. We found that relational investment was the most critical adoption factor, which also indirectly enhanced organizational readiness for technological adoption intention. From a Taiwanese perspective, our findings should be helpful in understanding what factors significantly impact the adoption of RFID technology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
