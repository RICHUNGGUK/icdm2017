The alpha-plane of a VO defines its shape at a given instance in time and hence determines the boundary of its texture. In packet-based networks, shape, motion, and texture are subject to loss. While there has been considerable attention paid to the concealment of texture and motion errors, little has been done in the field of shape error concealment. In this paper we propose a post-processing shape error concealment technique that uses the motion compensated boundary information of the previously received a-plane. The proposed approach is based on matching received boundary segments in the current frame to the boundary in the previous frame. This matching is achieved by finding a maximally smooth motion vector field. After the current boundary segments are matched to the previous boundary, the missing boundary pieces are reconstructed by motion compensation. Experimental results demonstrating the performance of the proposed motion compensated shape error concealment method, and comparing it with the previously proposed weighted side matching method [1] are presented.", "paper_title": "Motion compensated shape error concealment", "paper_id": "WOS:000234761400024"}
