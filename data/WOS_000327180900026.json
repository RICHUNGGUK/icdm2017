Despite the efforts of public and private consortiums on creating a standardized electrocardiogram (ECG) storage format, there is still not a single one. Indeed, there is also the necessity of access to raw data of the ECGs previously acquired. Most of these documents have been saved as Adobe PDF files, since for medical staff it is an easy format for later visualization. However, this format presents difficulties when trying to access original raw data for subsequent studies and signal analysis. In this manner, this paper presents an application that obtains plain numerical data from ECG files stored with PDF format. Data can also be exported to one of the most common file formats in existence, to be easily accessed thereafter. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
