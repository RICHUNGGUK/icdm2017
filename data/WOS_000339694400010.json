In recent years, the advances in information technologies have led to more complex road safety applications able to cope with a high variety of situations. These applications have strong sensing requirements that a single sensor, with the available technology, cannot attain. Recent researches in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) try to overcome the limitations of the sensors by combining them. But not only sensor information is crucial to give a good and robust representation of the road environment; context information has a key role for reliable safety applications to provide reliable detection and complete situation assessment. This paper presents a novel approach for pedestrian detection using sensor fusion of laser scanner and computer vision. The application also takes advantage of context information, providing danger estimation for the pedestrians detected. Closing the loop, the danger estimation is later used, together with context information, as feedback to enhance the pedestrian detection process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
