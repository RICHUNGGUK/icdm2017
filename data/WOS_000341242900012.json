The quality of hardware binding affects the area-time efficiency of a design. The goal of a synthesis process is to produce a design which meets the area-time requirements. In this paper, we present a new hardware binding algorithm with focus on area reduction. It is called extended compatibility path-based (ECPB) hardware binding and extends the compatibility path-based (CPB) hardware binding method by exploiting inter-operation flow dependencies, non-overlapping lifetimes of variables and modifying the weight relation in order to make it application aware and thus adaptive in nature. The presented methodology also takes into account bit width of functional units (FUs) and multi mode FUs. It performs simultaneous FU and register binding. Implemented within a C to register transfer level (RTL) framework, it produces binding results which are better than those produced by weighted bipartite matching (WBM) and CPB algorithms. The use of ECPB algorithm results in an average reduction of 34% and 17.44% in area-time product over WBM and CPB methods, respectively.", "paper_title": "EXTENDED COMPATIBILITY PATH BASED HARDWARE BINDING: AN ADAPTIVE ALGORITHM FOR HIGH LEVEL SYNTHESIS OF AREA-TIME EFFICIENT DESIGNS", "paper_id": "WOS:000341242900012"}
