In the Java context, the Java Modelling Language (JML) has been proposed as specification language. It can be used both for verification and test. Usually, the JML specification is designed with a specific purpose: test or verification. This article addresses the question of reusability of a JML specification provided for one activity (resp. verification or test) in the other context (resp. test or verification). Two different case studies are considered.", "paper_title": "Reusing a JML Specification Dedicated to Verification for Testing, and Vice-Versa: Case Studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000284665000005"}
