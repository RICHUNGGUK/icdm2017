It is shown that under some natural conditions the solution of the interpolation problem exists and is unique. Furthermore, it is given in a simple closed form which makes it attractive for practical applications. Asymptotic analysis confirms the expected approximation order, i.e., order six. Numerical examples pave the way for a promising nonlinear geometric subdivision scheme. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
