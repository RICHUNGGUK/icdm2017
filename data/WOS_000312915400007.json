However, it suffers from premature convergence because of quick losing of diversity. In order to enhance its performance, this paper proposes a hybrid PSO algorithm, called DNSPSO, which employs a diversity enhancing mechanism and neighborhood search strategies to achieve a trade-off between exploration and exploitation abilities. A comprehensive experimental study is conducted on a set of benchmark functions, including rotated multimodal and shifted high-dimensional problems. Comparison results show that DNSPSO obtains a promising performance on the majority of the test problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
