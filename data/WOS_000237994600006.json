Due to the limited power, slow processor, and less memory in each device, routing protocols of sensor networks must be designed carefully. Recently, a data-centric scheme called directed diffusion has been proposed to provide efficient data transmission over sensor networks. In this paper, we enhance this scheme by a hierarchical data aggregation technique (HDA). Experiments demonstrate that our enhanced scheme can save transmission energy up to 50% over directed diffusion, without any reliability or delivery efficiency being compromised. At the same time, our scheme can facilitate greater data-level aggregation in data-centric routing. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
