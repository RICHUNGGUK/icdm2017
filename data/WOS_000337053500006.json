We discuss the motion control requirements to accomplish trajectory tracking and other tasks, such as singular configuration avoidance and obstacle avoidance, for the snake robot. The features of the internal motion caused by kinematic redundancy are considered, and a kinematic model and a dynamic model of the snake robot are derived by introducing two types of shape controllable point. The first is the head shape controllable point, and the other is the base shape controllable point. We analyzed the features of the two kinds of shape controllable point and proposed a controller to accomplish the trajectory tracking of the robot's head as its main task along with several sub-tasks by using redundancy. The proposed method to accomplish several sub-tasks is useful for both the kinematic model and the dynamic model. Experimental results using a head raising snake robot which can control the angular velocity of its joints show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Control of Head Raising Snake Robots by Using Kinematic Redundancy", "paper_id": "WOS:000337053500006"}
