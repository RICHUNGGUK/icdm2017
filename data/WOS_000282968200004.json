One of these tasks is the proper management of documents. Documents are a key element of any democratic administration and their digital management is a clear pre-requisite for the arrival of digital government. This article tackles how this service can be provided using the support of semantics as a technological cornerstone. The implementation of such a tool is made through the so-called cPortfolio. This platform is deeply discussed and details about its design and implementation are provided. This system is designed to manage both the personal information from the citizen and the documents they possess. Tests on the prototype showed interesting features regarding the simplicity of use and the interoperability support provided to third party agents.", "paper_title": "Managing Citizen Profiles in the Domain of e-Government: The cPortfolio Project", "paper_id": "WOS:000282968200004"}
