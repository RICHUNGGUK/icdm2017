Thus, using various effects can make the presentation of a PowerPoint file more colorful and attractive. In this paper, we propose a steganographic method to embed message in a PowerPoint file via various effects. In contrast to other steganographic methods, we not only hide message naturally but also keep the content of the cover media intact. Furthermore, the proposed method can resist the format conversion attack. The experiment result demonstrates that the proposed method is undetectable under some visual and statistical attacks.", "paper_title": "A steganographic method via various animations in PowerPoint files", "paper_id": "WOS:000349356400016"}
