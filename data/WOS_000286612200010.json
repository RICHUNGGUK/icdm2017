It has been used to model real ecosystems in a comprehensible, modular and probabilistic way. However, simulators are needed for virtual experimentation. Hence, the development of correct simulation algorithms becomes a critical point. In this paper we present a formal verification of a new algorithm of simulation designed for this kind of probabilistic P systems.", "paper_title": "A SIMULATION ALGORITHM FOR MULTIENVIRONMENT PROBABILISTIC P SYSTEMS: A FORMAL VERIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200010"}
