The fluid domain is modeled through the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, while the immersed boundary method is used to account for the position of the organisms idealized as rigid bodies. The time discontinuous Galerkin method is employed to compute body motion. An explicit coupling strategy to combine the adopted numerical methods is proposed. The vertical take-off of a couple of butteries is numerically simulated in different scenarios, showing the mutual interaction that a buttery exerts on the other one. Moreover, the effect of lateral wind is investigated. A critical threshold value of the lateral wind is defined, thus corresponding to an increasing arduous take-off.", "paper_title": "Lattice Boltzmann simulations of flapping wings: The flock effect and the lateral wind effect", "paper_id": "WOS:000340603000007"}
