Most existing models are not web based, limited by the accessibility for real-world applications. A CyberGIS-enabled biomass supply chain decision support platform was developed to improve model accessibility and computational performance. The platform includes four major components: BioScope optimization model, GISolve middleware, high-performance cyberinfrastructure, and an interactive web interface. The workflow and functions of each component are provided to illustrate the development and usage of the platform. Case studies and associated system performance have been evaluated to demonstrate the utility of the CyberGIS-enabled decision support platform. Through leveraging cyberinfrastructure resources and interactive web-based interface, the platform enables solving complex biomass supply chain optimization problems. The improved computational performance could provide responsive decision support for group-based applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
