Analysing these measurements is a time-consuming task for the diagnosing clinician. A decision-support system in this area would reduce the analysis task of the clinician and enable him/her to give more attention to the patient. We have created a decision-support system which contains a signal classifier and a pattern identifier. The system performs an analysis of the physiological time series concerned which would otherwise be performed manually by the clinician. Methods: The signal-classifier, HR3Modul, classifies heart-rate patterns by analysing both cardio- and pulmonary signals, i.e., physiological time series. HR3Modul uses case-based reasoning (CBR), using a wavelet-based method for retrieving features from the signals. The system searches for familiar shapes in the signals by comparing them with shapes already stored. We have applied a best fit scheme for handling signals of different lengths, as the length of a breath is highly dynamic. We also apply automatic weighting to the features to obtain a more autonomous system. The classified heart signals indicate if a patient may be suffering from a stress-related disorder and the nature of the disorder. These classified signals are thereafter sent to the second subsystem, the pattern-identifier. The pattern-identifier analyses the classified signals and searches for familiar patterns by identifying sequences in the classified signals. The identified sequences give clinicians a more complete analysis of the measurements, providing them with a better basis for diagnosis. Results and conclusion: We have shown that a case-based classifier with a wavelet feature extractor and automatic weighting is a viable option for building a decision-support system for the psychophysiological domain, as it is at par, or even outperforms other retrieval techniques and is less complex.
