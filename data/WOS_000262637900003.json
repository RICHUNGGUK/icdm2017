It is argued that using extant theory to develop testable models of health information technology (HIT) benefits both research and practice. Methods and procedures: several theories of motivation, decision making, and technology acceptance are reviewed and associated theory-based principles of HIT usage behaviour are produced. Main outcomes and results: the case of medical error reporting technology is used to support the validity of the proposed HIT usage behaviour principles. Further, combining these principles produces a testable, theoretical multilevel model of HIT usage behaviour. The model provides an alternative to atheoretical research and practice related to HIT. Conclusions: developing, testing, and revising models of HIT like the one presented here is suggested to be beneficial to researchers and practitioners alike.", "paper_title": "A theoretical model of health information technology usage behaviour with implications for patient safety", "paper_id": "WOS:000262637900003"}
