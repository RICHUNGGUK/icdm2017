For each gene, within the QTL region, M2S uses data integration technology to integrate putative gene function with associated gene ontology terms, proteins, pathways and literature. As a typical QTL region easily contains several hundreds of genes, this gene list can then be further filtered using a keyword-based query on the aggregated annotations. M2S will help breeders to identify potential candidate genes for their traits of interest.", "paper_title": "Marker2sequence, mine your QTL regions for candidate genes", "paper_id": "WOS:000306136100018"}
