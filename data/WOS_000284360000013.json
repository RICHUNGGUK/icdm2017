The question to be answered in this research is whether or not ridge depth information improves the quality and matching capability of acquired fingerprints? For evaluation of this question, we use the National Institute of Standards and Technology fingerprint image quality metrics. These metrics require the 3-D prints to be flattened. We present a complete and detailed flattening algorithm based upon unfolding an elastic tube fit to the peaks and valleys of ridges identified within the scan. Further improvement of the flattened print is achieved through the incorporation of ridge information extracted from the albedo image with the depth and albedo ridge information fused together according to local scan quality. Our study compares image quality between the flattened 3-D prints and ink rolled prints. Most significantly, the matching performance of 3-D flattened to 3-D flattened prints is evaluated based on ridge depth only, albedo only, and depth with albedo fusion.", "paper_title": "Data Acquisition and Processing of 3-D Fingerprints", "paper_id": "WOS:000284360000013"}
