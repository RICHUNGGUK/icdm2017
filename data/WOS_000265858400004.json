The introduced analysis allows for a differentiation between the source of the message and the intermediate nodes (in terms of e.g. transmission power, speed or cooperation degree). Analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the delivery delay and the induced overhead are extracted, taking into account the fact that the source node may continue spreading copies after the message delivery. In addition, a fairly accurate approximate expression for the cdf of the delivery delay is also derived and validated through simulations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
