The first part finds out the optimum network size of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) using the Orthogonal Least Squares Regression algorithm. This judges the size of the PNN, with an effort to reduce the computation. The feature extraction to model the PNN is made meaningful using dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), which is nearly shift invariant analytical wavelet transform, giving a true representation of the input space. In the second part, preprocessing using principal component analysis is suggested as an effective way to further reduce the dimension of the feature set and size of the PNN without compromising the performance. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy show that the vibration signatures capture the fault more effectively (especially by the axial and radial ones), under varying supply-frequency and load conditions. A comparison with traditional discrete wavelet transform proves the applicability of the proposed scheme. A comparative evaluation with feedforward neural network and naive Bayes scheme brings out the advantage of the proposed optimized DTCWT-PNN based technique over other machine learning approaches.", "paper_title": "Vibration Analysis Based Interturn Fault Diagnosis in Induction Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600033"}
