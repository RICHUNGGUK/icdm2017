AXML is considered a distributed XML DBMS which extends the capability of XML by embedding intensional XML data inside XML documents. The management of intensional XML and XML data together in XML documents raises issues such as representation for intensional XML data, AXML-XML data exchange and AXML data query processing. This paper will study these issues, comparing as well as discussing the current solutions to AXML systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
