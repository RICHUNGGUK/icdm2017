Since the performance of a multicast mechanism is constrained in a wireless setting due to the interference among local wireless transmissions, the interference relationships are first characterized by introducing a graph transformation method. Based on the graph transformation, the multicast scheduling problem is converted to the graph coloring problem, and then a capacity greedy algorithm is designed to provide concurrent transmission scheduling so that the demanded multicast transmission rate can be achieved. Moreover, the necessary and sufficient conditions of multicast schedulable feasibility are derived. Through corresponding simulations, it is shown that the proposed strategy can enhance the throughput of wireless multi-hop multicast systems significantly.", "paper_title": "An effective scheduling scheme for multi-hop multicast in wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292503700011"}
