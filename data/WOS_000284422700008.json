However, previous works focus on finding the movement patterns of each single object or all objects. In this paper, we first propose an efficient distributed mining algorithm to jointly identify a group of moving objects and discover their movement patterns in wireless sensor networks. Afterward, we propose a compression algorithm, called 2P2D, which exploits the obtained group movement patterns to reduce the amount of delivered data. The compression algorithm includes a sequence merge and an entropy reduction phases. In the sequence merge phase, we propose a Merge algorithm to merge and compress the location data of a group of moving objects. In the entropy reduction phase, we formulate a Hit Item Replacement (HIR) problem and propose a Replace algorithm that obtains the optimal solution. Moreover, we devise three replacement rules and derive the maximum compression ratio. The experimental results show that the proposed compression algorithm leverages the group movement patterns to reduce the amount of delivered data effectively and efficiently.", "paper_title": "Exploring Application-Level Semantics for Data Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000284422700008"}
