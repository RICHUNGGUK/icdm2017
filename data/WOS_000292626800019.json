In this paper, we implement a parallel classification scheme inspired by the insect brain in, two popular parallel computing frameworks, namely as an NVidia (R) CUDA (TM) implementation on a Tesla (TM) device and a brute force OpenMP (TM) parallel implementation on a quad-core CPU. When evaluating the systems on the MNIST data-set of handwritten digits, we can report that, compared with a standard serial implementation on a single CPU core, CUDA (TM) implementations of the bio-inspired classification provide a 7-to-11 fold speed-up, whereas the OpenMP (TM) implementation is 2-to-.4 times faster. Our results are a proof of concept that suggests that modern parallel computing architectures and bio-mimetic algorithms are compatible and that the CUDA (TM) solution on an NVidia Tesla (TM) C870 device at the time of writing has a small edge over an OpenMP solution on a recent quad core processor (3 GHz AMD (R) Phenom (TM) II X4 940).", "paper_title": "BIO-MIMETIC CLASSIFICATION ON MODERN PARALLEL HARDWARE: REALIZATIONS ON NVIDIAG (R) CUDA (TM)", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626800019"}
