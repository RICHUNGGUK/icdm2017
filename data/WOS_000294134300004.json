A social tagging system can be modeled with a tripartite network of users, resources, and tags. In this paper, we investigate how to enhance Web clustering by leveraging the tripartite network of social tagging systems. We propose a clustering method called \"Tripartite Clustering\" which clusters the three types of nodes (resources, users, and tags) simultaneously by only utilizing the links in the social tagging network. We also investigate two other approaches to exploit social tagging for clustering with K-means and Link K-means. All the clustering methods are experimented on a real-world social tagging data set sampled from del.icio.us. The clustering results are evaluated against a human-maintained Web directory. The experimental results show that the social tagging network is a very useful information source for document clustering. All social-annotation-based clustering methods can significantly improve the performance of content-based clustering. Compared to social-annotation-based K-means and Link K-means, Tripartite Clustering achieves equivalent or better performance and produces more useful information.", "paper_title": "Exploiting the Social Tagging Network for Web Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000294134300004"}
