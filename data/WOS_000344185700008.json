Yet, the results can lead to very interesting insights to distillation and chemical engineering thermodynamics. The present article describes how one can exploit this simple laboratory experiment to teach these various aspects of chemical engineering. In addition, several simple calculations using computer software such as Mathematica (R) are performed to explain, interpret and reproduce theoretically all the gathered experimental data during the laboratory session.(c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
