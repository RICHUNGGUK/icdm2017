The proposed method uses weighted increment transformation and weighted ratio transformation techniques to handle weighted fuzzy interpolative reasoning in sparse fuzzy rule-based systems. It allows each variable that appears in the antecedent parts of fuzzy rules to associate with a weight between zero and one. Moreover, we also propose an algorithm that automatically tunes the optimal weights of the antecedent variables appearing in the antecedent parts of fuzzy rules. We also apply the proposed weighted fuzzy interpolative reasoning method to handle the truck backer-upper control problem. The proposed weighted fuzzy interpolative reasoning method performs better than the ones obtained by the traditional fuzzy inference system (2000), Huang and Shen's method (2008), and Chen and Ko's method (2008). The proposed method provides us with a useful way to deal with weighted fuzzy interpolative reasoning in sparse fuzzy rule-based systems.", "paper_title": "Weighted Fuzzy Interpolative Reasoning Based on Weighted Increment Transformation and Weighted Ratio Transformation Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000272319000014"}
