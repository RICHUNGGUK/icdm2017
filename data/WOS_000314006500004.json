This study presents the Intelligent Biomedic Organizations (IBOs) model, an intelligent dynamic architecture for knowledge discovery in biomedical databases. It involves an organizational model specially designed to support medical personnel in their daily tasks and to establish an innovative intelligent system to make classifications and predictions with huge volumes of information. IBO is based on a multi-agent architecture with Web service integration capability. The core of the system is a type of agent that integrates a novel strategy based on a case-based planning mechanism for automatic reorganization. This agent proposes a new reasoning agent model, where the complex processes are modeled as external services. In this sense, the agents act as coordinators of Web services that implement the four stages of the case-based planning cycle. The multi-agent system has been implemented in a real scenario to classify leukemia patients, and the classification strategy includes services such as a novel ESOINN neural network and statistical methods to analyze patient data. The results obtained are presented within this paper and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed organizational model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
