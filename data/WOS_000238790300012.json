This change towards a customer-focused strategy is leading to a strong demand for CRM solutions by companies. However, in spite of companies' interest in this new management model, many CRM implementations fail. One of the main reasons for this lack of success is that the existing methodologies being used to approach a CRM project are not adequate, since they do not satisfactorily integrate and complement the strategic and technological aspects of CRM. This paper describes a formal methodology for directing the process of developing and implementing a CRM System that considers and integrates various aspects, such as defining a customer strategy, re-engineering customer-oriented business processes, human resources management, the computer system, management of change and continuous improvement.
