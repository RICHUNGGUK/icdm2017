The analysis of the published material includes examining variables such as most productive authors, citation analysis, universities associated with the most publications, geographic diversity, authors' backgrounds and research methods. The keyword analysis suggests that ISF research has evolved from establishing concepts and domain of information systems ( IS), technology and management to contemporary issues such as outsourcing, web services and security. The analysis presented in this paper has identified intellectually significant studies that have contributed to the development and accumulation of intellectual wealth of ISF. The analysis has also identified authors published in other journals whose work largely shaped and guided the researchers published in ISF. This research has implications for researchers, journal editors, and research institutions.", "paper_title": "Profiling a decade of Information Systems Frontiers' research", "paper_id": "WOS:000264181200007"}
