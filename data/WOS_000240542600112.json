With the coordination, intelligent strategies can be established to realize computing topology and to serve different purposes of computing goals. With the development of cellular phones and internet, these individualized programs exist in the digital world where a new ecosystem can be formed. These smart entities create groups and consume natural resources in the digital world. Competition and collaboration thus exists among different groups of autonomous entities. We propose a model, based on a concept called food web in ecosystem. Food web exists in natural words for minions of years and serves as a balancing algorithm among different types of species. We define the food web model for autonomous entities and propose algorithms for formation and communication. As a consequence, the proposed model can be used to consider the development of intelligent strategies and the underlying communication topology such that ubiquitous intelligences can be evolved on the digital food web.", "paper_title": "Evolution of ubi-autonomous entities", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600112"}
