It is based on the concept of total variation regularization. The original boundary (given as a closed B-spline curve or several such curves for multiply connected domains) is approximated by another curve that possesses a smaller number of curvature extrema. Consequently, the modified curve leads to a smaller number of branches of the medial axis. In order to compute the medial axis, we use the state-of-the-art algorithm from [1] which is based on arc spline approximation and a domain decomposition approach. We improve this algorithm by using a different decomposition strategy that allows to reduce the number of base cases from 13 to only 5. Moreover, the algorithm reduces the number of conic arcs in the output by approx. 50%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
