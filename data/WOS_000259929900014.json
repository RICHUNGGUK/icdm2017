Here, for these automata a Security concept is introduced. which is based on a notion of opacity and on the assumption that in attacker can not only observe public system activities, but also cause abortion of some of them. Different intruder capabilities as well as different kinds of opacity are defined and the resulting security properties are investigated. Security of long-running transactions is defined by the mentioned notion of opacity and conditions for compositionality are established.", "paper_title": "Security in a Model for Long-running Transactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000259929900014"}
