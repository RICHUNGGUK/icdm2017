The effectiveness of the tool is demonstrated through FPGA and CIVICS implementations (90 nm, 65 nm and 45 nm technologies) of the baseband processing in embedded OFDM transceivers. Compared with state-of-art FFT/IFFT IP cores, the proposed work provides macrocells with lower circuit complexity while keeping the same system performance (throughput transform size, and accuracy) and is the first addressing the requirements of all OFDM standards including MIMO systems: 802.11 WLAN, 802.16 WMAN, Digital Audio and Video Broadcasting in terrestrial, handheld and hybrid satellite-scenarios, Ultra Wide Band, Broadband on Power Lines, xDSL.
