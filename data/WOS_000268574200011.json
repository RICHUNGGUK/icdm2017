These repositories lack the ability to attain an effective and accurate search. Using semantic technologies as the key for interoperation enables searching and processing of biomedical literature in a more efficient way. However, emerging semantic applications take for granted specific knowledge that biomedical researchers may not have. This paper presents design principles for easy-to-use biomedical semantic applications by means of ontology-based annotations and faceted search. The proposed approach is backed with a usable prototype that shows the breakthroughs of adding these principles to a biomedical digital library where identifying and searching information are critical aspects for non-semantic Web experts.", "paper_title": "Knowledge management in biomedical libraries: A semantic web approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000268574200011"}
