Given a large number of available clusters, one is faced with the following questions: (a) can we obtain the same quality of results with a smaller number of clusters instead of full ensemble? (b) If so, which subset of clusters is more efficient to be used in the ensemble? In this paper, these two questions are going to be answered. We explore a clustering ensemble approach combined with a cluster stability criterion as well as a dataset simplicity criterion to discover the finest subset of base clusters for each kind of datasets. Also, a novel method is proposed in order to accumulate the selected clusters and to extract final partitioning. Although it is expected that by reducing the size of ensemble the performance decreases, our experimental results show that our selecting mechanism generally lead to superior results.", "paper_title": "To improve the quality of cluster ensembles by selecting a subset of base clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000326918800006"}
