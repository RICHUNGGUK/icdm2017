The 16-QAM near complementary sequences are constructed by nonlinear offsets. But the peak-to-mean envelope power ratio bounds for these 16-QAM near complementary sequences is as low as 2.4. The number of newly constructed 16-QAM near complementary sequences is (m!/2)4(m+1).", "paper_title": "A New Construction of 16-QAM Near Complementary Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000283449000029"}
