In this way it is hoped to provide a direction for future cultural heritage applications to provide more complete and/or improved retrieval functionality. Design/methodology/approach-The methodology of this paper is based on introducing the general concept of image-based retrieval systems as well as their retrieval methods. Then, users' needs are discussed to illustrate the demands of semantic-based retrieval. After the retrieval methods have been presented, current digital cultural heritage libraries are examined in terms of their supported retrieval methods that allow users to query images. Findings-Current digital cultural heritage libraries mostly provide only general retrieval methods based on image-based low-level features, i.e. query by image contents. Very few consider other retrieval methods such as browsing and semantic-based retrieval. In addition, none of the current systems provide all possible retrieval methods for users. Originality/value-This study is the first one to examine image-based retrieval methods in digital cultural heritage libraries. This study supports the improvement of retrieval functionality for digital cultural heritage libraries in the future.", "paper_title": "A review of image retrieval methods for digital cultural heritage resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000246892600006"}
