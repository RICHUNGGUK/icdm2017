Active Near-Infrared (Near-IR) illumination projected by a Light Emitting Diode (LED) light source is used to provide a constant illumination. The difference between two face images captured when the LED light is on and off respectively, is the image of a face under just the LED illumination, and is independent of ambient illumination. In preliminary experiments across different illuminations, across time, and their combinations, significantly better results are achieved in both automatic and semi-automatic face recognition experiments on LED illuminated faces than on face images under ambient illuminations.", "paper_title": "Ambient illumination variation removal by active near-IR imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300003"}
