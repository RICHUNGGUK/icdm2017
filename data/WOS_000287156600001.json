The motivation is driven by transport processes in porous media (e.g. waste disposal, chemical deposition processes). We analyze the coupled transport-reaction equation with mobile and immobile areas. We apply analytical methods, such as Laplace-transformation, and for the numerical methods we apply Godunov's scheme, see (Mat. Sb. 1959; 47:271-306; Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2002). The method is based numerically on flux-based characteristic methods and is an attractive alternative to the classical higher-order TVD methods, see (J. Comput. Phys. 1993; 49: 357-393). In this paper, we will focus on the derivation of analytical solutions for general and special solutions of the characteristic methods that are embedded in a finite-volume method. At the end of the paper, we illustrate the higher-order method for different benchmark problems.
