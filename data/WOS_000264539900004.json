It is composed of four layers: Common Interface Layer, Context-aware Computing Layer, Ubiquitous Core Computing Layer and Grid Computing Layer. The layers cooperate to give intelligent ubiquitous convergence services and provide the advantages of layered architecture. The middleware has been developed to construct an intelligent ubiquitous system since 2005.", "paper_title": "An Intelligent Ubiquitous Middleware for U-City: SmartUM", "paper_id": "WOS:000264539900004"}
