It calls for a sustainable transmission path which would then modify the optimal transmission condition accordingly to render it dynamically efficient over time. But what is the most sustainable transmission path? Sustainable transmission satisfies the needs for transmission at present time without compromising the needs of bits for future transmission. This paper presents a set of axioms that capture this idea of sustainable transmission and characterizes the criterion of sustainable transmission. The Pontryagin's maximum principle is then used to find out the transmission path that maximizes such a criterion. It will be the most sustainable transmission path. Here we analyze to which point three coding methods lead to sustainable transmission. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
