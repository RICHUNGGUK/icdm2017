In practice, a study of how healthcare professionals adopt mobile services to support their work is imperative. An integration of TAM and TPB, concerning both technological and organizational aspects, is important for understanding the adoption of mobile healthcare. However, mobile healthcare is a wireless device which is often used in a voluntary motive. Service provisions for pervasive and timely usage and individual psychological states are critical in determining its use. Accordingly, perceived service availability (PSA) and personal innovativeness in IT (PUT) may be the important drivers to be included in TAM and TPB. This study thus proposed such a research framework from a broader and integrative perspective. The empirical examination showed high predictive power for adoption intention and the influential role of these important variables. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
