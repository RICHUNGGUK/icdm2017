It is well known that, machine's vibration is the best indicator of its overall mechanical condition, and an earliest indicator of arising defects. Support vector machines (SVM) is also well known as intelligent classifier with strong generalization ability. In this paper, both, machine's vibrations and SVM are used together for a new intelligent mechanical fault diagnostic method. Using only one vibration sensor and only four SVM's it was achieved improved results over the available approaches for this purpose in the literature. Therefore, this method becomes more attractive for on line monitoring without maintenance specialist intervention. Vibration signals turns out to occur in different directions (axial, horizontal or vertical) depending on the type of the fault. Thus, to diagnose mechanical faults it is necessary to read signals at various positions or use more them one accelerometer. From this work we also determined the best position for signals acquisition, which is very important information for the maintenance task. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
