Here, we investigate the effectiveness of the TMM model by analyzing algorithms for 3 classic problems suffix tree/array for string matching, fast Fourier transform, and merge sort - under this model. Our findings indicate that the TMM model can explain and predict previously unexplained trends and artifacts in experimental data.", "paper_title": "Theoretical Analysis of Classic Algorithms on Highly-threaded Many-core GPUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000349142100043"}
