In this sense, Ambient Intelligence (AmI) has emerged as a new discipline focused on people and aimed at facilitating their daily activities. This paper proposes a new definition model that helps designers to characterize collaborative e-learning systems based on AmI and Computer Supported Collaborative Learning. The use of mobile devices and Mobile Adhoc Networks is a key aspect in this model as they allow users to access resources from anywhere on demand. The proposed model is applied to a concrete case of study as an example of its application on real scenarios.", "paper_title": "Ambient intelligence and collaborative e-learning: a new definition model", "paper_id": "WOS:000209331700005"}
