Even as the component is the aggregation entity of objects, the cooperation is defined as the aggregation of agents based on the common tasks and the environmental constraints. As to the description of cooperation-oriented architecture, this paper brought forward a solution based on the extended WRIGHT. This new language of architecture description is named as WRIGHT*.", "paper_title": "Research on modeling and description of software architecture of cooperation-oriented system", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100057"}
