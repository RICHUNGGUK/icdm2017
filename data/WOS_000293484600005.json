To accomplish therapeutic goals, a series of virtual elements is customized to be meaningful to the user; the elements contain the fundamental emotional components that the person must confront. Thirty-nine participants diagnosed with PTSD (N=10), PG (N=16), and AD (N=13) were randomly assigned to a standard cognitive-behavioral program (CBT) (N=20) or a CBT program driven by EMMA's World (N=19). Participants were assessed before and after treatment. Measurements related to anxiety, depression and other emotions, maladjustment and interference were applied. Results indicate that CBT with EMMA's World was as effective as the standard CBT program for the treatment of these disorders, and the statistically significant differences (depression, relaxation intensity and social area interference) were in favor of EM MA's World. We expect VR to provide a positive alternative that will draw in clients who do not seek traditional forms of treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
