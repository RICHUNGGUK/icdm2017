In this paper, we propose a structured quantile estimation methodology in a nonparametric function estimation setup. Through the functional analysis of variance decomposition, the optimization of the proposed method can be solved using a series of quadratic and linear programmings. Our method automatically selects relevant covariates by adopting a lasso-type penalty. The performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated through numerical examples on both simulated and real data.", "paper_title": "Structured kernel quantile regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000313033800013"}
