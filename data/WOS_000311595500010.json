Several benchmark frame and truss structures, with geometric nonlinear behavior, are solved by these schemes. Based on the total number of iterations and overall analysis duration, the studied techniques are graded. In this way, the efficiencies of the solvers are found and these algorithms are sorted in terms of their abilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
