Determining compatibility is NP-hard, and the fastest algorithm to date has worst case complexity of around Omega(n(k)) time, n being the number of leaves. Here, we present an O(nf (k)) algorithm, proving that compatibility of unrooted phylogenetic trees is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the number k of trees. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
