Surface gateway deployment is one of the key techniques for connecting two networks with different channels. In this work, we propose an optimization method based on the genetic algorithm for surface gateway deployment, design a novel transmission mechanism-simultaneous transmission, and realize two efficient routing algorithms that achieve minimal delay and payload balance among sensor nodes. We further develop an analytic model to study the delay, energy consumption and packet loss ratio of the network. Our simulation results verify the effectiveness of the model, and demonstrate that the technique of multiple gateway deployment and the mechanism of simultaneous transmission can effectively reduce network delay, energy consumption and packet loss rate.", "paper_title": "Optimization of Multiple Gateway Deployment for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297859500008"}
