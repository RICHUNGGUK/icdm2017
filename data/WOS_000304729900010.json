Mixing was carried out with wheat flour alone or supplemented with different ingredients (alone or in combination) such as Y, G and HB (1%) or SB (0.5%) flour. The biochemical factors related to lipid oxidation - lipid components and lipoxygenase (LOX) activity - were quantified in the initial flour and in dough after mixing. Thus, the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) either in the free form (free-PUFA) or present in triacylglycerol (PUFA-TAG), the primary oxidation products of linoleic acid (LH) such as hydroxyacid (HODE), hydroperoxide (HPODE) and ketodiene (KODE) and the carotenoid pigments were analyzed. Two experimental designs were built to quantify the effects on lipid oxidation of the different ingredients and their interactions with a limited number of experiments. Results were analyzed by using multivariate chemometrical methods, principal component analysis (PCA), statistical methods (Pareto chart) and Mahalanobis distance (MD). The HODE and KODE levels are dependent on the LOX botanical origin. In our conditions and in terms of lipid oxidation, the dough biochemical characteristics are not affected by the presence of G (without added glucose) in the formulation whatever the other ingredients were.
