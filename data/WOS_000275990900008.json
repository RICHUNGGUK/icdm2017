It has been the concern of many researchers around the world to algorithmically assess the quality of image sequences based on human visual perception. This paper presents a novel technique for quantitatively assessing the quality of image sequences without the need for a reference image and in a way that precisely correlates to human judgement on quality. This research is a part of a larger framework that incorporates multi-objective optimisation algorithms to optimise the quality metrics of compressed videos acquired by autonomous vehicles and transmitted over low-bandwidth communication channels. Our system was trained on a dataset that involved 700 videos of 5 different categories. We validate the performance of our model and show that it highly correlates to the human subjective quality assessment.", "paper_title": "Visual Quality Assessment of Video and Image Sequences-A Human-based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000275990900008"}
