An example of such a problem is found in domestic pipe systems where vibration from pumps and valves installed in an assembled pipe system should be suppressed before it reaches installations in dwellings. By use of Floquet theory and a shape optimization procedure a stop-band design is tuned into a specified frequency range. The structures with prescribed stop-band characteristics are composed of curved and straight pipe segments. For comparison vibro-acoustic energy transmission analysis is made on periodic piping systems where a finite series of the same substructures are implemented as a stop-band filter. The influence of production tolerances of such a stop-band filter is also assessed.", "paper_title": "Design of stop-band filter by use of curved pipe segments and shape optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000297595300011"}
