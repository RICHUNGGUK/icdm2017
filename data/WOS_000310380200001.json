Thus sensing coverage is one of the most important quality of service factors in WSNs. A useful metric for quantifying the coverage reliability is the coverage rate that is the area covered by sensor nodes in a region of interest. The network sink can be informed about locations of all nodes and calculate the coverage rate centrally. However, this approach creates huge load on the network nodes that had to send their location information to the sink. Thus, a distributed approach is required to calculate the coverage rate. This paper is among the very first to provide a localized approach to calculate the coverage rate. We provide two coverage rate calculation (CRC) protocols, namely distributed exact coverage rate calculation (DECRC) and distributed probabilistic coverage rate calculation (DPCRC). DECRC calculates the coverage rate precisely using the idealized disk graph model. Precise calculation of the coverage rate is a unique property of DECRC compared to similar works that have used the disk graph model. In contrast, DPCRC uses a more realistic model that is probabilistic coverage model to determine an approximate coverage rate. DPCRC is in fact an extended version of DECRC that uses a set of localized techniques to make it a low cost protocol. Simulation results show significant overall performance improvement of CRC protocols compared to related works.", "paper_title": "Coverage rate calculation in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310380200001"}
