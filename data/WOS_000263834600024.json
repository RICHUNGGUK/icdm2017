The library provides a quality assessment of the signal intensities, as well as a broad range of options for data normalization, different statistical tests for the identification of significant siRNAs, and a significance analysis of the biological processes involving corresponding genes. The results of the analysis are presented as a set of HTML pages. Additionally, all values and plots are available as either text files or pdf and png files.", "paper_title": "RNAither, an automated pipeline for the statistical analysis of high-throughput RNAi screens", "paper_id": "WOS:000263834600024"}
