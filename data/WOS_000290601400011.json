Such model can be constructed by extracting representative terms from texts and their mutually semantic relationships. Afterward, it is represented as a graph, whose nodes are the selected terms and whose edges are the corresponding relationships respectively. Moreover, the weight is assigned to each edge so that the strength of relationship between two terms can be measured. Furthermore, for this weighted directed graph structure, a novel graph similarity algorithm is developed by extracting the maximum common subgraph between two concerned graphs, which can therefore be used to measure the distance between two graph structures, i.e., two texts, and further be applied to classification tasks. Finally, some experiments have been conducted with the Chinese benchmark corpus for validation. The experimental results have proved the better performance of the proposed textual knowledge representation model in terms of its precision and recall.", "paper_title": "ENHANCING TEXT REPRESENTATION FOR CLASSIFICATION TASKS WITH SEMANTIC GRAPH STRUCTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601400011"}
