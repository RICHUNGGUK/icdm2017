In a theoretical breakthrough, [Y. Meyer, Oscillating Patterns in Image Processing and Nonlinear Evolution Equations. Providence, RI: American Mathematical Society, 2001] proposed variational models that force the geometric part into the space of functions with bounded variation, and the textural part into a space of oscillatory distributions. Meyer's models are simple minimization problems extending the famous total variation model. However, their numerical solution has proved challenging. It is the object of a literature rich in variants and numerical attempts. This paper starts with the linear model, which reduces to a low-pass/high-pass filter pair. A simple conversion of the linear filter pair into a nonlinear filter pair involving the total variation is introduced. This new-proposed nonlinear filter pair retains both the essential features of Meyer's models and the simplicity and rapidity of the linear model. It depends upon only one transparent parameter: the texture scale, measured in pixel mesh. Comparative experiments show a better and faster separation of cartoon from texture. One application is illustrated: edge detection.", "paper_title": "Fast Cartoon plus Texture Image Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000282335000003"}
