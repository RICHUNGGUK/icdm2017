The activities present in NS3 have proved to be critical for viral replication. The replicative cycle of Flaviviridae requires coordinated regulation of all the activities present in the full-length NS3 protein, however, the exact nature of these interactions remains unclear. The present work aimed to determine common structural features between NS3 of dengue and hepatitis C viruses and to characterize residues involved in the regulation of the interdomain motions between NS3pro and NS3hel. Analysis of the root mean square (RMS) variation shows that NS3pro increases the stability of subdomain 1 of the RNA helicase. Moreover, the dynamic behaviour of the carboxy terminus of Whet, supports the hypothesis that, upon release of the carboxy-terminus from NS3pro, the residues involved in this interaction are folded back into the last alpha-helix. Using normal mode analysis, we characterized slow collective motions of NS3, and observed that the two lowest-frequency normal modes are enough to describe reorientations of NS3pro relative to NS3hel. These movements induced an increment in the exposure of the active site of NS3pro that can be important during the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein. The third low-frequency normal mode was correlated to subdomain reorientations of Whet, similar to those proposed during NTP hydrolysis and dsRNA unwinding. Based on these data, we support a dynamic model, in which the domain movements between NS3pro and NS3hel result in the regulation of its activities. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
