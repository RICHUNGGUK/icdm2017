In this paper, the combined use of tools from different MPEG standards is described in the context of a video summarization application. The main objective of the framework is the efficient generation of summaries, integrated with their adaptation to the user's terminal and network. The MPEG-4 Scalable Video Coding specification is used for fast adaptation and summary bitstream generation. MPEG-21 digital item adaptation tools are used to describe metadata related to the user's terminal and network. MPEG-7 tools are used to describe the summary. Finally, the framework is compared with alternative approaches (variations and transcoding), in terms of efficiency, rate-distortion performance and other aspects.", "paper_title": "Combining MPEG Tools to Generate Video Summaries Adapted to the Terminal and Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000318630600002"}
