Considering the importance of these domains, we have created MeTaDoR, a comprehensive resource dedicated to membrane targeting domains (MTDs). Result: MeTaDoR begins with a brief introduction about all the important MTDs including their subcellular localization and structural features. Sequences of all known MTDs are then provided in two formats: standard Prosite format and a parsed tab-delimited format that provides a manually curated classification into binding or non-binding. Structures of all MTDs and host proteins known so far are provided with links to PDB and Pfam databases. Membrane-binding orientation of these proteins, whether experimentally determined or proposed, is also provided with links to the appropriate literature. To facilitate molecular dynamics studies of these proteins, the force-field parameters for many non-standard lipids that commonly interact with these proteins are also provided. Finally, an online server for predicting membrane-binding proteins and a search function with various search fields are included. The resource is publicly available and will be updated on a regular basis.
