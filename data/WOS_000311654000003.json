The overall traversability estimation of the terrain and the subsequent selection of an obstacle-free route are prerequisites of a successful autonomous operation. This work proposes a computationally efficient technique for the traversability estimation of the terrain, based on a machine learning classification method. Additionally, a new method for collision risk assessment is introduced. The proposed system uses stereo vision as a first step in order to obtain information about the depth of the scene. Then, a v-disparity image calculation processing step extracts information-rich features about the characteristics of the scene, which are used to train a support vector machine (SVM) separating the traversable and non-traversable scenes. The ones classified as traversable are further processed exploiting the polar transformation of the depth map. The result is a distribution of obstacle existence likelihoods for each direction, parametrized by the robot's embodiment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
