We propose a unified pathway-analysis method that can be used for diverse phenotypes including binary, multi-class, continuous, count, rate, and censored survival phenotypes. The proposed method also allows covariate adjustments and correlation in the phenotype variable that is encountered in longitudinal, cluster-sampled, and paired designs. These are accomplished by combining the regression-based test statistic for each individual gene in a pathway of interest into a pathway-level test statistic. Applications of the proposed method are illustrated with two real pathway-analysis examples: one evaluating relapse-associated gene expression involving a matched-pair binary phenotype in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia; and the other investigating gene expression in breast cancer tissues in relation to patients' survival (a censored survival phenotype). Implementations for various phenotypes are available in R. Additionally, an Excel Add-in for a user-friendly interface is currently being developed.", "paper_title": "Pathway analysis of Microarray data via regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000254997500004"}
