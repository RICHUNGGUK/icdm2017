Natural language definitions of available glossaries in a given domain are parsed and converted into formal (OWL) definitions, compliant with the core ontology property specifications. To evaluate the methodology, we annotated and formalized a relevant fragment of the AAT glossary of art and architecture, using a subset of 10 properties defined in the CRM CIDOC cultural heritage core ontology, a recent W3C standard.", "paper_title": "Ontology enrichment through automatic semantic annotation of on-line glossaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000241683600012"}
