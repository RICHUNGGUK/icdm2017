In the recent past, three simulation methods have been used for single-electron device and circuit analysis: the Monte Carlo method, the master equation method, and SPICE using analytic models. Among these, the Monte Carlo method provides excellent accuracy, but is too slow for large-scale circuit simulation. In this work, we propose and develop an adaptive simulation technique based on the Monte Carlo method. This technique significantly improves the time efficiency while maintaining accuracy for single-electron device and circuit simulation. We have shown it is possible to reduce simulation time up to nearly 40 times and maintain an average propagation delay error of 3.4% compared to a nonadaptive Monte Carlo method.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Algorithm for Single-Electron Device and Circuit Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000282380600014"}
