The various approaches are investigated using the energy method and an eigenvalue analysis. It is shown that the weak implementation is superior and enhances the convergence to steady-state for coarse meshes. It is also demonstrated that all the stable approaches produce the same convergence rate as the mesh size goes to zero. The numerical results obtained by using a fully nonlinear finite volume solver support the theoretical findings from the linear analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
