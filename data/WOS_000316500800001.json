In this article, we show that mining frequent projection-selection-join queries becomes tractable if joins are performed along keys and foreign keys, in a database satisfying functional and inclusion dependencies, under certain restrictions. We note that these restrictions cover most practical cases, including databases operating over star schemas, snow-flake schemas and constellation schemas. In our approach, we define an equivalence relation over queries using a pre-ordering with respect to which the support is shown to be anti-monotonic. We propose a level-wise algorithm for computing all frequent queries by exploiting the fact that equivalent queries have the same support. We report on experiments showing that, in our context, mining frequent projection-selection-join queries is indeed tractable, even for large data sets.", "paper_title": "Mining frequent conjunctive queries using functional and inclusion dependencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000316500800001"}
