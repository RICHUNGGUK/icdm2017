It splits the original watermark into two shares and embeds one share into the cover image to increase the security. A polarization procedure is performed to establish a polarity stream from the cover image. The second share and the polarity stream are used to generate a master key and several normal keys. In this system, only the super-user can reveal the genuine watermark directly. Other users possess the normal keys can obtain shadow watermarks merely. By combining the shadow watermarks together, the real watermark can be recovered. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
