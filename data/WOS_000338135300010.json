Analytical techniques based on perturbation theory have been proposed in order to overcome the need for long fixed-point simulation. However, these techniques are not applicable in the presence of certain operations classified as un-smooth operations. In such circumstances, fixed-point simulation should be used. In this paper, an algorithm detailing the hybrid technique which makes use of an analytical accuracy evaluation technique used to accelerate fixed-point simulation is presented. This technique is applicable to signal processing systems with both feed-forward and feedback interconnect topology between its operations. The acceleration obtained as a result of applications of the proposed technique is consistent with fixed-point simulation, while reducing the time taken for fixed-point simulation by several orders of magnitude.", "paper_title": "Accelerated Performance Evaluation of Fixed-Point Systems With Un-Smooth Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000338135300010"}
