Adopting a sociolinguistic perspective, we conceptualize group maintenance behavior as interpersonal communication tactics specifically, social presence and politeness tactics that help maintain relationships among group members. Developer email messages were collected from two FLOSS projects with different development statuses, and their content was analyzed to identify frequently used group maintenance tactics. We then compared the group maintenance tactics used in the two projects, finding differences that reflect changes in the project work practices. Our work theoretically contributes to FLOSS research and has practical implications for FLOSS practitioners. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
