We present a finite-difference approximation to the drug mass transfer rate from dissolving cylindrical drug-containing compacts, consisting of alternating layers of drug and inert material. Results are compared with a recent analytical solution to the same problem and with experiment. The two theoretical estimates differ by about 10%, a result of different implementations of a derivative surface boundary condition. The finite-difference model is more physically realistic but the analytical solution is usefully accurate. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
