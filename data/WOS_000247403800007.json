There are certain areas of high seismic activity, as well as, regions of low seismicity where strong earthquakes are rather rare events. Consequently, it is of great interest to present a methodology concerning the earthquake process in Greece even for areas considered to be of low seismicity. In this paper, a study of the earthquake activity of an area in Northeastern Greece, centred at Xanthi, Thrace, extending over a region of radius R = 80 km, during a certain time period is presented. A two-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) dynamic system consisting of cells representing charges is used for the simulation of the earthquake process. The model has been tested as well as calibrated using the recorded events of the above-mentioned region as initial conditions. The simulation results are found in good quantitative and qualitative agreement with the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) scaling relations. Finally, the CA model has a user-friendly interface and enables the user to change several of its parameters, in order to study various hypotheses concerning the seismicity of the region under consideration.
