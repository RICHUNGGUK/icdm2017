Their scheme is a generalized case of the ring signature scheme, and it allows the key types to be based on the trapdoor one-way permutations (TOWP) or sigma-protocols including Schnorr's signature scheme. However, the signed message is public for all, which may result in disputes. In this paper, we present a novel threshold signer-ambiguous signature scheme, having the signed message concealed and keeping who the receivers are secret from variety of keys.", "paper_title": "A concealed t-out-of-n signer ambiguous signature scheme with variety of keys", "paper_id": "WOS:000252121100003"}
