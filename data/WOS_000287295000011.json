Our variety theorem establishes a bijective correspondence between these K Sigma-VTSs and the varieties of finite-dimensional K Sigma-algebras (K Sigma-VFDA for short); a K Sigma-algebra is a K-vector space equipped with multilinear Sigma-operations. The link between K Sigma-VTSs and K Sigma-VFDAs is provided by the syntactic K Sigma-algebras of tree series. The most immediate predecessors of this study are Berstel's and Reutenauer's (1982) [2] work on tree series over fields, Reutenauer's (1980) [27] theory of varieties of string series, Bozapalidis' and his associates (1983, 1989, 1991) [8,5,4] work on syntactic K Sigma-algebras, Steinby's (1979, 1992) [30,31] theory of varieties of tree languages, and our previous work (2009) on series of general algebras and their syntactic K Sigma-algebras.
