According to self-reported data from two periods and objective behavioral data, the combined fulfillment of needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence determines newcomers' cognitive social identity, which then influences participation behavior through affective commitment and collective self-esteem. Of the three needs, autonomy exerts the strongest effect on cognitive social identity. Moreover, relationship satisfaction moderates the relationship between awareness of group membership and affective commitment which helps explain why newcomers with high awareness of their group membership might not cohere with a particular social group. Overall, by combining self-determination theory with relationship management theories, this study establishes an explanatory platform for newcomers' participation behavior. The authors conclude with a discussion of the managerial and research implications of these findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
