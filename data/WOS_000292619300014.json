This immediately yields a lower bound on the key length and an optimal construction, namely (l + 1)-wise independent permutations. This also gives an operational interpretation to the notion of decryption oracles in information-theoretic security.", "paper_title": "Information-Theoretic Secrecy with Access to Decryption Oracles", "paper_id": "WOS:000292619300014"}
