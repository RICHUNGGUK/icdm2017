A design technique based on flipped voltage follower current sources is preferred to obtain a high performance CDBA. The proposed circuit can operate with the minimum supply voltages of +/- 0.6 V. It also consumes less power than its counterparts that have been reported so far. Moreover, the proposed CDBA has good voltage and current gain accuracies. For the simulations, UMC 0.18 mu m CMOS process is used. The performance of the CDBA is verified with HSPICE. Finally, a second-order, allpass/notch filter configuration is proposed to show the performance and usefulness of the circuit. The results from HSPICE simulations are in remarkable agreement with the expected ones.", "paper_title": "Low voltage low power CMOS current differencing buffered amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000273587200012"}
