In this paper, the time history of wave forces exerted on the Biloxi Bay Bridge during Hurricane Katrina was investigated by a wave-loading model. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method was adopted in the model to track the variations of water surface levels. In order to obtain wave parameters and storm-surge elevation at the bridge site during Hurricane Katrina, a storm surge model and a wave propagation model were coupled to hindcast the hydrodynamic conditions. Outputs of the coupled wave-surge models were imported to the wave-loading model to simulate the dynamic wave forces acting on the bridge deck. In order to evaluate the maximum uplift wave force, five different bridge deck elevations submerged at different water depths were investigated. The processes of wave-bridge interaction were simulated by the wave-loading model. The wave profiles, velocity field in the vicinity of the bridge, and dynamic wave forces on the decks were analyzed. Results indicate that the uplift force on the submerged bridge deck span exceeded its own weight under the extreme wave and storm surge conditions during Hurricane Katrina. Moreover, the numerical simulations suggest that the maximum uplift wave force occurred when the storm surge water level reached the top of the bridge deck. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
