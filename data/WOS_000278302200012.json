This paper presents a unified optimization algorithm for multifunctional 3D finite periodic structures, in which the topological sensitivities at the corresponding locations of different components are regulated to maintain the structural periodicity. To simultaneously address the stiffness and conductivity criteria, a weighted average method is employed to derive Pareto front. The examples show that the optimal objective functions could be compromised when the total number of periodic components increases. The influence of thermoelastic coupling on optimal topologies and objectives is also investigated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
