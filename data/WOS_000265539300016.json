We apply an inviscid fluid flow simulation using Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics to compute the global velocity and cross fields over the surface model. These fields guide the automatic placement of strokes while extracting the geometric and topological coherence of the model. Target tones are matched by tonal value maps allowing different hatching and cross-hatching effects. We demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of our method with sample renderings obtained for a variety of models.", "paper_title": "Fluid-based hatching for tone mapping in line illustrations", "paper_id": "WOS:000265539300016"}
