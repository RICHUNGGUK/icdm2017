An appropriate expression for dropping probability is derived based on this prediction to stabilize the queue length to the desired value. A new Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithm named as Straightforward AQM (SFAQM) is proposed with simple implementation. Its analysis of the stability is also carried out, and the necessary and sufficient condition for the system to be stable is presented. The simulation results using NS2 demonstrate that SFAQM is effective in different network environments. Compared to the conventional AQM controllers, such as PI, RaQ and CARED, SFAQM has smaller queue length jitter and faster convergence speed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
