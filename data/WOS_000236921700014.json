Since the collision kernel commonly used in physics is highly singular, numerical simulations are performed for related collision kernels to get a preliminary insight into the behavior of the solutions. Some of the numerical results are then given a theoretical explanation. Global existence of a solution to the Cauchy problem is proven when the L-1 initial data are a.e. smaller than the Planck distribution function, and non-existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem is proven when the L-1 initial data are a.e. bigger than the Planck distribution function.
