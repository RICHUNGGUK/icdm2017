Global routing is based on a combinatorial approximation scheme for min-max resource sharing. Detailed routing uses exact shortest path algorithms, based on a shape-based data structure for pin access and a two-level track-based data structure for long-distance connections. All algorithms are very fast. Compared to an industrial router (on 32nm and 22nm chips), BonnRoute is over two times faster, has 5% less netlength, 20% less vias, and reduces detours by more than 90%.", "paper_title": "BonnRoute: Algorithms and Data Structures for Fast and Good VLSI Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000317427700016"}
