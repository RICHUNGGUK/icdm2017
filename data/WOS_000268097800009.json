These programming models should be able to exploit the underlying platform, but also should have good programmability to enable programmer productivity. With respect to the heterogeneity and hierarchy of the underlying platforms, the programming models should take them into account but they should also enable the programmer to be unaware of the complexity of the hardware. In this paper we present an extension of the StarSs syntax to support task hierarchy. A motivation for such a hierarchical approach is presented through experimentation with CellSs. A prototype implementation of such a hierarchical task-based programming model that combines a first task level with SMPSs and a second task level with CellSs is presented. The preliminary results obtained when executing a matrix multiplication and a Cholesky factorization show the viability and potential of the approach and the current issues raised.", "paper_title": "HIERARCHICAL TASK-BASED PROGRAMMING WITH STARSS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268097800009"}
