The prediction of metabolic fluxes based on high-throughput molecular data sources could help to advance our understanding of cellular metabolism, since current experimental approaches are limited to measuring fluxes through merely a few dozen enzymes.", "paper_title": "iMAT: an integrative metabolic analysis tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000284947700024"}
