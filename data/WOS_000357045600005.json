When , the offline version of this problem is equivalent to the classical bin packing problem. In this paper, we focus on the case , and propose online algorithms and obtain lower bounds for the problem.", "paper_title": "Online bin packing with (1,1) and (2,) bins", "paper_id": "WOS:000357045600005"}
