Where necessary, a \"leak-out\" flow is invoked on a pipe section in order to achieve the balance. Usually, multiple solutions are possible, and these are sounded out by progressively increasing an integrity weight for each pipe section. A feature of the method is that it overlays \"snapshots\" of the network at a series of points in time, in order to progressively narrow down the part of the network which can commonly account for all observations.
