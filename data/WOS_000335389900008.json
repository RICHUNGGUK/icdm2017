Humaines 145:5-101, 1999), and Citti & Sarti (in J. Math. Imaging Vis. 24(3):307-326, 2006). In previous work we proved that the range of the exponential map of the underlying geometric problem formulated on SE(2) consists of precisely those end-conditions (x (fin),y (fin),theta (fin)) that can be connected by a globally minimizing geodesic starting at the origin (x (in),y (in),theta (in))=(0,0,0). From the applied imaging point of view it is relevant to analyze the sub-Riemannian geodesics and in detail. In this article we <UnorderedList Mark=\"Bullet\"> <ItemContent> <Para>show that is contained in half space xa parts per thousand yen0 and (0,y (fin))not equal(0,0) is reached with angle pi, show that the boundary consists of endpoints of minimizers either starting or ending in a cusp, analyze and plot the cones of reachable angles theta (fin) per spatial endpoint (x (fin),y (fin)), relate the endings of association fields to and compute the length towards a cusp, analyze the exponential map both with the common arc-length parametrization t in the sub-Riemannian manifold and with spatial arc-length parametrization s in the plane . Surprisingly, s-parametrization simplifies the exponential map, the curvature formulas, the cusp-surface, and the boundary value problem, present a novel efficient algorithm solving the boundary value problem, show that sub-Riemannian geodesics solve Petitot's circle bundle model (cf. Petitot in J. Physiol. Paris 97:265-309, [2003]), show a clear similarity with association field lines and sub-Riemannian geodesics.", "paper_title": "Association Fields via Cuspless Sub-Riemannian Geodesics in SE(2)", "paper_id": "WOS:000335389900008"}
