These flows are described by a non-conservative, unconditionally hyperbolic multiphase model. The numerical approximation is based on finite-volume method for unstructured grids. At the discrete level, the surface tension is approximated by a volume force (CSF formulation). The interface physical properties are recovered by designing an appropriate linearized Riemann solver (Relaxation scheme) that prevents spurious oscillations near material interfaces. For low-speed flows, a preconditioning linearization is proposed and the low Mach asymptotic is formally recovered. Numerical computations, for a bubble equilibrium, converge to the required Laplace law and the dynamic of a drop, falling under gravity, is in agreement with experimental observations.
