The solver uses a level set/finite element method on unstructured tetrahedral meshes. We show how the level set function can be used to build an anisotropic mesh with good properties. Some computations with a strong transient character and large densities ratios (1/1000) are presented. We show that the efficiency of the computations can be deeply enhanced by mesh adaptations.
