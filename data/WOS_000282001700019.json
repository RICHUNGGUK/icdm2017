This is a very clever, very problem specific, technique. This paper presents a simple dynamic-programming (DP) method that solves the problem with the same time and space bounds. The fact that there was an Theta(nD) time DP algorithm was previously known; it is a straightforward DP with the Monge property (which permits an order of magnitude speedup). It was not interesting, though, because it also required Theta(nD) space. The main result of this paper is the technique developed for reducing the space. It is quite simple and applicable to many other problems modeled by DPs with the Monge property. This is illustrated with examples from web-proxy design and wireless mobile paging.", "paper_title": "A Dynamic Programming Approach to Length-Limited Huffman Coding: Space Reduction With the Monge Property", "paper_id": "WOS:000282001700019"}
