H adsorption on the clusters was found to be preferentially at edge sites followed by 3-fold hollow sites and on-top sites. The minimum energy path calculations suggest that H-2 dissociative chemisorption is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable and the H atoms on the clusters are mobile. Calculations on the sequential H-2 dissociative chemisorption on the clusters indicate that the edge sites are populated first and subsequently several on-top sites and hollow sites are also occupied upon full cluster saturation. In all cases, the average hydrogen capacity on Ni-n clusters is similar to that of Pd-n clusters but considerably smaller than that of Pt-n clusters. Comparison of hydrogen dissociative chemisorption energies and H desorption energies at full H-coverage among the Ni family clusters was made.", "paper_title": "Hydrogen sequential dissociative chemisorption on Ni-n(n=2 similar to 9,13) clusters: comparison with Pt and Pd", "paper_id": "WOS:000294735900021"}
