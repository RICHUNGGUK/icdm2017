However, the languages to describe their discrete switching logic and stochastic dynamic processes are different, and this difference makes their design and analysis hard. This paper proposes a new Petri net model, namely stochastic-differential Petri net (S-DPN), to describe both discrete switching logic, represented by a Markov chain, and stochastic dynamic processes, represented by a set of stochastic differential equations. We then apply a model checking technique to S-DPN to check the correctness of the requirements of SSS. A temperature control system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "A New Class of Petri Nets for Modeling and Property Verification of Switched Stochastic Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000358246100009"}
