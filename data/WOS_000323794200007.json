The obtained weights are interpreted in the context of the interval-valued sets. The work proposes four different ways of calculating weights which consider both the correctness and incorrectness of the classification. The proposed weights have been used in the algorithms which combine the outputs of base classifiers. In this work we use both the outputs, represented by rank and measure level. Research experiments have involved several bases available in the UCI repository and two data sets that have generated distributions. The performed experiments compare algorithms which are based on calculating the weights according to the resubstitution and algorithms proposed in the work. The ensemble of classifiers has also been compared with the base classifiers entering the committee. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
