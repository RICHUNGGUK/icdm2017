The first part of this method is using rules to represent policies obtained from experienced schedulers to link the situations of disruptions to the choice of algorithms, while the second part is using seven components to modularize an algorithm and constructing a generic procedure to control the flow of algorithms. With the algorithms represented by the method, the decision support system for real-time vehicle routing can handle different disruptions occurring under different distribution states in real time. Moreover, the method can facilitate the process of real-time modeling and the maintenance of algorithms in a Decision Support System for real-time vehicle routing.", "paper_title": "A KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION METHOD FOR ALGORITHMS IN DSS FOR REAL-TIME VEHICLE ROUTING IN URBAN DISTRIBUTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800032"}
