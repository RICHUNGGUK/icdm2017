Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) represent the core of the internet of things (IoT). The growing number of nodes composing these networks requires effective node synchronisation and a correct network organisation in order to ensure data delivery to the destination nodes. This paper presents a cross-layer approach that integrates a synchronous TDMA MAC protocol with a smart routing approach, oriented to guarantee efficient communications of a set of wireless devices in the IoT. First, both approaches are detailed and individually tested by comparing them to similar approaches in the literature. Then, the cross-layer integration is described and tested, showing that both protocols are able to enhance the network performance when working together.", "paper_title": "Smart cross-layer protocol integration for efficient wireless communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000366130300003"}
