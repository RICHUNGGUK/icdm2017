Reformulations of this provide relations between computational algebra and integer programming and they contain Applegate, Cook and McCormick's sufficient condition for the TDI property and Sturmfels' theorem relating toric initial ideals generated by square-free monomials to unimodular triangulations. We also study the theoretical and practical efficiency and limits of the characterizations of the TDI property presented here. In the particular case of set packing polyhedra our results correspond to endowing the weak perfect graph theorem with an additional, computationally interesting, geometric feature: the normal fan of the stable set polytope of a perfect graph can be refined into a regular triangulation consisting only of unimodular cones.", "paper_title": "Alternatives for testing total dual integrality", "paper_id": "WOS:000301454100003"}
