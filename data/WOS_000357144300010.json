The full six by six cross-section stiffness matrix is evaluated from a single element thickness slice represented by 3D solid elements with lengthwise Hermitian interpolation with six independent imposed deformation modes corresponding to extension, torsion, bending and shear. The flexibility matrix of the slice is obtained from complementary elastic energy, and the stiffness matrix is obtained by extracting and inverting the cross-section flexibility. Three examples illustrate the accuracy of the method for solid and thin-walled sections with isotropic and general anisotropic materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
