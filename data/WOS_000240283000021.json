Adding a digital layer to the existing physical and social layers could facilitate new forms of interaction that reshape urban life. While commercial information providers would create, own, and maintain this new layer, the public would greatly inform its form and content. Initiated two years ago, Just-for-Us is a multidisciplinary exploration of public pervasive computing in a specific city precinct: Federation Square in Melbourne, Australia.", "paper_title": "Public pervasive computing: Making the invisible visible", "paper_id": "WOS:000240283000021"}
