The formulation is based on an axisymmetric representation of the Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method, where the wavenumbers of propagating modes are obtained as solutions of a Hamiltonian eigenvalue problem. The novel solution procedure involves tracing selected modes over a given frequency range and computing the corresponding solutions by means of inverse iteration. The resulting algorithm is applied in the context of material characterization, where the efficiency of the computation is crucial. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
