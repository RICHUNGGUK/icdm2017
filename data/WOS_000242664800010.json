We classify the fuzzy line spreads of the smallest finite projective space, the Fano plane, and prove a general existence theorem for line spreads of arbitrary finite projective planes. We then extend the classical relation between designs and statistics to an application of the fuzzy spreads in statistics, by considering projective spaces as 2-designs. A fuzzy spread then gives a blueprint of how to make groups for test procedures where certain kinds of objects are mixed together and in each group one kind is over-represented.
