Because of the locality property of partial reluctance. the inverse of partial inductance, the window-based partial reluctance extraction has been applied for large-scale interconnect structures. In this paper, an efficient method of partial reluctance extraction is proposed for large-scale regular P/G grid structures. With a block reuse technique, the proposed method makes full use of the structural regularity of the P/G grid. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed method is able to efficiently handle a P/G grid with up to one hundred thousands wire segments. It is several tens times faster than the window-based method, while generating accurate frequency-dependent partial reluctance and resistance.", "paper_title": "Efficient Partial Reluctance Extraction for Large-Scale Regular Power Grid Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000267640300009"}
