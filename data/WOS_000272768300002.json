In this paper, a system framework is presented to recognize multiple kinds of activities from videos by an SVM multi-class classifier with a binary tree architecture. The framework is composed of three functionally cascaded modules: (a) detecting and locating people by non-parameter background subtraction approach, (b) extracting various of features such as local ones from the minimum bounding boxes of human blobs in each frames and a newly defined global one, contour coding of the motion energy image (CCMEI), and (c) recognizing activities of people by SVM multi-class classifier whose structure is determined by a clustering process. The thought of hierarchical classification is introduced and multiple SVMs are aggregated to accomplish the recognition of actions. Each SVM in the multi-class classifier is trained separately to achieve its best classification performance by choosing proper features before they are aggregated. Experimental results both on a home-brewed activity data set and the public Schuldt's data set show the perfect identification performance and high robustness of the system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
