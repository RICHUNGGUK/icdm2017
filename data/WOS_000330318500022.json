Some suitable adaptive rules based on neural network are introduced that make all signals bounded, and also Lyapunov theory guaranteed tracking error signal asymptotically reaches zero. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, some numerical results are presented. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of the suggested method, a decentralized adaptive method is adopted from the literature and applied for comparison. Simulation results verify the desirable performance of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "An efficient decentralized robust adaptive controller for a class of large-scale non-affine nonlinear systems with strong interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000330318500022"}
