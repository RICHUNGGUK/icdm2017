Most researchers in revenue management focus on analysing the sensitivity of the expected revenue to price, availability and disposal cost. In this note, we apply the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions with maximum price constraints, and demonstrate that the optimal prices for the non-linear problem fall within the feasible region when constraints are imposed. A numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed study.", "paper_title": "Revisiting revenue management for remanufactured products", "paper_id": "WOS:000320099900015"}
