To provide such high-capacity network channels, data center interconnection is typically based on Flexi-Grid optical networks that ensure the performance guarantee of low delay, high availability and robustness at a low cost. In case of natural disasters, to ensure a high-level quality of service (QoS) for user request after disasters becomes a research focus. In this paper, we present a novel cross stratum resilience (CSR) architecture for OpenFlow-enabled data center interconnection with Flexi-Grid optical networks. The proposed architecture can enable joint optimization of optical networks and application stratum resources, and enhance the service resilience and the data center responsiveness to end-to-end service demands. Based on this architecture, the data center service deployment (DCSD) strategy is proposed to solve the data center services pre-allocation problem. Additionally, the data center resource maintenance (DCRM) strategy is introduced based on the proposed architecture to describe data center resource occupation for choosing the backup server as the alternative destination. The overall feasibility of these strategies is experimentally validated and the network performances are quantitatively evaluated on our large scale testbed with 200 virtual OpenFlow-enabled nodes.
