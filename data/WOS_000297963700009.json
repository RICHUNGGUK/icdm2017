Their role in the aggregation is to permit the user to express the importance of the information sources (either criteria or experts). Due to the fact that fuzzy measures are set functions, the definition of such measures requires the definition of 2(n) parameters, where n is the number of information sources. To make the definition easier, several families of fuzzy measures have been defined in the literature. In this paper m-separable fuzzy measures are introduced. We present some results on this type of measures and we relate them to some of the previous existing ones. We study generating functions for m-separable fuzzy measures and some properties related to these generating functions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
