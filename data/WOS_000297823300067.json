We seek for new methods to make location and routing decisions simultaneously and efficiently. For that purpose, we describe a genetic algorithm (GA) combined with an iterative local search (ILS). The main idea behind our hybridization is to improve the solutions generated by the GA using a ILS to intensify the search space. Numerical experiments show that our hybrid algorithm improves, for all instances, the best known solutions previously obtained by the tabu search heuristic. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
