The mathematical model for these robots is a tunable reaction network, which makes this approach applicable to a large class of other systems, including ones that exhibit stochastic self-assembly at various length scales. We prove that this controller works for a range of setpoints and how to compute this range both analytically and experimentally. Finally, we demonstrate these ideas on a physical testbed.", "paper_title": "Setpoint regulation for stochastically interacting robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000285873700005"}
