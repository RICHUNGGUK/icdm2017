The hysteretic energy demand was formulated in terms of several effective parameters such as earthquake intensity, number of stories, soil type, period, strength index, and energy imparted to the structure. The performance and validity of the model were further tested using several criteria. The proposed model provides very high correlation coefficient (R = 0.985), and low root mean absolute error (RMSE = 1,346.1) and mean squared error (MAE = 1,037.6) values. The obtained results indicate that GSA is an effective method for the estimation of the hysteretic energy. The proposed GSA-based model is valuable for routine design practice. The prediction performance of the optimal GSA model was found to be better than that of the existing models.", "paper_title": "An innovative approach for modeling of hysteretic energy demand in steel moment resisting frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000334251000005"}
