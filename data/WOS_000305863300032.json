In particular, this article focuses on the case that the edge costs are expressed by random fuzzy variables. A new decision making model based on a possibility measure and a value at risk measure is proposed in order to find a solution which fully reflects random and fuzzy information. It is shown that an optimal solution of the proposed model is obtained by a polynomial-time algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
