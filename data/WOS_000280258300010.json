These algorithms need to be designed to provide the required Quality of Service (QoS) to a wide range of applications while allowing seamless roaming among a multitude of access network technologies. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the VHD algorithms designed to satisfy these requirements. To offer a systematic comparison, we categorize the algorithms into four groups based on the main handover decision criterion used. Also, to evaluate tradeoffs between their complexity of implementation and efficiency, we discuss three representative VHD algorithms in each group. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
