We observe some new properties of the HECSM. Our attacks are based on these new properties and the observation that the parameters f(0) and f(1) of the hyperelliptic curve equation are not utilized for the HECSM. We show that with different \"values\" for curve parameters f(0), f(1), there exsit cryptographically weak groups in the Koblitz hyperelliptic curve. Also, we compute the theoretical probability of getting a weak Jacobian group of hyperelliptic curve whose cardinality is an smooth integer.", "paper_title": "Fault attacks on hyperelliptic curve discrete logarithm problem over binary field", "paper_id": "WOS:000332351000016"}
