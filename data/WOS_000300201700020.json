Unlike traditional approaches which assume a PKI where the original signer and the proxy signer already hold their public keys and digital certificates, our scheme does not need for each user to have a public key and a certificate, thus we can save the time for verifying the original signer's and the proxy signer's certificates in the proxy signature verification phase. Furthermore, we present a formal security model for our scheme under the intractability of the computational Diffie-Hellman problem in the random oracle model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
