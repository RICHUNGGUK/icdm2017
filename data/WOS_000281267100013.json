The code implements the orthotropic plate paradigm and provides a graphical user interface, which allows both preprocessing and post-processing, linked to a commercial finite element package. A description of the code is presented, along with the formulation of the orthotropic plate. Verification and comparison examples demonstrate the performance and features of the software and also the applicability of the formulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
