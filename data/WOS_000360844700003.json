The flow domain is assumed to have a small vertical scale as compared with the horizontal extents. Thus, after hydrostatic approximation, the simplified governing equations are derived from the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations for the surface flow and from the Darcy's law for the subsurface flow. A conservative free-surface equation is derived from a vertical integral of the incompressibility condition and extends to the whole water column including both, the surface and the subsurface, wet domains. Numerically, the horizontal domain is covered by an unstructured orthogonal grid that may include subgrid specifications. Along the vertical direction a simple z-layer discretization is adopted. Semi-implicit finite difference equations for velocities and a finite volume approximation for the free-surface equation are derived in such a fashion that, after simple manipulation, the resulting discrete free-surface equation yields a single, well-posed, mildly nonlinear system. This system is efficiently solved by a nested Newton-type iterative method that yields simultaneously the pressure and a non-negative fluid volume throughout the computational grid. The time-step size is not restricted by stability conditions dictated by friction or surface wave speed. The resulting algorithm is simple, extremely efficient, and very accurate. Exact mass conservation is assured also in presence of wetting and drying dynamics, in pressurized flow conditions, and during free-surface transition through the interface. A few examples illustrate the model applicability and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
