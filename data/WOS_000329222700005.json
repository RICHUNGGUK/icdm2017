In the same fashion as the traditional real band-pass filter, the proposed circuit is also designed through the frequency transformation. In order to obtain the prototype complex filter suitable for passive realization, the extended lowpass-highpass transformation or the bilinear lowpass-lowpass transformation different from the well-known frequency shifting method is adopted. These transformations give two filters; however, the final circuits become identical to each other. The proposed circuit has two output terminals. One is the complex band-pass output, and the other is for the complex band-elimination. The proposed circuit includes a capacitor, an autotransformer or an inductor and termination resistors only. Because the proposed circuit has terminating resistors at both of the input and the output sides, it is suitable for high frequency application. As an example, two first-order complex filters which operate in 100 kHz and 10 MHz are designed and their frequency responses are measured. It is shown that the measured frequency responses agree with the theoretical ones through experiment.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of a first-order passive complex filter with band-pass/band-elimination characteristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000329222700005"}
