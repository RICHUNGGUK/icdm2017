Their properties and interrelations are investigated. Logics, both Hilbert type axiomatization and sequent calculi for these algebras are presented. These algebraic structures may be considered as abstract generalizations of rough set algebra. In particular some of the algebras are observed to be quite rich in structure and hence bear the potentiality of generating concrete rough set models for specific usages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
