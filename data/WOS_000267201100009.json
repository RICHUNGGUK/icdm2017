A collocated finite volume multiblock approach in a general curvilinear coordinate is used with Cartesian velocities and pressure as dependent variables. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a fractional-step algorithm. The dynamic grid algorithm is implemented by satisfying the space conservation law by computing the grid velocities in terms of the volume swept by the faces. The dynamic movement of grid in a multiblock approach is achieved by using a combination of spring analogy and Trans-Finite Interpolation. The spring analogy is used to compute the displacement of block corners, after which Trans-Finite Interpolation is applied independently on each computational block. The performance of the code is validated in forced transverse oscillations of a cylinder in cross-flow, a heaving airfoil, and hovering of a fruitfly. Finally, the unsteady aerodynamics of flapping flight at Re = 10,000 relevant to the development of Micro Air Vehicles is analyzed for forward flight. The results show the capability of the solver in predicting unsteady aerodynamics characterized by complex boundary movements. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
