The analysis of the gathered data reveals specific topics of weakness that can also reflect the cultural acceptance or resistance that management groups have towards the adoption of quality systems. Having identified detailed problems and barriers, effective strategies and programmes can be deployed to improve the level of implementation and, therefore, the effectiveness of a software quality management system. This paper presents the question set used and the subsequent results obtained from the implementation assessment for 55 software systems at AWE plc. The data is collated into management groups and the associated cultures discussed. The topics of weakness are highlighted together with the very specific actions that are least undertaken. A range of improvement actions is also presented.", "paper_title": "An analysis of software quality management at AWE plc.", "paper_id": "WOS:000251000900002"}
