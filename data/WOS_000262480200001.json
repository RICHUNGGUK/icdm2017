Images suffer from poor visibility due to backscattering and signal attenuation. Most prior methods for scene recovery use active illumination scanners (structured and gated), which can be slow and cumbersome. On the other hand, natural illumination is inapplicable to dark environments. This paper addresses the need for a nonscanning recovery method which uses active scene irradiance. We study the formation of images under wide-field artificial illumination. Based on the formation model, this paper presents an approach for recovering the object signal. It also yields rough information about the 3D scene structure. The approach can work with compact simple hardware, having active wide-field polychromatic polarized illumination. The camera is fitted with a polarization analyzer. Two frames of the scene are instantly taken, with different states of the analyzer or light-source polarizer. A recovery algorithm follows the acquisition. It allows both the backscatter and the object reflection to be partially polarized. It thus unifies and generalizes prior polarization-based methods, which had assumed exclusive polarization of either of these components. The approach is limited to an effective range due to image noise and falloff of wide-field illumination. Thus, these limits and the noise sensitivity are analyzed. The approach particularly applies underwater. We therefore use the approach to demonstrate recovery of object signals and significant visibility enhancement in underwater field experiments.", "paper_title": "Active Polarization Descattering", "paper_id": "WOS:000262480200001"}
