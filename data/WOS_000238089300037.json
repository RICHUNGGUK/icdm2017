ASTERIX contains different interactive tasks from the area of the formal foundations of computer science. Students can access the system by means of an internet interface. The implementation of the interactive presentation and correction of the tasks is generated automatically from high-level XML specifications. In this work we give an overview of the essential features of the system and the supported task types and show how ASTERIX is used in the context of distance teaching at the FernUniversitat in Hagen.", "paper_title": "An extendable system for the specification and generation of interactive self-tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300037"}
