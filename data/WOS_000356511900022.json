Current day implants are controlled, monitored, and powered wirelessly, eliminating the need for batteries and prolonging the lifetime. A brief overview of wireless platforms for such implantable devices is presented in this paper alongside an in-depth discussion of wireless platform for peripheral nerve implants covering design requirements, link design, and safety. Initial acute studies on the performance of the wireless power and data links in rodents are also presented.", "paper_title": "Enabling Wireless Powering and Telemetry for Peripheral Nerve Implants", "paper_id": "WOS:000356511900022"}
