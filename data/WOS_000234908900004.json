The method efficiently administrates security policies based on the object oriented role-based access control model (ORBAC). Moreover, an information flow analysis technique is introduced for checking whether or not a created XML-based ORBAC security policy satisfies the Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security principles.", "paper_title": "An approach to XML-based administration and secure information flow analysis on an object oriented role-based access control model", "paper_id": "WOS:000234908900004"}
