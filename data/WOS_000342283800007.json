We study these volumes using the method of real log canonical thresholds from algebraic geometry. Our analysis involves the computation of the singular loci of correlation hypersurfaces. Statistical applications include the strong-faithfulness assumption for the PC algorithm and the quantification of confounder bias in causal inference. A detailed analysis is presented for trees, bow ties, tripartite graphs, and complete graphs.", "paper_title": "Hypersurfaces and Their Singularities in Partial Correlation Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000342283800007"}
