In this letter, we present new enhanced scheme of StR. Compared with StR protocol, our new approach attains the exactly same security, but requires less processing time and about half communication overheads. Therefore, we improve the performance without sacrificing any security, especially the communication delay is dramatically reduced.", "paper_title": "Efficient Privacy-Preserving Reputation Evaluation in Decentralized Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000330553400051"}
