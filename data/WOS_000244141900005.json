Given a graph G = (V,E), a partition of its vertices into K groups and connectivity requirements between the different groups, the aim is to find simultaneously a set of representatives, one for each group, and a minimum cost connected subgraph that satisfies the connectivity requirements between the groups (representatives). This problem is a generalization of the Steiner network problem and the group Steiner tree problem, two known NP-complete problems. We present an approximation algorithm for a special case of the group Steiner network problem with an approximation ratio of min {2(1 + 2x),2I}, where I is the cardinality of the largest-group and x is a parameter that depends on the cost function.
