In order to achieve safe and efficient operations, this paper proposes a novel L-1 adaptive state feedback controller for the multivariable nonlinear boiler-turbine systems with unknown uncertainties. This L-1 adaptive control approach can achieve arbitrarily close tracking of the reference signal while ensuring closed-loop stability in the presence of strong nonlinearities, internal un-modeled dynamics, time-varying unknown parameters and uncertain dead time within its time-delay margins. In this study, a boiler-turbine unit simulation model is first built in order to verify the algorithm; then the L-1 adaptive control approach is presented followed by its main results and proof; only based on one group of the equilibrium working point data, the L-1 adaptive controller is designed for the overall working range of the boiler-turbine unit. For a more reliable evaluation on the L-1 adaptive controller, the offset-free input-to-state stable fuzzy model predictive controller (OFISS-MPC) - which has all-sided performances - is briefly introduced and functions as a reference for our results. Finally, the L-1 adaptive controller is tested in a series of challenging simulation scenarios and then compared with the OFISS-MPC controller. The results validate the expected performances of the L-1 adaptive controller for the boiler-turbine unit with unknown uncertainties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
