The method is based on linear algebra and is proved to be secure under projection attack. The problem of anonymous fingerprinting is also addressed, by allowing a client to get a watermarked image from a server without revealing her own identity. In particular, we consider the specific scenario where the client is a structured organization being trusted as a whole but involving possibly untrusted members. In such a context, where the watermarked copy can be made available to all members, but only authorized subgroups should be able to remove the watermark and recover a distortion-free image, a multilevel access to the embedding key is provided by applying Birkhoff polynomial interpolation. Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method against standard image degradation operators.", "paper_title": "A multilevel asymmetric scheme for digital fingerprinting", "paper_id": "WOS:000258223800009"}
