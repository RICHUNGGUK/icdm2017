The proposed method can properly solve the complex and discrete DFR optimization problem by the use of an adaptive modification approach based on firefly algorithm (FA). In addition, a new stochastic solution based on 2m Point Estimate Method (2m PEM) is proposed to handle the uncertainty associated with the problem random variables including the active and reactive loads as well as the wind speed variations effectively. The problem is then formulated in a multi-objective optimization structure including four significant targets: 1) active power losses, 2) bus voltage deviation, 3) total system costs and 4) total pollution produced. As a result of the conflicting behavior of the four objective functions, a fuzzy based clustering technique is employed to reach the set of optimal solutions called Pareto solutions. The feasibility and satisfying performance of the proposed method is examined on the IEEE 32-bus standard test system.", "paper_title": "A hybrid fuzzy-PEM stochastic framework to solve the optimal operation management of distribution feeder reconfiguration considering wind turbines", "paper_id": "WOS:000332245500011"}
