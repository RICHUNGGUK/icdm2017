In this paper we develop novel memory-based methods that incorporate the level of a user credit instead of using similarity between users. The user credit is the degree of one's rating reliability that measures how adherently the user rates items as others do. Preliminary simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the conventional memory-based ones. The methods are effective in a cold-starting problem. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
