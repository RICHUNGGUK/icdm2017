SA allows to quantify numerosities, amplitudes and eigenvalues of the transfer function allowing, in this way, to separate kinetic components of the tissue tracer activity with minimal model assumptions. The SA model can be solved with a linear estimator alone or with numerical filters, resulting in different types of SA approaches. Once estimated the number, amplitudes and eigenvalues of the transfer function, one can distinguish the presence in the system of irreversible and/or reversible components as well as derive parameters of physiological significance. These characteristics make it an appealing alternative method to compartmental models which are widely used for the quantitative analysis of dynamic studies acquired with PET. However, despite its applicability to a large number of PET tracers, its implementation is not straightforward and its utilization in the nuclear medicine community has been limited especially by the lack of an user-friendly software application: In this paper we proposed SAKE, a computer program for the quantitative analysis of PET data through the main SA methods. SAKE offers a unified pipeline of analysis usable also by people with limited computer knowledge but with high interest in SA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
