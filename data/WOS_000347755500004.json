This paper describes a new sparse matrix storage format which works in conjunction with a custom memory subsystem which decodes the format on-the-fly. The SMVM operation is implemented on a single FPGA and a small parallel system of four FPGAs. The parameters that affect the performance of the sequential and parallel designs are investigated as well as the speedup for different matrices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
