The proposed approach is composed of two stages. The first one is the modelling of the system attitude dynamics taking into account the induced communication constraints. Then a robust fault detection and evaluation scheme is proposed using a post-filter designed under a particular design objective. This approach is compared with previous results based on the standard Kalman filter and gives better results for sensor fault diagnosis.", "paper_title": "FAULT DIAGNOSIS IN A NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEM UNDER COMMUNICATION CONSTRAINTS: A QUADROTOR APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000348144200009"}
