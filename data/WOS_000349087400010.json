The existing estimation and variable selection methods for this model are mainly built upon which subset of variables have linear or varying effect on the response is known in advance, or say, model structure is determined. However, in application, this is unreasonable. In this work, we propose a simultaneous structure estimation and variable selection method, which can do simultaneous coefficient estimation and three types of selections: varying and constant effects selection, relevant variable selection. It can be easily implemented in one step by employing a penalized M-type regression, which uses a general loss function to treat mean, median, quantile and robust mean regressions in a unified framework. Consistency in the three types of selections and oracle property in estimation are established as well. Simulation studies and real data analysis also confirm our method.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous structure estimation and variable selection in partial linear varying coefficient models for longitudinal data", "paper_id": "WOS:000349087400010"}
