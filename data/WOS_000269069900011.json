The main available technical residual stresses evaluation procedures for applying MID in isotropic materials are reviewed and have been included in the package, it has an easy-to-use, friendly interface, and can be used as a tool to teach the IHD technique or as a laboratory to study its applicability to real world problems. A set of exercises have been prepared, which are freely distributed to our students, in order to show the full potential of the package, but the students can also do simulations and experiments with their own data.
