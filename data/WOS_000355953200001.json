This lectin has been selected for its rather non-druggable binding site, which enables complex interactions that guide the binding of the core monosaccharide. Since optimal orientation is crucial for forming coordination bonds, it was important to assess whether the selected docking tools could reproduce the optimal binding conformation for several oligosaccharides that are known to bind DC-SIGN. Our results show that even widely used docking programs have certain limitations when faced with a rather shallow and featureless binding site, as is the case of DC-SIGN. The FRED docking software (OpenEye Scientific Software, Inc.) was found to score as the best tool for docking ligands to DC-SIGN. The performance of FRED was further assessed on another lectin, Langerin. We have demonstrated that this validated docking protocol could be used for docking to other lectins similar to DC-SIGN.", "paper_title": "Comparative evaluation of several docking tools for docking small molecule ligands to DC-SIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000355953200001"}
