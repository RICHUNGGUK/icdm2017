It has been found that unlike the pristine AlNNT, the Al-rich AlNNT can effectively interact with the HCN molecule so that its conductivity changes upon the exposure to this molecule. The adsorption energies of HCN on the pristine and defected AlNNTs have been calculated to be in the range of -0.16 to -0.62 eV and -1.75 to -2.21 eV, respectively. We believe that creating Al-rich defects may be a good strategy for improving the sensitivity of these tubes toward HCN molecules, which cannot be trapped and detected by the pristine AlNNT.", "paper_title": "Sensing behavior of Al-rich AlN nanotube toward hydrogen cyanide", "paper_id": "WOS:000319362500003"}
