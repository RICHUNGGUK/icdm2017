This paper presents a unified view of several recently proposed algorithms for handling this class of optimization problems, placing them in a common majorization-minimization (MM) framework. One of the classes of algorithms considered (when using quadratic bounds on non-differentiable log-priors) shares the infamous \"singularity issue\" (SI) of \"iteratively reweighted least squares\" (IRLS) algorithms: the possibility of having to handle infinite weights, which may cause both numerical and convergence issues. In this paper, we prove several new results which strongly support the claim that the SI does not compromise the usefulness of this class of algorithms. Exploiting the unified MM perspective, we introduce a new algorithm, resulting from using l(1) bounds for nonconvex regularizers; the experiments confirm the superior performance of this method, when compared to the one based on quadratic majorization. Finally, an experimental comparison of the several algorithms, reveals their relative merits for different standard types of scenarios.", "paper_title": "Majorization-minimization algorithms for wavelet-based image restoration", "paper_id": "WOS:000251295700011"}
