We prove that finitely presented MV-algebras whose maximal spectral space has topological dimension not exceeding 1 do have finite automorphism group. We give examples to show that finite presentability is an essential hypothesis. Our proof produces as an interesting by-product a complete graph-theoretic isomorphism invariant for the class of MV-algebras involved.", "paper_title": "Finitely Presented MV-algebras with Finite Automorphism Group", "paper_id": "WOS:000280314500004"}
