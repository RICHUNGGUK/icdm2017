Stem cell research topics were obtained with LDA and expert judgements made on these topics to test the feasibility of the model classification. Further, the correlation between topics was analysed. HMM was used to predict the trend evolution of topics over various years, and a time series map was used to visualize the evolutional relationships among the stem cell topics.", "paper_title": "Topic evolution based on LDA and HMM and its application in stem cell research", "paper_id": "WOS:000342200700005"}
