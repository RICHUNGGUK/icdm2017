In this paper, we present a new way for people to experience and express pixel art. Our digital art consists of a set of sticks made of acrylate resin, each of which refracts light from a parallel light source, in certain directions. Artistic users are able to easily rearrange these sticks and view their digital art through the refracted light projection on any planar surface. As we demonstrate in this paper, a user can generate various artistic images using only a single set of sticks. We additionally envision that our pixel art with rearrangeable sticks would have great entertainment appeal, e. g., as an art puzzle.", "paper_title": "Pixel Art with Refracted Light by Rearrangeable Sticks", "paper_id": "WOS:000306181700006"}
