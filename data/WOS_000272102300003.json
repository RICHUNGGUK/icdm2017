An important variant of the VRP arises when a mixed fleet of vehicles, characterized by different capacities and costs, is available for distribution activities. The problem is known as fleet size and mix VRP with fixed costs (FSMF) and has several practical applications. In this article, we present a new mixed integer programming formulation for FSMF based on a two-commodity network flow approach. New valid inequalities are proposed to strengthen the linear programming relaxation of the mathematical formulation. The effectiveness of the proposed cuts is extensively tested on benchmark instances. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
