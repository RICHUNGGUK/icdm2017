However, the deployment scenarios, the functionality requirements, and the limited capabilities of these networks expose them to a wide range of attacks against control traffic (such as wormholes, rushing, Sybil attacks. etc.) and data traffic (such as selective forwarding). In this paper we propose a framework called UNMASK that mitigates such attacks by detecting, diagnosing, and isolating the malicious nodes. UNMASK uses as a fundamental building block the ability of a node to oversee its neighboring nodes' communication. On top Of UNMASK, we build a secure routing protocol, LSR, that provides additional protection against malicious nodes by supporting multiple node-disjoint paths. We analyze the security guarantees Of UNMASK and use ns-2 simulations to show its effectiveness against representative control and data attacks. The overhead analysis we present shows that UNMASK is a lightweight protocol appropriate for securing resource constrained sensor networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
