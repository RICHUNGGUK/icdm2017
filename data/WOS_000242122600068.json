It also presents aspects for which future developments in artificial intelligence based techniques could support the objectives of such systems, both during operation and during the more detailed analysis of data after operations and in counteracting future trends in radar developments. These include parameter optimization, learning and predicting outcomes related to unseen data and so on.", "paper_title": "Is there a role for artificial intelligence in future electronic support measures?", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600068"}
