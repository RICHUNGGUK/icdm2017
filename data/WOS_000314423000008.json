However, it is considered as one of the most difficult NP-hard problems, which means that no polynomial-time algorithm is known to solve this intractable problem effectively. Even small instances of QAP may require vast computation time. In this work, a uniform cellular solution to QAP is proposed in the framework of membrane computing by using a family of recognizer tissue P systems with cell division. In the design of the solution, we encode the given instances in binary notations. The paper can be considered as a contribution to the study of considering a binary encoding of the information in P systems.", "paper_title": "A TISSUE P SYSTEM BASED SOLUTION TO QUADRATIC ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000314423000008"}
