Recommender systems have been applied successfully to avoid the information overload in different domains, but the number of electronic resources daily generated keeps growing and the problem rises again. Therefore, we find a persistent problem of information overload. In this paper we propose an improved recommender system to avoid the persistent information overload found in a University Digital Library. The idea is to include a memory to remember selected resources but not recommended to the user, and in such a way, the system could incorporate them in future recommendations to complete the set of filtered resources, for example, if there are a few resources to be recommended or if the user wishes output obtained by combination of resources selected in different recommendation rounds.", "paper_title": "An improved recommender system to avoid the persistent information overload in a university digital library", "paper_id": "WOS:000295512900002"}
