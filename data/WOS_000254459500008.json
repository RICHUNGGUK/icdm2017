Among our algorithms are: (i) A decremental algorithm for maintaining the transitive closure of a directed graph, through an arbitrary sequence of edge deletions, in O(mn) total expected time, essentially the time needed for computing the transitive closure of the initial graph. Such a result was previously known only for acyclic graphs. (ii) Two fully dynamic algorithms for answering reachability queries. The first is deterministic and has an amortized insert/delete time of O(m root n), and worst-case query time of O(root n). The second is randomized and has an amortized insert/delete time of O(m(0.5)8n) and worst-case query time of O(m(0.43)). This significantly improves the query times of algorithms with similar update times. (iii) A fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining the transitive closure of an acyclic graph. The algorithm is deterministic and has a worst-case insert time of O(m), constant amortized delete time of O(1), and a worst-case query time of O(n/log n). Our algorithms are obtained by combining several new ideas, one of which is a simple sampling idea used for detecting decompositions of strongly connected components, with techniques of Even and Shiloach [J.
