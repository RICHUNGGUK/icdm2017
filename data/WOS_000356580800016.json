As such, special-purpose systems have increasingly become the target or path of hacking attacks. From a digital forensics viewpoint, these systems can be used to gather evidence from all the relevant digital devices such as whole systems or storage units at the scene of a crime. Notably, In case of special-purpose embedded system, unlike a conventional computing system, is almost always 'powered on' like server, the accumulated data can remain in the volatile memory. This paper focuses on analyzing ways of gathering physical memory data for application in an embedded system and of developing a test system to analyze the physical memory for verification.", "paper_title": "A study on memory dump analysis based on digital forensic tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000356580800016"}
