Yet, little has been done so far to develop a common conceptual model for both medical and nursing patient records, which is a first challenge that should be met to set up a common electronic patient record. In this paper, we describe a problem-oriented conceptual model and we show how it may suit both nursing and medical perspectives in a hospital setting. Methods: We started from existing nursing theory and from an initial model previously set up for primary care. In a hospital pilot site, a multi-disciplinary team refined this model using one large and complex clinical case (retrospective study) and nine ongoing cases (prospective study). An internal validation was performed through hospital-wide multi-professional inter-views and through discussions around a graphical user interface prototype. To assess the consistency of the model, a computer engineer specified it. Finally, a Belgian expert working group performed an external assessment of the model. Results: As a basis for a common patient record we propose a simple problem-oriented conceptual model with two levels of meta-information. The model is mapped with current nursing theories and it includes the following concepts: \"health care element\", \"health approach\", \"health agent\", \"contact\", \"subcontact\" and \"service\". These concepts, their interrelationships and some practical rules for using the model are illustrated in this paper. Our results are compatible with ongoing standardization work at the Belgian and European levels. Conclusions: Our conceptual model is potentially a foundation for a multi-professional electronic patient record that is problem-oriented and therefore patient-centred. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
