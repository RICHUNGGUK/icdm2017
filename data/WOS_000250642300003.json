Science processes if modeled in workflow forms, i.e. scientific workflows, can be managed more effectively and performed more automatically. However, most current workflow models seldom take account of specific characteristics of science processes and are not very suitable for modeling scientific workflows. Therefore, a new workflow model named problem-based scientific workflow model (PBSWM) is proposed in this paper to accommodate those specific characteristics. Corresponding soundness verification and dynamic modification are discussed accordingly based on the new modelling method. This paper makes three main contributions: (1) three new constructs are proposed for special logic semantics in science processes; (2) verification is deployed with the consideration from both data-specific perspective and control-specific perspective; and (3) a set of rules are provided to automatically infer passive modifications caused by other modifications.
