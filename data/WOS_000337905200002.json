Accurate analytical approaches for the reliability evaluation of logic circuits, however, have a computational complexity that generally increases exponentially with circuit size. This makes intractable the reliability analysis of large circuits. This paper initially presents novel computational models based on stochastic computation; using these stochastic computational models (SCMs), a simulation-based analytical approach is then proposed for the reliability evaluation of logic circuits. In this approach, signal probabilities are encoded in the statistics of random binary bit streams and non-Bernoulli sequences of random permutations of binary bits are used for initial input and gate error probabilities. By leveraging the bit-wise dependencies of random binary streams, the proposed approach takes into account signal correlations and evaluates the joint reliability of multiple outputs. Therefore, it accurately determines the reliability of a circuit; its precision is only limited by the random fluctuations inherent in the stochastic sequences. Based on both simulation and analysis, the SCM approach takes advantages of ease in implementation and accuracy in evaluation. The use of non-Bernoulli sequences as initial inputs further increases the evaluation efficiency and accuracy compared to the conventional use of Bernoulli sequences, so the proposed stochastic approach is scalable for analyzing large circuits. It can further account for various fault models as well as calculating the soft error rate (SER). These results are supported by extensive simulations and detailed comparison with existing approaches.", "paper_title": "A Stochastic Computational Approach for Accurate and Efficient Reliability Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000337905200002"}
