The behaviour of the poroelastic homogeneous soil is governed by Blot's consolidation equations. The pile-soil system is decomposed into extended soil and fictitious piles. Considering the compatibility of vertical strain between fictitious piles and soil, the second kind of Fredholm integral equations were obtained to predict the axial force and settlement along pile shafts numerically. For the analysis of the interaction factor, two loading conditions for a two-dissimilar-pile system were proposed: (a) only one pile is loaded and (b) each pile is subjected to a load proportional to the pile length. Furthermore, the two-pile system was extended to pile groups with a rigid cap to capture the optimum design where each pile shares the same loading at the pile heads. The optimum results require shortening the peripheral piles and elongating internal piles, and the consolidation effect needs to be considered due to the adjustment of loading distribution among piles.
