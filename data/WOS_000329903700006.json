The comparison between the convergence rate of second-order neighbour protocol and the one of general protocol is developed. When multi-agent system achieves maximum speed consensus, the relation between the parameter in general protocol and that in second-order neighbour protocol is analysed. If there exists delay in communication, the delay margins of general protocol and second-order neighbour protocol are derived. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Second-order consensus in multi-agent systems based on second-order neighbours' information", "paper_id": "WOS:000329903700006"}
