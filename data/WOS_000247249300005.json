Fishery scientists have traditionally used fish otoliths, i.e. calcified structures in the inner car to estimate fish age, because their shape changes during a fish's lifetime. However, many factors influence changes in otolith shape, sometimes in unpredictable ways, so manual classification remains a complex task that may yield inaccurate age estimations. Here, we discuss automatic pattern analysis and recognition for accomplishing this task and present a novel application of two well-known kernel methods: kernel principal component analysis and multi-class support vector machines for analyzing and classifying fish ages from otolith images. Significant results were achieved as a result of analyzing a cod otolith database. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
