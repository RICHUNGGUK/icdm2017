As a consequence it is unclear how to design games that are engaging and usable also for people with disabilities. This work analyses perceived usability, entertainment and overall experience provided by three interfaces for blind people with different gaming habits: (1) a keyboard navigation system, (2) a sonar, and (3) a conversational interface. Data collected from a preliminary experience suggests that the three interfaces could be used for games, although (3) seems a better choice for occasional gamers and novice users and (2) for regular and frequent gamers or users seeking new challenges.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of Three Accessible Interfaces for Educational Point-and-Click Computer Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000209590100008"}
