The main result shows that there are examples having small regular resolution refutations, for which any regular refutation must contain a large clause. This forms a contrast with corresponding results for general resolution refutations.", "paper_title": "WIDTH AND SIZE OF REGULAR RESOLUTION PROOFS", "paper_id": "WOS:000307646300008"}
