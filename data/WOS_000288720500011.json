Several sophisticated methods have been developed for the computation of Boolean Grobner bases. However, most of them only deal with Boolean polynomial rings over the simplest coefficient Boolean ring GF(2). Boolean Grobner bases for arbitrary coefficient Boolean rings were first introduced by two of the authors almost two decades ago. While the work is not well-known among computer algebra researchers, recent active work on Boolean Grobner bases inspired us to return to their development. In this paper, we introduce our work on Boolean Grobner bases with arbitrary coefficient Boolean rings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
