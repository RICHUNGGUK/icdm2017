Design/methodology/approach - The supplier selection problem is a typical MADM problem, in which information of a series of indexes should be aggregated. However, it is relatively easy for decision makers to define information in uncertainty, sometimes as a grey number, rather than a precise number. By transforming linguistic scale of rating supplier selection attributes into interval grey numbers, a novel grey MADM method is developed. Steps of proposed model were provided, and a novel grey possibility degree approach was proposed. Finally, a numerical example of supplier selection is utilized to demonstrate the proposed approach. Findings - The results show that the proposed approach could solve the uncertainty decision-making problem. A numerical example of supplier selection is utilized to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed method is useful to aggregate decision makers' information so as to select the potential supplier. Practical implications - The approach constructed in the paper can be used to solving uncertainty decision-making problems that the certain value of the decision information could not collect while the interval value set could be defined. Obviously it can be utilized for other MADM problem. Originality/value - The paper succeeded in redefining interval grey number, constructing a novel interval grey number based MADM approach and providing the solution of the proposed approach. It is very useful to solving system forecasting problem and it contributed undoubtedly to improve grey decision-making models.", "paper_title": "Interval grey numbers based multi-attribute decision making method for supplier selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000341938400008"}
