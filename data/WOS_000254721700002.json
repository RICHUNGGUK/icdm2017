We present visualizations of the molecular structure of each of the four liquids under shear and elongation, and compare them with their equilibrium static structures. These graphics provide a structural understanding of the various statistical measures that have been used in the literature to characterize the change in chain conformation as a function of strain rate and chain length. Moreover, these graphics allow a visualization of the inherent chain dynamics and orientation induced by shear and elongational flows. We discuss the molecular-level mechanisms apparent in the graphics. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
