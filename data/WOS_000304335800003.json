As opposed to some offline algorithms, OIRLSSVR takes the realtime advantage, which is confirmed using benchmark data sets. In comparison with online algorithm, the realtime of OIRLSSVR is also favorable. As for this point, it is tested with experiments on the benchmark data sets and a more realistic scenario namely a diesel engine example. All in all. OIRLSSVR can enhance the modeling realtime, especially for the case where the samples enter in a flow mode. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
