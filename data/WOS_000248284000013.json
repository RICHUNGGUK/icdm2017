Let G be a molecular graph (called a cacti), which all of blocks of G are either edges or cycles. Denote g(n,r) the set of cacti of order n and with r cycles. Obviously, g(n,0) is the set of all trees and g(n, 1) is the set of all unicyclic graphs. In this paper, we present a unified approach to the extremal cactus, which have the same or very similar structures, for Wiener index, Merrifield-Simmons index, Hosoya index and spectral radius. From our results, we can derive sonic known results.", "paper_title": "A unified approach to extremal cacti for different indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000248284000013"}
