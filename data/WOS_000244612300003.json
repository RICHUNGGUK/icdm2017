In RGB stacked OLEDs, blue emitting, 2-t-butyl-9,10-di-(2-naphthyl)anthracene (TBADN) doped with p-bis(p-N,N-diphenyl-amono-styryl)benzene (DSA-Ph), green emitting, tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq) doped with C545, and red emitting, tris-[8-hydroxyquinoline]aluminum (Alq) doped with 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)- 4H-pyran (DCJTB), were used. By adjusting the order and thickness of emitting layer in RBG structure, we got a white OLED with current efficiency of 5.60 cd/A and Commission Internationale De L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.34, 0.34) at 200 mA/cm(2). Its maximum luminance was 20,700 cd/ m(2) at current density of 400 mA/cm(2). The results have been explained on the basis of the theory of excitons generation and diffusion. According to the theory of excitons generation and diffusion, an equation has been set up which relates EL spectra to the thickness of every layer and to the exciton diffusion length.
