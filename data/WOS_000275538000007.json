A nonlinear delayed model is considered for a rate-based congestion control system of a heterogeneous network with arbitrary topology and time-varying delays. We propose a Lyapunov-based method to obtain a sufficient condition under which global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium is guaranteed. The main contribution of the paper lies in considering time variations of delays in a heterogeneous network which may be applicable in actual networks. Moreover, we obtain conditions for Internet-style networks with multi-source multi-link topology. We first prove the stability for a class of nonlinear time-delay systems. Then, we apply the results to a Kelly's rate-based approximation of the congestion control system.", "paper_title": "Global stability analysis of computer networks with arbitrary topology and time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000275538000007"}
