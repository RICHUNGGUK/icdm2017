Also, consulting experience in four major Serbian companies was used to further elaborate and explain the results in the context of modern literature and practice. Conclusions were that ICT adoption is more frequently expressed in decentralized companies, empirically described by dominant liberal style of management, although ICT adoption can also lead to centralization in some cases, depending on other factors in the organization.", "paper_title": "Influence of Information and Communication Technologies on Decentralization of Organizational Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000268481800005"}
