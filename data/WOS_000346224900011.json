The BRB methodology is developed from the evidential reasoning (ER) approach and traditional IF-THEN rule based system. It can be used to model complicated nonlinear causal relationships between antecedent attributes and consequents under different types of uncertainty. In a BRB model, various types of information and knowledge with uncertainties can be represented using belief structures, and a belief rule is designed with belief degrees embedded in its possible consequents. In this paper, we first introduce the BRB methodology for modelling uncertain nonlinear systems. Then we present a comparative analysis of three BRB identification models through combining the BRB methodology with nonlinear optimisation techniques. The novel BRB identification models using l(infinity)-norm and minimising mean uncertainties in belief rules (MUBR) show remarkable capabilities of capturing the lower and upper bounds of the interval outputs of uncertain nonlinear systems simultaneously. Trade-off analysis between identification accuracy and interval credibility are briefly discussed. Finally, a numerical study of a simplified car dynamics is conducted to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the BRB identification models for the modelling and identification of uncertain nonlinear systems.
