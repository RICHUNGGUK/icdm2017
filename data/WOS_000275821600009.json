The prominent feature of our hybrid calculus is that it reduces reasoning about qualified number restrictions to integer linear programming. The calculus decides SHQ Abox consistency w.r.t. a Tbox containing general axioms. The presented approach ensures a more informed calculus which adequately handles the interaction between numerical and logical restrictions in SHQ concept and individual descriptions. A prototype reasoner for deciding ALCHQ concept satisfiability has been implemented. An empirical evaluation of our hybrid reasoner and its integrated optimization techniques for a set of synthesized benchmarks featuring qualified number restrictions clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our hybrid calculus.", "paper_title": "Practical reasoning with qualified number restrictions: A hybrid Abox calculus for the description logic SHQ", "paper_id": "WOS:000275821600009"}
