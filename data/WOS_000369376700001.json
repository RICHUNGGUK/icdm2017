However, the development of cyberphysical systems is constrained by security factors. According to this situation, this paper put forward a CPS security model, which contains security objectives, basic theories, simulation, and CPS framework, summarizes security attacks to cyber-physical systems as a theoretical reference for the study of cyber-physical systems and to provide useful security defense. Based on the cyber-physical systems framework, the paper classifies attacks for the execution layer, transport layer and control layer. The execution layer attacks include security attacks for nodes such as sensors and actuators. Transport layer attacks include data leakage or damage and security issues during massive data integration. Control layer attacks include the loss of user privacy, incorrect access control policies and inadequate security standards. This paper gives security defenses and recommendations for all types of security attacks. Finally, this paper introduces categorizations of CPS application fields and explores their relationships.", "paper_title": "A Security Architecture in Cyber-Physical Systems: Security Theories, Analysis, Simulation and Application Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000369376700001"}
