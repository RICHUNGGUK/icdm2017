The 2DCUDA method seeks to explore color uncorrelated discriminant properties of the color face images and eliminate the correlations between color-based features. The novelties of this paper are twofold. First, this paper develops a new color-based feature for face recognition, which can provide substantial mutual complementation information and improve the recognition performance. Second, theoretical analysis guarantees the uncorrelated property of the obtained color-based features. Comparative experiments on AR and FRGC-2 color face databases have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than other color face recognition methods and the two-dimensional color uncorrelated discriminant features are more effective for low-resolution image compared with conventional gray-based features. Finally, we explain why the proposed algorithm can improve the recognition performance compared with other color face recognition methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
