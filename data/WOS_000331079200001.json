An outer decoder that corrects epsilon errors and theta erasures with high probability if lambda epsilon + theta <= d(o) - 1, where a real number 1 < lambda <= 2 is the trade-off rate between errors and erasures for this decoder is used. In particular, an outer l-punctured RS code, i.e., a code over the field F-q(l) of length n(o) < q with locators taken from the sub-field F-q, where l is an element of {1, 2,...} is considered. In this case, the trade-off is given by lambda = 1 + 1/l. An m-trial decoder, where after inner decoding, in each trial we erase an incremental number of symbols and decode using the outer decoder is proposed. The optimal erasing strategy and the error correcting radii of both fixed and adaptive erasing decoders are given. Our approach extends results of Forney and Kovalev (obtained for lambda = 2) to the whole given range of lambda. For the fixed erasing strategy the error correcting radius approaches rho(F) approximate to d(i)d(o)/2 (1 - l(-m)/2) for large d(o). For the adaptive erasing strategy, the error correcting radius rho(A) approximate to d(i)d(o)/2 (1 - l(-2m)) quickly approaches d(i)d(o)/2 or m grows. The minimum number of trials required to reach an error correcting radius d(i)d(o)/2 is m(A) = 1/2(log(l) d + 1). This means that 2 or 3 trials are sufficient in many practical cases if l > 1.", "paper_title": "ON MULTI-TRIAL FORNEY-KOVALEV DECODING OF CONCATENATED CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000331079200001"}
