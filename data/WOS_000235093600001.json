Such manipulations tend to be tedious and error-prone manual processes that are not easily automated. We show that most field problems may be solved directly by using approximate distance fields computed from designed or sampled geometric data, thus avoiding many of the difficult reconstruction and meshing problems. With distances we can model fields that satisfy boundary conditions while approximating the governing differential equations to arbitrary precision. Because the method is based on sampling, it provides natural control for multi-resolution both in geometric detail of the domain and in accuracy of the computed physical field. We demonstrate the field modeling capability with several heat transfer applications, including a typical transient problem and a 'scan and solve' approach to the simulation of a physical field in a real-world artifact.
