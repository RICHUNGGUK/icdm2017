The nonlinear systems considered here are more general than feedforward systems ( upper triangular systems). By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov - Krasovskii functional (LKF) and solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the delay-dependent controller making the closed-loop system globally asymptotically stable (GAS) is explicitly constructed. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic stabilization via output feedback for nonlinear systems with delayed output", "paper_id": "WOS:000239238200001"}
