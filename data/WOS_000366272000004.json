The states are first clustered and next, a range of bootstrapped scores is generated to manifest the estimated variability in the road safety performance. Bootstrapping the original DEA scores showed to be a useful strategy to assess the robustness of the states' ranking.", "paper_title": "Bootstrapping DEA Scores for Road Safety Strategic Analysis in Brazil", "paper_id": "WOS:000366272000004"}
