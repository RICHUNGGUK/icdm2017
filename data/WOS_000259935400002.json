The efficiency of the approach is investigated through analysis and numerical experiments, revealing a method which in many cases performs better than the Filon-type method. It is shown that considerable savings in terms of the required number of potentially expensive moments can be expected. The case of multivariate oscillatory integrals is discussed briefly.", "paper_title": "A COMBINED FILON/ASYMPTOTIC QUADRATURE METHOD FOR HIGHLY OSCILLATORY PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000259935400002"}
