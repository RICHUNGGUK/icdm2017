A TSV and inductance aware cell-based 3-D power network model is proposed and evaluated. Constant TSV aspect ratio and constant TSV area penalty scaling, as two scenarios of TSV technology scaling, are discussed. A comparison of power noise among via-first, via-middle, and via-last TSV technologies with CMOS scaling is also presented. When the TSV technology is a primary bottleneck in high performance 3-D ICs, an increasing TSV area penalty should be adopted to produce lower power noise. As a promising TSV technology, via-middle TSVs are shown to produce the lowest power noise with CMOS technology scaling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
