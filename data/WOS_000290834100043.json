In this short paper we focus on multi-material fluid flows. We present a hybrid remapping method combining the swept remapping algorithm in pure regions with the intersection-based remapping algorithm close to material interfaces. We describe the hybrid remapping method in two formulations, as a one-step and a two-step procedure and compare behaviour of both approaches with the standard intersection-based algorithm using several numerical examples.
