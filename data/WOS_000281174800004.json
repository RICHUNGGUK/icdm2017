Firstly, a chaotic high speed stream cipher is implemented based on coupled nonlinear dynamic filters (CNDF), in which the CNDF are constructed to have flows inverse to each other. Secondly, renewable and privacy preserving palmprint templates are generated using the CNDF chaotic stream cipher with multiple orientation palmprint features obtained from a bank of Gabor filters and encoded in a phase-coding scheme. Compared with the standard palmprint templates, the cancelable templates have greater ability to discriminate palmprints from different hands by increasing the inter-class divergence of different palms more effectively, while maintaining the intra-class distance among palmprints of the same hands. Lastly, the matching stage is performed directly on the cancelable/encryption domain in parallel to accelerate matching and to protect user's privacy. Several fusion rules are investigated for the matching scores of different directional Palm-Codes to obtain the final matching score. Compared with Max, Min, Median and Product fusion rules, the Sum rule can greatly accelerate the speed and improve the performance Experimental results on the Hong Kong PolyU Palmprint Database verify that the proposed cancelable templates can achieve very high performance and security levels with a very strong ability to reissue palmprint templates. The proposed method can also be implemented at high speed, which satisfies the needs of real-time applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
