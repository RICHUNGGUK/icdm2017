Recent advances in VE techniques have resulted in their being widely used in many areas, in particular, the E-learning-based training applications. Many researchers have developed the techniques for designing and implementing the 3D virtual environment; however, the existing approaches cannot fully catch up the increasing complexity of modern VE applications. In this paper, we designed and implemented a very attracting web-based 3D virtual environment application that aims to help the training practice of personnel working in the radiology department of a hospital. Furthermore, we presented a model-based formal approach using discrete event system specification (DEVS) to help us in validating the X3D components' behavior. As a step further, DEVS also helps to optimize our design through simulating the design alternatives.
