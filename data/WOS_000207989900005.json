In this research we analyze differences in end users' perceptions of corporate strategic factors among four situations divided by information system flexibility and information resource visibility. The results suggest that perceptions of corporate strategic factors on information system flexibility, and on information resource visibility, are significantly different. Also, perceptions of the corporate strategic factors among four situations from IS/IT contexts are significantly different. We suggest that top managers pay more attention to understanding the differences between end users' cognitions among different situations in IS/IT contexts, in order to achieve alignment between IS/IT strategy and business strategy.", "paper_title": "A Study for End Users' Perceptions of Business Strategic Factors among Different IS/IT Contexts", "paper_id": "WOS:000207989900005"}
