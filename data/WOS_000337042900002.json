In this paper, we investigate devastating consequences of link failures in networks. We propose an exact algorithm and a spectral lower-bound on the minimum number of removed links to incur a significant level of disruption. Our exact solution can identify optimal solutions in both uniform and weighted networks through solving a well-constructed mixed integer program. Also, our spectral lower-bound derives from the Laplacian eigenvalues an estimation on the vulnerability of large networks that are intractable for exact methods. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Bound and exact methods for assessing link vulnerability in complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337042900002"}
