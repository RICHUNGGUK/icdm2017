In the system, a CCD camera is employed as an image sensor for detecting motions of a backing-up car. The fuzzy logic controller receives the motion information from the image sensor, and then generates the steering signal of the car to complete a closed-loop control system of backing-up an autonomous vehicle. The MATLAB/Simulink are installed in a PC to execute the control action through a model car, driven by two electric motors. Both simulations and experimental results are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A vision-based fuzzy logic controller for backing-up an autonomous vehicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000260458700005"}
