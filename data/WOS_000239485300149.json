The film characteristics to model were deposition rate and positive charge density. Model performance was evaluated as a function of two training factors, the spread range and a factor employed for balancing training and prediction errors. For comparison, GRNN models were constructed as well as four types of statistical regression models. Compared to conventional GRNN models, GA-GRNN models improved the prediction accuracy considerably by about 50% for either film characteristic. The improvements over statistical regression models were more pronounced and they were more than 60%. There results clearly reveal that the presented technique can significantly improve conventional GRNN predictions.", "paper_title": "Prediction of plasma enhanced deposition process using GA-Optimized GRNN", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300149"}
