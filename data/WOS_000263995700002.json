However, the time domain DFT-S-GMC system has a relatively high implementation complexity and is difficult to analyze its signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR). In addition, the existing link-to-system mapping methods for OFDM-based systems cannot be utilized in the DFT-S-GMC systems. In this paper, we first propose a novel frequency domain transceiver model for the DFT-S-GMC system, which can effectively simplify the SINR analysis. Then, we derive the closed-form SINR expressions for the link-to-system mapping of DFT-S-GMC system with Alamouti-like space-time block-coding (STBC). It is demonstrated that the theoretical SINR expressions match the simulation results very well. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
