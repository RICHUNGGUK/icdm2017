This task requires that hovering vehicles remain stable and balanced in flight as payload mass is added to the vehicle. If payload is not loaded centered or the vehicle properly trimmed for offset loads, the robot will experience bias forces that must be rejected. In this paper, we explore the effect of dynamic load disturbances introduced by instantaneously increased payload mass and how those affect helicopters and quadrotors under Proportional-Integral-Derivative flight control. We determine stability bounds within which the changing mass-inertia parameters of the system due to the acquired object will not destabilize these aircraft with this standard flight controller. Additionally, we demonstrate experimentally the stability behavior of a helicopter undergoing a range of instantaneous step payload changes.", "paper_title": "Stability of small-scale UAV helicopters and quadrotors with added payload mass under PID control", "paper_id": "WOS:000305227600008"}
