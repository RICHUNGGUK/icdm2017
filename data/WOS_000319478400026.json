In this approach, users partition an image into regions, assigning a type or style to each of them. Next, a grid is generated over the drawing space, based on the parameters specified for each region. The illustration is then obtained in the form of a path that covers most areas of the grid. Contrary to previous works, our approach allows users to control the overall flow of the line throughout any given region, by providing the means to define tensor fields per region which directly influence the line orientation. We also extend this work for generating continuous-line paintings, a similar style consisting of a single line that varies in color and thickness while covering the entire drawing space. This is achieved by transforming drawings obtained with the above-mentioned approach through a Voronoi-based strategy.", "paper_title": "Abstracting images into continuous-line artistic styles", "paper_id": "WOS:000319478400026"}
