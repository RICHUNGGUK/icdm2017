The system performance is evaluated with an intelligent index of performance. The reconfiguration mechanism is based on a model predictive controller and reference trajectory management techniques. When an actuator fault occurs in the system, a new degraded reference trajectory is generated and the controller calculates new admissible controls. A constraint set and cost function are established to avoid actuator saturation and reduce the control energy spent in closed loop dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using a hydrothermal system subject to actuator faults and constraints on actuator dynamic ranges.", "paper_title": "PERFORMANCE EVALUATION BASED FAULT TOLERANT CONTROL WITH ACTUATOR SATURATION AVOIDANCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000295124400004"}
