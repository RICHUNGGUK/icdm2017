A combined exploitation of suitably defined statistical tools is presented to appreciate the intensity of the dispersion, of response variables both. physically via the variance, and, statistically through the kurtosis or fourth-order moment. The. usefulness of this method to analyze resonances is illustrated by the study of a transmission line affected by two different types of random geometrical perturbations, viz. a local deformation modeled by a wavelet and global sinusoidal undulations.", "paper_title": "Variance and kurtosis-based characterization of resonances in stochastic transmission lines: local versus global random geometries", "paper_id": "WOS:000273220900003"}
