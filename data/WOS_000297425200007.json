Compared to traditional wireless sensor networks, the routing design of WMSN has higher requirements on the quality of service (QoS). This paper systemically analyzes the similarity between social network and WMSN, then designs a QoS trust estimation model based on social network analysis, which enables each sensor node measuring the service quality by monitoring the behaviors of neighbor nodes. An energy efficient QoS assurance routing based on cluster hierarchy (EEQAR) is proposed to achieve energy efficiency and meet the requirement of QoS. To obtain a better performance, EEQAR routing adopts cellular topology to form the cluster structure and balance the energy consumption by structure movement. The simulation results show the high performance of EEQAR routing in lifetime and quality of service.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficiency QoS Assurance Routing in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297425200007"}
