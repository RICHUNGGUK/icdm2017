It turned out that the definition on which the construction is based was inappropriate, and thus the proof of the property was flawed. We give here the correct definition of the broken derived terms of an expression which allow to define the automaton and the detailed full proof of the property.", "paper_title": "CORRIGENDUM TO OUR PAPER: HOW EXPRESSIONS CAN CODE FOR AUTOMATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000283579400004"}
