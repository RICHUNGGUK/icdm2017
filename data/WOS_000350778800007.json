By applying the Laplace-Hankel transform to the state variables involved in the basic governing equations, the analytical layer-element which describes the relationship between the transformed generalized stresses and displacements is obtained. Considering the continuity conditions between adjacent layers and the boundary conditions, the global stiffness matrix for a multilayered system is assembled and solved in the transformed domain. The actual solutions of the problem in the physical domain are acquired by inverting the Laplace-Hankel transform. Finally, some numerical examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method and to illustrate the influences of the heat source's types and the anisotropy of thermal diffusivity on the thermo-elastic response.
