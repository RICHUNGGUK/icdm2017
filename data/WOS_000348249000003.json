The proposed method uses the side-match distortion (SMD) function to sort the codebook so as to make an index value become very close to its neighboring index values, then the residual value between the index and its neighboring index is obtained by bitwise exclusive-OR operation and the secret bits are embedded into the residual value according to our embedding rules based on joint neighboring coding. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms the related existing data hiding methods in embedding performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
