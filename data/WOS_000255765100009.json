Solution of the master equation may require calculating eigenvalues for the corresponding eigenvalue problem. In this paper, we numerically study the folding rate for a dynamic problem of protein folding by solving a large-scale eigenvalue problem. Three methods, the implicitly restarted Arnoldi. Jacobi-Davidson. and QR methods are employed in solving the corresponding large-scale eigenvalue problem for the transition matrix of master equation. Comparison shows that the QR method demands tremendous computing resource when the length of sequence L > 10 due to extremely large size of matrix and CPU time limitation. The Jacobi-Davidson method may encounter convergence issue, for cases of L > 9. The implicitly restarted Arnoldi method is suitable for solving problems among them. Parallelization of the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method is successfully implemented on a PC-based Linux cluster. The parallelization scheme mainly partitions the operation of matrix. For the Arnoldi factorization. we replicate the upper Hessenberg matrix H-m for each processor, and distribute the set of Arnoldi vectors V-m among processors. Each processor performs its own operation. The algorithm is implemented on a PC-based Linux cluster with message passing interface (MPI) libraries. Numerical experiment performing on our 32-nodes PC-based Linux cluster shows that the maximum difference among processors is within 10%. A 23-times speedup and 72% parallel efficiency are achieved when the matrix size is greater than 2 x 106 on the 32-nodes PC-based Linux cluster. This parallel approach enables us to explore large-scale dynamics of protein folding. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
