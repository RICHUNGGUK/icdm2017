A computer system is usually modeled as a network topology with arcs and vertices where each arc denotes a delivery medium and each vertex denotes an Internet data center. Each component (arc and vertex) of a network should be considered as multi-state owing to the failure, partial failure, maintenance, etc., of the components. Evaluating the delivery reliability of a network with imperfect vertices is a complicated process. This type of network, called a multi-state imperfect vertex computer network, is addressed in this paper. We study how data can be delivered through multiple minimal paths simultaneously within the permitted PER and latency. An algorithm is proposed to assess delivery reliability. To show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution, we implemented the proposed solution on practical computer networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
