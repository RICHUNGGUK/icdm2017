Furthermore, we presented a new neural network model including both intrinsic disturbance of single node and communication noise over the network connections. Only one controller is used for the stabilization of the neural networks in terms of LMIs, and the prescribed L-2-gain condition is satisfied. The proposed linear matrix inequality results are easy to be solved by standard commercial software. An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the result. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
