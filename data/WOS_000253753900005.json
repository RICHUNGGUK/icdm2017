A basic problem is to determine nonzero integer vectors x such that L(x)=0, and the maximum norm parallel to x parallel to is relatively small compared with the size of the coefficients a(1), a(2), ..., a(n) . The main result of this paper asserts that there exist linearly independent vectors x(1), ..., x(n-1)is an element of Z(n) such that L(x(i)) = 0, i = 1, ..., n-1, and parallel to x parallel to ... parallel to x(n-1)parallel to parallel to a parallel to/ sigma(n,) where a = (a(1), a(2), ..., a(n)) and sigma(n) = 2/pi integral(infinity)(0) (sin t/t)(n) dt.
