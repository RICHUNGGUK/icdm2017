The successful porting of reverse time migration (RTM), a data-intensive algorithm and one of the largest uses of computational resources in seismic exploration, is described, and results are presented demonstrating that the CAF implementation provides comparable performance to an equivalent MPI version. We then discuss further language extensions for supporting scalable parallel I/O operating on the massive data sets that are typical of applications used in seismic exploration.", "paper_title": "A Coarray Fortran implementation to support data-intensive application development", "paper_id": "WOS:000336424400034"}
