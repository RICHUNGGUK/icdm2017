In this paper, we consider the general quantitative model of weighted transition systems, where transitions are labeled with elements of a finite metric space. We study the so-called point-wise and accumulating simulation distances which provide extensions to the well-known Boolean notion of simulation on labeled transition systems. We introduce weighted process algebras for finite and regular behavior and offer sound and (approximate) complete inference systems for the proposed simulation distances. We also settle the algorithmic complexity of computing the simulation distances. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
