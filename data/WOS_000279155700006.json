However, our research finds that presence is a much richer theoretical construct than these studies suggest. Building on this viewpoint and drawing on prior communication research, we more fully explore the application of three types of presence-physical presence, social presence, and self-presence-to mobile services design and to the corresponding opportunities for value creation. We present a series of design challenges for mobility and identify opportunities for overcoming these challenges by incorporating presence. The implications of designing with presence are (1) a greater awareness of and response to the users' needs and behaviors; (2) strategies for design that leverage this awareness; and (3) methods for integrating unique features of mobile devices based on user-driven and environment-driven factors rather than technology-driven factors. Our research suggests the development of middle-range theories of presence for specific application domains such as mobility that combine theoretical aspects of presence theory with the real-world design factors of mobile services. Numerous real-world examples illustrate both the complete nature of presence and its application to mobile services.", "paper_title": "Value Creation of Mobile Services Through Presence: Designing Mobile Information and Entertainment Applications with Presence in Mind", "paper_id": "WOS:000279155700006"}
