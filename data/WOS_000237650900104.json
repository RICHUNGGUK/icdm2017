The FH/MC DS-CDMA scheme achieves the diversity gain the frequency diversity gain as well as the time diversity gain. The proposed system can achieve the frequency diversity gain provided by Fast Multi-carrier hopping, and the proposed system creates the time diversity gain with maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the Rake receiver. Therefore, the performance of this Fast FH MC-DS/CDMA is improved compared to the conventional MC-CDMA in the frequency selective fading channel.", "paper_title": "Adaptive multi-carrier direct-sequence CDMA system using Fast-Frequency-Hopping", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900104"}
