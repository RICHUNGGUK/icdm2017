We propose a fast delay, angle, and power adaptive holograms (FDAPA-Holograms) approach based on a divide and conquer (D&C) methodology and evaluate it with angle diversity receivers in a mobile optical wireless system. The ultimate goal is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduce the effect of inter-symbol interference, and eliminate the need to calculate the hologram at each transmitter and receiver location. A significant improvement is achieved in the presence of demanding background illumination noise, receiver noise, multipath propagation, mobility, and shadowing typical in a realistic indoor environment. The combination of beam delay, angle, and power adaptation offers additional degrees of freedom in the link design, resulting in a system that is able to achieve higher data rates (5 Gb/s). At a higher data rate of 5 Gb/s and under eye safety regulations, the proposed FDAPA-Holograms system offers around 13 dB SNR with full mobility in a realistic environment where shadowing exists. The fast search algorithm introduced that is based on a D&C algorithm reduces the computation time required to identify the optimum hologram. Simulation results show that the proposed system, FDAPA-Holograms, can reduce the time required to identify the optimum hologram position from 64 ms taken by a classic adaptive hologram to about 14 ms.", "paper_title": "Hologram Selection in Realistic Indoor Optical Wireless Systems With Angle Diversity Receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000359583200009"}
