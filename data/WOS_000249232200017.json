The aim is to propose an algorithm to find spatial solitons, i.e. solutions with a harmonic behaviour in time and along the fibre but with a field distribution in the cross-section corresponding to a self-trapped propagation of the electromagnetic field. Design/methodology/approach - The field is supposed to be harmonic in time and along the direction of invariance of the fibre but inhomogeneous in the cross-section. This modifies the refractive index profile of the fibre (a step-index one in this study). A scalar model of the fibre, together with the finite element method (that is well suited to deal with inhomogeneous media), is used and a new iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the non-linear solutions. An adaptive meshing is necessary to guarantee the accuracy of the model. Findings - The new algorithm converges to self-coherent solutions that are different from those obtained via a fixed power algorithm. The equivalents both of a fundamental mode and of a second order mode are studied. Originality/value - The approach acknowledges the findings of the previously known spatial solitons (with a slight modification of the algorithm) together with a new family of solutions. It opens a new field of investigation to understand this whole family of non-linear solutions as it shows that only a small part of them was known up to now.", "paper_title": "A finite element analysis of spatial solitons in optical fibres", "paper_id": "WOS:000249232200017"}
