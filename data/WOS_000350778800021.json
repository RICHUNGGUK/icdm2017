The objective function of the homogeneous isotropic slope safety factor is optimized by nonlinear sequential quadratic programming. The stability charts of homogeneous isotropic slopes under simple conditions are developed by the analysis of substantial data and those of slopes under different conditions, by considering the effects of typical factors such as surcharge load, pore water pressure, and horizontal seismic forces. These charts can be quickly and easily used to determine the safety factor and corresponding slope failure mechanism under different typical conditions. The failure mechanisms of sample slopes under different conditions are provided to illustrate the uses of these stability charts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
