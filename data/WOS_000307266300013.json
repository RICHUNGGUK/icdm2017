Tissue P systems are a class of the most investigated computing models in the framework of membrane computing, especially in the aspect of efficiency. To generate an exponential resource in a polynomial time, cell separation is incorporated into such systems, thus obtaining so called tissue P systems with cell separation. In this work, we exploit the computational efficiency of this model and construct a uniform family of such tissue P systems for solving the independent set problem, a well-known NP-complete problem, by which an efficient solution can be obtained in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "A uniform solution to the independent set problem through tissue P systems with cell separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000307266300013"}
