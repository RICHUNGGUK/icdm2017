A new particle updating strategy is proposed based upon the concept of fuzzy global-best to deal with the problem of premature convergence and diversity maintenance within the swarm. The proposed features are examined to show their individual and combined effects in MO optimization. The comparative study shows the effectiveness of the proposed MA, which produces solution sets that are highly competitive in terms of convergence, diversity, and distribution.", "paper_title": "A multiobjective memetic algorithm based on particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000244131800005"}
