For this, we consider a signaling pathway of four-tiered protein kinase cascades with each tier involving single (de) phosphorylation reactions only. In the case of a small cell, we propose a short positive feedback for short-range cell signaling, which can generate bistability to facilitate the phosphoprotein signal propagation from the plasma membrane to the periphery of cell nucleus. In contrast, in the case of a large cell for which the long-range signaling cannot be achieved by the short feedback, we propose a long positive feedback, and find that it can facilitate the propagation of phosphoprotein signal over along distance. These results imply that positive-feedback mechanisms would be employed by living organisms for spatial information transfer and cellular decision-making processing", "paper_title": "POSITIVE FEEDBACK-ASSISTED SHORT/LONG-RANGE CELL SIGNALINGS IN MAPK CASCADES", "paper_id": "WOS:000272468000006"}
