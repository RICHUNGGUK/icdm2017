The Estrada index EE of G is the sum of the terms e(lambda i). Let T(p, q) denote the set of all trees with a given (p, q)-bipartition, where q >= p >= 2. And D(p, q) denotes the double star which is obtained by joining the centers of two stars S(p) and S(q) by an edge. In this note, we will show that D(p,q) has the maximal Estrada index in T(p, q).", "paper_title": "A Note on the Maximal Estrada Index of Trees with a Given Bipartition", "paper_id": "WOS:000296211400005"}
