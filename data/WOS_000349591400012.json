An integrated integer programming model is presented which is based on an approximate reduced time-band network and a passenger transiting relationship. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with reassigning aircraft and passengers to flights. A feasibility analysis for the problem is conducted to obtain the necessary conditions under which aircraft and passenger recovery is possible. Solutions are obtained to the network model with CPLEX and then, if necessary, adjusted to more accurately reflect actual costs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by analyzing several scenarios that were developed using data from a big airline in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
