Diggavi and Grossglauser considered codebooks with codewords generated by a first-order Markov chain. They only consider typical outputs, where an output is typical if an N bit input gives an N (1 - d) (1 - c) bit output. The improvements in this correspondence arise from two considerations. First, a stronger notion of a typical output from the channel is used, which yields better bounds even for the codebooks studied by Diggavi and Grossglauser. Second, codewords generated by more general processes than first-order Markov chains are considered.", "paper_title": "On lower bounds for the capacity of deletion channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776500026"}
