Compared with previous schemes, these schemes have better performance and shorter private/public key length. Moreover, they have fewer public values and simpler construction, as well as various methods for the reconstruction phase. Altogether, they are easy to use and provide great capabilities for many applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
