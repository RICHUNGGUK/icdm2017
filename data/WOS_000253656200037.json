The exact value of linear complexity k(6e)(omega) is determined when the parameter r = Sigma(omega)(i=1) 3(ei). Furthermore, the upper bound of the linear complexity is given when the other forms of the value r is taken. Finally, a Maple program is designed to illustrate the validity of the results.", "paper_title": "On the linear complexity of some ternary sequences with ideal autocorrelation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253656200037"}
