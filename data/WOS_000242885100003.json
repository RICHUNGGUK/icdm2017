The scheme combines features of the box-scheme of Keller, [20], [13], with the hermitian approximation of the gradient on a compact stencil, which is characteristic of compact schemes, [9], [21]. The resulting scheme is proved to be 4th order accurate for the primitive unknown u and its gradient p. The proved convergence rate is 1.5 for (u,p) in the discrete L(2)p norm. The connection with a non standard mixed finite element method is given. Finally, numerical results are displayed on pertinent 1-D elliptic problems with high contrasts in the ellipticity, showing in practice convergence rates ranging from 1 to 2.5 in the discrete H-1 norm.", "paper_title": "A hermitian box-scheme for one-dimensional elliptic equations - Application to problems with high contrasts in the ellipticity", "paper_id": "WOS:000242885100003"}
