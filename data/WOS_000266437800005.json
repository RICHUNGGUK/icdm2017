Empirical evidence derived from human subject experiments indicates an inverse relationship between a peripherally degraded scene's high-resolution inset size and mean search time, a trend consistent with existing image-based and model-based techniques. In addition, the data suggest that maintaining a target's silhouette edges decreases search times when compared to targets with degraded edges. However, analysis suggests a point of diminishing returns with an inset larger than 15 degrees when target discrimination is a component of visual search. Benefits of the hybrid technique include simplicity of design and parallelizability, both conducive to GPU implementation.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Image/Model-Based Gaze-Contingent Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000266437800005"}
