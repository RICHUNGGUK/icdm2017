However, many social factors influence people's preferences for taking buses. These social factors may include heavy traffic cost, traffic congestion, poor air quality and so forth. Existing prediction techniques rarely consider social sensing when predicting the bus arrival time. Accordingly, this paper proposes a social sensing enhanced service for predicting bus routes, which integrates sensing ability and social networks to understand and measure the influence between social events and vehicle velocity. We focus on the analysis of two different attributions: PT service quality attributions PEAs and road condition attributions PRCAs. Both of them synthesize the social sensing in their evaluation of bus routes. PEA represents individual preferences and PRCA represents physical factors that significantly influence vehicle velocity. Bus relevant social events were further categorized into PEA events or PRCA events. PEAs of buses were scored according to the tendency of bus conditions reflected in social events. Furthermore, an artificial neural network prediction model is established to estimate the bus travel time.
