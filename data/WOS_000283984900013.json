This work presents a general methodology that integrates control issues and real-time schedulability analysis to improve the control performance in embedded systems with time and resource constraints. The performance increase is achieved by properly selecting task periods and deadlines under feasibility constraints.", "paper_title": "Parameter Selection for Real-Time Controllers in Resource-Constrained Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283984900013"}
