WMNs must deal with the highly unstable wireless medium. Therefore, the design of algorithms that consider link quality to choose the best routes are enabling routing metrics and protocols to evolve. In this work, we analyze the state of the art in WMN metrics and propose a taxonomy for WMN routing protocols. Performance measurements for a WMN, deployed using various routing metrics, are presented and corroborate our analysis.", "paper_title": "Routing metrics and protocols for wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000252577200003"}
