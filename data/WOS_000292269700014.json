By exploiting the inherent structure association between OSTBC and QOSTBC, the proposed schemes can obtain the full-rate and good performance while keeping the coding complexity as super-orthogonal space-time coding schemes for 2 transmit antennas. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperforms the existing super-quasi orthogonal space-time coding schemes by almost 2 dB.", "paper_title": "Super-orthogonal space-time code design based on the trellis diagram integrated operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000292269700014"}
