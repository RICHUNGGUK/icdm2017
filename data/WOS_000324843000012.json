Warning messages can be exchanged among nearby vehicles, helping to predict dangerous situations, and thus improving road safety. Such safety messages require fast delivery and minimal delay to local areas, in order for them to be effective. Therefore, a fast and efficient channel access scheme is required. A feasible solution, derived from the Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) field, groups nodes into smaller manageable sections called clusters. Such an approach can be beneficial for locally delivering messages under strict time constraints. In this paper, a Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm (HCA) is presented. HCA is a distributed randomized algorithm, which manages channel access by forming three hierarchy clusters. The proposed channel access scheme enables delay bounded reliable communication. Unlike other common clustering algorithm for VANETs, HCA does not require the knowledge of the vehicles' locations. This feature guarantees accurate operation even when localization systems such as GPS are not available. The running time and message complexity were analyzed and simulated. Simulation results show that the algorithm behaves well especially under realistic mobility patterns; therefore, it is a suitable solution for channel access scheme for VANETs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
