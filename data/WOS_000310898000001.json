A semi-supervised logistic model with Gaussian basis functions is presented along with the technique of graph-based regularization. A crucial issue in modeling process is the choice of tuning parameters included in the nonlinear semi-supervised logistic models. In order to select these adjusted parameters, we derive model selection criteria from the viewpoints of information theory and also the Bayesian approach. Some numerical examples are given to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed semi-supervised modeling strategies.", "paper_title": "Semi-Supervised Logistic Discrimination Via Graph-Based Regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000310898000001"}
