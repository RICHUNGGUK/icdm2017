By using Galois ring, relative trace and investigating the character values of corresponding relative difference sets, we present a construction of perfect nonlinear functions from Z(4)(2m) to Z(4)(m'), where m' is a divisor of 2m, and a construction of perfect nonlinear functions from Z(p2)(n) to Z(p2)(m) where 2m is possibly larger than the largest divisor of n. Meanwhile we prove that there exists a perfect nonlinear function from Z(2p)(2) to Z(2p) if and only if p = 2, and there doesn't exist a perfect nonlinear function from Z(2kl)(2n) to Z(2kl)(m) if m > n and l( l is odd) is self-conjugate modulo 2(k) (k >= 1).", "paper_title": "On perfect nonlinear functions (Pi)", "paper_id": "WOS:000258540700001"}
