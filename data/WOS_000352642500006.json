In the manufacturing industry, lower confidence bound (LCB) estimates the minimum process capability providing pivotal information for quality engineers to monitoring the process and assessing process performance for quality assurance. The main objective of this paper is to compare and contrast the LCBs on C-pk using two approaches, Classical method and Bayesian method.", "paper_title": "Estimating process capability index C-pk: classical approach versus Bayesian approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000352642500006"}
