A combination of the composite link model with roughness penalties is proposed to estimate smooth densities from such data in a Bayesian framework. A simulation study is used to evaluate the performances of the strategy in the estimation of a density, of its quantiles and first moments. Two illustrations are presented: the first one involves grouped data of lead concentration in the blood and the second one the number of deaths due to tuberculosis in The Netherlands in wide age classes.
