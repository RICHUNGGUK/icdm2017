The bit security of the Diffie-Hellman function over subgroups of F*(p) and of an elliptic curve over F-p, is considered. It is shown that if the Decision Diffie-Hellman problem is hard in these groups, then the two most significant bits of the Diffie-Hellman function are secure. Under the weaker assumption of the computational (rather than decisional) hardness of the Diffie-Hellman problems, only about (log p)(1/2) bits are known to be secure.", "paper_title": "On the bit security of the Diffie-Hellman key", "paper_id": "WOS:000234948600003"}
