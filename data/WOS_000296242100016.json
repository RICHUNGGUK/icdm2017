The efficiency of multi-objective optimization algorithms depends on the quality and quantity of Pareto fronts produced by them. To compare different Pareto fronts resulting from different algorithms, criteria are considered and applied in multi-objective problems. Each criterion denotes a characteristic of the Pareto front. Thus, ranking approaches are commonly used to evaluate different algorithms based on different criteria. This paper presents three multi-objective optimization methods based on the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. To evaluate these methods, bi-objective mathematical benchmark problems are considered. Results show that all proposed methods are successful in finding near-optimal Pareto fronts. A ranking method is used to compare the capability of the proposed methods and the best method for further study is suggested. Moreover, the nominated method is applied as an optimization tool in real multi-objective optimization problems in multireservoir system operations. A new technique in multi-objective optimization, called warm-up, based on the PSO algorithm is then applied to improve the quality of the Pareto front by single-objective search. Results show that the proposed technique is successful in finding an optimal Pareto front.", "paper_title": "MOPSO algorithm and its application in multipurpose multireservoir operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000296242100016"}
