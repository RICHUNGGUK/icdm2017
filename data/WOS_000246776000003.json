The Messenger on-the-drive (MOD) is developed as an inter-vehicle multi-networked voice/text communication utility, which enables the seamless wireless or telecommunications among the drivers and passengers in a fleet of cars. Two core features of Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), multi-streaming and multihoming, are applied for implementing the MOD project. We also use Partial Reliable SCTP (PR-SCTP), a characteristic extension of SCTP, to provide low latency handover in multi-network. By integrating our proprietary works and other open source projects, the MOD was successfully built.", "paper_title": "The design and implementation of messenger on-the-drive", "paper_id": "WOS:000246776000003"}
