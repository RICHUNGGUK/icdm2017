This paper proposes a universally composable secure positioning model, which is a bounded retrieval model (F-BRM) with the ideal functionalities of secure positioning (F-SP(d)). Then, a one-dimensional version of a novel secure positioning protocol SPreg1 is presented, which is universally composable and is secure in the (F-REG, F-BRM)-hybrid model. Protocol SPreg1 additionally offers verifier authentication properties, as opposed to similar existing secure positioning protocols. Lastly, a generic version of the secure positioning protocol SPregd in d dimensions is proposed based on the protocol SPreg1. In summary, the proposed secure positioning protocols have been proved to be secure in the universally composable framework.", "paper_title": "Universally composable secure positioning in the bounded retrieval model", "paper_id": "WOS:000365129500004"}
