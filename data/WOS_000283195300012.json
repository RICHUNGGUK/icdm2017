A large construction project requires large quantities of construction equipment. This volume can result in traffic congestion in the flow of construction equipment, which also lowers the overall efficiency of construction operations. In particular, this effect can be serious in the area where traffic bottlenecks are most likely. This study applies a multiagent-based simulation modeling approach to a real project. Through a case study, this study evaluates how traffic flow of construction equipment influences the efficiency of that equipment in construction operations and, moreover, the schedule of a project.", "paper_title": "Case Study on the Evaluation of Equipment Flow at a Construction Site", "paper_id": "WOS:000283195300012"}
