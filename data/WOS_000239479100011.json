To ensure a level of predictability -and thus make the services more dependable-, it has been argued that the hosts must exchange information that allows guessing how the network is set up at a given moment, and how it will be in the near future. This paper introduces an approach to handling that information, which has been explicitly devised to deal with incomplete and changeable knowledge. As a contribution to the current state of the art, this approach enables a practical scheme where the different hosts in a MANET can collaborate to make up the network that best satisfies their service requirements.", "paper_title": "Managing ad-hoc networks through the formal specification of service requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000239479100011"}
