In this article, we present a new encryption scheme with the AON property, based on operations defined by quasigroups. The proposed procedure is a reliable and secure preprocessing step to any other common encryption mode, aiming to slow down the brute force searches against block ciphers.", "paper_title": "An application of quasigroups in All-Or-Nothing transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000245931200005"}
