The presented results hold in the general framework of vector-valued functions; therefore they can be applied to multitask problems. In particular, we observe that the concept of effective dimension plays a central role in the definition of a criterion for the choice of the regularization parameter as a function of the number of samples. Moreover, a complete minimax analysis of the problem is described, showing that the convergence rates obtained by regularized least-squares estimators are indeed optimal over a suitable class of priors defined by the considered kernel. Finally, we give an improved lower rate result describing worst asymptotic behavior on individual probability measures rather than over classes of priors.", "paper_title": "Optimal rates for the regularized least-squares algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000247941700003"}
