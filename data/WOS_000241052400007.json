Each data stream usually contains significant volume of redundant noisy data. In many real-time applications, it is essential to focus the computing resources on a relevant subset of data streams at any given time instant and use it to build the model of the environment. We formulate this problem as an experiential sampling problem and propose an approach to utilize computing resources efficiently on the most informative subset of data streams. In this paper, we generalize our experiential sampling framework to multiple data streams and provide an evaluation measure for this technique. We have successfully applied this framework to the problems of traffic monitoring, face detection and monologue detection.", "paper_title": "Experiential sampling on multiple data streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000241052400007"}
