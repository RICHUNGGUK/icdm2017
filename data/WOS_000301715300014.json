By tapering the coupling section, the bandwidth of substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) directional couplers can be enlarged. Two design aspects are involved in this approach. First, the even-mode propagation constant in the tapered coupling section is accurately extracted with the help of a numerical thru-reflect-line calibration technique. Then, it is fitted into the model of a uniform dielectric-filled rectangular waveguide and thereafter extrapolated to the operation range of the odd mode. Second, equivalent circuit models of the waveguide bifurcation effects are also presented together with parametric values. Based on the results of extraction, a 90 degrees 3-dB directional coupler is developed to validate the proposed design approach. To achieve the reverse phasing at two output ports, the prototyped 90 degrees 3-dB directional coupler is subsequently integrated with a novel broadband fixed phase shifter developed with the SIW technology, of which a systematic synthesis procedure has been proposed in this article. Measured performance of both 90 degrees and 180 degrees 3-dB couplers confirms the accuracy of our proposed design approach. This kind of wide-band directional coupler can find applications in wideband power dividing/combining circuits within a single-layer platform. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
