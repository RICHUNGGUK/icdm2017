We present a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based emphatic speech synthesis model. The ultimate objective is to synthesize corrective feedback in a computer-aided pronunciation training (CAPT) system. We first analyze contrastive (neutral versus emphatic) speech recording. The changes of the acoustic features of emphasis at different prosody locations and the local prominences of emphasis are analyzed. Based on the analysis, we develop a perturbation model that predicts the changes of the acoustic features from neutral to emphatic speech with high accuracy. Further based on the perturbation model we develop an HMM-based emphatic speech synthesis model. Different from the previous work, the HMM model is trained with neutral corpus, but the context features and additional acoustic-feature-related features are used during the growing of the decision tree. Then the output of the perturbation model can be used to supervise the HMM model to synthesize emphatic speeches instead of applying the perturbation model at the backend of a neutral speech synthesis model directly. In this way, the demand of emphasis corpus is reduced and the speech quality decreased by speech modification algorithm is avoided. The experiments indicate that the proposed emphatic speech synthesis model improves the emphasis quality of synthesized speech while keeping a high degree of the naturalness.", "paper_title": "Synthesizing English emphatic speech for multimodal corrective feedback in computer-aided pronunciation training", "paper_id": "WOS:000342418700023"}
