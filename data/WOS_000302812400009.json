Using these Fourier series representations closed-form expressions are obtained for the amplitudes of the fundamental and third-order intermodulation products generated when a exposing ferroelectric-based varactor to a DC bias voltage plus an equal-amplitude two-sinusoids signal. The results clearly show the strong and complicated dependence of the third-order intermodulation performance on the DC bias voltage, the temperature and the amplitude of the sinusoid. The results obtained suggest that the DC bias voltage and/or the temperature play an important role in deciding the nonlinear performance of the ferroelectric-based varactors.", "paper_title": "Improved analysis of the intermodulation performance of ferroelectric thin-film and bulk-based varactors", "paper_id": "WOS:000302812400009"}
