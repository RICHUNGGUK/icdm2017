Like an infant, Jean repeatedly executes schemas, gradually extending its schemas to accommodate new experiences. Jean's environment is a simulated \"playpen\" in which Jean and other objects move about and interact. Jean's cognitive development depends on several integrated functions: a simple perceptual system, an action-selection system, a motivational system, a long-term memory, and learning methods. This paper provides an overview of Jean's architecture and schemas, and it focuses on how Jean learns schemas and transfers them to new situations.", "paper_title": "Piagetian adaptation meets image schemas: The Jean system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125300031"}
