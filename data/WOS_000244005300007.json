This paper postulates that estimating these bidden costs may be attained by applying the first and second laws of thermodynamics to reduce system entropy (or disorder) at a cost. The applicability of this concept is demonstrated for the economic lot size problem with permissible delay in payments. Mathematical models are developed with numerical examples provided and results discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
