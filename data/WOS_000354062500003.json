DSA-IS is a new disk-friendly method for sequentially retrieving the preceding character of a sorted suffix to induce the order of the preceding suffix. For a size-n string of a constant or integer alphabet, given the RAM capacity Omega((nW)(0.5)), where W is the size of each I/O buffer that is large enough to amortize the overhead of each access to disk, both the CPU time and peak disk use of DSA-IS are O(n). Our experimental study shows that on average, DSA-IS achieves the best time and space results of all of the existing external memory algorithms based on the induced sorting principle.", "paper_title": "Induced Sorting Suffixes in External Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000354062500003"}
