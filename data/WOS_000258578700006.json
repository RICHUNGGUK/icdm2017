According to Dal Maso, LeFloch, and Murat's theory, a shock wave theory for a given nonconservative system requires prescribing a priori a family of paths in the phase space. In the present paper, we consider schemes that are formally consistent with a given family of paths, and we investigate their limiting behavior as the mesh is refined. we first generalize to systems a property established earlier by Hou and LeFloch for scalar conservation laws, and we prove that nonconservative schemes generate, at the level of the limiting hyperbolic system, an convergence error source-term which, provided the total variation of the approximations remains uniformly bounded, is a locally bounded measure. This convergence error measure is supported on the shock trajectories and, as we demonstrate here, is usually \"small\". In the special case that the scheme converges in the sense of graphs - a rather strong convergence property often violated in practice - then this measure source-term vanishes. We also discuss the role of the equivalent equation associated with a difference scheme; here, the distinction between scalar equations and systems appears most clearly since, for systems, the equivalent equation of a scheme that is formally path-consistent depends upon the prescribed family of paths. The core of this paper is devoted to investigate numerically the approximation of several (simplified or full) hyperbolic models arising in fluid dynamics. This leads us to the conclusion that for systems having nonconservative products associated with linearly degenerate characteristic fields, the convergence error vanishes. For more general models, this measure is evaluated very accurately, especially by plotting the shock curves associated with each scheme under consideration; as we demonstrate, plotting the shock curves provide a convenient approach for evaluating the range of validity of a given scheme.
