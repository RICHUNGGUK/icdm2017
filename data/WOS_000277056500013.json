Despite numerous compiler and high-level synthesis studies, usage of such systems has largely been limited to device experts, due to significantly increased application design complexity. To reduce application design complexity, we introduce elastic computing - a framework that separates functionality from implementation details by enabling designers to use specialized functions, called elastic functions, which enable an optimization framework to explore thousands of possible implementations, even ones using different algorithms. Elastic functions allow designers to execute the same application code efficiently on potentially any architecture and for different runtime parameters such as input size, battery life, etc. In this paper, we present an initial elastic computing framework that transparently optimizes application code onto diverse systems, achieving significant speedups ranging from 1.3x to 46x on a hyper-threaded Xeon system with an FPGA accelerator, a 16-CPU Opteron system, and a quad-core Xeon system.", "paper_title": "Elastic Computing: A Framework for Transparent, Portable, and Adaptive Multi-core Heterogeneous Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000277056500013"}
