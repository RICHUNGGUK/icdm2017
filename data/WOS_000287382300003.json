An algorithm is provided, that takes a weighted automaton A as input and halts if and only if the corresponding series r(A) is absolutely convergent: hence, absolute convergence of rational series is semi-decidable. A spectral radius-like parameter rho(vertical bar r vertical bar) is introduced, which satisfies the following property: a rational series r is absolutely convergent iff rho(vertical bar r vertical bar) < 1. We show that if r is rational, then rho(vertical bar r vertical bar) can be approximated by convergent upper estimates. Then, it is shown that the sum Sigma w is an element of Sigma* vertical bar r(W)vertical bar can be estimated to any accuracy rate. This result can be extended to any sum of the form Sigma w is an element of Sigma* vertical bar r(W)vertical bar(p) , for any integer p.
