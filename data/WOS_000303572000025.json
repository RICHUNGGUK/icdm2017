Crash and Conflict Severity Model is developed to show the relationship between Crash Index and Conflict Index. The validity and reliability of this model are proved by comparing the Model Ranking and Wisconsin Statewide Ranking of unsignalized intersections' safety. The results indicate that the Model Ranking and Statewide Ranking match well. Based on intersections' conflict data in Wisconsin, this paper offers unsignalized intersections' crash severity classification using probabilistic computing. Visual software is developed for calculating unsignalized intersections' crash severity intelligently based on this model. Overall, CCS Model can serve for intersection crash severity evaluation in real time system and be a theoretical basis for decision support system of unsignalized intersections crash prevention.", "paper_title": "Crash Severity Evaluation for Unsignalized Intersection Using Conflict Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572000025"}
