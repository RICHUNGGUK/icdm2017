To consider the complex behavior of the soil under the rocking load, an analytical solution for a rigid strip foundation on saturated soil under a rocking moment is developed under the framework of Biot's coupling theory. The boundary-value problem for the governing coupling equations for saturated soil is solved using a Fourier transform to yield a pair of dual integral equations. These dual integral equations are transformed into a set of linear equations using an infinite series of orthogonal Jacobi polynomials to yield the compliance functions. In addition, a parametric study has been carried out to examine the influence of: (1) the dimensionless frequency, (2) the dynamic permeability and (3) the Poisson's ratio on saturated soil under a rocking rigid strip footing.
