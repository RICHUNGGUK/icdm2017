Using discrete data are usually more compact, shorter and more quickly than using continuous ones. So that we proposed a data discretization method, which is the modified minimize entropy principle approach to fuzzify attribute and then build the classification tree. For verification, two NASA software projects KC2 and JM1 are applied to illustrate our proposed method. We establish a prototype system to discrete data from these projects. The error rate and number of rules show that the proposed approaches are both better than other methods.", "paper_title": "Software diagnosis using fuzzified attribute base on modified MEPA", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800134"}
