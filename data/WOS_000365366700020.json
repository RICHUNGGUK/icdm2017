In the present study we revisit that solution and rederive these forces in a new functional form which provides new insight. Specifically, we revisit the notion of a neutral plane, at a critical vertical separation, in which alignment forces identically vanish. To this end we present a new simplified 2D model of the problem, in which it is easier to understand the nature of these forces. We show that our simplified 2D model captures the same response characteristics as in the more complex 3D problem of the interaction between coils. We show the context and range of parameters in which a local neutral plane exists. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
