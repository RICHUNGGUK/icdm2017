They arise from Survo puzzles, where the basic task is to fill an mxn table by integers 1, 2, horizontal ellipsis , mn, so that each number appears only once, when the column sums and the row sums are fixed. We present a new computational method for solving Survo puzzles with binary matrices that are recoded and combined using the Hadamard, Kronecker, and Khatri-Rao products. The idea of our method is based on using the matrix interpreter and other data analytic tools of Survo R, which represents the newest generation of the Survo computing environment, recently implemented as a multiplatform, open source R package. We illustrate our method with detailed examples.", "paper_title": "Solving Survo puzzles using matrix combinatorial products", "paper_id": "WOS:000355538300009"}
