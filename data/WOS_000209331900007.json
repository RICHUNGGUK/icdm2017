Here we compare EFPSO and EFCM, implementing both methods in a Geographic Information System. We apply the two methods to two specific datasets for crime analysis and forest fire point-events showing that EFPSO has the best performance with respect to EFCM.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy particle swarm optimization algorithm and its application to hotspot events in spatial analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000209331900007"}
