Design/methodology/approach - A brief review of nonlinear analysis is presented. A powerful method (called arc-length) for tracing nonlinear equilibrium path is described. Techniques for monitoring critical points are discussed to find the rank deficiency of the stiffness matrix. Finally, by using eigenvalue perturbation of tangent stiffness matrix, load parameter associated with multiple bifurcation points is obtained. Findings - Since other methods of finding simple bifurcation points diverge in the neighborhood of critical points, this paper introduces a new method to find multiple bifurcation points. It should be remembered that a simple bifurcation point is a multiple bifurcation point with rank deficiency equal to one. Therefore, the method is applicable to simple critical points as well. Practical implications - Global buckling of the structures should be considered in design. Many structures (specially symmetric space structures) have multiple bifurcation points, therefore, analyst and designer should be aware of these points and should control them (for example, by changing the geometry or other related factors) for obtaining a safe and optimum design. Originality/value - In this paper a robust method to find multiple bifurcation points is introduced. By using this method, engineers can be aware of critical load of multiple bifurcation points to control global buckling of related structures.", "paper_title": "Computation of multiple bifurcation point", "paper_id": "WOS:000240150900005"}
