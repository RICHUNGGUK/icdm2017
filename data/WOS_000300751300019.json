Accordingly, more and more industries use group pricing discrimination strategy to attract potential customers in order to increase competitive advantage. Hence, to find ways maximize profit and to minimize total cost, group pricing discrimination strategy has become an important issue for decision makers. Unfortunately, these types of problems cannot be solved by any current goal programming models. The objective of this study is to deduce a new method, which we call the multi-coefficients goal programming, for group pricing discrimination problems. In addition, an example is given to illustrate the correctness and usefulness of the proposed model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
