The states and input symbols are first expressed in vector forms, then the transition function is described in an algebraic form. Using this algebraic representation, a sufficient and necessary condition of the reachability of any two states is proposed, based on which an algorithm is developed for discovering all the paths from one state to another. Furthermore, a mechanism is established to recognize the language acceptable by a finite automaton. Finally, illustrative examples show that the results/algorithms presented in this paper are suitable for both deterministic finite automata (DFA) and nondeterministic finite automata (NFA).", "paper_title": "Semi-tensor product of matrices approach to reachability of finite automata with application to language recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000352068400005"}
