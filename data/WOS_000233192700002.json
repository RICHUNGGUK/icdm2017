Even though particular cases have been handled previously, a general framework for the problem has never been reported. Presented in this paper is a theory to handle the Apollonius Tenth Problem by characterizing the spatial relationship among given circles and the desired Apollonius circles. Hence, the given three circles in this paper do not make any assumption regarding on the sizes of circles and the intersection/inclusion relationship among them. The observations made provide an easy-to-code algorithm to compute any desired Apollonius circle which is computationally efficient and robust. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
