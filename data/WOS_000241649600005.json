Three types of neighbors are used on this grid, therefore neighborhood sequences contain values 1, 2 and 3. The grid is coordinatized by three coordinates in a symmetric way. Digital circles are classified based on digital distances using neighborhood sequences. They can be triangle, hexagon, enneagon and dodecagon. The corners of the convex hulls of these polygons are computed.", "paper_title": "Geometry of neighborhood sequences in hexagonal grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000241649600005"}
