The UTB SB-nMOSFET devices offer excellent RF performance with high values of f (T) and f (max). The significant dependence of f (T) and f (max) on gate voltage and weak dependence on barrier height are demonstrated. Meanwhile, the significant dependence of g (m) and g (ds) on both gate voltage and SB height are shown. Moreover, the scalability of f (T) is outstanding and close to the ideal case (f (T) ae 1/L (g) (2) ). The high frequency performances of 45 nm channel length SB-nMOSFETs at ballistic transport limit are also investigated. Results show that scattering strongly affects the capacitances C (gs), C (gd) and C (ds). At ballistic transport limit the f (T) and f (max) are almost 10 times larger. The Scattering effects in nano-scale SB-nMOSFETs cannot be neglected.", "paper_title": "High frequency performance of nano-scale ultra-thin-body Schottky-barrier n-MOSFETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000293188100019"}
