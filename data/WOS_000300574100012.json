This multiplication method is different from the previous ones. Theoretically, we show that the number of multiplications is at least as good as Karatsuba-based algorithm. Moreover, using the proposed method, we improve the number of additions slightly. We remark that our method works efficiently for any N and it is easy to implement. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method has the best multiplication and addition complexity for the N-term polynomial multiplication in Chebyshev form with 3 <= N <= 13.", "paper_title": "On the Polynomial Multiplication in Chebyshev Form", "paper_id": "WOS:000300574100012"}
