In this paper, we study the problem of crawl scheduling that biases crawl ordering toward important pages. We propose a set of crawling algorithms for effective and efficient crawl ordering by prioritizing important pages with the well-known PageRank as the importance metric. In order to score URLs, the proposed algorithms utilize various features, including partial link structure, inter-host links, page titles, and topic relevance. We conduct a large-scale experiment using publicly available data sets to examine the effect of each feature on crawl ordering and evaluate the performance of many algorithms. The experimental results verify the efficacy of our schemes. In particular, compared with the representative RankMass crawler, the FPR-title-host algorithm reduces computational overhead by a factor as great as three in running time while improving effectiveness by 5 % in cumulative PageRank.", "paper_title": "Novel approaches to crawling important pages early", "paper_id": "WOS:000310871700009"}
