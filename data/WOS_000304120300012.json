By varying the transmission strategy according to the usage of the channel, nodes can send RTS and CTS packets omni-directionally or directionally. Also, this paper proposes a calculation method of virtual carrier sensing with collision avoidance. By the method, ADMAC protocol makes more pairs of nodes transmit and receive data simultaneously without interferences than other MAC protocols for directional antennas. The paper compares the simultaneous delivering nodes and network throughput of ADMAC with DMAC, DVCS and SDMAC under different experiment parameters. The simulation results show that the throughput of ADMAC is higher than the throughput of DMAC, DVCS and SDMAC protocols.", "paper_title": "An adaptive directional MAC protocol for ad hoc networks using directional antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000304120300012"}
