An extended cointegration procedure allowing for three types of structural break, is employed and compared with the standard Johansen procedure, for daily and weekly returns. The empirical results suggest a higher level of integration within the ASEAN-5 markets than previously found, suggesting that financial risk reduction benefits from diversifying investments across the region are less than previously thought. Further, Singapore and Thailand are the main long-term drivers in the region; Malaysia and Indonesia are more short-term drivers. Structural breaks are found to correspond with the Asian financial crisis in 1997/98 and a possible Y2K effect in late 1999. Results are verified using another structural break model and method, where break dates are treated as known. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
