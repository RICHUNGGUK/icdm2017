A three-stage consulting framework of system evaluation, usability study, and management plan (SUM) was proposed and implemented for a firm of this size, which included three parts: (1) System evaluation: requirement analysis and performance evaluation of both hardware and software components of the 4D tool; (2) Usability study: usability tests and improvement of the 4D tool: and (3) Management plan workflow re-engineering for the firm to be able to successfully implement and apply the 4D management tool to actual projects. We found that the SUM framework was able to effectively identify major problems when introducing a 4D tool to a large design-build project and helped to minimize its own impact on the firm's business processes.
