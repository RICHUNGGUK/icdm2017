These networks frequently comprise parts that are unique to each condition, and parts that are shared among related conditions. Existing approaches for learning condition-specific networks typically identify either only differences or only similarities across conditions. Most of these approaches first learn networks per condition independently, and then identify similarities and differences in a post-learning step. Such approaches do not exploit the shared information across conditions during network learning. Results: We describe an approach for learning condition-specific networks that identifies the shared and unique subgraphs during network learning simultaneously, rather than as a post-processing step. Our approach learns networks across condition sets, shares data from different conditions and produces high-quality networks that capture biologically meaningful information. On simulated data, our approach outperformed an existing approach that learns networks independently for each condition, especially for small training datasets. On microarray data of hundreds of deletion mutants in two, yeast stationary-phase cell populations, the inferred network structure identified several common and population-specific effects of these deletion mutants and several high-confidence cases of double-deletion pairs, which can be experimentally tested. Our results are consistent with and extend the existing knowledge base of differentiated cell populations in yeast stationary phase.", "paper_title": "A multiple network learning approach to capture system-wide condition-specific responses", "paper_id": "WOS:000291752600062"}
