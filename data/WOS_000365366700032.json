As the uncertainties/disturbances caused by a tire blow-out are difficult to be measured or estimated, this study proposes a novel constrained H-infinity coordinated control approach for the path-following and driving stability problem of the road vehicles after a tire blow-out. Simulation results and analyses for a variety of driving scenarios are conducted, based on a co-simulation between the proposed vehicle controller and vehicle dynamics simulation platform veDYNA. The dynamic analyses clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated controller in improving vehicle stability, as well as the robustness of the controller against the uncertainties/disturbances caused by a tire blow-out.
