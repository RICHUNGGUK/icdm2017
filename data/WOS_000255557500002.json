We present a new approach to mining a user's preferences on the search results from clickthrough data and using the discovered preferences to adapt the search engine's ranking function for improving search quality. We develop a new preference mining technique called SpyNB, which is based on the practical assumption that the search results clicked on by the user reflect the user's preferences but does not draw any conclusions about the results that the user did not click on. As such, SpyNB is still valid even if the user does not follow any order in reading the search results or does not click on all relevant results. Our extensive offline experiments demonstrate that SpyNB discovers many more accurate preferences than existing algorithms do. The interactive online experiments further confirm that SpyNB and our personalization approach are effective in practice. We also show that the efficiency of SpyNB is comparable to existing simple preference mining algorithms.", "paper_title": "Mining user preference using Spy voting for search engine personalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000255557500002"}
