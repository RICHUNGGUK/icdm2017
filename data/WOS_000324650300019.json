Each nonzero circulant submatrix is a superposition of K cyclic-shifted identity matrices, where the circulant weight K >= 1. We propose a novel layered decoder architecture to support QC-LDPC codes with any circulant weight. We present a block-serial decoding architecture which processes a layer of a parity check matrix block by block, where each block is a Z x Z circulant matrix with a circulant weight of K. In the case study, we demonstrate an LDPC decoder design for the China Mobile Multimedia Broadcasting (CMMB) standard, which was synthesized for a TSMC 65-nm CMOS technology. With a core area of 3.9 mm(2), the CMMB LDPC decoder achieves a maximum throughput of 1.1 Gb/s with 15 iterations.", "paper_title": "VLSI Architecture for Layered Decoding of QC-LDPC Codes With High Circulant Weight", "paper_id": "WOS:000324650300019"}
