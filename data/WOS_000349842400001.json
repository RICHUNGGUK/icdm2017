They are easily obtained under the Cox Proportional-hazards model. In populations defined by an intial, acute event, like myocardial infarction, or in studies with long-term follow-up, the proportional hazards assumption of constant hazard ratios is frequently violated. One alternative is to fit an interaction between covariates and a prespecified function of time, implemented as a time-dependent covariate. This effectively creates a time-varying coefficient that is easily estimated in software such as SAS and R. However, the usual programming statements for survival estimation are not directly applicable. Unique data manipulation and syntax is required, but is not well documented for either software. This paper offers a tutorial in surviva; estimation for time-varying coefficient model, implemented in SAS and R. We provide a macro coxtve to facilitate estimation in SAS where the current functionality is more limited. The macro is validated in simulated data and illustrated in an application.", "paper_title": "Tutorial Survival Estimation for Cox Regression Models with Time-Varying coefficients", "paper_id": "WOS:000349842400001"}
