Besides, the correlation among playful cloud-learning, cooperative learning, self-determination theory, technology acceptance model, and student's learning attitude, continuance learning intention, and the learning outcomes are also investigated. This study also examines the appropriateness of the hypothesized model of the researching model. We employed the path analysis with Structural equation modeling to analyze the observations. The results of the study are summarized below: (1) Playful cloud-learning has positive influence on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived playfulness. (2) Cooperative learning doesn't have positive influence on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived playfulness. (3) Self-determination theory has positive influence on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived playfulness. (4) Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived playfulness of Technology Acceptance Model have positive influence on learning attitude. (5) Students' learning attitude has positive influence on students' continuance learning intention. (6) Students' continuance learning intention has positive influence on their learning outcomes. (7) For the appropriateness of the hypothesized model, the result of the goodness-of-fit indexes indicates that the hypothesized model of playful cloud-learning with cooperative learning model adequately describes the observations. The major contribution of this study is that reveal the playful cloud-learning indeed has good influence on junior high school students' learning outcomes. Without using cooperative learning, playful cloud-learning still has good influence on their learning outcomes.", "paper_title": "An Explorative Study of Continuance Intention on Cloud Learning with Applying Social Networks Blended in New Era of Internet Technology Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000356204400020"}
