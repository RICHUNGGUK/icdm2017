In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian texture classifier based on the adaptive model-selection learning of Poisson mixtures on the contourlet features of texture images. The adaptive model-selection learning of Poisson mixtures is carried out by the recently established adaptive gradient Bayesian Ying-Yang harmony learning algorithm for Poisson mixtures. It is demonstrated by the experiments that our proposed Bayesian classifier significantly improves the texture classification accuracy in comparison with several current state-of-the-art texture classification approaches.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Texture Classification Based on Contourlet Transform and BYY Harmony Learning of Poisson Mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000300510800001"}
