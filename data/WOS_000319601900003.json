Several server-centric network structures for data centers have been proposed. They, however, are not truly expandable and suffer a low degree of regularity and symmetry. Inspired by the commodity servers in today's data centers that come with dual port, we consider how to build expandable and cost-effective structures without expensive high-end switches and additional hardware on servers except the two NIC ports. In this paper, two such network structures, called HCN and BCN, are designed, both of which are of server degree 2. We also develop the low overhead and robust routing mechanisms for HCN and BCN. Although the server degree is only 2, HCN can be expanded very easily to encompass hundreds of thousands servers with the low diameter and high bisection width. Additionally, HCN offers a high degree of regularity, scalability, and symmetry, which conform to the modular designs of data centers. BCN is the largest known network structure for data centers with the server degree 2 and network diameter 7. Furthermore, BCN has many attractive features, including the low diameter, high bisection width, large number of node-disjoint paths for the one-to-one traffic, and good fault-tolerant ability. Mathematical analysis and comprehensive simulations show that HCN and BCN possess excellent topological properties and are viable network structures for data centers.", "paper_title": "Expandable and Cost-Effective Network Structures for Data Centers Using Dual-Port Servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000319601900003"}
