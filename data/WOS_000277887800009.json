Here, we consider a heterogeneous network environment with both legacy WLAN and novel line-of-sight (LOS)-dependent 60 GHz radio systems deployed in home to support high quality multimedia applications. Both the above decision-making approaches take into account multiple subjective and objective factors, such as user preference, network condition, device capability and impact of the environment. We make decisions based on an evaluation of the candidate actions, but with different length of horizon. We show their ability to effectively make decisions, to handover or not, in uncertain situations. The method and results herein are in general applicable ;to any other situation where such a decision has to be made. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
