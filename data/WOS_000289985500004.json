A local criterion is developed, and is, together with a range of local and global criterion functions from literature, benchmarked on a number of numerical examples of laminated composite structures for the maximization of the buckling load considering fiber angle design variables. The optimization formulations are based on either linear or geometrically nonlinear analysis and formulated as mathematical programming problems solved using gradient based techniques. The developed local criterion is formulated such it captures nonlinear effects upon loading and proves useful for both analysis purposes and as a criterion for use in nonlinear buckling optimization.", "paper_title": "Optimization formulations for the maximum nonlinear buckling load of composite structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000289985500004"}
