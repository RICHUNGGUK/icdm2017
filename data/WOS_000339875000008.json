Nonetheless, the existing approaches to local community detection are usually sensitive to seeds, i.e., some seeds may lead to missing of some true communities. In this paper, we present a seed-insensitive method called GMAC and its variation iGMAC for local community detection. They estimate the similarity among vertices by investigating vertices' neighborhoods, and reveal a local community by maximizing its internal similarity and minimizing its external similarity simultaneously. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data sets verify the effectiveness of our algorithms.", "paper_title": "Toward seed-insensitive solutions to local community detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000339875000008"}
