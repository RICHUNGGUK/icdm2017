The design also guarantees other randomness properties, i.e., balance, long period, ideal tuple distribution, and high and exact linear complexity. We discuss how these properties are achieved by the proposed design and show how to select various parameters to obtain an efficient stream cipher for the desired security level. We also show that the proposed generators are secure against time/memory/data tradeoff attacks, algebraic attacks and correlation attacks. Finally we present WG-128(1) as a concrete example of a WG stream cipher with a key size of 128 bits. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
