It is a pure software-based solution and uses the most basic set of commodity hardware - a speaker, a microphone, and some form of interdevice communication. The ranging scheme works without any infrastructure and is applicable to sensor platforms and commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices. It achieves high accuracy through three techniques: two-way sensing, self-recording, and sample counting. We further devise a scalable and fast localization scheme. Our experiments show that up to one-centimeter ranging accuracy and three-centimeter localization accuracy can be achieved.", "paper_title": "BeepBeep: A High-Accuracy Acoustic-Based System for Ranging and Localization Using COTS Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000302557400004"}
