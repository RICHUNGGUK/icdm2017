The Morse code has been shown to be a valuable tool in assistive technology, augmentative and alternative communication, and rehabilitation for people with neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy. In this paper, we designed and implemented a wireless environmental control aid system using the Morse code as an adapted access communication tool, which includes three types of switch: single-switch, double-switch, and six-switch types. People with disabilities can easily control all types of electronic appliance without restrictions owing to spatial arrangements using a signal transmission based on radio frequency (RF). Experimental results revealed that three participants with disabilities were able to gain access to electronic facilities after six weeks of practice with the new system.", "paper_title": "Environmental control aid system for people with physical disabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233300023"}
