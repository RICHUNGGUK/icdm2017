A key challenge in developing distributed real-time systems is to meeting critical performance constraints when DRT systems become more difficult to predict in terms of the needs of the application, particularly those needs that are likely to change dynamically during execution of the application. The system design must combine temporal requirements and considerable uncertainty, together with the ability to swiftly adapt to changing environmental conditions. This paper proposes a robust DRT model that does not require precise system parameters. A multivariable Ha controller is developed and provides utilisation and deadline guarantees in an unpredictable environment.", "paper_title": "Robust performance modelling and scheduling of distributed real-time systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278527000008"}
