For these two tasks, we propose simple biologically inspired strategies, well suited for building dedicated circuits and for on-board implementation on real robots. The odor recognition system is based on a spiking neural network using a synchronization coding scheme. The robot navigation system is based on the use of bilateral comparison between two spatially separated gas sensors arrays at either side of the robot. We propose binary or analog navigation laws depending on the nature of the available sensory information extracted from the plume structure (isolated odor patches or smoother concentration field).", "paper_title": "A biomimetic robot for tracking specific odors in turbulent plumes", "paper_id": "WOS:000238393600002"}
