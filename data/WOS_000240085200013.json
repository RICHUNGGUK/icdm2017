After a thorough study over different kinds of group-awareness theories in recent years, and combined with the important concept Service, a new group-awareness model is proposed which is services-oriented, is called Service-Oriented Group Awareness Model (SOGAM). The awareness need of applications in heterogeneity environment and representation of the dynamic property in the group structure can be resolved by this model. The formalization to describe the awareness model, implementation of a Web-based architecture using Web Service related standards as communication model to share awareness information are given in this paper. Finally problems that need further study are pointed out.", "paper_title": "A service-oriented group awareness model and its implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200013"}
