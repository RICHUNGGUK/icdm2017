We demonstrate the approach using measurements obtained from a hardware prototype, and present schedulability analyses for systems that share a cache by explicit reservation. These analyses form the basis for a series of experiments to further evaluate the approach. We find that explicit reservation is most useful for larger task sets with high utilization. Some task sets cannot be scheduled with a conventional cache, but are schedulable with explicit reservation.", "paper_title": "Explicit Reservation of Cache Memory in a Predictable, Preemptive Multitasking Real-Time System", "paper_id": "WOS:000341390100003"}
