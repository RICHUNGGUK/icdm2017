Our contribution is two-fold. First, we extend the refinement type system framework employed in the recent work on (incomplete) automated higher-order verification by drawing on the classical work on relatively complete \"Hoare logic like\" program logic for higher-order procedural languages. Then, by adopting the recently proposed techniques for solving constraints over quantified first-order logic formulas, we develop an automated type inference method for the type system, thereby realizing an automated relatively complete verification of higher-order programs.", "paper_title": "Automating Relatively Complete Verification of Higher-Order Functional Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000318629900008"}
