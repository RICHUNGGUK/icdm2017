While those proposals and corresponding methodologies are helpful to engineers in determining appropriate architecture, the systematic methods for the evaluation of software architecture are scarce. To select appropriate software architecture from various alternatives appropriately, a scenario-based method has been proposed to assess how software architecture affects the fulfillment of business requirements. The empirical evaluation on the selection of a supply chain software tool has shown that the developed method offers remarkable insights of software development and can be incorporated into the industrial informatics practice of an organization with a moderate cost.", "paper_title": "Enterprise Information Systems Architecture-Analysis and Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700033"}
