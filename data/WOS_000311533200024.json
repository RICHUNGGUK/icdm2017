In the past, with respect to the motorcycle industry, the lack of adequate systems to control the quantity of overloaded polluting products has led to serious environmental problems. In order to reduce damage to the environment, this paper presents a process-based reference model and information system that can be used by the motorcycle industry to better manage and control the quantity and quality of the supply network. The IDEF (integration definition) tool set is applied to describe the overall operational workflow. An object-oriented, analytical approach is used to represent the architecture of the collaborative model. A prototype platform is constructed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in controlling the supply network of materials and to show the improved communications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
