A Knowledge-based Constraints Network System (KCNS) has been developed to maintain design consistency and to support the selection of appropriate design parameter intervals. A data-mining algorithm named fuzzy-rough algorithm is developed to acquire the knowledge level constraints from the numerical simulation. The method integrated Case Based Reasoning (CBR) and Rule Based Reasoning (RBR) with interval consistency algorithm is adopted to predict the potential conflicts and to specify the interval of design parameters. The design example of a crank connecting link in a V6 engine shows the validity of the system.", "paper_title": "The study of a Knowledge-based Constraints Network System (KCNS) for concurrent engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100028"}
