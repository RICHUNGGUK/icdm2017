The WPD-based transcale control algorithm provides a compromise between performance index and computational efficiency compared with the conventional LQG tracking control algorithm, and it is an improvement of the wavelet transform based algorithm previously proposed. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
