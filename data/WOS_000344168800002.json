One of the most important developing issues in WMNs is multicast routing, which is a key technology that provides dissemination of data to a group of members in an efficient way. In this article, after an introduction about the structure of a WMN, multicast routing algorithms and protocols in WMNs are surveyed in a detailed and efficient manner. Moreover, effort is made to scale the study into one of the important potential capabilities of multicast routing mechanisms in WMNs, which is taking advantage of using different channels and radios association. While nodes in a single-radio mesh network operating on single-channel have restrictions for capacity, equipping mesh routers with multiple radios using multiple channels can decrease the intention of capacity problem as well as increase the aggregate bandwidth available to the network and improving the throughput. Hence, the purpose of channel assignment is to decrease the interferences while increasing the network capacity and keeping the connectivity of the network. Therefore, this article investigates the multicast protocols considering a definition of three types of WMNs, based on channel-radio association including SRSC, SRMC and MRMC. In its follow, a classification for multicast routing algorithms regarding the achieved optimal solutions will be presented. Finally, a study of MRMC and its relevant problems will be offered, considering the joint channel assignment and the multicast tree construction problem.", "paper_title": "Multicast routing protocols in wireless mesh networks: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000344168800002"}
