Devices such as firewalls demand fast packet classification on very complicated rule sets of large size, which is still challenging today. This paper proposes a practical packet classification algorithm named dynamic discrete bit selection ((DBS)-B-2), which achieves high classification speed while requiring low storage. (DBS)-B-2 employs dynamic heuristic schemes at bit level, to explore the inherent characteristics of the rule sets. (DBS)-B-2 has been implemented on various platforms including Intel-architecture, multicore network processor, and FPGA, and is compared with the state-of-the-art solutions. Experimental results on real-life rule sets show that the memory storage required by (DBS)-B-2 is at least one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the existing work, while the speed is much higher. With 64-byte Ethernet packet and 10K size ACL rule set, (DBS)-B-2 achieves a throughput over 10 Gbps on Cavium OCTEON CN5860 multicore network processor and over 135 Gbps on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA, which outperforms the existing work under the same test environment. All results promise that (DBS)-B-2 is a highly practical solution to satisfy vigorous requirements.", "paper_title": "Practical Multituple Packet Classification Using Dynamic Discrete Bit Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000333469900013"}
