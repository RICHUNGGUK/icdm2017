Wang, Theory of truth degrees of formulas in Lukasiewicz n-valued propositional logic and a limit theorem, Sci. China Inform. Sci. E 35(6) (2005) 561-569 (in Chinese)] is firstly extended to the n-valued R-o-logic L-n* and the concept of truth degrees of formulas in L-n* is proposed. A limit theorem saying that the truth function tau(n) induced by truth degrees converges to the integrated truth function tau when n converge's to infinity is obtained. This theorem builds a bridge between discrete valued R-o-logic and continuous valued R-o-logic. Secondly, based on deduction theorem, completeness theorem and the concept of truth degrees of formulas in L-n*, the concept of consistency degrees of theories is given. It is proved that a theory Gamma over L-n*, is a useless theory(i.e., the deductions of Gamma are all tautologies) iff the consistency degree consist(n)(Gamma) of Gamma is equal to 1, Gamma is consistent iff 1/2 <= consist(n) (Gamma) <= 1, and Gamma is inconsistent iff consist(n)(Gamma) = 0. Lastly, the concept of consistency degrees of theories is generalized and a method of graded reasoning in L-n* is obtained. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
