This study presents a concept for cultivation of the intra-row and close to crop area. The weeding tool consists of an arm holder and three or more integrated arms, which are carriers of the end effectors. The hoeing tool rotates around a horizontal axis, which is positioned directly above the crop row and moves along it. The system is similar to the rotational crop thinning systems used in the past. Main differences compared with the thinning systems is the adjustment of the angular position of the arms in relation to the plane, perpendicular to the rotation axis and on-line tuning of the rotational speed depending on the travelling speed, detected distance between two adjacent plants and angular position of the weeding tool. Systems modularity allows application of various weeding strategies regarding the number of consecutive cultivation trajectories of the end effectors between adjacent plants. Trajectories number is affected by the in-row distance between the plants, used type of end effector and plants development stage. A virtual prototype of the weeding tool was used for testing the behaviour of the system for various weeding strategies, considering inter alia the problem of irregular distances between the adjacent plants. Weeding strategies with one, two and three consecutive trajectories between adjacent plants, with and without adjustment of the angular position were simulated and analysed. The size of the unaffected spaces around the crop plant was calculated. The results proved that an optimised adjustment of the arms angular position affects the size of the cultivated area between two adjacent plants and the unaffected space around the crop plant. Furthermore, advantages of the presented concept in terms of more flexible cultivation of the close to crop area were demonstrated. Based on the results of simulation, lower rate of plant injuring during the weeding can be expected, in comparison to the similar weeding tool concepts, without the possibility to adjust the angular position of the arms. In additional simulation set the behaviour of the system was observed while proportional (P-) control of the rotational speed and irregular inrow distances between plants were simulated. The results showed adequate adaptation and accurate positioning of the cultivated area between the adjacent plants, in spite of the irregularity of in-row distances. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
