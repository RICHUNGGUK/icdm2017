The receiver adopts double conversion structure and two dynamic range control modes of variable gain amplifier (VGA) and programmable gain amplifier (PGA). The receiver includes the blocks of LNA, down-conversion mixers, band pass filter, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), VGA, PGA, 2-bit ADC, two frequency synthesizers and so on. The LNA adopts source inductive degeneration technique to achieve good noise performance, and a novel positive feedback capacitor is introduced to enhance gain. The novel gain-boosting charge pump (CP) structure acquires accurate current matching of 0.1% error which improves the output phase noise of frequency synthesizer. The measured radio performances of noise figure (NF) is only 4 dB and the maximum gain is 110 dB. The gain control range achieves 50 dB provided by PGA and VGA. The receiver occupies an area of 1.875 mm x 1.575 mm including all needed voltage reference and the 1.8V low dropout regulator.", "paper_title": "A 2.9 mm(2) Highly Integrated Low Noise GPS Receiver in 0.18-mu m CMOS Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000350569300011"}
