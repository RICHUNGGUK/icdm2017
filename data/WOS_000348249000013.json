The method is applied to achieve the segmentation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image. Firstly, the superpixels are extracted based on multi-scale features. Then, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering based on superpixels is implemented, in which the influence of neighboring and similar superpixels is incorporated into FCM and the influential degree is optimized to improve segmentation performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve an impressive accuracy of SAR segmentation. For application extension, when we extract corresponding feature from several types of specific images, the proposed method is able to achieve better segmentation performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
