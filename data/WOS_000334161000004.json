In this paper, we first identify the key requirements of designing an efficient and flexible architecture for integrating MCC and VCPS. Based on the requirements, we design a VCPS and MCC Integration Architecture (VCMIA), which provides mobile services for potential users such as drivers and passengers to access mobile traffic cloud. Then, we ana- lyze two crucial cloud-supported components: GIS with traffic-aware capability and cloud-supported dynamic vehicle routing. Finally, we select Vehicle Maintenance Services (VMS) as an application scenario to carry out the validation. The proposed VCMIA can provide the flexibility for enabling diverse applications.", "paper_title": "VCMIA: A Novel Architecture for Integrating Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems and Mobile Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000334161000004"}
