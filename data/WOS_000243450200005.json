In this paper, we present a real-time cloth simulation system that offers a compromise between a realistic physically-based simulation of fabrics and a haptic application with high requirements in terms of computation speed. We place emphasis on architecture and algorithmic choices for obtaining the best compromise in the context of haptic applications. A first implementation using a haptic device demonstrates the features of the proposed system and leads to the development of new approaches for haptic rendering using the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "From measured physical parameters to the haptic feeling of fabric", "paper_id": "WOS:000243450200005"}
