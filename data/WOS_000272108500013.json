Furthermore, the application of improved CE/SE scheme was extended to detonation simulation. Three models were used for chemical reaction in gaseous detonation. And a two-fluid model was used for two-phase (gas-droplet) detonation. Shock reflections were simulated by the improved CE/SE scheme and the numerical results were compared with those obtained by other different numerical schemes. Gaseous and gas-droplet planar detonations were simulated and the numerical results were carefully compared with the experimental data and theoretical results based on C-J theory. Mach reflection of a cellular detonation was also simulated, and the numerical cellular patterns were compared with experimental ones. Comparisons show that the improved CE/SE scheme is clear in physical concept, easy to be implemented and high accurate for above-mentioned problems.
