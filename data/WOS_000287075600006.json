At the same time, a buffer layer using MoO3 was induced between m-MTDATA and N,N'-bis-[1-naphthy(-N,N'diphenyl-1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'-diamine)](NPB) to prompt hole injection because not only the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of MoO3 is suitable to be used as buffer layer but also the interfacial doping effect of MoO3 induces interfacial charge transfer complex formation between MoO3 and NPB. At current density of 20 mA/cm(2), compared with control device, the current efficiency, power efficiency and luminance of device using ultrathin Alq(3)-LiF-Al trilayer and MoO3 were increased by 64%, 101% and 63% respectively, while driving voltage was reduced by 26%. After a series of single-carrier devices were made to analyze performance improvement of device using ultrathin Alq(3)-LiF-Al trilayer and MoO3, it is found that efficient carrier balance can improve device performance remarkably.
