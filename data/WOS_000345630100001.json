The responses of the two constituent groups are evaluated independently, then the responses are juxtaposed for between-group analysis. Additional concerns are elicited from the respective groups, and the social representations generated are reported per stakeholder group. Analysis is illustrated through network topic maps and discussed based on the authors' interpretations of the findings. The findings show some marked differences between the groups suggesting that IS academics are more critical of the IS discipline than business school deans.", "paper_title": "Is the IS Crisis Real?
