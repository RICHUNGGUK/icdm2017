The texture pattern produced by the finger knuckle bending is highly unique and makes the surface a distinctive biometric identifier. The finger geometry features can be simultaneously acquired from the same image at the same time and integrated to further improve the user-identification accuracy of such a system. The fingerback surface images from each user are normalized to minimize the scale, translation, and rotational variations in the knuckle images. This paper details the development of such an approach using peg-free imaging. The experimental results from the proposed approach are promising and confirm the usefulness of such an approach for personal authentication.", "paper_title": "Personal Authentication Using Finger Knuckle Surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000263640700008"}
