To state results simply, consider a proportional-growth asymptotic, where for fixed delta, rho in (0, 1), we have a sequence of matrices A(n,Nn) and of integers k(n) with n/N(n) -> delta and k(n)/(n) -> rho as n -> infinity. If each matrix A(n,Nn) has its columns in general position, then fk(AI(N))/f(k)(I(N)) tends to zero or one depending on whether rho > min(0, 2 - delta(-1)) or rho < min(0, 2 - delta(-1)). Also, if each A(n,Nn) is a random draw from a distribution which is invariant under right multiplication by signed permutations, then f(k)(AR(+)(N))/f(k)(R(+)(N)) tends almost surely to zero or one depending on whether sigma > min(0, 2 - delta(-1)) or rho < min(0, 2 - delta(-1)). We make a variety of contrasts to related work on projections of the simplex and/or cross-polytope. These geometric face-counting results have implications for signal processing, information theory, inverse problems, and optimization. Indeed, face counting is related to conditions for uniqueness of solutions of underdetermined systems of linear equations.
