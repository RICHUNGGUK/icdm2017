In this paper two families of quantum error-correcting codes are constructed based on Hermitian curves. Unlike the case of classical codes, it is a difficult, sometimes impossible, task to puncture a quantum stabilizer code. The puncture code of Hermitian codes is computed that allows one to determine the admissible puncturings. A large number of punctured Hermitian codes are derived by exploiting known facts about the weight distribution of these puncture codes.", "paper_title": "Nonbinary quantum codes from Hermitian curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000236107500013"}
