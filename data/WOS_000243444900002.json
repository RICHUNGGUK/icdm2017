Fluid. 2001; 30:37-67) for the simulation of acoustic wave propagation. The emphasis is put on the formulation of an efficient method on structured curvilinear rids, along with the definition and implementation of efficient boundary conditions. The cases of inflow, outflow, rigid/compliant walls and walls with prescribed impedance are addressed. The proposed boundary conditions are assessed on generic cases. The pseudo-characteristic formulation enables a straightforward and optimal use of high-order upwind dispersion-relation-preserving schemes, yielding an efficient method.
