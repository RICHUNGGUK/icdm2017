Given the volume fractions of each material in mesh elements, the method first recreates the material interfaces in the elements using interface reconstruction methods. Then the mesh is subdivided along the interfaces making sure that the final polyhedral mesh is conforming. Finally, the diffusion equation is solved on the sub-divided mesh containing all single material elements. It is shown that the method produces second-order accurate solutions with a lower error than methods that average the material properties in the multi-material elements.
