We use the multi-level-multi-scale dynamic substructure method so that we need only to eliminate a few nodes in advancing a fractal level. We shall give four numerical examples including the von Koch curves and the L-system. The natural frequencies and the dynamic power laws are presented. Example 4 has a fractal dimension that is a function of fractal level and has intermittence power laws discovered here for the first time. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
