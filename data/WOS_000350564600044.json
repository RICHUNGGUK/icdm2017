Our position is that in order to address this problem, a key challenge that must be addressed is the design of a massively scalable global name service that rapidly resolves identities to network locations under high mobility. Our primary contribution is the design, implementation, and evaluation of Auspice, a next-generation global name service that addresses this challenge. A key insight underlying Auspice is a demand-aware replica placement engine that intelligently replicates name records to provide low lookup latency, low update cost, and high availability. We have implemented a prototype of Auspice and compared it against several commercial managed DNS providers as well as state-of-the-art research alternatives, and shown that Auspice significantly outperforms both. We demonstrate proof-of-concept that Auspice can serve as a complete end-to-end mobility solution as well as enable novel context-based communication primitives that generalize name-or address-based communication in today's Internet.", "paper_title": "A Global Name Service for a Highly Mobile Internetwork", "paper_id": "WOS:000350564600044"}
