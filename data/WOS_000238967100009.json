The pruning maintains the geodesic distances between nodes. It has shown itself to be very useful in the analysis of, amongst others, citations in BIS (bibliometrics, informetrics, and scientometrics). It has even been proposed for the online display of the search results in an information retrieval system. However, its great time and space complexity limits its use in real-time applications and in networks of any considerable size. The present work describes an improved algorithm with considerably reduced time and space complexity. Its lower execution costs thus increase its applicability both in real time and to large networks. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
