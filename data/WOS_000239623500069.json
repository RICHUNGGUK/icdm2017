However, when applied to text classification domain, the high dimensionality, the diversity of text data sets and the class skew make classification tasks more complicated. In this study, we present a new method for associative text categorization tasks. First,we integrate the feature selection into rule pruning process rather than a separate preprocess procedure. Second, we combine several techniques to efficiently extract rules. Third, a new score model is used to handle the problem caused by imbalanced class distribution. A series of experiments on various real text corpora indicate that by applying our approaches, associative text classification (ATC) can achieve as competitive classification performance as well-known support vector machines (SVM) do.", "paper_title": "Feature selection, rule extraction, and score model: Making ATC competitive with SVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500069"}
