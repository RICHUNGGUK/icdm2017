The approach models the marbleization process as a two-dimensional fluid dynamics problem, whereby color advection of an input image results in a marbleized image. During the fluid dynamics simulation, we add a pixel-level external force field which is tangent to salient features in the image. The forces are computed from the image characteristics without user intervention. A stylized image with marble-like appearance is easily created that maintains the basic shape of objects in the input image. The entire modeling framework is implemented on a graphics processing unit, thus enabling real-time visual feedback. This approach provides a new tool to design figurative marbling textures without mixing of colors, which are almost impossible with previous computer-generated marbling methods.", "paper_title": "Real-time image marbleization", "paper_id": "WOS:000317608600014"}
