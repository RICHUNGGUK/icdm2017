In the proposed scheme, system working environment is learned and the environmental context is identified. Best selection is applied to the environment context where one classifier strongly dominates the other. In the remaining context, fusion of multiple classifiers is applied. The decision of best selection or fusion is made using t-test decision model. Fusion methods namely Cosine based identify and Euclidian identify. In the proposed scheme, we are modeling for t-test based combination system. A group of classifiers are assigned to each environmental context in prior. Then the decision of fusion of more than one classifiers or selecting best classifier is made using proposed t-test decision model.", "paper_title": "T-test model for context aware classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600047"}
