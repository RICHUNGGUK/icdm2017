For compositional system design, parallel composition of timed automata as proposed by Larsen et al. [22] is useful. Although parallel composition provides a general method for system construction, in the low level behavior, components often behave sequentially by passing control via communication. This paper proposes a behavioral model, named controller automata, to combine timed automata by focusing on the control passing between components. In a controller automaton, to each state a timed automaton is assigned. A timed automaton at a state may be preempted by the control passing to another state by a global labeled transition. A controller automaton properly extends the expressive power because of the stack, but this can make the reachability problem undecidable. Given a strict partial order over states, we show that this problem can be avoided and a controller automaton can be faithfully translated into a timed automaton.", "paper_title": "MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF REAL-TIME SYSTEMS WITH MUTEX COMPONENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306071800005"}
