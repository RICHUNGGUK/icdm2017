This method has been designed to detect the optic disk center and the optic disk rim. In our experiments with the DRIVE and DIARETDB1 databases, the proposed method was able to detect the optic disk center with 100% and 97.75% of accuracy, respectively. We considered correct all automatically detected optic disk location that is within the borders of the optic disk marked manually. Using our proposed method, the rim of the optic disk was detected in all images of the DRIVE database with average sensitivity and specificity of 83.54% and 99.81%, respectively, and on the DIARETDB1 database with average sensitivity and specificity of 92.51% and 99.76%, respectively.
