[A. El-Amawy, S. Latifi, Properties and performance of folded hypercubes, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems 2(3) (1991) 31-42], is an (n + 1)-regular (n + 1)-connected graph. Conditional diagnosability, a new measure of diagnosability introduced by Lai et al. [Pao-Lien Lai, Jimmy J.M. Tan, Chien-Ping Chuang, Lih-Hsing Hsu, Conditional diagnosability measures for large multiprocessor systems, IEEE Transactions on Computers 54(2) (2005) 165-175] can better measure the diagnosability of regular interconnection networks. This paper determines that under PMC-model the conditional diagnosability of FQ(n) (t(c)(FQ(n))) is 4n - 3 when n = 5 or n >= 8; t(c)(FQ(3)) = 3, t(c)(FQ(4)) = 7. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
