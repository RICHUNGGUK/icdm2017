A system architecture is suggested, and basic principles of its functioning are discussed. For data integration, it is proposed to use a combined approach based on Linked Data sets. The system can be applied for integration of data from numerous autonomous sources, between which sufficiently stable links may be identified.", "paper_title": "Scientific data integration system in the linked open data space", "paper_id": "WOS:000314335500005"}
