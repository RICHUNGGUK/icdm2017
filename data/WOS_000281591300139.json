Project portfolio managers need methods and tools to find a good solution for complex project portfolios and multiobjective target criteria efficiently. However, software project portfolios are challenging to describe for optimization in a practical way that allows efficient optimization. In this paper we propose an approach to describe software project portfolios with a set of multiobjective criteria for portfolio managers using the COCOMO II model and introduce a multiobjective evolutionary approach, mPOEMS, to find the Pareto-optimal front efficiently. We evaluate the new approach with portfolios choosing from a set of 50 projects that follow the validated COCOMO II model criteria and compare the performance of the mPOEMS approach with state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization evolutionary approaches. Major results are as follows: the portfolio management approach was found usable and useful; the mPOEMS approach outperformed the other approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
