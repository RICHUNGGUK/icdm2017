Poly-silicon, as a representative industry in a low carbon economy, has become the focus of a low carbon economy. However, its production process consumes a great deal of energy, and produces excessive waste and poisonous fluids such as SiCL4. This paper aims to study the poly-silicon industry planning, find the energy hungry and pollution intensive links, and seek solutions to their control and optimization. First, we select and optimize the main factors affecting the planning using a fuzzy chance-constrained model. Then, we simulate and analyze the complete industry chain using system dynamics. Finally, the world natural and cultural heritage area, Leshan has been studied as an example to show how decision making can be improved from the insight that the model provides.", "paper_title": "Simulation and Optimization of One Low-Carbon Poly-Silicon Industry Production Chains Using SD-FCCM in World Natural and Cultural Heritage Areas: A Case Study in China", "paper_id": "WOS:000345620800019"}
