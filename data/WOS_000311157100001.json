Particular types of routing protocols are known as bioinspired. Related to theses, the algorithms based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), are particularly relevant. This work presents a new variant of AntOR, a multihop adaptive routing protocol based on AntHocNet which already has two versions: disjoint link routes (AntOR-DLR) and disjoint node (AntOR-DNR). The new protocol, called AntOR-RDLR, differs from AntOR-DLR in the pheromones updating process and the route discovery mechanism. The simulation results indicate that AntOR-RDLR improves their predecessors in all analyzed metrics.", "paper_title": "Restrictive Disjoint-Link-Based Bioinspired Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000311157100001"}
