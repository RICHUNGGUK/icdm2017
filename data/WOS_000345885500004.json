An efficient Multicast Routing and Wavelength Assignment (MRWA) algorithm is important to the design of intra-DCN with fast optical switching. In this paper, with the dynamic traffic and wavelength continuity constraint, a Dynamic Multicast HC-tree Construction (DMTC) scheme is proposed to construct multicast light-trees, to address the MRWA issue for hypercube intra-DCN based on Labeled Optical Burst Switching with Home Circuit (LOBS-HC). In DMTC, load balancing and wavelength utilization are provided to both multicast and unicast transmission by using multiple candidate routing trees for each communication request, and HC-trees are constructed and released dynamically. We evaluate the availability and efficiency of the DMTC scheme with K-shortest Tree (KST) and Independent Spanning Tree (IST) methods through simulation in terms of the total block probability, load balancing guarantee, and wavelength resource cost.", "paper_title": "Dynamical Multicast Light-Tree Construction in Intra-Datacenter Networks with Fast Optical Switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000345885500004"}
