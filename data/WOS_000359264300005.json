They all employ distributed probabilistic tools designed to take into account wireless camera networks (WCNs) capabilities and constraints. They use efficient and distribution-friendly representations and metrics in which each node contributes to the computation in each mechanism without requiring any prior knowledge of the rest of the nodes. These mechanisms are integrated in two different distributed schemes so that they can be implemented in constant time regardless of the cluster size. Their experimental validation showed that the proposed mechanisms and schemes significantly reduce energy consumption (>55 percent) and computational burden with respect to existing methods.", "paper_title": "Efficient Cluster-Based Tracking Mechanisms for Camera-Based Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000359264300005"}
