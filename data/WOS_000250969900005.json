By using the differential clocked CMOS ( (CMOS)-M-2) latch with one shared output holder and the conditional-precharge modules to simplify the sense-amplifier latch, the mCP-SAFF can achieve a much shorter input to output delay (D-to-Q delay) and more symmetrical rising/falling delays than those of the original conditional-precharge sense-amplifier-based flip-flops (CP-SAFF). Post-layout simulation results show that the mCP-SAFF, compared with the widely used conventional DFF, does not suffer neither timing nor area penalties and have achieved up to 34% of power reduction ratio and 33% of power-delay-product ( PDP) reduction ratio, respectively. And the mCP-SAFF is comparable to the prevailing DFFs with regard to noise immunity performance.", "paper_title": "Modified conditional-precharge sense-amplifier-based flip-flop with improved speed", "paper_id": "WOS:000250969900005"}
