Herbrand theorem, completeness theorem (with respect to a classical-like semantics) and cut-elimination theorem are proved for PLK. The correspondence between PLK and PRC is shown by using a faithful embedding of PLK into the sequent calculus LK for classical logic.", "paper_title": "Foundations of paraconsistent resolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000240246700003"}
