We model the problem of selecting the servers that will be on and finding their speeds through mixed integer programming; we also show how to combine such solutions with control theory. For proof of concept, we implemented this dynamic configuration scheme in a web server cluster running Linux, with soft real-time requirements and QoS control, in order to guarantee both energy-efficiency and good user experience. In this paper, we show the performance of our scheme compared to other schemes, a comparison of a centralized and a distributed approach for QoS control, and a comparison of schemes for choosing speeds of servers.
