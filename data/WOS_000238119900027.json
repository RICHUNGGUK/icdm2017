An external arc is defined as an arc connecting two distinct blocks. The problem can be shown to be NP-hard generally, and to remain intractable even if B = 2 and the height of DAGs is three. In this paper we provide a factor linear time approximation algorithm for B = 2, and prove that the ratio is optimal in terms of approximation guarantee. In the case of B >= 3, we also show that there is no 3/2 - epsilon factor approximation algorithm assuming P not equal NP, where e is arbitrarily small positive. Furthermore, we give a 2 factor approximation algorithm for B = 3 if the input is restricted to a set of layered graphs.", "paper_title": "How to pack directed acyclic graphs into small blocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238119900027"}
