These mechanisms are all types of resource pooling, which means making a collection of resources behave like a single pooled resource. We believe that the natural evolution of the Internet is that it should achieve resource pooling by harnessing the responsiveness of multipath-capable end systems. We argue that this approach will solve the problems and limitations of the current piecemeal approaches.", "paper_title": "The Resource Pooling Principle", "paper_id": "WOS:000263599100009"}
