The test is based on Bartlett's statistic. The asymptotic distribution of the statistic is investigated. The limiting distribution is that of a linear combination of i.i.d. chi-square variables with 1 degree of freedom. By using simulation, the critical values of the null distribution of the modified Bartlett's statistic for testing the homogeneity of variances of two normal populations are obtained when the sample sizes and censoring levels are not equal. Also, we investigate the properties of the proposed test (size, power and robustness). Results show that the distribution of the test statistic depends on the censoring level. An example of the use of the new methodology in animal science involving reproduction in ewes is provided.", "paper_title": "A test for equality of variances with censored samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000344408800002"}
