To improve the communication efficiency and the bandwidth utilization of NoC for various applications, we firstly propose a table-based algorithm for identifying the dominant flows at runtime. Then a two-layer NoC architecture with an application-driven bandwidth allocation scheme is presented, which is capable of identifying heavy-load data-flows and dynamically reconfiguring point-to-point (P2P) connections to optimize the heavy-load traffic. Experimental results reveal that our design (8 x 8 mesh NoC) achieves 28.5% performance improvement and 25.9% power consumption saving compared to the baseline NoC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
