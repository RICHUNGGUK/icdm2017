On the other hand, for sufficiently fast growing f (or F), the class of non-speedable computable problems does not have effective measure 0. These results answer some questions raised by Calude and Zimand. We also give a quantitative analysis of Borodin and Trakhtenbrot's Gap Theorem, which corrects a claim by Calude and Zimand.", "paper_title": "Quantitative aspects of speed-up and gap phenomena", "paper_id": "WOS:000284044600002"}
