With the advent of modern communication and computational devices and inexpensive sensors it is possible to collect and process data from a number of sources. Data fusion (DF) is collection of techniques by which information from multiple sources are combined in order to reach a better inference. DF is an inevitable tool for ITS. This paper provides a survey of how DF is used in different areas of ITS. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
