Multiple sclerosis patients are usually treated with interferon-beta but disease activity decrease in only 30-40% of patients. In the attempt to differentiate between responders and non-responders, we screened the main genes involved in the interferon signaling pathway for 38 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a multiple sclerosis Caucasian population from South Italy. We then analyzed the data using a multilayer perceptron neural network-based approach, in which we evaluated the global weight of a set of SNPs localized in different genes and their association with response to interferon therapy through a feature selection procedure (a combination of automatic relevance determination and backward elimination). The neural approach appears to be a useful tool in identifying gene polymorphisms involved in the response of patients to interferon therapy: 2 out of 5 genes were identified as containing 4 out of 38 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms, with a global accuracy of 70% in predicting responder and non-responder patients.
