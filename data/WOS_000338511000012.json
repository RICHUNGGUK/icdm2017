The contribution of any given expert to a final solution depends on a parameter called responsibility, which can vary from cycle to cycle. When resources are insufficient to run all experts, two problems arise: 1) how much utilization is to be allocated to experts and 2) how can a schedule be created based on these allocations. Problem (1) can be formulated as a succession of optimization problems, each of which calculates experts' allocations in a cycle. Explicit mappings from responsibilities to allocation weights are needed to solve each of these problems in every cycle using a technique called \"task compression (TC).\" We refer to this baseline approach as TT-TC. Two other proposed heuristics TT-TC and TT-Top reduce TC's execution time to O(N) for N experts. To address (2), the proposed EPOC scheduler converts the heuristics' allocations into schedules that satisfy capacity, execution, and learning constraints across cycles. Simulations demonstrate that our approaches enable real-time computation and significantly decrease the average percentage error of limited-resource outputs (i.e., 0.2%-40% and 0.3%-0.5% when scheduled with TT-TC* and TT-Top, respectively, versus 0.2%-97% when using TT-TC).", "paper_title": "Dynamic Scheduling of Real-Time Mixture-of-Experts Systems on Limited Resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000338511000012"}
