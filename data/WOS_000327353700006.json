We propose here a fast and robust skew estimation algorithm based on rank analysis in Farey sequence. Our target document class comprises two major Indian scripts with headlines, namely Devnagari and Bangla. At the beginning, straight edge segments from the edge map of the document page are detected by our algorithm using properties of digital straightness. Straight edges derived in this manner are binned by Farey ranks in correspondence with their slopes. The principal bin, identified from these bins using the strength of accumulated edge points, represents the principal direction along the direction of headlines, from which the gross skew angle is estimated. A fast refinement algorithm is then applied with a finer tuning of Farey ranks, to detect the skew up to the desired level of precision. The algorithm has been tested on a diverse set of document images, containing Bangla and Devnagari scripts. Experimental results are quite encouraging in terms of accuracy, sensitivity to non-textual objects, effectiveness in dealing with unrestricted layouts, and computational efficiency.", "paper_title": "SKEW CORRECTION OF DOCUMENT IMAGES BY RANK ANALYSIS IN FAREY SEQUENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000327353700006"}
