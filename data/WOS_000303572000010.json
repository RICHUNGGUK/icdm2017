It might directly influence the driving safety and traffic operation. This paper discusses in enough detail the shaping mechanism of driver expectation while considers road geometer parameters, driver behavior and vehicle performance in mountainous road. Combined various geometer parameters with different driving characteristics, the vehicle trajectory and speed were selected as key factors for describing completely the vehicle's operation condition. And then, the desired trajectory models were established using six basic forms of the desired trajectory. Based on the vehicle dynamics and control strategy, a desired speed model that consisted of the desired trajectory, the driver's experience and vehicle parameter was developed, the numerical simulation results show the simulation-based model of driver expectation is used to driving behavior analysis in mountainous road.", "paper_title": "Model-based simulation of driver expectation in mountainous road using various control strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572000010"}
