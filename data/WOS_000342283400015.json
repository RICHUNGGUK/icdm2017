The proposed algorithm possesses (1) robustness by yielding unit cells with fiber volume fraction of up to 45 % for aspect ratios as high as 20, (2) computationally efficiency accomplished through a hierarchy of algorithms with increasing computational complexity, and (3) versatility by generating unit cells with different inclusion shapes. A statistical study aimed at determining the effective size of the unit cell is conducted. The method has been applied to various random inclusion microstructure composites, including: (1) two-dimensional chopped tow composites employed in automotive applications, (2) polyurea or polyethene coating consisting of hard and soft domains (segments) employed for energy absorption in military and industrial applications, and (3) fiber framework called fiberform embedded in or free from an amorphous matrix used as heat shield on space crafts to prevent structural damage during reentry into the atmosphere.", "paper_title": "Automated modeling of random inclusion composites", "paper_id": "WOS:000342283400015"}
