The overshoot/undershoot voltage and the transient recovery time are effectively reduced. The APM control can always maintain the system phase margin at an adequate value under different load conditions. That is, the compensation pole-zero pair is adapted to load current to extend the system bandwidth and get an adequate phase margin. Experimental results show the overshoot/undershoot voltage is smaller than 60 mV (3%) and transient period is smaller than 12 mu s as load current suddenly changes from 100 to 500 mA, or vice versa. Compared with conventional designs without any fast transient technique, the undershoot voltage and recovery time are enhanced by 45% and 85%, respectively.", "paper_title": "Fast Transient (FT) Technique With Adaptive Phase Margin (APM) for Current Mode DC-DC Buck Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000306922400004"}
