This paper proposes a new method to register 2-D flat and 3-D CT image first to facilitate the registration between small 3-D FMT images and large 3-D CT images. A novel algorithm combining differential evolution and improved simplex method for the registration between the 2-D flat and 3-D CT images is introduced and validated with simulated images and real images of mice. The visualization of the alignment of the 3-D FMT and CT image through 2-D registration shows promising results.", "paper_title": "Registration of 3-D CT and 2-d flat images of mouse via affine transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000259571700003"}
