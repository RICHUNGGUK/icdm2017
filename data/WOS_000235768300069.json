An improved DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) algorithm is put forward to verify online signatures based on writing forces. Compared to the general DTW algorithm, this one deals with the varying consistency of signature point, signing duration and the different weights of writing forces in different direction. The iterative experiment is introduced to decide weights for writing forces in different direction and the classification threshold. A signature database is constructed with F-Tablet and the experiments results are present in the end.", "paper_title": "Online signature verification based on global feature of writing forces", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300069"}
