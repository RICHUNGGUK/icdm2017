Unlike other approaches this technique uses an incremental learning method, to model both the colour variations and posterior probability distributions of spatio-temporal links between cameras. These operate in parallel and are then used with an appearance model of the object to track across spatially separated cameras. The approach requires no pre-calibration or batch preprocessing, is completely unsupervised, and becomes more accurate over time as evidence is accumulated.", "paper_title": "Tracking objects across cameras by incrementally learning inter-camera colour calibration and patterns of activity", "paper_id": "WOS:000237555200010"}
