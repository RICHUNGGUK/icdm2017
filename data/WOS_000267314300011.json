Both strip and spread footings were considered in the finite element analyses. In each case, different footing distances were applied for the purposes of comparison among all of the results. From these results, it was observed that the load responses of multiple footings are similar to those of the single footing at distances greater than three times the footing width. Design equation and correlation parameters, necessary for quantifying the values of the bearing capacity ratio for the different multiple-footing configuration, were derived. Experimental test results from the literature were selected and used in verifying the proposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
