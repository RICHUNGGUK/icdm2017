The Supply chain problem is modeled with capacity constraints and demand variations over different time periods to minimize the total supply chain configuration cost. The algorithm portfolio is implemented over Various problem instances to inspect and alleviate the computational expensiveness of a solution strategy. A bunch of five algorithms are utilized hereby viz. AIS, GA, Endosymbiotic Optimization, PSO and Psychoclonal algorithm. The observations reflect the appropriateness and effect of algorithm portfolios over the adopted supply chain, and viability over other optimization problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
