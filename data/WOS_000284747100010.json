Two sets of oscillating patterns with different frequencies, mean oscillating angles and amplitudes are numerically simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and the results obtained are validated against the corresponding published experimental data. It is concluded that the CFD prediction captures well the vortex-shedding predominated flow structure which is experimentally obtained and the results quantitatively agree well with the experimental data, except when the blade is at a very high angle of attack.
