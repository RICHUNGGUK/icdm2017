A heuristic analysis of our algorithm indicates that asymptotically for varying q, \"almost all\" instances of the DLP in degree 0 class groups of curves represented by plane models of a fixed degree d >= 4 over F-q can be solved in an expected time of O(q(2-2)/((d-2))). Additionally we provide a method to represent \"sufficiently general\" (non-hyperelliptic) curves of genus g >= 3 by plane models of degree g + 1. We conclude that on heuristic grounds, \"almost all\" instances of the DLP in degree 0 class groups of (non-hyperelliptic) curves of a fixed genus g >= 3 (represented initially by plane models of bounded degree) can be solved in an expected time of 6(q(2-2/(g-1))).", "paper_title": "An index calculus algorithm for plane curves of small degree", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566700038"}
