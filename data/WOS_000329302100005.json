The nonlinear distortion in the concurrent dual-band PA is quite different from that in the conventional single-band PA. This article analyzes the nonlinearities in the concurrent dual-band PA and reveals that both input signals in the dual bands are important for the behavioral modeling. The 2D Hammerstein model and 2D Wiener model are proposed for the first time for the concurrent dual-band PA. They are extended versions of conventional Hammerstein and Wiener structures used in the single-band PA by including the cross-band intermodulation in the static nonlinearity block. The proposed 2D models require much less coefficients than the original work of the 2D-DPD model. Experiments were carried out for an 880 MHz/1960 MHz concurrent dual-band Doherty PA to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models. The results clearly show that less than -40 dB normalized mean square errors (NMSEs) are obtained in the dual bands in the behavioral modeling. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
