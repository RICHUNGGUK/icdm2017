The proposed technique employs the master-slave approach and offers large transconductance tuning range using a control current. The transconductor was designed using triple-well 0.13 mu m CMOS process under the ultra low supply voltage of 0.5 V. The circuit features 37 dB open loop gain, CMRR = 31 dB at each output node, PSRR = 90 dB and GBW = 530 MHz for 120 mu A current consumption.", "paper_title": "0.5 V CMOS inverter-based tunable transconductor", "paper_id": "WOS:000304874300032"}
