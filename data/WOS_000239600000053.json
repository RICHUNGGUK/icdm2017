The end result of DRSA is a decision rule model of Decision Maker preferences. In this paper, we consider an additive function model resulting from dominance-based rough approximations. The presented approach is similar to UTA and UTADTS methods. However, we define a goal function of the optimization problem in a similar way as it is done in Support Vector Machines (SVM). The problem may. also be defined as the one of searching for linear value functions in a transformed feature space obtained by exhaustive binarization of criteria.", "paper_title": "Additive preference model with piecewise linear components resulting from Dominance-based Rough Set Approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000053"}
