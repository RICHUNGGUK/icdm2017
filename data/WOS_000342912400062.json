While relative quantification has been commonly used in proteomics, few proteomic datasets measuring absolute protein quantities have been reported to date. Various technologies have been applied using different types of input data, e.g. ion intensities or spectral counts, as well as different absolute normalization strategies. To date, a user-friendly and transparent software supporting large-scale absolute protein quantification has been lacking. Results: We present a bioinformatics tool, termed aLFQ, which supports the commonly used absolute label-free protein abundance estimation methods (TopN, iBAQ, APEX, NSAF and SCAMPI) for LCMS/MS proteomics data, together with validation algorithms enabling automated data analysis and error estimation.", "paper_title": "aLFQ: an R-package for estimating absolute protein quantities from label-free LC-MS/MS proteomics data", "paper_id": "WOS:000342912400062"}
