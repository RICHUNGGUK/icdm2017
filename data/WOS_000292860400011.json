The first order kinetic flux vector splitting (KFVS) method has been found to be very robust but suffers from the problem of having much more numerical diffusion than required, resulting in inaccurate computation of the above flow features. However, numerical dissipation can be reduced by refining the grid or by using higher order kinetic schemes. In flows with strong shock waves, the higher order schemes require limiters, which reduce the local order of accuracy to first order, resulting in degradation of flow features in many cases. Further, these schemes require more points in the stencil and hence consume more computational time and memory. In this paper, we present a low dissipative modified KFVS (m-KFVS) method which leads to improved splitting of inviscid fluxes. The m-KFVS method captures the above flow features more accurately compared to first order KFVS and the results are comparable to second order accurate KFVS method, by still using the first order stencil.
