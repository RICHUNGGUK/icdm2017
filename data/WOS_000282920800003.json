We give a characterization of the class of languages recognized by NQFAs, demonstrating that it is equal to the class of exclusive stochastic languages. We also characterize the class of languages that are recognized necessarily by two-sided error by QFAs. It is shown that these classes remain the same when the QFAs used in their definitions are replaced by several different model variants that have appeared in the literature. We prove several closure properties of the related classes. The ramifications of these results about classical and quantum sublogarithmic space complexity classes are examined.", "paper_title": "LANGUAGES RECOGNIZED BY NONDETERMINISTIC QUANTUM FINITE AUTOMATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000282920800003"}
