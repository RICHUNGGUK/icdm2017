After training the competence estimation functions, the adaptive mechanism enables our system the filtering of unsure judgments of classifiers for a specific input. Comparison with classical and non-adaptive approaches proves the superiority of this model. Also we examined how these features contribute to the combined result and whether they can together establish a more robust feature.", "paper_title": "Study of facial features combination using a novel adaptive fuzzy integral fusion model", "paper_id": "WOS:000257930400004"}
