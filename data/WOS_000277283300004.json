Data storage and sharing is difficult for these devices due to the data inflation and the natural limitations of mobile devices, such as the limited storage space and the limited computing capability. Since the emerging cloud storage solutions can provide reliable and unlimited storage, they satisfy to the requirement of pervasive computing very well. Thus we designed a new cloud storage platform which includes a series of shadow storage services to address these new data management challenges in pervasive computing environments, which called as \"SmartBox\". In SmartBox, each device is associated its shadow storage with a unique account, and the shadow storage acts as backup center as well as personal repository when the device is connected. To facilitate file navigation, all datasets in shadow storage are organized based on file attributes which support the users to seek files by semantic queries. We implemented a prototype of SmartBox focusing on pervasive environments being made up of Internet accessible devices. Experimental results with the deployments confirm the efficacy of shadow storage services in SmartBox.", "paper_title": "Design a cloud storage platform for pervasive computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000277283300004"}
