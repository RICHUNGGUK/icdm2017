Inspired by the recent Bayesian/variational dejittering model of Shen (SIAM J. Appl. Math., vol. 64, pp. 1691-1708, 2004), in the current paper we propose a novel dejittering approach nicknamed 'bake-and-shake.' The bake step is to apply Perona-Malik type nonlinear diffusions to 'melt away' or heat Up the jittered video frames, based upon which the shake step is able to optimally estimate. the individual line jitters and renormalize the jittered images. Numerical implementation of the bake-and-shake algorithm as well as several computational results are presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
