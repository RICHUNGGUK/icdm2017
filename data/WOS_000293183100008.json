These blocks include a mixer, a filter, and an ADC that are cascaded to build each analog processing path of the FTH-ADC. The mixer-filter path is designed with sufficient linearity and signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) to accommodate for the desired resolution of the path ADC. A 4-bit flash ADC structure is used in each path. This path has a signal bandwidth of 0.5 GHz and frequency-translates the input signal into baseband and digitizes it with the sample rate of 2 GHz. Multiple such mixer-filter-ADC paths are then combined together with proper mixing frequencies in order to implement two- and three-channel ADC systems. The two- and three-channel systems have overall input bandwidths of 2 and 3 GHz and effective conversion rates of 4 and 6 GS/s, respectively, while maintaining their single-path resolution across their entire input bandwidths. The implemented architecture provides an extendible solution to improve the speed of ADCs by incorporating them in an FTH-ADC architecture.", "paper_title": "4-and 6-GS/s 4-bit frequency-translating hybrid ADCs in 90-nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293183100008"}
