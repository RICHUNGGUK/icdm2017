A total mean absolute deviation of 1.67 kcal mol(-1) was achieved with G3(MP2)-CEP, compared with 1.47 kcal mol(-1) for G3(MP2). Electron affinities and enthalpies of formation are the properties exhibiting the lowest deviations with respect to the original G3(MP2) theory. The use of pseudopotentials and composite theories in the framework of the G3 theory is feasible and compatible with the all electron approach.", "paper_title": "G3(MP2)-CEP theory and applications for compounds containing atoms from representative first, second and third row elements of the periodic table", "paper_id": "WOS:000359539700007"}
