In general, the results of academic research should be verified by assessing objective effectiveness, which is often represented by a recognition ratio. Although objective effectiveness is also a requirement for research in music generation, it is meaningless unless subjective requisites are also satisfied. However, it is not easy for researchers to execute subjective evaluations within their individual endeavours. To address this difficulty within the research area of computer systems for generating expressive music performances, the Performance Rendering Contest (Rencon) was created. This is an international competition in which entrants present computer systems and the performances generated are graded, and has been held in conjunction with related international conferences. This paper presents an overview of Rencon history, highlighting the evaluative motivation of each contest. In addition, we discuss the possibilities of a new scientific research field in which future Rencons may play a role.", "paper_title": "On Evaluating Systems for Generating Expressive Music Performance: the Rencon Experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000312443400002"}
