The proposed technique is based on the localization of regional intensity maxima associated with protein spots and is formulated so as to ignore rectangular-shaped streaks, minimize the detection of false negatives, and allow the detection of multiple overlapping spots. Regional intensity constraints are imposed on the localized maxima in order to cope with the presence of noise and artifacts. The experimental evaluation of the proposed technique on real proteomics images demonstrates that it: 1) achieves a predictive value (PV) and detection sensitivity (DS) which exceed 90%; 2) outperforms Melanie software package in terms of PV, specificity, and DS; 3) ignores artifacts; 4) distinguishes multiple overlapping spots; 5) locates spots within streaks; and 6) is automated and efficient.", "paper_title": "A Computer-Based Technique for Automated Spot Detection in Proteomics Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000293660300021"}
