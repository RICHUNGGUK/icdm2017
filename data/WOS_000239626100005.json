Previous attempts of simulating conversations in grammar systems used rewriting rules, which remained fix and unchangeable during the whole dialogue. The novelty of this approach is that taking inspiration from a Multi Agent Protocol language we define a grammatical system in which agents (grammars) behaviours are given by string process descriptions or protocols. Strings can be modified during running time, allowing to dynamically alter agent behaviour according to the environmental changes. This provides agents with a more flexible and adaptative reaction to unpredictable and changeable conversational space.", "paper_title": "A grammatical framework for modelling multi-agent dialogues", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100005"}
