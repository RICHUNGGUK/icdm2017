The depth of image is conventionally defined as the distance between the corresponding scene point of the image and the pinhole of the camera, which is not in harmony with the depth perception of human vision. In this paper we define a new perceptual depth of image which is perceived by human vision. The traditional computation models of image depth are all based on the physical imaging model, which ignores the human depth perception. This paper presents a novel computation model based on the visual Perception theory. In this approach, using Pictorial Cues like sky and ground, we can get the relative perceptual depth from a single 2-D image. Experimental results show that our model is effective and corresponds to the human perception.", "paper_title": "Visual perception theory guided image perceptual depth estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211400012"}
