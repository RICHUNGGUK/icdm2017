Consequently, the peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm is receiving significant attention as an alternative. The authors propose a multilayer P2P framework for developing distributed synchronous collaborative systems using asynchronous P2P platforms. They've used the framework to develop a shared Web browser using the Java programming language and the JXTA platform.", "paper_title": "A multilayer peer-to-peer framework for distributed synchronous collaboration", "paper_id": "WOS:000241909100005"}
