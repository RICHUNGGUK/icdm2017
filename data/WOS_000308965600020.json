Using codes for the character-constrained channel, we present simple and systematic constructions of high-rate binary maximum runlength constrained codes. The new constructions have the virtue that large lookup tables for encoding and decoding are not required. We will compare the error propagation performance of codes based on the new construction with that of prior art codes.", "paper_title": "High-Rate Maximum Runlength Constrained Coding Schemes Using Nibble Replacement", "paper_id": "WOS:000308965600020"}
