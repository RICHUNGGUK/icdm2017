We use a front-fixing transformation of the underlying asset variable to fix the free boundary conditions and approximate the integral term by the Laguerre polynomials. We use the Radial basis functions (RBF) method to achieve an implicit nonlinear system of first order equations and apply the Crank-Nicholson scheme. We apply the Predictor-Corrector method, to deal with the system of nonlinear equations. The proposed method is stable and the results are in agreement with those obtained by other numerical methods in literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
