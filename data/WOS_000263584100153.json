Minimal conditions for interoperability are: (1) to discover and plug in proper services for integration and (2) to support for seamless data exchanges between component services. A similarity-based approximate matching is a practical approach for both, in that the service discovery relies on functional matches between a query and service descriptions, and the seamless data exchange is granted by mapping information from a service to others. To these ends, this paper comprehensively investigates functional attributes of web services and their manipulation, and particularly highlights an information compatibility and mapping analysis. The functional quality of service (FQoS) allows service discovery and selection to step forward. Simulation results show that the present FQoS metrics are effective in service discovery, (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
