The proposed TB-CBP-BDI real-time agent is the core of a multi-agent system that manages security issues in industrial environments, where time constraints are a key factor. The proposed planning model facilitates the automatic temporal bounded reorganization of tasks to provide the system with adaptation abilities to the changes that occur in the environment. The planning mechanism focuses on optimizing industrial and manufacturing processes, specifically the tasks performed by the available security entities in these environments. Additionally, several Ambient Intelligence technologies such as QR-CODES, GPS, Wi-Fi and HSDPA are used to develop the intelligent environment that was tested and analyzed in this study.
