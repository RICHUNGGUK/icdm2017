In this paper, we propose a fuzzy adhoc rate-based congestion control (FARCC) to enhance the efficiency of network in MANETs. In FARCC, we use a rate-based transmission scheme using two fuzzy controller of zero order Takagi Sugeno Kang (TSK) model to congestion detection and congestion control. The FARCC sender adjusts data rate by receiving a feedback packet from FARCC destination. NS2-based simulation results show that FARCC outperforms ITP and ATP to achieve, in terms of throughput and fair resource allocation in Ad Hoc networks under random topology.", "paper_title": "A Rate based Congestion Control Mechanism using Fuzzy Controller in MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000319952400014"}
