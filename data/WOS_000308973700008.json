In this work, we show how to construct lossy trapdoor functions from homomorphic reproducible PKE. generalizing the DDH-based construction given by Peikert and Waters (STOC 2008). We also show that reproducible PKE can be constructed from standard number-theoretic assumptions, including DDH, QR. and OCR, and from smooth projective hash proof systems. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
