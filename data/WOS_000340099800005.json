Supposing each pixel of the target image has an optimal local scale from the segmentation viewpoint, we treat the lip segmentation problem as a combination of observation scale selection and observed data classification. Accordingly, we propose a hierarchical multiscale Markov random field (MRF) model to represent the membership map of each input pixel to a specific segment and localscale map simultaneously. Subsequently, lip segmentation can be formulated as an optimal problem in the maximum a posteriori (MAP)-MRF framework. Then, we present a rival-penalized iterative algorithm to implement the segmentation, which is independent of the number of predefined segments. The proposed method mainly features two aspects: 1) its performance is independent of the predefined number of segments, and 2) it takes into account the local optimal observation scale for each pixel. Finally, we conduct the experiments on four benchmark databases, i.e. AR, CVL, GTAV, and VidTIMIT. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust to the segment number that changes with a speaker's appearance, and can enhance the segmentation accuracy by taking advantage of the local optimal observation scale information.", "paper_title": "Lip Segmentation under MAP-MRF Framework with Automatic Selection of Local Observation Scale and Number of Segments", "paper_id": "WOS:000340099800005"}
