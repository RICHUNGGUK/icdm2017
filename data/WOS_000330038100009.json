Our developments are motivated by the need for sub-linear time algorithms to solve large-scale parametric bilinear saddle point problems where cheap online assessment of the solution quality is crucial. We present the theoretical efficiency estimates of our algorithms and discuss a number of applications, primarily to the problem of l(1) minimization arising in sparsity-oriented signal processing. We demonstrate, both theoretically and by numerical examples, that when seeking for medium-accuracy solutions of large-scale l(1) minimization problems, our randomized algorithms outperform significantly (and progressively as the sizes of the problem grow) the state-of-the art deterministic methods.", "paper_title": "Randomized first order algorithms with applications to l(1)-minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000330038100009"}
