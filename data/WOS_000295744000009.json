Equivalent linearized models, which are proposed in the literature, are assessed through parametric studies, using a specially-developed software. The aim is to obtain an insight on their suitability and identify how that may be affected by certain parameters. The results indicate that the estimation of the effective characteristics influences considerably the computed response. Linear elastic analysis may be used in the preliminary design. However, for analysis and research purposes, the more accurate bilinear inelastic analysis should be used. (C) 2011 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
