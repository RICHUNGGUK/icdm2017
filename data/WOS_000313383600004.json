While these features enhance automobile safety and reliability, the security impact is a growing concern. This paper examines the security of drive-by-wire automobile systems. Generic models of access control and information flow are defined, with specific instances of the 2010 Toyota Prius used where appropriate. The automobile systems are examined from the viewpoint of the driver with special emphasis on the driver's ability to determine who, or what, is actually in control of the automobile in critical situations.
