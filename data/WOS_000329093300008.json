ACM, New York, 1996) to accelerate the search for improved offsprings. We then specialize the above formulation to two specific search heuristics: Random Local Search and the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm. We call the resulting quantum versions of these search heuristics Quantum Local Search and the (1+1) Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm. We conduct a rigorous runtime analysis of these quantum search heuristics in the computation model of quantum algorithms, which, besides classical computation steps, also permits those unique to quantum computing devices. To this end, we study the six elementary pseudo-Boolean optimization problems OneMax, LeadingOnes, Discrepancy, Needle, Jump, and TinyTrap. It turns out that the advantage of the respective quantum search heuristic over its classical counterpart varies with the problem structure and ranges from no speedup at all for the problem Discrepancy to exponential speedup for the problem TinyTrap. We show that these runtime behaviors are closely linked to the probabilities of performing successful mutations in the classical algorithms.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary Algorithms for Quantum Computers", "paper_id": "WOS:000329093300008"}
