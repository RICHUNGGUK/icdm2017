When a random sample Y1, ..., Yn is examined sequentially and successive minimum values are recorded, Samaniego and Whitaker [F.J. Samaniego, and L.R. Whitaker, On estimating popular characteristics from record breaking observations I. Parametric results, Naval Res. Logist. Quart. 33 (1986), pp. 531-543] obtained a maximum likelihood estimator of the mean of the population and showed its convergence in probability. We establish here its convergence in mean square error, which is stronger than the convergence in probability. Next, we discuss the optimal sample size for estimating the mean based on a criterion involving a cost function as well as the Fisher information based on records arising from a random sample. Finally, a comparison between complete data and record is carried out and some special cases are discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "Optimal sample size for record data and associated cost analysis for exponential distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000284477100007"}
