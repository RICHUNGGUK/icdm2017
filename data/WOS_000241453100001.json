These results involve semilinear sets given by additive circuits as input data. If arbitrary real constants are allowed in the circuit, the completeness results are for the Blum-Shub-Smale additive model of computation. If, in contrast, the circuit is constant-free, then the completeness results are for the Turing model of computation. One such result, the P-NP[log]-completeness of deciding Zariski irreducibility, exhibits for the first time a problem with a geometric nature complete in this class.", "paper_title": "The complexity of semilinear problems in succinct representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241453100001"}
