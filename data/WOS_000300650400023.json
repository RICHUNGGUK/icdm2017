Its activation/inactivation mechanism is related to conformational changes in its cytoplasmatic kinase domain, involving first among all the alpha C-helix in N-lobe and the A-loop in C-lobe. Affinity of inhibitors for the active or inactive kinase form could dictate the open or closed conformation of the A-loop, thus making the different conformations of the kinase domain receptor (KDR) domain different drug targets in drug discovery. In this view, a detailed knowledge of the conformational landscape of KDR domain is of central relevance to rationalize the efficiency and selectivity of kinase inhibitors. Here, molecular dynamics simulations were used to gain insight in:to the conformational switching activity of the KDR domain and to identify intermediate conformations between the two limiting active and inactive conformations. Specific energy barriers have been selectively removed to induce, and hence highlight at the atomistic level, the regulation mechanism of the A-loop opening. The proposed strategy allowed to repeatedly observe the escape of the KDR domain from the DFG-out free energy basin and to identify rare intermediate conformations between the DFG-out and the DFG-in structures to be employed in a structure-based drug discovery process.", "paper_title": "Insights into the Conformational Switching Mechanism of the Human Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor Type 2 Kinase Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000300650400023"}
