In this paper, we propose to use spherical harmonic (SPHARM) surface reconstruction and alignment methods to generate curvilinear meshes for finite element models of ventricular anatomy which incorporate detailed structural information. The endocardial and epicardial surfaces are defined by SPHARM, and the volume between these surfaces is divided into nested shells. Consequently, the resulting mesh comprises hexahedral elements. Using this novel SPHARM-based meshing method, the transmembrane potential propagation is simulated, based on FitzHugh-Nagumo reaction-diffusion equations. The dynamic electrical activation propagations are simulated on realistic cardiac data during a heart cycle. The obtained results clearly demonstrate an accurate resolution of the cardiac potential during the excitation. Our novel curvilinear mesh models have a great potential to be used in an improved simulation of cardiovascular pathologies for testing therapy strategies and planning interventions.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional models for cardiac bioelectricity simulation: Cell to organ", "paper_id": "WOS:000250554300003"}
