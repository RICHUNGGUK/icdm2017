At each iteration, a regularized proximal-like equilibrium problem on a suitable outer approximation of the original constraint set is considered. We prove, under standard assumptions, that the sequence generated by the algorithm converges weakly to a solution of the problem. Some numerical experience with the algorithm is reported.", "paper_title": "An outer approximation algorithm for equilibrium problems in Hilbert spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000347686300008"}
