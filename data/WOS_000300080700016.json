It is well established that quadratic synthesis for discrete T-S models and/or linear parameter-varying systems can be outperformed easily via nonquadratic syntheses. Several Lyapunov functions can be used. Nevertheless, this paper shows that with a \"small\" change in the initial Lyapunov function, a \"better\" (in the sense of solutions to the linear matrix inequality constraints problem) Lyapunov function can be reached. This one can introduce very important improvements.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Lyapunov Function for Discrete T-S Models: Observer Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000300080700016"}
