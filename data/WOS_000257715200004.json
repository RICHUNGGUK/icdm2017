This can be viewed as a two-phase process of (1) applying a similarity measure to find the correspondence of each pair of entities from two ontologies, and (2) extraction of an optimal or near optimal mapping. This paper is focused on the second phase and introduces our evolutionary approach for that. To be able to do so, we need a mechanism to score different possible mappings. Our solution is a weighting mechanism named coincidence-based weighting. A genetic algorithm is then introduced to create better mappings in successive iterations. We will explain how we code a mapping as well as our crossover and mutation functions. Evaluation of the algorithm is shown and discussed.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary coincidence-based ontology mapping extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000257715200004"}
