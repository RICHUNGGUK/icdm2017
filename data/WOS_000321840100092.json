Unlike the existing works on sketch-based search and composition of 3D models, which typically process individual sketched objects one by one, our technique performs co-retrieval and co-placement of 3D relevant models by jointly processing the sketched objects. This is enabled by summarizing functional and spatial relationships among models in a large collection of 3D scenes as structural groups. Our technique greatly reduces the amount of user intervention needed for sketch-based modeling of 3D scenes and fits well into the traditional production pipeline involving concept design followed by 3D modeling. A pilot study indicates that it is promising to use our technique as an alternative but more efficient tool of standard 3D modeling for 3D scene construction.", "paper_title": "Sketch2Scene: Sketch-based Co-retrieval and Co-placement of 3D Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000321840100092"}
