Thirty-two participants used the VR system. Postural stability was measured before and after each VR module [range of motion (ROM), velocity, and accuracy]. The duration of each module was recorded, and participants reported their SS using a visual analogue scale (SS-VAS)/100 mm. Following the VR assessment, participants completed the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ) (child and adult subsections) and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). The incidence of motion sickness during the VR immersion was 28 %, and the mean severity was 17.2 mm on VAS. There was a significant difference in ROM time, total time, MSSQ score, and SSQ score (p < 0.05) between those who reported any level of SS-VAS and those with no SS-VAS. The SS-VAS score displayed significant positive correlations with SSQ score, change in postural stability time pre to post, ROM time, and total time. Results indicate a relatively high incidence but low severity of SS which was associated with the MSSQ child subsection score and exposure time.", "paper_title": "Simulator sickness incidence and susceptibility during neck motion-controlled virtual reality tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000363862800010"}
