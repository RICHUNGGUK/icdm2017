Next we give an in-depth capacity analysis of the proposed frequency-time domain radio resource allocation which achieves much higher capacity (spectral efficiency) than the conventional frequency domain resource allocation. Then according to the allocation algorithm's computational complexity, two different-complexity adaptive resource allocation algorithms-algorithm A and algorithm B-are proposed which adopt a two-step allocation method to reduce the scheduling complexity and meanwhile improve the scheduling performance. Simulation results show that though the performance of algorithm A and B is slightly different, both of the proposed algorithms yield much higher spectral efficiency and much lower outage probability than conventional OFDM-TDMA scheme or random allocation without any scheduling policy.
