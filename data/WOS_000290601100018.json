A database service provider contracts with a data owner to sell storage space and make a profit. The data owner pays for the service and transmits data for storage in a database at a service provider's site through the Internet. In a high-risk network environment, a service provider may want to ensure that the received data are originally generated by the payer. A data owner may similarly worry about leaking his sensitive data to others, including the distrusted service provider. Thus, it is necessary to provide data confidentiality services to data owners and data integrity services to both service providers and data owners. In addition, using a symmetric cryptosystem to provide data confidentiality services usually requires many encryption keys; as such, determining how to manage those keys while minimizing the associated burden is a challenge. Accordingly, a key management scheme called the IC-Lock approach is proposed to simultaneously guarantee both integrity and confidentiality. Moreover, if necessary, the approach's modular design makes the approach flexible enough to adopt new components for performance and security consideration.", "paper_title": "IC-LOCK APPROACH: A KEY MANAGEMENT SOLUTION FOR OUTSOURCED DATABASE", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100018"}
