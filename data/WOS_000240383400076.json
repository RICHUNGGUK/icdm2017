Sufficient conditions for asymptotical stability, instability under arbitrary switching sequence and asymptotical stability under special switching sequence are reached. These conditions can be applied not only to study the problem of stability analysis for switched linear systems, but also to design the stable switching sequence for a switched linear system. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Stability criteria for switched linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400076"}
