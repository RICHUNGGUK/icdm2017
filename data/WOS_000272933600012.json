In this article we propose an architecture for UWSNs that aims to deliver the information from under water to the surface and then to the control center from there. We formulate the mechanism using a grid pattern of local sinks on the sea surface and randomly moving sensors, forming a wireless underwater ad hoc network of sensor nodes under the sea surface. This design focuses on the important concern of information reception. We focus on the reliability of data achievable through data redundancy. The mechanism has been made self-adjusting to achieve robustness. A solution for the important problem of power management has also been proposed. As part of this work we have also designed UWSim, a simulator for use in UWSN problems. The main aim of the system we designed is to make the oil discovery process under water easier.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT DATA ACQUISITION IN UNDERWATER WIRELESS SENSOR AD HOC NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272933600012"}
