Gray-scale suppression (GSS) is recommended for use in conjunction with the SIMP material description, although gray-scale suppression in itself is adequate to effect predominantly black-and-white designs. Minimal changes are required to incorporate the gray-scale suppression technique in Sigmund's popular 99-line Matlab code for topology optimization.", "paper_title": "A simple heuristic for gray-scale suppression in optimality criterion-based topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000267368400007"}
