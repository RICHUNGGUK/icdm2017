The purpose of the mechanisms is to utilize TFRC feedback and thus achieve a beneficial balance between power consumption and the received video quality. There are two power adaptation mechanisms proposed, each one with its own advantages. They both offer significant improvements when used in terms of both power consumption and received video quality. We use simulation in order to compare and evaluate our approach.
