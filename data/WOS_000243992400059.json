A range of tests is offered: omnibus and haplotype-specific tests; prospective and retrospective likelihoods; covariates and moderators; sliding window analyses; permutation P-values. We focus on the ability to flexibly impose constraints on haplotype effects, which allows for a range of conditional haplotype-based likelihood ratio tests: for example, whether an allele has an effect independent of its haplotypic background, or whether a single variant can explain the overall association at a locus. We illustrate using these tests to dissect a multi-locus association.", "paper_title": "WHAP: haplotype-based association analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000243992400059"}
