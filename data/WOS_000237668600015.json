However, dynamic interworking of wired infrastructure, wireless access systems and small scale Personal Area Networks has been challenging due to their heterogeneous nature. One of the most important problems to be solved is name resolution between different terminals and networks. This paper presents a new mechanism for name resolution, which relies on existing naming mechanisms. In particular the focus is on the scalability of the solution from signaling load and latency point of view.", "paper_title": "Scalability of name resolution for ambient networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237668600015"}
