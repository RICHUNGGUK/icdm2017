It might be of interest to transmit secret messages over 3G voice channels. In this paper, we introduce a new covert communication scheme via Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) encoded speech. An adaptive suboptimal pulse combination constrained (ASOPCC) method is presented to embed data on compressed speech signal of AMR-WB codec. The method takes advantage of the \"redundancy\", created by non-exhaustive search of algebraic code-book, to encode secret information. An embedding factor eta is used to control embedding bits. By properly setting eta, ASOPCC can offer a better trade-off between speech quality and embedding capacity in the process of coding mode switching. Experimental results show that the proposed method is quite promising for both high capacity and good imperceptivity. Although ASOPCC is only applied to AMR-WB codec in this article, it can be further used by any other speech coding based on Algebraic Coded Exited Linear Prediction (ACELP). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
