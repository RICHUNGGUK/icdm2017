In this paper, we elaborate on the implication of these parameters and devise a method to estimate their value for general one-point algebraic geometric codes. As it is demonstrated, for Hermitian codes, our bound is often tight. Furthermore, for these codes, the relative generalized Hamming weights are often much larger than the corresponding generalized Hamming weights.", "paper_title": "Relative Generalized Hamming Weights of One-Point Algebraic Geometric Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900009"}
