The QoS support is facilitated by the link layer. The framework is based on the Media Independent Handover protocol and utilizes link layer metrics to observe the network condition and further exploit them to aid the handover decision. Besides being environmentally aware, the framework also incorporates policies to support user's preferences. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can efficiently support the QoS needs of the different applications running on the terminal by switching across the different interfaces based on the prevailing access network capacity as well as user's preferences.
