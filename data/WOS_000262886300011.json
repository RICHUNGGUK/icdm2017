New method supports more than two cooperative users with low cooperation levels. We evaluate the performance Of Our proposed method in the frequency nonselective slow fading channels. Our numerical results show that each of the N cooperative users obtains the full diversity order of N in moderate-to-high signal to noise ratio regimes. Also simulation results show that the new coded cooperation method can achieve a noticeable gain over non-cooperative networks. Because of the complexity of the general case, we only derive the exact frame error rate for two cooperative users. The analytical results are evaluated by the simulations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
