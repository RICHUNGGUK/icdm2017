The propulsion performance and flow structure are explored by solving the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations. Computations are conducted for a range of oscillation frequency, pitching amplitude, and asymmetry. The results show that the higher asymmetry can induce the stronger reverse Von Karman vortex in the wake, which in turn leads to the increased thrust. However, the propulsion efficiency reduces as increasing asymmetry. Computed results are further adopted to shed insight into the mechanism of thrust enhancement.", "paper_title": "NUMERICAL STUDY OF ASYMMETRIC EFFECT ON A PITCHING FOIL", "paper_id": "WOS:000271219200012"}
