Some of them settled architectural models that today are broadly known as grid computing and service oriented architecture. Both of them are base on service and workflow paradigms as a single shareable unit of work. Unfortunately, an increasing number of workflows being brought out has raised a problem of their distribution and management, e.g., search repositories and find workflows similar to the given one in order to increase the efficiency of calculations. In this paper a similar workflow search algorithm based on semantic type comparison has been proposed. In order to evaluate the algorithm usability and precision, an experiment has been conducted that regarded workflow extraction from Feta repository. The entire process involved reasoning based on my Grid ontologies. The received results were compared to results obtained from other algorithm, based on an analysis of the names of the workflow components using the TD-IDF weight. The described experiment shows that semantics and ontology play significant role in service and workflow representation.", "paper_title": "WORKFLOW SIMILARITY ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000295807600008"}
