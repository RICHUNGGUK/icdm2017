An important application is the construction of reference curves/surfaces and conditional prediction intervals for Y. Recently, a nonparametric quantile regression method based on the concept of optimal quantization was proposed. This method competes very well with k-nearest neighbor, kernel, and spline methods. In this paper, we describe an R package, called QuantifQuantile, that allows to perform quantization-based quantile regression. We describe the various functions of the package and provide examples.", "paper_title": "QuantifQuantile: An R Package for Performing Quantile Regression Through Optimal Quantization", "paper_id": "WOS:000368551800006"}
