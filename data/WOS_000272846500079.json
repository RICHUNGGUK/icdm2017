In this method, the exponential membership function has been adopted to solve the zero-weight problem, and the information entropy has been used to modify the coefficients of weight in order to exploit the useful information of data to a maximum extent. In addition, the weighted average principle has been taken to replace the maximum membership principle for reserving the information in the assessment coefficients as much as possible. The water quality of Three Gorges region is taken as an example and the results show that the improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is superior to the traditional model and worth to be recommended.
