These methods do not require many computational resources, but they ignore feature interactions. A simple recursive approach, which, without requiring many more computational resources, also allows identification of interactions, is investigated. This approach can lead to substantial improvements in the performance of classifiers, and can provide insight into the way in which features work together in a given population. It also enjoys attractive statistical properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
