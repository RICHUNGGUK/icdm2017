The observer structure consists of a DNN to estimate the system dynamics on-line, a dynamic filter to estimate the unmeasurable state and a sliding mode feedback term to account for modeling errors and exogenous disturbances. The observed states are proven to asymptotically converge to the system states of high-order uncertain nonlinear systems through Lyapunov-based analysis. Simulations and experiments on a two-link robot manipulator are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to several other state estimation methods.
