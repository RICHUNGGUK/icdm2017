We obtain a compact and exact expression for the probability distribution of the entanglement values across any bipartite cut. This allows for exact derivations of the average entanglement and the degree of concentration of measure around this average. We also give simple bounds on these quantities. We find that for large systems the average entanglement is near maximal and the measure is concentrated around it.", "paper_title": "Entanglement probability distribution of bi-partite randomised stabilizer states", "paper_id": "WOS:000239396100005"}
