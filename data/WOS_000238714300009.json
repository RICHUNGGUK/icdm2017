Given the escalating design complexity, new methods such as embedded deterministic test have been proposed in recent years to deal with the cost of manufacturing test. This paper discusses diagnosis of logic blocks by leveraging the existing embedded deterministic test hardware. The proposed method is based on new techniques for on-chip decompression and comparison of incompletely specified test patterns and test responses. Using experimental data, the tradeoffs between the number of tester channels, on-chip area, and scan time are discussed.", "paper_title": "Diagnosis of logic circuits using compressed deterministic data and on-chip response comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000238714300009"}
