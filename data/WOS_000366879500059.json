A modeling and verification methodology for complex digital logic components is presented to improve the development quality and efficiency. In order to help developer to understand the design intent preferably and speed up the development process, design activities are carried out under a convenient modeling methodology and a precise verification solution for completing the design cycle. Its calculus system offers a theoretic way to connect components via connectors, and then provides a theoretical basis for further verification. A washing machine controller design shows that the modeling can reflect the design intent of the designers effectively, detect some design errors which maybe result in modeling failures in implementation as soon as possible, and avoid the negligence and errors in modeling for complex digital systems.
