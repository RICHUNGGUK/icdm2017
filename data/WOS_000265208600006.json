To express such a situation, a fuzzy multi-objective bilevel (FMOBL) programming model and related solution methods are introduced. This research develops a FMOBL decision support system through implementing the proposed FMOBL methods.", "paper_title": "A FUZZY MULTI-OBJECTIVE BILEVEL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000265208600006"}
