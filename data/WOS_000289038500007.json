However, the synergy of multiple co-existing overlays still has not been fully exploited yet. Most of related research studies only focused on one of two issues that include the reduction of maintenance costs and the enhancement of system performance. On the other hand, failure detection is a necessary maintenance protocol for an overlay to ensure overlay resilience; however, independent failure detection in co-existing overlays introduces large probe messages as the number of those overlays increases. Therefore, this paper proposes a cooperative failure detection approach both to eliminate the redundant failure detection operations and to improve the failure detection mechanism in multi-overlay environments. Experimental results show that the proposed cooperative approach reduces more than 80% probe messages and shortens the detection time up to 60%.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Failure Detection in Multi-Overlay Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000289038500007"}
