The purpose of this model is to allow reliable predictions to be made for the performance of the software on large numbers of processors of a given parallel system, by only benchmarking the code on small numbers of processors. Having described the methods used, and emphasized the simplicity of their implementation, the approach is tested on a range of engineering software applications that are built upon the use of multigrid algorithms. Despite their simplicity, the models are demonstrated to provide both accurate and robust predictions across a range of different parallel architectures, partitioning strategies and multigrid codes. In particular, the effectiveness of the predictive methodology is shown for a practical engineering software implementation of an elastohydrodynamic lubrication solver.
