Most of the discussion focuses on conformal triangular-type meshes, but we show how to extend this to the most general meshes. We review, some first-order monotone schemes and also high-order ones specially dedicated to steady problems.", "paper_title": "On the numerical approximation of first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000255025000011"}
