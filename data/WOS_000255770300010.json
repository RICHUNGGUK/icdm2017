In this context it has been shown that the identification of main crops and annual crop rotation in the Rur catchment by SPOT, LANDSAT and ASTER imagery provides the key for a spatial and thematic enhancement of the model results. The spatial resolution of the nitrogen surplus data set which denotes the linkage between RAUMIS and GROWA is enhanced from district level to field/pixel level. In parallel, the empirical water balance model GROWA is enhanced to differentiate between agricultural crops in the real evapotranspiration calculation. It is calibrated by runoff data measured at gauging stations. Results indicate, e.g., an average nitrate concentration in the leachate of 42 mg NO3/L in the relatively wet year of 2002 and almost 62 mg NO3/L in the dry year of 2003. There is a 20 mg NO3/L weather-induced difference which can be modelled in a more detailed way using self-processed remotely sensed data. The model results were compared to nitrate concentrations observed in the top parts of multi-level wells. In this way the related coefficient of determination has been improved from a value (R) of -0.50 using CORINE to 0.59 by using self-processed remotely sensed data, thus demonstrating the potential of the enhanced model system.
