In this article, we propose a two-stage HPR system for Sign Language Recognition using a Kinect sensor. In the first stage, we propose an effective algorithm to implement hand detection and tracking. The algorithm incorporates both color and depth information, without specific requirements on uniform-colored or stable background. It can handle the situations in which hands are very close to other parts of the body or hands are not the nearest objects to the camera and allows for occlusion of hands caused by faces or other hands. In the second stage, we apply deep neural networks (DNNs) to automatically learn features from hand posture images that are insensitive to movement, scaling, and rotation. Experiments verify that the proposed system works quickly and accurately and achieves a recognition accuracy as high as 98.12%.", "paper_title": "A Real-Time Hand Posture Recognition System Using Deep Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000354049800011"}
