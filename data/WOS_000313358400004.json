In this case, we want to combine the trees into a reticulate network with the fewest hybridization events. In this article, we develop a software tool (named UltraNet) for several fundamental problems related to the construction of minimum reticulate networks from two or more phylogenetic trees. Our experimental results show that UltraNet is much faster than all previous tools for these problems.", "paper_title": "An Ultrafast Tool for Minimum Reticulate Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000313358400004"}
