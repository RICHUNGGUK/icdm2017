Phys. 2 (1929) 1031]. It contains two hypergeometric functions F(a.b:c;x), which are difficult to calculate directly, when the (negative) integers a. b are large, as in the case of high Rydberg states of hydrogenic ions. We have derived a simple method [D. Hoang-Binh, Astron. Astrophys. 238 (1990) 449], using a recurrence relation to calculate exactly F. starting from two initial values, which are very easy to compute. We present here a numerical code using this method. The code computes exact hydrogenic radial integrals, oscillator strengths, Einstein coefficients, and lifetimes, for principal quantum numbers up to 1000.

Phys. Comm. 166 (2005) 191 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Exact calculation of atomic data. Solution method: Use of a recurrence relation to compute hypergeometric functions. Reasons for new version: This new version computes additional important related data, namely, the total Einstein coefficients. and radiative lifetimes. Summary of revisions: Values of the total Einstein transition probability from an upper level n to a lower level n' are computed, as well as the radiative lifetime of a level n.
