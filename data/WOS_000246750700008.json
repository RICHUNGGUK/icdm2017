Previous analysis work has done an inadequate job on the environment component of this task. We develop a new analytic framework, ACFA, which is based on a new abstraction: frame strings, an enriched variant of procedure strings that can be used to model both control flow and environment allocation. This abstraction enables new environment-sensitive analyses and transformations that have not been previously attainable. We state the critical theorems needed to establish correctness of the entire technology suite, with their proofs. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
