Three pharmacophore models of opioid agonists were generated by the Catalyst/HypoGen program. The best pharmacophore models for mu, delta and kappa agonists contained four, five and five features, respectively. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional structures of three receptor subtypes were modeled on the basis of the crystal structure of beta 2-adrenergic receptor, and molecular docking was conducted further. According to these pharmacophore models and docking results, the similarities and differences among agonists of three subtypes were identified. mu or delta agonists, for example, could form one hydrogen bond separately with Tyr129 and Tyr150 at TMIII, whereas. ones formed a pi-pi interaction in that place. These findings may be crucial for the development of novel selective analgesic drugs.", "paper_title": "Insights into subtype selectivity of opioid agonists by ligand-based and structure-based methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000289531200006"}
