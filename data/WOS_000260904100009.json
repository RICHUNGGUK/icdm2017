This is an extension of the algorithm of Matsuo, Chao and Tsujii (MCT) [K. Matsuo, J. Chao, S. Tsujii, An improved baby step algorithm for point counting of hyperelliptic curves over finite fields, in: LNCS vol. 2369, Springer-Verlag, 2005, pp. 461-474] for hyperelliptic curves. We study the characteristic polynomials and the Jacobian varieties of algebraic curves of genus three over finite fields. Based on this, we investigate the explicit computable bounds for coefficients of the characteristic polynomial and improve a part of the baby-step giant-step of the counting points algorithm. Usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated and verified by the simple examples. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
