In particular we demonstrate that each F induces a unique structure (scaffold) on f which determines how all \"succint\" coverings of f (by elements of F) are positioned on f. Our motivation for this study comes from the formalization of the template-guided recombination which is a molecular operation that provides a solution for a molecular implementation of gene assembly in ciliates.", "paper_title": "Covers from templates", "paper_id": "WOS:000237139600014"}
