The jumping parameters, determined by a continuous-time, discrete-state Markov chain, are assumed to be norm bounded. The delays are assumed to be time-varying and belong to a given interval, which means that the lower and upper bounds of interval time-varying delays are available. By constructing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and using poincarS inequality and the mathematical induction method, several novel sufficient criteria ensuring the delay-dependent exponential stability of IRDCGNNs with Markovian jumping parameters are established. Our results include reaction-diffusion effects. Finally, a Numerical example is provided to show the efficiency of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Delay-Dependent Robust Exponential Stability of Impulsive Markovian Jumping Reaction-Diffusion Cohen-Grossberg Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327089800001"}
