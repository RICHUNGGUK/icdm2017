Different stability detection methods based on the classical two-port K-(s) pair, linear three-port graphical analysis, system identifications, circuit modal analysis, and normalized determinant function are all reviewed. The corresponding techniques are employed to predict the occurrence of instability at 15 GHz observed during measurements on a fabricated monolithic microwave integrated circuit power amplifier. Experimental results from a redesigned power amplifier with improved stability are presented to confirm that the previously detected oscillation loop is removed using odd-mode stabilization resistors with the correct choice of values and locations.
