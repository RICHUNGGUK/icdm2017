The transition of a k-head automaton depends solely on the symbols currently scanned by its k heads, and every such transition moves each head one cell left or right, or instructs it to stay. We show that stateless (k+4)-head two-way automata are more powerful than stateless k-head two-way automata. In the one-way case, we prove a tighter result: stateless (k + 1)-head one-way automata are more powerful than stateless k-head one-way automata. Finally, we show that the emptiness problem for stateless 2-head two-way automata is undecidable. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
