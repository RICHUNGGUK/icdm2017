In the paper MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 61 (2009) 451-461 the concept of almost-eguienergetic graphs was put forward, based on the observation that in some cases the (non-zero) difference between the energies of two graphs is very small. We now estimate the minimal value of this difference.", "paper_title": "On Almost-Equienergetic Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000328007000021"}
