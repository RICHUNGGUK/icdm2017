The paper treats the most general case of multiple delays in both state and observation equations, which are allowed to be different from each other. The resulting system of equations for determining the filter gain matrix consists, in the general case, of an infinite set of equations. It is however demonstrated that a finite set of the filtering equations can be obtained in the particular case of equal or commensurable delays in the observation and state equations. In the example, performance of the designed optimal filter for linear systems with state and observation delays is verified against the best Kalman-Bucy filter available for linear systems without delays.", "paper_title": "Optimal linear filtering for systems with multiple state and observation delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243700021"}
