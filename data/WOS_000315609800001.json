Results from a survey of 425 consumers suggested that the hypothesized model was an accurate reflection of factors that affect privacy preferences of consumers. The results provide important implications for research and practice. Our study should contribute by initiating an integrative stream of research on the impact of IT and other factors on information privacy perception. For practitioners, our findings suggested that consumers hold corporations, not the IS, responsible for any inappropriate use of personal information. Organizations, therefore, must be proactive in formulating and enforcing information privacy policy in order to address consumers' concerns. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
