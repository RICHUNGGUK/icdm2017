A peer-to- peer (P2P) network structure is widely employed for video streaming applications due to its flexible extensibility and ability to share data stream loading among different peer nodes. This paper considers the problems of network packet loss and native peer random leave in a P2P network environment. An XOR-based frame loss protection scheme is proposed, based on the recently proposed interleaved video frame distribution P2P architecture to mitigate the effects of peer leave and network packet loss. The proposed scheme is not only capable of recovering lost packets, but can also resist the peer-leaving churn. Analysis and simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme has better performance in a frame loss rate with less redundant overhead.", "paper_title": "Reliable Consideration of P2P-based VoD System with Interleaved Video Frame Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000331983100034"}
