The complex, three-dimensional, vortex structures formed via surface/vortex interaction and induction between vortices have been computed using the proposed technique implemented within a level-set method for both vertical and oblique droplet impacts in incompressible fluids. The present results have been validated through numerical tests which confirm zero tangential shear at the free-surface and comparisons with experimental observations of cavity and vortex ring formation underneath the impact location. In some cases, transitions from a concentric vortex ring to a fully three-dimensional vortex structure has been confirmed. Whilst the primary vortex ring is initiated at the highly curved contact surface between the droplet and receiving surface, azimuthal instabilities are manifested in the shear layer around the cavity crater developing after the vertical impact, resulting in axial counter-rotating vorticity between the cavity and descending vortex ring. Underlying mechanisms which induce local deformation of the free-surface, creating a so-called scar, due to the sub-surface vortices at the oblique impacts are also discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
