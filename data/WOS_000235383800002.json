It allows mobile devices to access internet services, corporate databases and to control various network devices. iMobile implements three key abstractions: dev-let, info-let and app-let. An info-let provides abstract view of information space. An app-let implements service or application logic by processing information from various info-lets. A dev-let receives and sends messages through any particular protocols for mobile devices. The let engine supports user and device profiles for personalization and transcoding, and invokes proper app-lets and info-lets to answer requests from a dev-let. The Mobile modular architecture allows developers to write device drivers, information access methods and application logic independently from each other.
