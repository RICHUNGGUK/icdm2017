The service region is to be divided into districts, each served by a single vehicle that departs from a central depot. The district, design aims to optimize two criteria: compact district shape and balance of workload content among districts. We present a mathematical formulation of the problem as well as a multi-start heuristic procedure to solve the problem. The procedure combines some elements of metaheuristics such as Tabu Search and GRASP. Experimental results in comparison with CPLEX solutions are presented.", "paper_title": "A HEURISTIC APPROACH FOR A LOGISTICS DISTRICTING PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400017"}
