The ART is used to parallelize the GSOM: it divides the input space of city positions into subspaces automatically. One GSOM is allocated to each subspace and grows following the input data. After all the GSOMs grow sufficiently they are connected and we obtain a tour. Basic experimental results suggest that we can find semi-optimal solution much faster than serial methods.", "paper_title": "An approach to collaboration of growing self-organizing maps and adaptive resonance theory maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093700042"}
