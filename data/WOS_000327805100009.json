The approach leverages risk maps and can be applied to general infrastructure networks. A semi-quantitative assessment strategy that incorporates the creation of risk charts within a risk management framework is also presented. This strategy engages an intuitive graphical representation to identify the most significant threats affecting infrastructure networks. As a result, it is possible to conduct risk analyses of energy supply (and other) infrastructures within a region or country by engaging interconnected risk maps. The application of the methodology is demonstrated using a case study of a Colombian electricity infrastructure, which includes an estimation of the risk components. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
