A quality prediction method based on sub-stage PCA-SI (subspace identification) is proposed for dedicating to capture batch-to-batch dynamic correlations among the variables in the historical data, and to capture dynamic correlation between process variables at different stages of injection molding process and final qualities, and to build a stage-based on-line quality prediction model of injection molding process. Application has demonstrated that the proposed method can not only give a valid quality prediction, but also it can effectively carry on quality closed-loop control.", "paper_title": "A quality prediction method of injection molding processes using sub-stage PCA-SI", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400100"}
