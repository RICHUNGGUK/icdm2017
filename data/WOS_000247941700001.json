We show that K is the interior of the intersection of the second-order cones (K) over cap (r)(x), as x ranges over all directions in K. Using these second-order cones as approximations to cones of symmetric, positive definite matrices, we develop a new polynomial-time primal-dual interior-point algorithm for semidefinite programming. The algorithm is extended to symmetric cone programming via the relation between symmetric cones and Euclidean Jordan algebras.", "paper_title": "The primal-dual second-order cone approximations algorithm for symmetric cone programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000247941700001"}
