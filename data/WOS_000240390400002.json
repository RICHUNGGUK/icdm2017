In the periodic orbit method, the nonlinear normal mode is obtained by making the continuation of branches of periodic orbits of the equation of motion. The terms \"periodic orbits\" means a closed trajectory in the phase space, which is obtained by time integration. In the modal representation method, the nonlinear normal mode is constructed in terms of amplitude, phase, mode shape, and frequency, with the distinctive feature that the last two quantities are amplitude and total phase dependent. The methods are compared on two DOF strongly nonlinear systems. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
