These systems are of the so-called saddle point type, which means that there is a large block of zeros on the main diagonal. To solve these types of systems efficiently, several block preconditioners have been published. These types of preconditioners require adaptation of standard finite element packages. The alternative is to apply a standard ILU preconditioner in combination with a suitable renumbering of unknowns. We introduce a reordering technique for the degrees of freedom that makes the application of ILU relatively fast. We compare the performance of this technique with some block preconditioners. The performance appears to depend on grid size, Reynolds number and quality of the mesh. For medium-sized problems, which are of practical interest, we show that the reordering technique is competitive with the block preconditioners. Its simple implementation makes it worthwhile to implement it in the standard finite element method software.
