The problem consists of finding a necessary and sufficient condition for a stratified L-filter to be induced by a T-filter in the sense of Lemma 4.4.3 in this book. The condition given is proved to be equivalent to the condition considered in Proposition 4.4.4 in this book in the case of complete MV-algebras with square roots. We also extend the relation between stratified L-filters and T-filters. established earlier by Hohle and Sostak, to stratified and tight L-filters. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
