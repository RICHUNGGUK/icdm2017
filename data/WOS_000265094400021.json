ClueGO integrates Gene Ontology (GO) terms as well as KEGG/BioCarta pathways and creates a functionally organized GO/pathway term network. It can analyze one or compare two lists of genes and comprehensively visualizes functionally grouped terms. A one-click update option allows ClueGO to automatically download the most recent GO/KEGG release at any time. ClueGO provides an intuitive representation of the analysis results and can be optionally used in conjunction with the GOlorize plug-in.", "paper_title": "ClueGO: a Cytoscape plug-in to decipher functionally grouped gene ontology and pathway annotation networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000265094400021"}
