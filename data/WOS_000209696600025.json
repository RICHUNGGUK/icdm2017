The Markov renewal process model simplifies the derivation of the closed form solution for the probability that each station attempts to transmit in a slot. The throughput expression shows a relatively explicit relation between the throughput and the offered load. The accuracy of the method is verified by ns-2 simulation.", "paper_title": "A New Method for Analyzing Nonsaturated IEEE 802.11 DCF Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696600025"}
