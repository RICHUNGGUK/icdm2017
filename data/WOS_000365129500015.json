However, it is rare to see man-made biomolecular intelligence system. Learning ability is one of the basic abilities of intelligence. Many organisms have learning ability naturally. In this paper, we have successfully designed, constructed, and tested a genetic conditional learning system in the bacterium Escherichia coli. The system can recognize 'bad guy' signal with the help of 'study' signal. The function was realized by combining biomolecular AND gate and memory inverter. The AND gate used riboswitch as computation tool, and the memory inverter used Cre recombinase. Flow cytometry was used to verify the function of the system. This study is an attempt of constructing man-made biomolecular intelligence system. The system may lead to new applications for biomolecular computing, artificial intelligence, and biotherapy.", "paper_title": "Construction of a genetic conditional learning system in Escherichia coli", "paper_id": "WOS:000365129500015"}
