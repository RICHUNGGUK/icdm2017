Nodes correspond to points on the unit disk and each uses a directional antenna covering a sector of a given angle alpha. The width required for a connectivity problem is to find out the necessary and sufficient conditions of alpha that guarantee connectivity when an antenna's location is uniformly distributed and the orientation of the antenna's sector is either random or fixed. We show that when the number of network nodes is big enough, the required alpha approaches zero. Specifically, on the unit disk, assuming uniform orientation, it holds with high probability that the threshold for connectivity is alpha = Theta(root logn/n). This is shown by the use of Poisson approximation and geometrical considerations. Moreover, when the model is relaxed, assuming that the antenna's orientation is directed towards the center of the disk, we demonstrate that alpha = Theta(root logn/n) is a necessary and sufficient condition.
