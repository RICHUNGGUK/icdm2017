In order to manage the sensor network and collect data from the network efficiently, we need to know the state of the WSN. In this paper, we propose a model-aided approach to support the monitoring of the state of WSNs. In this approach, models are created on base station to support the monitoring of the network, and mobile agents are injected into the network to collect state information. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Monitoring wireless sensor networks using a model-aided approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800110"}
