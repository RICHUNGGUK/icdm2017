The study selected one class of business students to participate in the experiment. The entire procedure comprised pretest, 3DVC training and posttest. The results were analyzed through a paired sample t-test to understand if there is any significant difference between pretest and 3DVC, and pretest and posttest. The results showed that the participants made a significant improvement in ill-structured problem-solving ability after the 3DVC training. The results provide important references for educators that a 3D situational learning environment is beneficial in improving students' ill-structured problem-solving ability.", "paper_title": "A Virtual Experiential Learning and Students' Ill-Structured Problem-Solving Ability", "paper_id": "WOS:000337059800004"}
