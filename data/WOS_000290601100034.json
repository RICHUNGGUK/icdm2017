By generalized feedforward neural networks, we mean that links are not restricted to just going from one layer to the next layer. The STSA utilizes the orthogonal array (OA) to uniformly generate the initial population in order to globally explore the solution space, and then applies a novel trajectory search method to exploit the promising area thoroughly. Besides, for classification problems, the authors propose a strong winner concept and a mixed fitness evaluation method to avoid overtraining and to improve the generalization ability of the trained ANNs. The performance of the STSA is evaluated by applying it to solve the n-bit parity problem and the classification problems on three medical datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. By comparing with the previous studies, the experimental results reveal that the neural networks trained by the STSA have very good classification ability for unseen cases.", "paper_title": "THE SYSTEMATIC TRAJECTORY SEARCH ALGORITHM FOR THE GENERALIZED FEEDFORWARD NEURAL NETWORK TRAINING", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100034"}
