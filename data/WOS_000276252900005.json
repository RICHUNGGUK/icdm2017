Phenomena that involve substrate parasitic voltage and substrate propagation are discussed. A simple methodology to predict the substrate cross-talk and some associated tools are presented. A typical study shows the possibility of such a method and measurements finally demonstrate its efficiency.", "paper_title": "Mixed-signal IC design guide to enhance substrate noise immunity in bulk silicon technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000276252900005"}
