In this study, nonlinear finite element models have been used to simulate the behavior of these structures. Diffused cracking and crushing in concrete and masonry are described by a smeared-crack continuum model, while dominant cracks as well as masonry mortar joints are modeled with a cohesive crack interface model. The interface model adopts an elasto-plastic formulation to describe the mixed-mode fracture of concrete and masonry. The model accounts for cyclic crack opening and closing, reversible shear dilatation, and joint compaction due to damage. The constitutive models have been validated with experimental data and successfully applied to the dynamic analysis of a three-story, two-bay, masonry-infilled, non-ductile, reinforced concrete frame tested on a shake table. The results have demonstrated the capabilities of the finite element method in capturing the nonlinear cyclic load-displacement response and failure mechanisms of the structure, and indicated the important contribution of infill walls to the seismic resistance of a non-ductile reinforced concrete frame.
