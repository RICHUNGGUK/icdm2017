In this paper, we consider authorship attribution as found in the wild: the set of known candidates is extremely large (possibly many thousands) and might not even include the actual author. Moreover, the known texts and the anonymous texts might be of limited length. We show that even in these difficult cases, we can use similarity-based methods along with multiple randomized feature sets to achieve high precision. Moreover, we show the precise relationship between attribution precision and four parameters: the size of the candidate set, the quantity of known-text by the candidates, the length of the anonymous text and a certain robustness score associated with a attribution.", "paper_title": "Authorship attribution in the wild", "paper_id": "WOS:000287922900006"}
