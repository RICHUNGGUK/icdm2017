The proposed amplifier uses all idle devices in the conventional folded-cascode amplifier in the signal path and the positive feedback cross-coupled transistors to enhance both the small-signal and large-signal parameters. It significantly improves the DC gain, unity-gain bandwidth, and slew rate compared to the conventional folded-cascode amplifier with the same power consumption and input parasitic capacitance. Extensive circuit level analysis and simulation results using a 90 nm CMOS technology are provided to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed amplifier.", "paper_title": "A single-stage operational amplifier with enhanced transconductance and slew rate for switched-capacitor circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000335157500014"}
