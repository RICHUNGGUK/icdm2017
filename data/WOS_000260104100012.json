In light-emitting diode (LED) manufacturing, each die on the LED wafer must be inspected to determine whether it has defects or not, so detecting defective regions is a significant issue. In this paper, a new approach for inspecting LED wafer defects using Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) neural networks is presented. Each die image and its region of interest (ROI) can be acquired from the wafer image. Then, by analyzing the properties of every ROI, we can extract specific geometric features and texture features. Using these features, the LVQ neural networks is used to classify the dies as either acceptable or defective. The inspection approach is conducted on images of the four-element (aluminum gallium indium phosphide, AlGaInP) LED wafers. The experimental results confirm the usefulness of the approach for LED wafer defect inspection.", "paper_title": "LEARNING VECTOR QUANTIZATION NEURAL NETWORKS FOR LED WAFER DEFECT INSPECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000260104100012"}
