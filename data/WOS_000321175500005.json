Femoral configuration renders it feasible to redesign the original femur based on the information obtained from the contralateral femur. In this report, we describe a method to rebuild the original femur based on the contralateral side as the reference after ascertaining the bilateral symmetry of the body. The method was tested on animals using the spine model and the experimental results are discussed briefly. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
