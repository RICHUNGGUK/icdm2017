PECOLE can intelligently run on very constrained resources, is highly resilient, scalable and does not rely on dedicated servers. Instead, PECOLE is built upon a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay network, using SUN's JXTA framework and SWT technology. In this paper, we present the architecture and implementation of PECOLE with the performance results of the tests we conducted.", "paper_title": "PECOLE: P2P multimedia collaborative environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000257771600003"}
