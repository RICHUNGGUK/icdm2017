MANETs are especially popular in locations that lack a fixed communication infrastructure. To achieve zero-configuration MANETs, as well as quick and easy access to network resources, resources must be well managed by the network. This paper proposes a hierarchical service discovery and advertisement protocol (HSDAP) implemented in the routing layer. HSDAP queries services by piggybacking service REQuest (SREQ) packets on routing packets to reduce overhead and energy consumption. We extend the cluster-based routing protocol (CBRP) to improve service management hierarchy. Simulation results show that adding service discovery and advertisement (SDA) functions to CBRP does not significantly affect overhead. SDA overhead, routing overhead, energy consumption, and SDA delay are significantly less than the extended zone routing protocol. Furthermore, SDA hit ratio of the proposed protocol is greater than 86% for various levels of mobility. The proposed HSDAP is robust and scalable. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
