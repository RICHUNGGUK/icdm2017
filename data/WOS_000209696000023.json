The burst arrival nature and strong correlation of video traffic are taken into account by using a discrete-time batch Markovian arrival process. The impact of packet transmissions between the two hops is investigated by properly modelling the packet departure process of the first hop. To address a strict delay constraint for video services, we consider a buffer size limit in the first hop and a proactive packet discard policy in the second hop. Numerical results based on video traces demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical approach.", "paper_title": "Packet-Level Performance Analysis for Video Traffic over Two-Hop Mobile Hotspots", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696000023"}
