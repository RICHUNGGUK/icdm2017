The problem is known to be NP-hard for d >= 2. We propose an O(n(2)) time algorithm for the one dimensional version (d = 1) of the problem. This is an improvement over the existing result on this problem by a factor of h [A.E.F. Clementi et al. The minimum broadcast range assignment problem on linear multi-hop wireless networks, Theoret.
