As non-visual information sources that are closely linked to human activities in diverse environments, such signals are capable of communicating about the spaces we traverse and activities we encounter in familial and intuitive ways However, in order for them to be effectively employed in human-computer interfaces, significant knowledge is required in areas including the perception of acoustic signatures of walking, and the design, engineering, and evaluation of interfaces that utilize them. Much of this expertise has accumulated in recent years, although many questions remain to be explored We highlight past work and current research directions in this Multidisciplinary area of investigation, and point to potential future trends.
