We consider the framework of action-based systems, whose behaviors can be represented by labeled transition systems (LTSS), and whose temporal properties of interest can be formulated in modal mu-calculus (L-mu). First, we determine, for any L-mu the maximal set of actions that can be hidden in the LTS without changing the interpretation of the formula. Then, we define L-mu(dsbr), a fragment of L-mu which is adequate w.r.t divergence-sensitive branching bisimilarity. This enables us to apply the maximal hiding and to reduce the LTS on-the-fly using divergencesensitive tau-confluence during the verification of any L-mu(dsbr) formula. The experiments that we performed on various examples of communication protocols and distributed systems show that this reduction approach can significantly improve the performance of on-the-fly verification.
