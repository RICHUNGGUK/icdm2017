It describes operational aspects of the evolved behaviour of a group of robots equipped with a different set of sensors, that navigates towards a target in a walled arena. In particular, analysis of the sound signalling behaviour shows that the robots employ the sound to remain close to each other at a safe distance with respect to the risk of collisions. Spatial discrimination of the sound sources is achieved by exploiting a rotational movement which amplifies intensity differences between the two sound sensors.", "paper_title": "Operational aspects of the evolved signalling behaviour in a group of cooperating and communicating robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000242307400010"}
