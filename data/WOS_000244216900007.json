The oriented chromatic number of an oriented graph H is defined as the minimum order of an oriented graph H' such that H has a homomorphism to H'. In this paper, we prove that 2-outerplanar graphs are 4-degenerate. We also show that oriented 2-outerplanar graphs have a homornorphism to the Paley tournament QR(67), which implies that their (strong) oriented chromatic number is at most 67. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
