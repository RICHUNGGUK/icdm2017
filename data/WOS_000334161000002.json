Simultaneously, we have seen a phenomenal increase in the usage and deployment of smartphone platforms and applications worldwide. This paper discusses the current state of the art in the merger of these two popular technologies, that we refer to as Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). We illustrate the applicability of MCC in various domains including mobile learning, commerce, health/wellness and social medias. We further identify research gaps covering critical aspects of how MCC can be realized and effectively utilized at scale. These include improved resource allocation in the MCC environment through efficient task distribution and offloading, security and privacy.", "paper_title": "Mobile Cloud Computing: A Survey, State of Art and Future Directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000334161000002"}
