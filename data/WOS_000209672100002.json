M2M is a key enabling technology for the cyber-physical systems (CPSs). This paper explores CPS beyond M2M concept and looks at futuristic applications. Our vision is CPS with distributed actuation and in-network processing. We describe few particular use cases that motivate the development of the M2M communication primitives tailored to large-scale CPS. M2M communications in literature were considered in limited extent so far. The existing work is based on small-scale M2M models and centralized solutions. Different sources discuss different primitives. Few existing decentralized solutions do not scale well. There is a need to design M2M communication primitives that will scale to thousands and trillions of M2M devices, without sacrificing solution quality. The main paradigm shift is to design localized algorithms, where CPS nodes make decisions based on local knowledge. Localized coordination and communication in networked robotics, for matching events and robots, were studied to illustrate new directions.", "paper_title": "Machine-to-Machine Communications With In-Network Data Aggregation, Processing, and Actuation for Large-Scale Cyber-Physical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209672100002"}
