A robust TPKE is that if threshold decryption of a valid ciphertext fails, the combiner can identify the decryption users that supplied invalid partial decryption shares. In this paper, we propose a practical and efficient TPKE scheme which is robust and non-interactive. Security against chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCAs) can be proved in the standard model under the hashed Diffie-Hellman assumption in bilinear groups. The security reduction is tight and simple. We use an instantiation hash function of the Kiltz's key encapsulation mechanism and Lai et al.'s chosen-ciphertext secure technique to construct a TPKE scheme. Moreover, our scheme is more simple and shown to be more efficient than currently existing CCA-secure TPKE schemes.", "paper_title": "Efficient Construction of CCA-Secure Threshold PKE Based on Hashed Diffie-Hellman Assumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000325489800009"}
