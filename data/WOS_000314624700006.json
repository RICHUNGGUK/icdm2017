It maps the cores of the application to the routers of the NoC topology, affecting the overall performance and power requirement of the system. This paper presents a detailed survey of the work done in last one decade in the domain of application mapping. Apart from classifying the reported techniques, it also performs a quantitative comparison among them. Comparison has been carried out for larger sized test applications also, by implementing some of the prospective techniques. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
