We first develop set-based dynamic programming and show its equivalence with classical dynamic programming. We then show how to describe state sets intensionally using any form of structured knowledge representation and obtain a generic algorithm that can optimally solve large, even infinite, MDPs without explicit state space enumeration. We derive two new Bellman backup operators and algorithms. In order to support the view of IDP as a Rosetta stone for Structured dynamic programming. we review many existing techniques that employ either propositional or relational knowledge representation frameworks.
