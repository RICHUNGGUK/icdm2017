From closed to open systems, from parallel computing to multi-agent systems and from database integration to knowledge-intensive environments, coordination abstractions and technologies have gained in relevance and power in those scenarios where complexity has become a key factor. In this paper, we outline and motivate 25 years of evolution of coordination models and languages, and discuss their potential perspectives in the future of artificial systems.", "paper_title": "Coordination models and languages: from parallel computing to self-organisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000288060200009"}
