Molecular dynamics (MD) with the Amber94 and Amber-Glycam04 forcefields were performed. The main result of the present Amber-based MD simulations is that the experimental plateau of the force-extension dependence for dextran can be explained by a transition of the glucopyranose rings in the dextran monomers from a chair (C-4(1)) to a inverted chair (C-1(4)) conformation whereas chair to boat transitions occur at higher forces. MD simulation of coarse-grained model of dextran consisting of two- or three-state monomers were performed to clarify the molecular mechanism of dextran extension.", "paper_title": "New molecular mechanism of dextran extension in single molecule AFM", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900075"}
