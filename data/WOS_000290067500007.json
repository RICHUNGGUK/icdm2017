In this paper, we propose a method to detect conjugate-point pairs for aligning two polygon datasets by matching the contours of corresponding polygons. This method comprises three processes, including identification of the corresponding polygon pairs, shape approximation with virtual corner-vertices and detection of conjugate-point pairs with our modified vertex-attributed-string-matching (VASM) algorithm. We applied this method to two distinct spatial datasets; a cadastral map and a topographical map of the same urban area. Then, the performance of our method was assessed visually and statistically. Both evaluations showed satisfactory results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
