In Korea, SWIM local server was proposed by using SWIM network architecture that is based on Enterprise service bus. This paper describes the AID that processes the aeronautical data as one of proposed SWIM local server functions and proposes the data that needs to be processed as well as adaptable AID for proposed SWIM local server with requirements satisfied.", "paper_title": "Study on Aeronautical Information Data Domain for SWIM", "paper_id": "WOS:000365531800006"}
