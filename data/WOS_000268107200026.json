Using results from class field theory, a lower bound to the minimum discriminant of a maximal order with a given center and index (= the number of Tx/Rx antennas) is derived. Also numerous examples of division algebras achieving the bound are given. For example, a matrix lattice with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) coefficients that has 2.5 times as many codewords as the celebrated Golden code of the same minimum determinant is constructed. Also, a general algorithm due to Ivanyos and Ronyai for finding maximal orders within a cyclic division algebra is described and enhancements to this algorithm are discussed. Also some general methods for finding cyclic division algebras of a prescribed index achieving the lower bound are proposed.", "paper_title": "On the Densest MIMO Lattices From Cyclic Division Algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000268107200026"}
