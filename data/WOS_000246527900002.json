Unlike the previous work on fuzzy languages, characterized by fuzzification at the level of their acceptors/generators, here we follow a top-down approach by starting our fuzzification with more abstract entities: monoids and particular families in monoids. Moreover, we replace the unit interval (in fact, a finite subset of the unit interval) as support for fuzzy values with the more general structure of a lattice. We have found that completely distributive complete lattices allow the fuzzification at the highest level, that of recognizable and rational sets. Quite surprisingly, the fuzzification process has not followed thoroughly the classical (crisp) theory. Unlike the case of rational sets, the fuzzification of recognizable sets has revealed a few remarkable exceptions from the crisp theory: for example the difficulty of proving closure properties with respect to complement, meet and inverse morphisms. Nevertheless, we succeeded to prove the McKnight and Kleene theorems for fuzzy sets by making the link between fuzzy rational/recognizable sets on the one hand and fuzzy regular languages and Fr-NFA languages (languages defined by NFA with fuzzy transitions) on the other. Finally, we have drawn the attention to fuzzy rational transductions, which have not been studied extensively and which bring in a strong note of applicability.", "paper_title": "Fuzzification of rational and recognizable sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000246527900002"}
