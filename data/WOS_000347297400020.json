The results reveal that the aging speed of seven disciplines roughly descend as follows: Management, Economics, Education, Law, Literature, Philosophy, History. This is due to the reasons that the aging speed of humanities is slower than social sciences and the dependence of History and Philosophy on archival literature is the strongest. Moreover, each discipline of humanities and social sciences follows a basic function: half life (H) x Price Index (P) = constant C, C is 2.6 or so. Furthermore, the maximum citation age of humanities and social sciences at this stage is found to be about 3 years.", "paper_title": "Comparative study on the obsolescence of humanities and social sciences in China: under the new situation of web", "paper_id": "WOS:000347297400020"}
