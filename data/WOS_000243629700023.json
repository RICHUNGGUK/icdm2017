The proposed algorithm not only guarantees each media stream's basic bandwidth, but also provides differentiated service according to users' different priorities. Moreover, it allows users to control the bandwidth of each video stream independently under various quality of service requirements and resource constraints. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme through both simulation experiment and practical application. Our results show that our scheme is more efficient, flexible and faster than existing techniques including CBQ and WFQ in supporting multimedia group communications. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
