In this note, a simple simulated annealing algorithm for the maximum clique problem is proposed and tested on all 80 DIMACS maximum clique instances. Although it is simple, the proposed simulated annealing algorithm is efficient on most of the DIMACS maximum clique instances. The simulation results show that the proposed simulated annealing algorithm outperforms a recent efficient simulated annealing algorithm proposed by Xu and Ma, and the solutions obtained by the proposed simulated annealing algorithm have the equal quality with those obtained by a recent trust region heuristic algorithm of Stanislav Busygin.
