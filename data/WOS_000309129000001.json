Actuator faults are considered. A reliable piecewise linear quadratic regulator state feedback is designed such that it can tolerate actuator faults. A sufficient condition for the existence of a passive fault-tolerant controller is derived and formulated as the feasibility of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The upper bound on the performance cost can be minimised using a convex optimisation problem with LMI constraints which can be solved efficiently. The approach is illustrated on a numerical example and a two degree of freedom helicopter.", "paper_title": "Passive fault-tolerant control of discrete time piecewise affine systems against actuator faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000309129000001"}
