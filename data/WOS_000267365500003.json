Our result builds on, simplifies, and improves on both the work by Bogdanov and Viola (FOCS '07) and the follow-up by Lovett (STOC '08). The. first relies on a conjecture that turned out to be true only for some degrees and. fields, while the latter considers the sum of 2(d) small-bias generators (as opposed to d in our result).", "paper_title": "THE SUM OF D SMALL-BIAS GENERATORS FOOLS POLYNOMIALS OF DEGREE D", "paper_id": "WOS:000267365500003"}
