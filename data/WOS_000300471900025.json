Content Anycasting shows how to utilize the capabilities of one of the candidate future Internet technologies that is the Flow-based network as in Open Flow to giving new opportunities to the future internet that are currently not available. Content Anycasting aims to provide more flexible and dynamic redirection of contents. This would be very useful in extending the content server's capacity by enabling it to serve more clients, and in improving the response of the P2P networks by reducing the time of joining P2P networks. This method relies on three important ideas which are; the content based networking, decision making by the network in a similar manner to anycast, and the participation of user clients in providing the service. This is done through the use of the flow-based actions in flow-based network and having some modifications to the content server and client.", "paper_title": "On Demand Content Anycasting to Enhance Content Server Using P2P Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900025"}
