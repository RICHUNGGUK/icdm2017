The influence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances on the system performance can be reduced and system robustness can be improved. The adaptive sliding mode controller is designed so that the practical system can track the state of the reference model. The asymptotically stability of the adaptive sliding mode control system is proved based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive sliding mode control for semi-active vehicle suspension.", "paper_title": "ROBUST ADAPTIVE SLIDING MODE CONTROLLER FOR SEMI-ACTIVE VEHICLE SUSPENSION SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648400013"}
