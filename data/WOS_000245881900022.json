The varicose mode of streak breakdown is found to be a dominant mode in the case of the adverse pressure gradient. A strong influence of pressure gradient upon the development of the streak and the secondary instability is revealed. The unfavourable pressure gradient is shown to alter the critical streak amplitude, the dispersion properties of the streak and the secondary disturbance, as well as attained maximum amplitudes for both the streak and the secondary disturbance.", "paper_title": "Influence of an unfavourable pressure gradient on the breakdown of boundary layer streaks", "paper_id": "WOS:000245881900022"}
