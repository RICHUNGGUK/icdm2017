For example, we can authenticate a phone call by recognizing a person's voice and identify people we know by recognizing their appearance. But the authentication process can get complicated when visual or auditory clues aren't available to help with identification. Because they're cheap and convenient, passwords have become the most popular technique for authenticating users trying to access confidential data stored in computers, even though such authentication is vulnerable to several forms of attack. Password protocols preventing offline dictionary attacks need more than heuristic arguments to provide a guarantee of security.", "paper_title": "Password-based authentication: Preventing dictionary attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247247100012"}
