The proposed framework is a modified version of the frameworks of Rippa and Garland and Heckbert that facilitates the development of more effective mesh-generation methods. As the proposed framework has several free parameters, the effects of different choices of these parameters on mesh quality are studied, leading to the recommendation of a particular set of choices for these parameters. A mesh-generation method is then introduced that employs the proposed framework with these best parameter choices. This method is demonstrated to produce meshes of higher quality ( both in terms of squared error and subjectively) than those generated by several competing approaches, at a relatively modest computational and memory cost.", "paper_title": "A Tuned Mesh-Generation Strategy for Image Representation Based on Data-Dependent Triangulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000318476800025"}
