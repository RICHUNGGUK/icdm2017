This paper shows (i) a combinatorial relationship between a mixed-level array and a non-resolvable incomplete block design (IBD) with varying replications (and its dual, a resolvable IBD with varying block sizes); (ii) the relationship between the criterion E(d(2)) proposed by Lu and Sun [Lu, X., Sun, Y., 2001. Supersaturated designs with more than two levels. Chinese Ann. Math. B 22, 183-194] or E(f(NOD)) proposed by Fang et al. [Fang, K.T., Lin, D.K.J., Liu, M.Q., 2003b. Optimal mixed-level supersaturated design. Metrika 58, 279-291] used in the (near-) OA construction and the (M, S)-optimality criterion used in the IBD construction; (iii) the derivation of a tighter bound for E(d(2)); (iv) how to modify the IBD algorithm of Nguyen [Nguyen, N.-K., 1994. Construction of optimal incomplete block designs by Computer. Technometrics 36, 300-307] to obtain efficient (near-) OA algorithms. Some new (near-) OAs are presented and some near-OAs are compared with arrays constructed by other authors. Examples showing the use of the constructed arrays are given. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
