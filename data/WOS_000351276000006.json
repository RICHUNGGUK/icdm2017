First, sliding mode control law has been taken from chaotic state error system which is asymptotically stable. Second, the shown sliding mode control ensures that fractional-order error system is asymptotically stable in the presence of uncertainty and nonlinear input. Simulation results using MATLAB software show that the designed controller is able to synchronize fractional-order chaotic systems in the presence of the mentioned factors.", "paper_title": "Synchronization of fractional-order uncertain chaotic systems with input nonlinearity", "paper_id": "WOS:000351276000006"}
