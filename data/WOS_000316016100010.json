The proposed common mode feedback scheme significantly reduces the size of the LVDS transmitter by eliminating the use of area consuming passive resistor and capacitor used for close loop stability compensation. A preemphasis technique has been introduced to enhance the transmitter output's signal quality without significantly increasing the power draw. On the receiver part, an equalization technique has also been introduced to further enhance signal quality, increases data rate and improved jitter with relatively low power consumption. The LVDS transmitter consumes 5.4 mA of current while driving an external 100 ohm resistor with an output voltage swing of 440 mV. The chip consumes an area of 0.044 mm(2). This LVDS receiver has an input common mode range from 0.1 to 1.6 V. It consumes 34 mW of power with a maximum data rate of 2 Gbps. It consumes an area of 0.147 mm(2) a jitter of 11.74 ps rms. A test chip is implemented using 0.18 mu m CMOS process.", "paper_title": "Equalization and pre-emphasis based LVDS transceiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000316016100010"}
