In. particular. the causative form takes the shape of a suffix. In Chinese, the causative form constitutes an independent \"'word\". In our previous studies on Super-Function Based, Machine Translation (SFBMT), we have found that causative sentences are very frequently used and difficult to translate correctly, the over use of causative sentences can be dangerous as it may introduce ambiguity in the translation. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in handling Japanese causative sentences in an SFBMT system; we present a shallow method for translating causative sentences by using some fixed rules and Super Functions (SF). In the present research, sufficient Chinese-Japanese causative sentence patterns have been employed as a language-database for experiments, which proves the suggested method can effectively improve translation, quality within the range under discussion.", "paper_title": "Chinese-Japanese translation of causative sentences using super-function based machine translation system", "paper_id": "WOS:000254981200014"}
