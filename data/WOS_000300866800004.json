Its purpose is to compute a context-independent and dense set or list of grasps, instead of just a small set of grasps regarded as optimal with respect to a given criterion. By context-independent, we mean that only the robot hand and the object to grasp are considered. The environment and the position of the robot base with respect to the object are considered in a further stage. Such a dense set can be computed offline and then used to let the robot quickly choose a grasp adapted to a specific situation. This can be useful for manipulation planning of pick-and-place tasks. Another application is human-robot interaction when the human and robot have to hand over objects to each other. If human and robot have to work together with a predefined set of objects, grasp lists can be employed to allow a fast interaction. The proposed method uses a dense sampling of the possible hand approaches based on a simple but efficient shape feature. As this leads to many finger inverse kinematics tests, hierarchical data structures are employed to reduce the computation times. The data structures allow a fast determination of the points where the fingers can realize a contact with the object surface. The grasps are ranked according to a grasp quality criterion so that the robot will first parse the list from best to worse quality grasps, until it finds a grasp that is valid for a particular situation.
