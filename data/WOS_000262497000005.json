Our results are as follows. On the negative side, we show that the model-checking problem of TCTL extended with parameters is undecidable over discrete-timed automata with only one parametric clock. The undecidability result needs equality in the logic. On the positive side, we show that the model-checking and the parameter synthesis problems become decidable for a fragment of the logic where equality is not allowed. Our method is based on automata theoretic principles and an extension of our method to express durations of runs in timed automata using Presburger arithmetic.", "paper_title": "REAL-TIME MODEL-CHECKING: PARAMETERS EVERYWHERE", "paper_id": "WOS:000262497000005"}
