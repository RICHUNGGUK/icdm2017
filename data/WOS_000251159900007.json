Modeling Multichannel Adaptive ISs requires complex interactions between the users and the system front-end due to the different capabilities of existing devices. Unfortunately, the expressive power and effectiveness of visual languages have not been fully exploited in this new area. In this paper we address two related issues. First we propose a visual language that allows for adapting the presentation layer to different physical devices; then we describe a technique to evaluate possible tradeoffs between usability and other qualities of service in Web services design.
