A nodes aggregation method is proposed for improving the running time and a Graph-Cuts method is used to model the segmentation problem. The whole process is interactive. Once the users specify the interest regions by drawing a few lines, the segmentation process is reliably computed automatically no additional users' efforts are required. It is convenient and efficient in practical applications. Experiments are given and outputs are encouraging.", "paper_title": "Graph-based fast image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100051"}
