The algorithm is based on a quantum walk a la Szegedy [Quantum speed-up of Markov chain based algorithms, in Proceedings of the 45th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE Computer Society Press, 2004, pp. 32-41] that is defined in terms of the Markov chain. The main new idea is to apply quantum phase estimation to the quantum walk in order to implement an approximate reflection operator. This operator is then used in an amplitude amplification scheme. As a result we considerably expand the scope of the previous approaches of Ambainis [Quantum walk algorithm for Element Distinctness, in Proceedings of the 45th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE Computer Society Press, 2004, pp. 22-31] and Szegedy (2004). Our algorithm combines the benefits of these approaches in terms of being able to find marked elements, incurring the smaller cost of the two, and being applicable to a larger class of Markov chains. In addition, it is conceptually simple and avoids some technical difficulties in the previous analyses of several algorithms based on quantum walk.", "paper_title": "SEARCH VIA QUANTUM WALK", "paper_id": "WOS:000287697400008"}
