To tackle it, Support Vector Machines (SVM) is adopted to diagnose the chemical process steady faults in this paper. Considering the high data dimensionality in the large-scaled chemical industry seriously spoil classification capability of SVM, a modified adaptive chaotic binary ant system (ACBAS) is proposed and combined with SVM for fault feature selection to remove the irrelevant variables and ensure SVM classifying correctly. Simulation results and comparisons of Tennessee Eastman Process show the developed ACBAS can find the essential fault feature variables effectively and exactly, and the SVM fault diagnosis method combined with ACBAS-based feature selection greatly improve the diagnosing performance as unnecessary variables are eliminated properly.", "paper_title": "A modified adaptive chaotic binary ant system and its application in chemical process fault diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100066"}
