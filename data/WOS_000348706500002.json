It adopts non-uniform deployment strategy to balance the energy consumption of the entire network and presents the formula to determine the space between adjacent sensor nodes. Analysis and simulation results show that the method of double-chain deployment of multi-sinks is suitable for long-distance transmission; it can solve the problem that sensor nodes closer to the sink node exhaust their energy earlier. By this method, energy consumption of each node is balanced and the lifecycle of the network is extended markedly.", "paper_title": "An optimised deployment method for chain-type wireless sensor network based on energy efficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000348706500002"}
