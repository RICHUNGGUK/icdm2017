We combine this digital analysis technique with a reinforcement learning technique to create a new fraud discovery approach. When applied to records of naturally occurring phenomena, our adaptive fraud detection method uses deviations from the expected Benford's Law distributions as an indicators of anomalous behaviour that are strong indicators of fraud. Through the exploration component of our reinforcement learning method we search for the underlying attributes producing the anomalous behaviour. In a blind test of our approach, using real health and auto insurance data, our Adaptive Fraud Detection method successfully identified actual fraudsters among the test data.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Fraud Detection using Benford's Law", "paper_id": "WOS:000239589600030"}
