A set of KDE models are first constructed based on the pre-segmentation result of the input image, and then for each pixel, a set of likelihoods to fit all KDE models are calculated accordingly. The color saliency and spatial saliency of each KDE model are then evaluated based on its color distinctiveness and spatial distribution, and the pixel-wise saliency map is generated by integrating likelihood measures of pixels and saliency measures of KDE models. In the first phase of salient object segmentation, the saliency map based graph cut is exploited to obtain an initial segmentation result. In the second phase, the segmentation is further refined based on an iterative seed adjustment method, which efficiently utilizes the information of minimum cut generated using the KDE model based graph cut, and exploits a balancing weight update scheme for convergence of segmentation refinement. Experimental results on a dataset containing 1000 test images with ground truths demonstrate the better segmentation performance of our approach.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised Salient Object Segmentation Based on Kernel Density Estimation and Two-Phase Graph Cut", "paper_id": "WOS:000306599400013"}
