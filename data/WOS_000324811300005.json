Expanded vermiculite as lightweight aggregate was used for making the polymer modified mortar test specimens. To study the effect of polymer-cement ratio and vermiculite-cement ratio on various properties, specimens were prepared by varying the polymer-cement and vermiculite-cement ratios. Tests of physical properties such as density, water absorption, thermal conductivity, three-point flexure and compressive tests were made on the specimens. Furthermore, a coupled thermal-structural finite element model of an entire corner wall was modelled in order to study the best material configuration. The wall is composed by a total of 132 bricks of 120 x 242 x 54 size, joined by means of a contact-bonded model. The use of advanced numerical methods allows us to obtain the optimum material properties. Finally, comparisons of polymer-cement and vermiculite-cement ratios on physical properties are given and the most important conclusions are exposed.", "paper_title": "Experimental and numerical analysis of new bricks made up of polymer modified-cement using expanded vermiculite", "paper_id": "WOS:000324811300005"}
