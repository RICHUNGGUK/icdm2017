This paper shows how to derive a user interface for human agents from such a model, especially with respect to the monitor and control capabilities of those agents. A goal-oriented widget taxonomy was elaborated in order to facilitate selecting widgets that are appropriate for each element of the underlying domain model. A user-friendly tool for building user interfaces, supporting the retrieval of adequate components and their fine tuning at a graphical level, was developed and deployed on the animator of the Objectiver/FAUST requirements toolbox.", "paper_title": "Goal-oriented design of domain control panels", "paper_id": "WOS:000238085600021"}
