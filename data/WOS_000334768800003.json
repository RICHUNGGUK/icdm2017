A genetic algorithm is adopted in the EvoSeedRNSA to evolve the random seeds to generate an approximately optimal detector set. This paper proposes an improved EvoSeedRNSA, named as the EvoSeedRNSAII, to generate a more efficient detector set. A multi-group random seed encoding scheme is designed to represent the individuals and different detector generation sequences are discussed. The experiments demonstrate that the EvoSeedRNSAII has a better performance than the EvoSeedRNSA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
