Following a signal from the cumulative count of conforming (CCC) control chart, the performance of the proposed monotonic change-point estimator is next evaluated by comparing its performances to the ones designed for step-changes and linear-trend disturbances through extensive simulation experiments involving different single step-changes, linear-trend disturbances, and multiple-step changes. The results show that when the type of change is not known a priori, using the proposed change-point estimator is useful, because it provides accurate and precise estimates of the change points for almost all of the shift magnitudes and all of the change types considered in this paper. In addition, the applicability of the proposed method is illustrated using a real case. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
