An extension of the Delsarte method is presented that relates upper bounds on the size of spherical codes to upper bounds on codes in caps. Several new upper bounds on codes in caps are derived. Applications of these bounds to estimates of the kissing numbers and one-sided kissing numbers are considered. It is proved that the maximum size of codes in spherical caps for large dimensions is determined by the maximum size of spherical codes, so these problems are asymptotically equivalent.", "paper_title": "Codes in spherical caps", "paper_id": "WOS:000254705300011"}
