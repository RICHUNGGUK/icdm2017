Minimizing a shape prior, defined as a distance between shape descriptors based on the Legendre moments of the characteristic function, leads to a geometric flow that can be used with benefits in a two- class segmentation application. The shape model includes intrinsic invariance with regard to pose and affine deformations.", "paper_title": "Affine-invariant geometric shape priors for region-based active contours", "paper_id": "WOS:000238162400016"}
