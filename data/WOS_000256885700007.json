Genetic programming as a supervised learning algorithm is employed for building two detectors with complementary characteristics. The first detector identifies the majority of noisy pixels. The second detector searches for the remaining noise missed by the first detector, usually hidden in image details or with amplitudes close to its local neighborhood. Both detectors are based on the robust estimators of location and scale-median and MAD. The filter made by the proposed method is capable of effectively suppressing all kinds of impulse noise, in contrast to many existing filters which are specialized only for a particular noise model. In addition, we propose the usage of a new impulse noise model-the mixed impulse noise, which is more realistic and harder to treat than existing impulse noise models. The proposed model is the combination of commonly used noise models: salt-and-pepper and uniform impulse noise models. Simulation results show that the proposed two-stage GP filter produces excellent results and outperforms existing state-of-the-art filters.", "paper_title": "Universal impulse noise filter based on genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000256885700007"}
