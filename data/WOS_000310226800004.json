This paper builds on a more realistic traffic flow model, and offers a holistic view on the network designing problem. In addition to the extensively studied transmission capacity, this paper takes designing cost and scalability as two other designing objectives, and presents a quantitative study of how different designing choices independently and collectively influence these objectives by the introduction of a cartesian coordinate system. It is shown that different kinds of network topologies display different shapes of achievable solution spaces and exhibit different abilities to achieve cost-effective and scalable designing. In particular, we find the philosophy underlying empirical network designing and engineering today fails to meet the cost-effective and scalable designing requirements, and propose a cost-effective and scalable designing scheme for BA-like networks, i.e., the efficient routing combined with effective betweenness based link bandwidth allocation. In addition, when designing a thoroughly new network from the beginning, we find that ER network is a good candidate to achieve cost-effective and scalable designing in most settings.", "paper_title": "Communication network designing: Transmission capacity, cost and scalability", "paper_id": "WOS:000310226800004"}
