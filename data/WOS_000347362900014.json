However, the impact of agricultural water use on the hydrologic cycle has been rarely explored by integrated SW-GW modeling, especially in large basins. This study coupled the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), which is able to simulate highly engineered flow systems, with the Coupled Ground-Water and Surface-Water Flow Model (GSFLOW). The new model was applied to study the hydrologic cycle of the Zhangye Basin, northwest China, a typical arid to semi-arid area with significant irrigation. After the successful calibration, the model produced a holistic view of the hydrological cycle impact by the agricultural water use, and generated insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of the SW-GW interaction in the study area. Different water resources management scenarios were also evaluated via the modeling. The results showed that if the irrigation demand continuous to increase, the current management strategy would lead to acceleration of the groundwater depletion, and therefore introduce ecological problems to this basin. Overall, this study demonstrated the applicability of the new model and its value to the water resources management in arid and semi-arid areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
