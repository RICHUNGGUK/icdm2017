The known leakages are canceled at the transmit side, and SLNR is calculated with the unknown leakages. GMD is applied to cancel the known leakages, so the subchannels for each receiver have equal gain. We further improve the proposed precoding scheme by ordering users. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes have a considerable bit error rate (BER) improvement over the original SLNR scheme.", "paper_title": "Successive SLNR Precoding with GMD for Downlink Multi-User Multi-Stream MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000309043100023"}
