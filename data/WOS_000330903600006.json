However, the electrode arrangement for this case is debated. This paper analyzes the influence of the position of the anodal electrode on the electric field in the brain. The simulation shows that moving the anode from scalp to shoulder does influence the electric field not only in the cortex, but also in deeper brain regions. The electric field decreases dramatically in the brain area without epileptiform activity.", "paper_title": "COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION IN THE CHILD BRAIN: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF REFRACTORY CHILDHOOD FOCAL EPILEPSY", "paper_id": "WOS:000330903600006"}
