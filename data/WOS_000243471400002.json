Especially, citation data of US patents contain most valuable pieces of the information among other patents. This paper identifies the factors affecting patent citation counts using US patents belonging to Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST). For patent citation count model, zero-inflated models are announced to handle the excess zero data. For explanatory factors, research team characteristics, invention-specific characteristics, and geographical domain related characteristics are suggested. As results, the size of invention and the degree of dependence upon Japanese technological domain significantly affect patent citation counts of KIST.", "paper_title": "An in-depth empirical analysis of patent citation counts using zero-inflated count data model: The case of KIST", "paper_id": "WOS:000243471400002"}
