In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of management frameworks delays through a set of specific metrics. We investigate the statistical properties of these metrics when the number of management nodes increases. We show that management delays measured at the application level are statistically modeled by distributions with heavy tails, especially the Weibull distribution. Given that delays can substantially degrade the capacity of management algorithms to react and resolve problems it is useful to get a finer model to describe them. We suggest the Weibull distribution as a model of delays for the analysis and simulations of such algorithms.", "paper_title": "On delays in management frameworks: Metrics, models and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000242406000002"}
