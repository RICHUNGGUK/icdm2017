So this leads to constructing a poorly phylogenetic tree. This paper presents a new discrete measure based on information gain for phylogenetic construction, which works on sequences using the information gain and doesn't need aligning sequences to measure their distances and does not have subjective factors to interfere. Distance matrix of 10 mammals' whole mitochondrial genomes sequences is computed by this new measure. Compared with the proposed measures, the method of constructing phylogenetic trees based on new measure is feasible.", "paper_title": "A Discrete Measure for Phylogenetic Construction Based on Information Gain", "paper_id": "WOS:000292855700024"}
