Mireles Morales described precisely the relationship between these two structures, and made the assertion that when implemented with balanced divisor arithmetic, the Jacobian generically yields more efficient arithmetic than the infrastructure for cryptographic applications. We confirm that this assertion holds for genus two curves, through rigorous analysis and the first detailed numerical performance comparisons, showing that cryptographic key agreement can be performed in the Jacobian without any extra operations beyond those required for basic scalar multiplication. We also present a modified version of Mireles Morales' map that more clearly reveals the algorithmic relationship between the two structures.", "paper_title": "COMPARISON OF SCALAR MULTIPLICATION ON REAL HYPERELLIPTIC CURVES", "paper_id": "WOS:000346108100003"}
