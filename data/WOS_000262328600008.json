Based on the properties of the preimage distributions of perfect nonlinear functions from an Abelian group of order 3(tau) to an Abelian group of order 3, the weight distributions of the ternary linear codes C-Pi from the perfect nonlinear functions Pi(x) from F-3 tau to itself are determined. These results suggest that two open problems, proposed by Carlet, Ding, and Yuan in 2005 and 2006, respectively, are answered.", "paper_title": "Properties and Applications of Preimage Distributions of Perfect Nonlinear Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000262328600008"}
