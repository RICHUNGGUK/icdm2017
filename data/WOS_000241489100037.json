In this paper, we jointly consider light field rendering and compression and propose a novel DLF compression scheme based on the requirements of DLF streaming. In this scheme, successive temporal prediction chains are broken and a shared field is used as a reference for all the later P frames in a group of field. Meanwhile, considering the region of interest for DLF rendering, we partition all the P frames into regional blocks and code them in a manner that any region block can be independently transmitted for bandwidth economized streaming. With this coding scheme, a multi-camera DLF system is developed to verify the streaming performance of the proposed scheme. Experimental results show that our scheme saves the per-user transmission bandwidth a lot compared with other DLF compression schemes.", "paper_title": "Dynamic light field compression using shared fields and region blocks for streaming service", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100037"}
