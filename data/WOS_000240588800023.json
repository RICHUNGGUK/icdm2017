It offers a user-friendly Windows graphical interface and a Windows or Linux simulator with a diverse selection of parameters to control the evolutionary model. Serial NetEvolve is a modification of the Treevolve program with the following additional features: simulation of serially-sampled data, the choice of either a clock-like or a variable rate model of sequence evolution, sampling from the internal nodes and the output of the randomly generated tree or network in our newly proposed NeTwick format.", "paper_title": "Serial NetEvolve: a flexible utility for generating serially-sampled sequences along a tree or recombinant network", "paper_id": "WOS:000240588800023"}
