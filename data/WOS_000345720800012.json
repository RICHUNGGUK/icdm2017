We prove that any bell-shaped mask, satisfying the basic sum rules, gives rise to a convergent monotonicity preserving subdivision scheme, but convexity preservation is not guaranteed. We show that to reach convexity preservation the first order divided difference scheme needs to be bell-shaped, too. Finally, we show that ternary subdivision schemes associated with certain refinable functions with dilation 3 have shape-preserving properties of higher order. (C) 2013 MACS.
