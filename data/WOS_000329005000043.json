These measures overlook the roles an individual plays in research collaboration, which is critical in an institutional research management environment due to the inherent interdependency among research entities. In order to address the organizational research management needs, we propose a research social network approach to better analyze local collaboration networks. For this purpose, we develop a new \"collaboration supportiveness\" measure to quantify an individual researcher's collaboration ability. Insights derived from this research are very helpful for managers to effectively allocate resources, identify research priorities, promote collaboration, and grow research in directions aligned with the organizational strategies.
