We propose a semi-automatic framework to recover both repetition patterns of the elements and their individual deformation parameters to produce a factored facade representation. Such a representation enables a range of applications including interactive facade images, improved multi-view stereo reconstruction, facade-level change detection, and novel image editing possibilities.", "paper_title": "Interactive Facades Analysis and Synthesis of Semi-Regular Facades", "paper_id": "WOS:000318545900009"}
