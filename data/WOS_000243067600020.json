Criminals with large networks (botnets) of compromised nodes (zombies) use the threat of DoS attacks to extort legitimate companies. To fight these threats and ensure network reliability, early detection of these attacks is critical. Many methods have been developed with limited success to date. This paper presents an approach that identifies change points in the time series of network packet arrival rates. The proposed process has two stages: (i) statistical analysis that finds the rate of increase of network traffic, and (ii) wavelet analysis of the network statistics that quickly detects the sudden increases in packet arrival rates characteristic of botnet attacks. Most intrusion detections are tested using data sets from special security testing configurations, which leads to unacceptable false positive rates being found when they are used in the real world. We test our approach using data from both network simulations and a large operational network. The true and false positive detection rates are determined for both data sets, and receiver operating curves use these rates to find optimal parameters for our approach. Evaluation using operational data proves the effectiveness of our approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
