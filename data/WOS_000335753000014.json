Many examples appearing in the literature in ad hoc ways, as well as new examples, can be constructed by this method. These tilings can be used to extend a fractal transformation defined on the attractor of a contractive IFS to a fractal transformation on the entire space upon which the IFS acts.", "paper_title": "Fractal Tilings from Iterated Function Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000335753000014"}
