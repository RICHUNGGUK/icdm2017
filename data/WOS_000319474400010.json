We give sufficient conditions under which the finitely generated free algebras for a variety V may be described as the colimit of a chain of finite partial algebras obtained by repeated application of a functor. In particular, our method encompasses the construction of finitely generated free algebras for varieties of algebras for a functor as in Bezhanishvili and Kurz (2007, LNCS, 143-157), Heyting algebras as in Bezhanishvili and Gehrke (2011, LMCS, 7, 1-24) and S4 algebras as in Ghilardi (2010, J.
