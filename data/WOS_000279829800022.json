Thus, to satisfy the different requirements, the users often make a tradeoff between good embedding quality and high embedding capacity. In this paper, a spatial domain technique, embedding binary message bits into a still image based on Hamming code oriented wet paper codes, is discussed and evaluated. We get inspiration from Chang, Chou and work and make a critical improvement. The significant difference between their scheme and ours is that we have no specific requirements imposed on the distribution of both the dry pixels and the wet pixels in cover images; wet pixels can be chosen completely in accordance with the characteristics of different cover images as well as the application's needs. The proposed scheme has been tested with nine commonly-used gray images. Subtle and radical variations to the existing scheme are suggested and proven to provide a significantly improved PSNR.", "paper_title": "AN INFORMATION HIDING SCHEME BASED ON (7,4) HAMMING CODE ORIENTED WET PAPER CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800022"}
