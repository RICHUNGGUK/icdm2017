However, existing research tends to focus on one or several types of nonlinearities at a time and thus do not offer a complete overall solution. This paper studies precision motion control of linear motors in the presence of parameter variations and disturbances. An adaptive robust control (ARC) algorithm with simultaneous compensation of all significant nonlinearities is developed. Those nonlinearities include Coulomb friction, cogging force, and nonlinear electromagnetic field effect. The proposed ARC with and without nonlinearity compensation have also been implemented on the Y-axis of a linear-motor-driven industrial gantry. Comparative experimental results show that the proposed ARC algorithm with simultaneous compensation of all significant nonlinearities achieves better motion tracking performance than existing ones. In addition, high-frequency structural flexible modes due to bearing, which are neglected in the previous researches, are explicitly identified experimentally, and their effects are carefully examined. Theoretical analysis is then conducted to generate a set of practically useful guidelines on the tuning of controller gains to optimize the achievable performance in practice.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Robust Precision Motion Control of Linear Motors With Integrated Compensation of Nonlinearities and Bearing Flexible Modes", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706700040"}
