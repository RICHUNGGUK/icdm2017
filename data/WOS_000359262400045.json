With the help of Lyapunov-like functions, we establish stability, uniform stability, and uniformly asymptotical stability theorems, respectively, for a class of fuzzy differential equations with the second type of Hukuhara derivative. Besides, a very useful comparison principle is derived, which connects the stability relationships between fuzzy differential equations with the second type of Hukuhara derivative and scalar differential equations. In addition, some examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.", "paper_title": "Stability of Fuzzy Differential Equations With the Second Type of Hukuhara Derivative", "paper_id": "WOS:000359262400045"}
