The total interval of the time-varying delay is first divided into two parts, and then each part is further divided into several subintervals. To deal with the state variables associated with these subintervals, an extended reciprocal convex combination approach and a double integral term with variable upper and lower limits of integral as a Lyapunov functional are proposed, which help to obtain the stability criterion. The main feature of the proposed result is more effective for the RNNs with fast time-varying delay. A numerical example is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed stability result.", "paper_title": "Stability Criteria for Recurrent Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay Based on Secondary Delay Partitioning Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000362358800030"}
