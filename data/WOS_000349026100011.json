These limitations entail the need for complementary verification methods such as runtime verification. Runtime verification is a dynamic analysis technique and is prone to scalability. In this paper, we integrate runtime verification into the BIP (Behavior, Interaction and Priority) framework. BIP is a powerful and expressive component-based framework for the formal construction of heterogeneous systems. Our method augments BIP systems with monitors to check specifications at runtime. This method has been implemented in RV-BIP, a prototype tool that we used to validate the whole approach on a robotic application.", "paper_title": "Runtime verification of component-based systems in the BIP framework with formally-proved sound and complete instrumentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000349026100011"}
