Based upon these notions and the topological degree theory, we studied the feasibility and strictly feasibility of (ICP) in R-n and an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space H, respectively. As special cases, we obtain the feasibility and strictly feasibility of complementarity problems and partly answered the second open problem (P2) proposed by Isac [G.
