To the purpose, we embrace an engineering approach, by describing an actual implementation of an open source centralized video-conferencing system capable to offer advanced communication experience to end-users through the effective exploitation of mechanisms like session management and floor control. Meetecho has been designed to be fully compliant with the latest standard proposals coming from both the IETF and the 3GPP and can be considered as an outstanding example of a real-time application built on top of the grounds paved by the SIP protocol. We will discuss both the design of the overall conferencing framework and the most important issues we had to face during the implementation phase.", "paper_title": "Standard multimedia conferencing in the wild: the Meetecho architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000309861700010"}
