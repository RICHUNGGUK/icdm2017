As n-dimensional parallel array systems are a more general model than n-dimensional cellular automata, they not only allow for the correct formal description of algorithms for n-dimensional cellular automata, but even allow for representing concise solutions for more general complex problems.", "paper_title": "Cellular automata and parallel array systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249421300002"}
