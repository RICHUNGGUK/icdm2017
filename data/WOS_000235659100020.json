In this paper we propose a framework for syntactic validation and semantic verification based on the logic programming language XCentric, The high declarative model of this language based on a new unification algorithm along with an interface to semistructured data provides an elegant framework for semantic error detection. The result is an easy to follow model to improve website quality and management.", "paper_title": "VeriFLog: A constraint logic programming approach to verification of website content", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100020"}
