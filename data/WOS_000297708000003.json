The result suggests that geographical, linguistic, and economic affinities did not have a meaningful impact on the formation of co-authorship network between 'advanced' nations, different from previous research results which claimed their importance on international cooperation. Globalization facilitated by the development of information and transportation technologies was found to influence the co-authorship link between countries, but not to accelerate centralization of the network in the past 15 years. Though the core-periphery pattern still persists, new rising stars, which are Korea and Turkey, have emerged in the co-authorship network among 'advanced' nations. These two countries, having a rapid increase in the share of degree centrality from 1995 to 2010, had strategic financial support from the government which stimulated the collaboration between universities and industries and emphasized the development of science and engineering fields.", "paper_title": "Core-periphery, new clusters, or rising stars?: international scientific collaboration among 'advanced' countries in the era of globalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000297708000003"}
