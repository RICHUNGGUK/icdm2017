A subset C subset of V is called identifying if for every vertex x is an element of V the intersection of C and the closed neighbourhood of x is nonempty, and these intersections are different for different vertices x. Let k be a positive integer. We will consider graphs where every k-subset is identifying. We prove that for every k > 1 the maximal order of such a graph is at most 2k - 2. Constructions attaining the maximal order are given for infinitely many values of k : The corresponding problem of k-subsets identifying any at most l vertices is considered as well.", "paper_title": "Graphs where every k-subset of vertices is an identifying set", "paper_id": "WOS:000342623000005"}
