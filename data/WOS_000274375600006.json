This theorem has important applications in semigroup theory, and beyond. We provide two improvements to the standard result. First we improve on all previously known bounds. Second, we extend it to 'every linear ordering'. We use this last variant in a simplified proof of the translation of recognizable languages over countable scattered linear orderings to languages accepted by automata. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
