Nowadays, compressive sensing (CS) has been proposed with a revolutionary idea to sense the sparse spectrum by using a lower sampling rate. However, many methods for compressive spectrum sensing assume that the sparse level is static and a fixed compressive sampling rate is applied over time. To adapt to time-varying sparse levels and adjust the sampling rate, we proposed to model sparse levels as a dynamic system and treat the dynamic rate selection as a tracking problem. By introducing the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm into a distributed compressive spectrum sensing framework, we could not only track the optimal sampling rate but determine the unoccupied channels accurately in a unified method.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Sampling Rate Adjustment for Compressive Spectrum Sensing over Cognitive Radio Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696000003"}
