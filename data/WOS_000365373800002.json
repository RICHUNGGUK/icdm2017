Algebraic invariant surfaces of the system are obtained by using methods of computational algebra. Then we look for singular points on the invariant surfaces and study their stability and bifurcations. Finally numerical simulations which confirm our theoretical results are presented. The study is carried out with help of computer algebra systems SINGULAR and MATHEMATICA.", "paper_title": "Investigation of Invariants of a Chemical Reaction System with Algorithms of Computer Algebra", "paper_id": "WOS:000365373800002"}
