Results indicate that the measurement of rhythmic variability used in prior studies, the nPVI, or normalized Pairwise Variability Index, may be of use in studying individual compositional style even when a significant correlation with spoken language characteristics is not present in the repertoire. By modifying and focusing the results of the nPVI, and studying the relationship between rhythmic variability and notated meter, it is possible to determine musically meaningful information about individual composer's rhythmic characteristics.", "paper_title": "The Role of Meter in Compositional Style in 19th Century French and German Art Song", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576000001"}
