Mobile devices enabled with multiple wireless technologies make possible to maintain seamless connectivity in highly dynamic scenarios such as vehicular networks (VNs), switching from one wireless network to another by using vertical handover techniques (VHO). In this paper we present an overview of VHO techniques, along with the main algorithms, protocols and tools proposed in the literature. In addition we suggest the most appropriate VHO techniques to efficiently communicate in VN environments considering the particular characteristics of this type of networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
