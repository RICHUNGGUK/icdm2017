Based on the moment generating function, the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the effective signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of the system are first derived, respectively. Then, with the available CDF and PDF, the accurate closed-form expressions of average channel capacity and average BER are further derived for exact performance evaluation. To simplify the expression, a simple closed-form approximate expression of average channel capacity is obtained by means of Taylor series expansion, with the performance results close to the accurate expression. Besides, the system outage capacity is analyzed, and an accurate closed-form expression of outage capacity probability is derived. These theoretical expressions can provide good performance evaluation for DAS downlink. It can be shown by simulation that the theoretical analysis and simulation are consistent, and DAS with antenna selection outperforms that with conventional blanket transmission. Moreover, the system performance can be effectively improved as the number of receive antennas increases.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Distributed Antenna Systems with Antenna Selection over MIMO Rayleigh Fading Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000345333600004"}
