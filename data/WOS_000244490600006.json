The physical reasoning is based on the oscillatory-wave model and leads to the modem ideas of quantum information science. The mathematical simulation employs difference and differential equations. Notice that an independent semigroup-theoretical approach to modeling closed loops in pre-mRNA and crystallized proteins was discussed in [2]. The paper is addressed to biochemists, physicists, and applied mathematicians that are engaged in interdisciplinary research on RNA and proteins.", "paper_title": "Emulating the function of introns in pre-mRNA", "paper_id": "WOS:000244490600006"}
