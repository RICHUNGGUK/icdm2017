QTA has been widely used for process fault detection and diagnosis. Recently, Dash et al. [2004. A novel interval-halving framework for automated identification of process trends. AlChE Journal 50 (1), 149-162] presented an interval-halving-based algorithm for off-line automatic trend extraction from a record of data, a fuzzy-logic based methodology for trend-matching and a fuzzy-rule-based framework for fault diagnosis (FD). In this article, an algorithm for on-line extraction of qualitative trends is proposed. A framework for on-line fault diagnosis using QTA also has been presented. Some of the issues addressed are: (i) development of a robust and computationally efficient QTA-knowledge-base, (ii) fault detection, (iii) estimation of the fault occurrence time. (iv) on-line trend-matching, and (v) updating the QTA-knowledge-base when a novel fault is diagnosed manually. A prototype QTA-based diagnostic system has been developed in Matlab (R). Results for fault diagnosis of the Tennessee Eastman process using the developed framework are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
