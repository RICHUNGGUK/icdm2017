The hybrid-HOXCs employ a waveband cross-connect for routing waveband paths and an electrical cross-connect for grooming wavelength paths. We first develop an integer linear programming model to solve the network design problem. We then propose a 2-stage ILP-based design algorithm for hierarchical optical path networks that utilize the hybrid-HOXCs. Its effectiveness is evaluated through numerical experiments. Impact of the critical parameter, electrical/optical port cost ratios, on total network cost is also investigated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
