However, this scheduling technique has not been well studied for heterogeneous wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a virtual-queue based backpressure scheduling (VQB) algorithm for heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks. The VQB algorithm introduces a simple virtual queue for each flow at a node for backpressure scheduling, whose length depends on the cache size of the node. When calculating flow weights and making scheduling decisions, the length of a virtual queue is used instead of the length of a real queue. We theoretically prove that VQB is throughput-optimal. Simulation results show that the VQB algorithm significantly outperforms a classical backpressure scheduling algorithm in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks in terms of the packet delivery ratio, packet delivery time, and average sum of the queue lengths of all nodes per timeslot.", "paper_title": "A Virtual-Queue based Backpressure Scheduling Algorithm for Heterogeneous Multi-Hop Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000370180200007"}
