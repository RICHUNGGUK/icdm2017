The main contribution is the derivation of the probability distribution function of the cochannel interference for the uplink of mobile communications systems, unconditioned on the interferers' directions of arrival. Closed-form results for the cumulative distribution function, moment generating function, and outage probability are also reported. Numerical verification is provided, utilizing both simulation and published data.
