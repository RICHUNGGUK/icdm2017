Our goal is to provide a framework for efficient validation of streaming XML in the realistic setting where the schemas of the exchanging parties evolve and thus diverge from one another. We show that Visibly Pushdown Languages are closed under the defined language operators and this enables us to expand the schemas (for XML) in order to account for flexible or constrained evolution.
