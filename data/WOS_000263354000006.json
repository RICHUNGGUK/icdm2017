It turns out that this is a very powerful method to construct new APN functions. In particular, we show that our approach can be used to construct a \"non-quadratic\" APN function. This new example is in remarkable contrast to all recently constructed functions which have all been quadratic. An equivalent function has been found independently by Brinkmann and Leander [8]. However, they claimed that their function is CCZ equivalent to a quadratic one. In this paper we give several reasons why this new function is not equivalent to a quadratic one.", "paper_title": "A NEW ALMOST PERFECT NONLINEAR FUNCTION WHICH IS NOT QUADRATIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000263354000006"}
