The desired stationary formation is achieved by introducing diverse self-delay for each agent. In addition, a delay-dependent formation control algorithm is proposed to achieve the desired moving formation. Based on the frequency-domain analysis and matrix theory, sufficient conditions are obtained for the multi-agent systems asymptotically converging to desired stationary and moving formations, respectively. Simulation results illustrate the correctness of the results.", "paper_title": "Formation control of multi-agent systems with heterogeneous communication delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000267286800006"}
