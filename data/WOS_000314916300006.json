This paper proposed a novel Graphics Processing Unit-based method for rapid simulation of water interacting with objects. The interactions between dynamic objects and the surrounding environment were realized with a specially designed simulation grid. Perfectly Matched Layers method was introduced to ensure the continued stability of the simulation grid's boundary fluctuations. To model the rigid body efficiently, a pre-rigid body method was proposed to achieve plausible visual results at higher rendering rates. Various experiment results showed the validity of our method.", "paper_title": "Fast and stable simulation of virtual water scenes with interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000314916300006"}
