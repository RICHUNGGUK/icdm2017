However, the decoding algorithm typically ignores how accurate these estimates are. Uncertainty decoding methods incorporate this type of information. In this paper, we develop a formulation of the uncertainty decoding paradigm for Frequency Filtered (FF) parameters using spectral subtraction as a feature enhancement method. Additionally, we show that the uncertainty decoding method for FF parameters admits a simple interpretation as a spectral weighting method that assigns more importance to the most reliable spectral components. Furthermore, we suggest combining this method with SSBD-HMM (Spectral Subtraction and Bounded Distance HMM), one recently proposed technique that is able to compensate for the effects of features that are highly contaminated (outliers). This combination pursues two objectives: to improve the results achieved by uncertainty decoding methods and to determine which part of the improvements is due to compensating for the effects of outliers and which part is due to compensating for other less deteriorated features.
