(SIAM J. Imaging Sci. 2011, accepted), for classifying noisy projection images of similar viewing directions in three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This preliminary classification is of fundamental importance in determining the three-dimensional structure of macromolecules from cryo-EM images. Inspecting this algebraic structure we obtain a conceptual explanation for the admissibility (correctness) of the algorithm and a proof of its numerical stability. The proof relies on studying the spectral properties of an integral operator of geometric origin on the two-dimensional sphere, called the localized parallel transport operator. Along the way, we continue to develop the representation theoretic set-up for three-dimensional cryo-EM that was initiated in Hadani and Singer (Ann. Math. 2010, accepted).", "paper_title": "Representation Theoretic Patterns in Three-Dimensional Cryo-Electron Microscopy II-The Class Averaging Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000300097200004"}
