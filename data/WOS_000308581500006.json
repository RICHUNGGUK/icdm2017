We study the behavior of the soft interference cancellation (SIC) detector employed in IDMA systems and design the channel codes using EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) evolution, aiming at optimizing the system performance. Simulation results show that the designed codes approach the theoretical limits and outperform previous IDMA schemes based on Turbo-Hadamard codes.
