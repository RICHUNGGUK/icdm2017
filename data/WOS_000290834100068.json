The framework builds on nonoscillatory forward-in-time MPDATA solvers using finite volume edge-based discretization, and admits meshes with arbitrarily shaped cells. The numerical formulation is equally applicable to global and limited area models. Theoretical considerations are supported with canonical examples of slab-symmetric, nonhydrostatic orographic problems in weakly and strongly stratified flow regimes and three-dimensional hydrostatic analogues of the strongly stratified case on a slowly and rapidly rotating sphere.
