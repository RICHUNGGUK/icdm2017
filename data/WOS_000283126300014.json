In this approach, statistical techniques are applied for estimating games based on data produced by a simulation model. The estimation procedure is presented in cases involving games with both discrete and continuous decision variables. The validity of the simulation model is assessed by comparing the properties of the estimated games to actual practices in AC. These games are also applied for simulation-based optimization in a two-sided setting in which the action of the opponent is taken into account. In optimization, the estimated games enable the study of effectiveness of AC tactics as well as aircraft, weapons, and avionics configurations. The game-theoretic approach enhances existing methods for the validation of discrete-event simulation models and techniques for simulation-based optimization by incorporating the inherent game setting of AC into the analysis. It also provides a novel game-theoretic perspective to simulation metamodeling which is used to facilitate simulation analysis. The utilization of the game-theoretic approach is illustrated by analyzing simulation data obtained with an existing AC simulation model.", "paper_title": "Game-Theoretic Validation and Analysis of Air Combat Simulation Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000283126300014"}
