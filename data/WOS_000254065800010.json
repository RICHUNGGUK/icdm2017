The dynamic environment in question is represented by a simulation model-connected to a production scheduler system-with flexible modelling capabilities. The paper addresses the simulation module of the proposed architecture highlighting its main functionalities and advantages, compared to former simulation-based solutions. By applying the proposed architecture, which constitutes a coherent part of a digital enterprise approach, the solution methods for stability-oriented rescheduling can be thoroughly tested and analysed. An evaluation of several scenarios of the rescheduling threshold and the timing of rescheduling are also presented in an industrial case-study.", "paper_title": "Simulation as one of the core technologies for digital enterprises: Assessment of hybrid rescheduling methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000254065800010"}
