The two-dimensional steady-state model presented allows for the use of variable coefficients represented by non-uniform velocity profiles and turbulent diffusion coefficients, in any general functional form. The proposed model is then applied to an example of biocides contamination downstream of thermohydroelectric power stations, originated from the cleaning of cooling water systems undergoing biofouling.
