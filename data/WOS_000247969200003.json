The present work outlines the wide range of complex physical phenomena involved in the chip formation in a descriptive manner. In order to improve and understand the process different numerical strategies have been used for simulation. Several of these numerical strategies are reviewed and a short discussion of their relative merits and drawbacks is presented. By means of several examples, where a combined experimental/numerical effort was undertaken, we try to illustrate what numerical techniques, models and pertinent parameters are needed for successful simulations.", "paper_title": "Modelling and simulation of machining processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000247969200003"}
