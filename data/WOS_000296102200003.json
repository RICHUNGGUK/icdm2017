An approximate Riemann solver is proposed for direct sensitivity calculation even in the presence of discontinuous solutions. The Shallow Water Sensitivity Equations are first derived as well as the expressions of the sensitivity source terms, initial and boundary conditions. The numerical technique is then detailed and application examples are provided to assess the method's efficiency in estimating the sensitivity to different parameters (friction coefficient and initial and boundary conditions). The application of the dam-break problem to a trapezoidal channel is also provided. The comparison with the analytical solution and the classical empirical approach illustrates the usefulness of the direct sensitivity calculation.
