The standard way to obtain information about the internet topology is to use the traceroute tool from a small number of monitors. Recent papers have made the case that increasing the number of monitors will give a more accurate view of the topology. However, scaling up the number of monitors is not a trivial process. Duplication of effort close to the monitors wastes time by reexploring well-known parts of the network, and close to destinations might appear to be a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack as the probes converge from a set of sources towards a given destination. In prior work, authors of this paper proposed Double-tree, an algorithm for cooperative topology discovery, that reduces the load on the network, i.e., router IP interfaces and end-hosts, while discovering almost as many nodes and links as standard approaches based on traceroute. This paper presents our open-source and freely downloadable implementation of Doubletree in a tool we call traceroute@home. We evaluate the performance of our implementation on the PlanetLab testbed and discuss a large-scale monitoring infrastructure that could benefit of Doubletree.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of a large-scale topology discovery algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000242563100017"}
