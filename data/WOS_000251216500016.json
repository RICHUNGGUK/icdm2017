Therefore, we collected known active compounds of CDK2, p38 MAPK, PPAR-gamma, and factor Xa and built a set of druglike decoys using ilib:diverse. Subsequently, we generated 3D structures using CORINA and also calculated conformational models for all compounds using CAESAR, CATALYST FAST, and OMEGA. A widespread set of 103 structure-based pharmacophore models was developed with LigandScout for virtual screening with CATALYST. The performance of both database search modes (FAST and BEST flexible database search) as well as the fit value calculation procedures (FAST and BEST fit) available in CATALYST were analyzed in terms of their ability to discriminate between active and inactive compounds and in terms of efficiency. Moreover, these results are put in direct comparison to the performance of the shape-based virtual screening platform ROCS. Our results prove that high enrichment rates are not necessarily in conflict with efficient vHTS settings: In most of the experiments, we obtained the highest yield of actives in the hit list when parameter sets for the fastest search algorithm were used.", "paper_title": "Fast and efficient in silico 3D screening: Toward maximum computational efficiency of pharmacophore-based and shape-based approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000251216500016"}
