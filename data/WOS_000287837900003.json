If these companies are to achieve a seamless semantic alignment by exchanging documents, we should employ a conceptual model which does not rely on agreeing in advance on a centralised standard for document contents and format, but instead allows individual companies to maintain localised ontologies structuring their own documents allowing the companies to automatically establish a semantic alignment between pairs of collaborating companies, taking into account the ripple effects that such an alignment could trigger. In this article we demonstrate how the conceptual model of devolved ontology is engineered and tested to support such a scenario: we show how we have engineered the devolved ontology through a case study, and present experimental results on the document alignment intrinsically needed for this.", "paper_title": "DEVOLVED ONTOLOGY IN PRACTICE FOR A SEAMLESS SEMANTIC ALIGNMENT WITHIN DYNAMIC COLLABORATION NETWORKS OF SMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000287837900003"}
