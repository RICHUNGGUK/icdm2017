More exactly, it does not build an instructional course from scratch - from the domain curriculum, as most Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) do. Instead, information in the curriculum model is used as metadata, together with other metadata, to describe tutoring resources. Given a learning requirement (learning objectives and/or constraints), it finds out the most appropriate tutoring resource(s) and proposes a proper learning sequence of them. Based on the proposed fuzzy instructional model and learner model, the tutoring planning problem is defined as a multi-criteria programming (MCP) model.", "paper_title": "A multi-criteria programming model for intelligent tutoring planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000094"}
