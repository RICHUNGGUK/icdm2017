For this purpose, a cellular automata approach coupled with fuzzy set theory is developed to study the HIV evolution. The study is conducted using two cellular automata models in two corresponding steps. The first step concerns HIV dynamics in individuals with no antiretroviral therapy. In this case, the trajectory developed by the cellular automaton model depicts all phases shown in the known history of HIV dynamics. The main purpose of the first step is to serve as a model validation step. The second step extends the model developed in the first step to consider HIV dynamics in individuals under antiretroviral therapy. The effects of antiretroviral therapy in the cellular automaton model are modeled using a fuzzy rule-based system with two inputs, the medication potency and treatment adhesion rate of the individuals to the therapy. The fuzzy rule-based system is used to compute the number of HIV infected CD4+ cells and the viral replication. The results developed by the cellular automaton model with antiretroviral therapy are close to the ones reported in the literature and agree with the behavior expected by experts [J. Guedj, R.
