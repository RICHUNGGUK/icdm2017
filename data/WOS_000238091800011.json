However, in some realistic situations, the capacity of a machine is not constant. We call it a flexible batching machine. In this paper, we address the problem of scheduling jobs on a flexible batching machine to minimize the makespan. We prove that the problem is strong NP-hard, and its two agreeable cases are NP-hard. Then two pseudo-polynomial algorithms for the two cases are presented respectively.", "paper_title": "Scheduling jobs on a flexible batching machine: Model, complexity and algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800011"}
