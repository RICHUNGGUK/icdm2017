The sound is collected with a microphone installed in a tire and a wireless communication and power supply system. Characteristic frequency of each road condition is extracted from wavelet transform of the sound signal. An experiment result shows the proposing logic can discriminate the road conditions, including flat, pave, rough and ditch.", "paper_title": "ROAD TYPE ESTIMATION BY WAVELET ANALYSIS OF RUNNING TIRE SOUND", "paper_id": "WOS:000280583000010"}
