The structure consists of a layer of inner lining (glass fibre/vinyl ester), a layer of fibrous insulation, and a load carrying sandwich panel (carbon fibre/epoxy face sheets on a PMI core). Besides the most commonly used design constraints, such as mechanical strength, stiffness and geometry, also acoustic and thermal insulation as well as fire safety is included in the optimisation. The results suggest that well over 40 % mass reduction can be achieved with these types of structures.", "paper_title": "Multi-functional design of a composite high-speed train body structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000340401600009"}
