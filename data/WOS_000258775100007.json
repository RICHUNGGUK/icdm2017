For an interference model that constrains a node to either transmit to or receive from only one other node at a time, and not to do both, we propose an architecture for fair resource allocation that consists of a distributed scheduling algorithm operating in conjunction with an asynchronous congestion control algorithm. We show that the proposed joint congestion control and scheduling algorithm supports at least one-third of the throughput supportable by any other algorithm, including centralized algorithms.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous congestion control in multi-hop wireless networks with maximal matching-based scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000258775100007"}
