The approach determines the shortest video exposures needed for low-latency recognition by sequentially evaluating a series of posterior ratios for different action classes. If a subsequence is deemed unreliable or confusing, additional video frames are incorporated until a reliable classification to a particular action can be made. Results are presented for multiple action classes and subsequence durations, and are compared to alternative probabilistic approaches. The framework provides a means to accurately classify human actions using the least amount of temporal information. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
