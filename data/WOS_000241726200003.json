Unfortunately, these systems are largely heterogeneous, mostly with respect to the data model but at least with respect to the schema, making synchronization and propagation of data a daunting task. Our goal is to cope with this situation in a best-effort manner. To meet this claim, we introduce a symmetric instance-level matching approach that allows to establish mappings without any user interaction, schema information or dictionaries and ontologies. In awareness of dealing with inexact and incomplete mappings, the quality of the propagation has to be quantified. For this purpose, different quality dimensions like accuracy or completeness are introduced. Additionally, visualizing the quality allows users to evaluate the performance of the data propagation process.", "paper_title": "Tolerant ad hoc data propagation with error quantification", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200003"}
