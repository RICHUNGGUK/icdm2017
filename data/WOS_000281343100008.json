Therefore there is a need to correct display's conditions by controlling image factors such as luminance offset, contrast, color gain, and gamma to maintain the perceived display quality. The focus of our study is on the formulation of a simpler and more effective model for color and tone reproduction for digital imaging systems to utilize color appearance models. It can be applicable to optimum color display conditions to give comfort and consistency visually in various ambient conditions.", "paper_title": "A Controllable GOG Model for Ergonomic Color Reproduction of Digital Imaging Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000281343100008"}
