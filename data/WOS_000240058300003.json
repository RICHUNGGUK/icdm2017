Event systems are widely used because asynchronous messaging provides a flexible alternative to RPC. They are typically implemented using an overlay network of routers. A content-based router forwards event messages based on filters that are installed by subscribers and other routers. This paper addresses the optimization of content-based routing tables organized using the covering relation and presents novel configurations for improving local and distributed operation. We present the poset-derived forest data structure and variants that perform considerably better under frequent filter additions and removals than existing data structures. The results offer a significant performance increase to currently known covering-based routing mechanisms.", "paper_title": "Optimizing content-based routers: posets and forests", "paper_id": "WOS:000240058300003"}
