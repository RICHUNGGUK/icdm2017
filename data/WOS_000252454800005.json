A Gaussian mixture model for video data is obtained offline and is thereafter utilized online in order to restore lost blocks from spatial and temporal surrounding information. We propose estimators on closed form for missing data in the case of varying available neighboring contexts. Our error concealment strategy increases peak signal-tonoise ratio compared to previously proposed schemes. Examples of improved subjective visual quality by means of the proposed method are also supplied.", "paper_title": "Packet video error concealment with Gaussian mixture models", "paper_id": "WOS:000252454800005"}
