A simple algorithm is presented by minimizing a loss function of the nonlinear innovation. The method exploits the nonstationarity of sources in the sense that the variance of each source signal can be assumed to change smoothly as a function of time. Simulations verify the efficient implementation of the proposed method, especially its robustness to the outliers. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
