The recent interest in this technological route derives from the development of new third generation biorefinery concepts, in which, algal oil is subjected to catalytic hydrodeoxygenation processes for the production of (Hydrotreated Renewable Jet) HRJ fuels. Beside biofuels, co-production of large amounts of propane is observed, which can be upgraded by a catalytic conversion to aromatics on zeolites. Kinetic studies of propane aromatization over H-ZSM-5 zeolite in a wide range of conversions are reported in the literature. Based on these results, a general kinetic model of propane aromatization has been developed. The revised kinetic scheme is then embedded in a process simulation, performed with the commercial code SimSci PROIII by Schneider Electric. Basing on the process simulation and on available price assessments, a techno-economic analysis has been performed to show limits as well as potentialities of the proposed layout.
