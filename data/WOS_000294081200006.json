They (except one) were proven secure in the random oracle model, which has received a lot of criticism. In this paper, we propose a new construction of proxy signature which is strongly unforgeable in the standard model with the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption in bilinear groups. Compared with the only proxy signature without random oracles, our scheme demonstrates stronger security, shorter system parameters and higher efficiency. As far as we know, this is the first proxy signature scheme, which possesses the property of strong unforgeability in the standard model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
