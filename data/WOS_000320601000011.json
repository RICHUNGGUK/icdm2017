However it seems that no one studies how to add the ability of returning changes in micropayment schemes. In this paper, we take the lead in studying a micropayment scheme with the ability to return changes (MSRC), which reduces the hash operations in the transaction phase. When compared with previous micropayment schemes, the proposed MSRC has low computation costs and thus is more suitable and practical for mobile commerce environments, which have a limited computation capability and limited bandwidth.
