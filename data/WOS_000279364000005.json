There are a number of umbrella terms used by researchers to classify their contributions. This can cause problems in disseminating and sharing results and potentially restricts research due to a lack of knowledge of the varied contributions. This paper reviews research in spiking neural networks and attempts to determine if the term Soft Computing can be used to classify contributions in this area.", "paper_title": "Does Soft Computing Classify Research in Spiking Neural Networks?", "paper_id": "WOS:000279364000005"}
