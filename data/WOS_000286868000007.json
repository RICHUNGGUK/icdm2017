We consider black-box algorithms that seek to learn information about a polynomial f from input/output pairs (x(i), f(x(i))). We define a more general class of (d, S)-independent function properties, where, outside of a set S of exceptions, knowing d input values does not help one predict the answer. There are essentially two strategies to computing such a function: query d + 1 random input values, or search for one of the vertical bar S vertical bar exceptions. We show that, up to constant factors, we cannot beat these two approaches.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM INTERPOLATION OF POLYNOMILAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000286868000007"}
