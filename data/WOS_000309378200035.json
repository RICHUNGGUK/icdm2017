Different studies have shown the relationship between continuous exposition to electromagnetic fields and different kinds of pathologies. Despite this, the electromagnetic danger for exposition is not taken into account in recent mobile network deployments. In this paper we propose a novel evolutionary algorithm for mobile networks deployment, which takes into account the control of the electromagnetic emission from the base stations as one of the key design parameters. The proposed evolutionary approach is a variable-length algorithm, able to produce solutions with different number of base stations. We detail the encoding, operators and a repairing procedure applied to obtain good solutions in terms of coverage, cost and electromagnetic pollution. The algorithm has been tested in a real problem of mobile network deployment in Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain, and compare with a greedy (constructive) approach and a meta-heuristic algorithm (Harmony Search), obtaining very good results.
