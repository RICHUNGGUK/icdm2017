We propose an information theoretic measure, Squeeziness, as the theoretical basis for avoiding fault masking. We begin by explaining fault masking and the relationship between collisions and fault masking. We then define Squeeziness and demonstrate by experiment that there is a strong correlation between Squeeziness and the likelihood of collisions. We conclude with comments on how Squeeziness could be the foundation for generating test suites that minimise the likelihood of fault masking. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
