In such a project, some buildings need to be torn down and re-constructed. The two processes of tearing down and re-constructing each building are often viewed as a single operation. However, under certain circumstances, the re-construction process, i.e., the resource recycling process, can be viewed as a separate operation. In this paper we regard these two processes as separate on the assumption that they are handled by different working crews. We formulate the problem as a resource-constrained two-machine flowshop scheduling problem with the objective of finding a feasible re-development sequence that minimizes the makespan. We provide problem formulations, discuss the complexity results, and present polynomial algorithms for various special cases of the problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
