Stabilization is achieved by means of fixation of the central image region using a variable window size block matching method. When applied to a sliding temporal window, the stabilization improves the performance of standard optic flow techniques. Due to the unique choice of fixation as the main stabilization mechanism, the proposed method not only increases the flow field density but renders certain global structural properties of the flow fields more predictable as well. This in turn is advantageous for egomotion computation.", "paper_title": "Fixation as a mechanism for stabilization of short image sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000243242000005"}
