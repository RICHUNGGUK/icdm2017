However, since cellular phones only have numerical keys for inputting characters, users have to conduct laborious operations to input a keyword for a web search. In our previous work, we assumed information devices equipped with pointing devices and proposed a Click-Search method that enables users to perform a keyword search simply by pointing to and clicking on the desired word on a web page. This approach might be effective for web searches using cellular phones. However, since many cellular phones only have a direction pad as a pointing device, users still have to conduct laborious operations using the pad to move a pointer and point to a word. To solve this problem, we propose a Click-Search interface for cellular phone users that uses an expanding circle to select a word for a search. Using this interface, users can specify a keyword simply by pushing a few buttons.
