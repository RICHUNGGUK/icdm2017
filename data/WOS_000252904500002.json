Through handling experiments the solution domain for the path of the robotic gripper is determined, the handling parameters are identified and implicit knowledge is accumulated. Then a proper scheme for the data acquisition is formed and a path-planning algorithm based on fuzzy logic is developed. Due to conflicts and inaccuracies of the acquired data, a subtractive clustering algorithm is used, to identify the proper clusters for the two developed fuzzy systems, with the first employing the clusters as rules and the second a neuro-fuzzy system initialised by the implicit knowledge and trained via back-propagation. Finally, the effectiveness of the two path-planning systems is investigated in an experimental stage where the robot successfully places on a table fabrics of a variety of materials and sizes.
