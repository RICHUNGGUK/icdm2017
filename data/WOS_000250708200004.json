This article focuses on how visual configuration systems can be developed. The approach for developing visual configuration systems has been developed by Centre for Product Modelling (CPM) at The Technical University of Denmark. The approach is based on experiences from a visualization project in co-operation between CPM and the global provider of power protection American Power Conversion (APC). The visual configuration system was developed in 2001-2002 and has during its operation since the beginning of 2003 delivered promising results. The lead-time for approval of quotations has been reduced and the percentages of first-time-completed and correct configuration sessions are increased thanks to an increased user-interaction, caused by the visualization of the product in the visual configuration system.
