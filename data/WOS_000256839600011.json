We discuss methodological issues related to the computation of h-index of topics (denoted h-b index by BANKS [2006]). Data collection for computing the h-b index is much more complex than computing the index for authors, research groups and/or journals, and has several limitations. We demonstrate the methods on a number of informetric topics, among them the h-index.", "paper_title": "The h-index of h-index and of other informetric topics", "paper_id": "WOS:000256839600011"}
