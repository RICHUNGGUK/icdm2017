Based on the accurate improve Gaussian approximation (IGA) technique, a new BER expression is derived in a closed form. Validated by Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed expression is used to accurately investigate the impacts of channel's conditions, power allocation and random users' distributions on the BER performance.", "paper_title": "Theoretical Analysis on Bit Error Rate of VSG CDMA in Nakagami Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900017"}
