This paper introduces the topic and provides a general overview of the current state of the field of Multicomponent Robotic Systems focusing on providing some insights into where Hybrid Intelligent Systems could provide key contributions to its advancement. Thus, the aim is to identify prospective research areas and to try to delimit the field from the point of view of the following essential problem: how to coordinate multiple robotic elements in order to perform useful tasks.
