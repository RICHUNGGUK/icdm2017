Described here is a web interface to SALIGN, the versatile protein multiple sequence/structure alignment module of MODELLER. The web server automatically determines the best alignment procedure based on the inputs, while allowing the user to override default parameter values. Multiple alignments are guided by a dendrogram computed from a matrix of all pairwise alignment scores. When aligning sequences to structures, SALIGN uses structural environment information to place gaps optimally. If two multiple sequence alignments of related proteins are input to the server, a profile-profile alignment is performed. All features of the server have been previously optimized for accuracy, especially in the contexts of comparative modeling and identification of interacting protein partners.", "paper_title": "SALIGN: a web server for alignment of multiple protein sequences and structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000306686400021"}
