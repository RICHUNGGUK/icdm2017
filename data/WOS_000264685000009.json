A mixed quadrilateral and triangular grid is first refined using one-level h-refinement to generate a quadrilateral grid while keeping the curvature of boundary edges. The SD method designed for quadrilateral meshes can subsequently be applied for the refined unstructured grid. Results obtained with the SD method for both inviscid and viscous compressible flows compare well with analytical solutions and other published results.
