In this paper, we propose a fast fixed-point learning algorithm for efficiently implementing maximization of the harmony function on Gaussian mixture with automated model selection. Several simulation experiments are performed to compare its effectiveness in automated model selection as well as its efficiency in parameter learning with other existing learning algorithms. The experimental results reveal that the performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to its counterparts in these aspects. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is further tested with three typical real-world data sets and successfully applied to unsupervised color image segmentation.
