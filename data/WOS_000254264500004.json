The results show that the centralised scheme offers better data volume compression, similar automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) runtime results and lower hardware overhead. The cost with the centralised scheme is in the routing congestion.", "paper_title": "Comparative study of centralised and distributed compatibility-based test data compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000254264500004"}
