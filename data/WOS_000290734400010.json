MAWA* uses the window-bounded anytime-search methodology of AWA* as the basic framework and combines it with the memory-bounded A*-like approach to handle restricted memory situations. Simple and efficient versions of MAWA* targeted for tree search have also been presented. Experimental results of the sliding-tile puzzle problem and the traveling-salesman problem show the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.", "paper_title": "MAWA*-A Memory-Bounded Anytime Heuristic-Search Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000290734400010"}
