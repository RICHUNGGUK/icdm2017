In the proposed approach, the integration of monitoring in the manufacturing system is facilitated by the development of a generic model. The aim is to propose a monitoring system able of absorbing internal degradation of any variables and ensuring the continuity of the service. The outline of the optimization of the fault latency method is based on two steps is proposed. The first step is the evaluation of fault latency and the second one is the performance evaluation of monitoring process. Timed automata are the modeling tool used for these two steps. The proposed method can be applied to various kinds of processes and gives good results. Indeed, the simulation results, including a serial manufacturing line, substantiate the feasibility of the proposed method and provide a promising potential to spin-off applications in industrial manufacturing system.
