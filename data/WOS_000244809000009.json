Atanassov, Intuitionistic fuzzy sets, VII ITKR's Session, Sofia (deposed in Central Science-Technical Library of Bulgarian Academy of Science, 1697/84), 1983 (in Bulgarian)] are an extension of fuzzy set theory in which not only a membership degree is given, but also a non-membership degree, which is more or less independent. Considering the increasing interest in intuitionistic fuzzy sets, it is useful to determine the position of intuitionistic fuzzy set theory in the framework of the different theories modelling imprecision. In this paper we discuss the mathematical relationship between intuitionistic fuzzy sets and other models of imprecision. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
