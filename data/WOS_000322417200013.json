However, the rotational failure mechanism in the conventional upper bound limit analysis cannot rationally describe the sliding of the failure mass along the weak interlayer. Therefore, a new failure mechanism was proposed in this study to evaluate the stability of slopes with weak interlayers using the upper bound limit analysis and the associated factor of safety was determined by the shear strength reduction technique. The new failure mechanism is comprised of rigid blocks undergoing rotational or translational movements, instead of the rotational movement in the conventional failure mechanism. It has also been extended to the stability analysis of slopes in presence of stabilizing piles and pore water pressures. Case studies were carried out on actual slopes with weak interlayers. The proposed rotational-translational failure mechanism was verified by the shear strength reduction finite element method (SSRFEM). Comparisons demonstrate the reliability of limit analysis method with the proposed rotational-translational failure mechanism for slopes with weak interlayers and therefore it can be used as a simple evaluation method for the engineering design.
