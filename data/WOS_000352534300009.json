Splicing localization in this image is a challenging problem when a forger uses some postprocessing operations as antiforensics to remove the splicing traces anomalies by resizing the tampered image or blurring the spliced region boundary. Such operations remove the artifacts that make detection of splicing difficult. In this paper, we overcome this problem by proposing a novel framework for blurred image splicing localization based on the partial blur type inconsistency. In this framework, after the block-based image partitioning, a local blur type detection feature is extracted from the estimated local blur kernels. The image blocks are classified into out-of-focus or motion blur based on this feature to generate invariant blur type regions. Finally, a fine splicing localization is applied to increase the precision of regions boundary. We can use the blur type differences of the regions to trace the inconsistency for the splicing localization. Our experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method in the detection and the classification of the out-of-focus and motion blur types. For splicing localization, the result demonstrates that our method works well in detecting the inconsistency in the partial blur types of the tampered images. However, our method can be applied to blurred images only.", "paper_title": "Blurred Image Splicing Localization by Exposing Blur Type Inconsistency", "paper_id": "WOS:000352534300009"}
