The observer-based controller is capable of disturbance-rejection in the presence of unknown but bounded disturbance. We present results, which illustrate plainly the role of the similarity transformation in converting a BMI problem into an LMI problem in a unified fashion applicable to both continuous- and discrete-time problems with or without uncertainty. Finally the validity and applicability of the approach are illuminated by examples.", "paper_title": "Existence of similarity transformation converting BMIs to LMIs", "paper_id": "WOS:000250372100007"}
