The proposed system is intended to design an implantable LoC. The lowest static power consumption of the implemented Integrated circuit is 650 mu A with a voltage supply of -1.10 and +1.8 V. Three different sizes of carboxyl-modified polystyrene particles (diameters of 0.22, 0.97 and 2.04 mu m) where tested experimentally with three different electrode architectures to achieve dielectrophoretic mixing and separation. U-shaped, L-shaped and octagonal electrodes are used to perform the separation and mixing operations. The biosensing part is designed with a charge based capacitive sensor with an integrated sigma-delta modulator at its output stage. It was tested experimentally with algae and ethanol. The chip size is 1.2 by 1.2 mm and it is connected to a 15 x 30 cm microfluidic design. An efficient particle manipulation was achieved by applying a voltage of 1.7 V peak to peak in the microchannel with 90 and 180 degrees dephased signals.", "paper_title": "Low-voltage lab-on-chip for micro and nanoparticles manipulation and detection: experimental results", "paper_id": "WOS:000310639400006"}
