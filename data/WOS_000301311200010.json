The proposed method considers both pose tracking and relocation problems. The pose tracking is achieved by calculating node probability using grid-map matching and relative motion model. The relocation method detects the kidnap automatically and recovers it using multiple hypothesis tracking. After kidnap recovery, it also provides a criterion for selecting a reasonable hypothesis for returning to the pose tracking stage autonomously. Experimental results in a real home environment verify that the proposed localization method provides a reliable and convergent node probability when the robot is kidnapped. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
