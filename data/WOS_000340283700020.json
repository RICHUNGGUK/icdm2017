A number of national studies have substantiated those needs with respect to the future competitiveness of USA in research and development, the innovation of new products, and the competitiveness of many industries. Creating computational science programs at academic institutions organized along disciplinary boundaries represents a challenge because aspects of computer science, mathematics, and a science or engineering domain are required parts of any program. Gaining agreement on the associated requirements, integrating the classes with those in the traditional curriculum, and obtaining the necessary support through academic and administrative reviews represent substantial challenges. Clark Atlanta University, the University of Mary Washington, and Southern University are all working on establishing undergraduate or graduate programs in computational science and have had a number of common experiences.
