This paper introduces a decentralized H-infinity fuzzy filter design for nonlinear interconnected systems with multiple time delays via T-S fuzzy models. The T-S fuzzy model consists of N time-delay T-S fuzzy subsystems. The decentralized H-infinity filter is designed based on this model, which the asymptotic stability and a prescribed H infinity performance index are guaranteed for the overall filtering error system. A sufficient condition for the existence of such a filter is established by using linear matrix inequalities that are numerically feasible. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of this approach.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Fuzzy H-infinity Filtering for Nonlinear Interconnected Systems With Multiple Time Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000282348400019"}
