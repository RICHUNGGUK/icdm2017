However. the realization and success of supply chain management (SCM) depends significantly on the previous supply chain modeling and simulation for analyzing complex systems. This study develops a modular approach for system analysis and design of supply Chain Simulation. which is capable of modeling the supply chain process and the operation of related communication data and information through XML techniques, and simulating them within the SIMAN simulation tool. This study performs the following tasks: (i) characterizing supply chain process and establishing data/information elements. (ii) establishing knowledge requirements for supply chain process, (iii) analyzing and designing supply chain process modules. (iv) representing and integrating specifications of supply chain process modules, and (v) generating and demonstrating modular supply chain simulation. The results of this study can be used to develop a modular system analysis and design for supply chain simulation for effectively assisting the integration of SCM and the exchange of related communication data and information in a supply chain, thus increasing business efficiency.
