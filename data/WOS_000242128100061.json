We assume that low level connectivity with such topological properties, e.g., anatomical or functional connectivity in brains, is compulsory to achieve high level cognitive functionality, as language. The study of these network properties provides tools to approach different issues in behavior based Artificial Intelligence (AI) that usually have been ill defined, e.g., complexity and autonomy. In this paper, we propose a model in which situated agents evolve knowledge networks holding both Small World and Scale Free properties. Experimental results in the context of Pragmatic Games, elucidate some required conditions to obtain the expected network properties when performing complex learning.", "paper_title": "Does complex learning require complex connectivity?", "paper_id": "WOS:000242128100061"}
