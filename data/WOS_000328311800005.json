We consider the problem of finding such a k-factor of S by using auxiliary points. Two types are considered: white points whose position is fixed, and Steiner points which have no fixed position. Our approach provides algorithms for constructing those k-factors, and gives bounds on the number of auxiliary points needed to draw a monochromatic geometric planar k-factor of S.
