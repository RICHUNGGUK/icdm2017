Such careful comparison of modelling techniques allows us to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, and facilitates cross-fertilization between them. In the present case we take a characteristic of one formalism, functional rates in Stochastic Automata Networks, and introduce it to the other formalism, Performance Evaluation Process Algebra. We investigate the benefits of this cross-fertilization, particularly from the perspectives of Markov process generation and reduction.", "paper_title": "Formal techniques for performance analysis: blending SAN and PEPA", "paper_id": "WOS:000244835100002"}
