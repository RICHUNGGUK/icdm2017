However, one of the main problems with this paradigm is still the representation and manipulation of ontologies as well as the complex relationships that they implicitly represent. Actually, this remains a challenge when unskilled users have to deal with this abstract representation in order to carry out daily solving-problem activities (e.g., designing web applications based on ontologies). This probably made the Semantic Web to decrease in popularity, also being commercially unsupported and overcame by recent technologies and services based on the Web 2.0, the emerging end-user-focused web concept. All in all. the specification of Model-Based User Interfaces fits very well to both paradigms. Accordingly, the aim of this work is to provide new ways of modeling user interfaces based on semantic models that better fit the domain problem. At the same time, we think of exploiting interactive features through current and modern end-user programming elements based on the Web 2.0, finally contributing to an architecture that supports higher interactive end-user interfaces on the web.
