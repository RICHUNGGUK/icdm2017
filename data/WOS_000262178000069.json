This is common background for firms. In this regard, marketing professionals and scholars highlight the necessity for knowing and explaining consumers' behaviour patterns in an increasingly efficient way. The use of new knowledge discovery methods, able to exploit such data, may represent it relevant source of competitive advantage. In marketing. the information about most consumer variables of interest is usually obtained by means of questionnaires containing a diversity of items. It is also frequent that marketing modellers make use of unobserved variables to build the consumer models; i.e.. abstract variables that need to be measured by means of it set of observed variables or items associated with them. In these cases, the value of a certain unobserved variable cannot be assigned to a number. but to a potentially scattered set of numbers, This fact disables the application of conventional data mining techniques to extract knowledge from them. In this paper. we present it new approach that is able to deal with this kind of uncertain data by using it multiobjective genetic algorithm to derive fuzzy rules. Specifically, we propose it complete methodology that considers the different stages of knowledge discovery: data collection. data mining, and knowledge interpretation. This methodology is experimented on a consumer modelling application in interactive computer-mediated environments. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
