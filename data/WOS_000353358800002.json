The voltage mode driver with the 2-step impedance calibration loop is proposed to optimize the output impedance and voltage swing. This chip is fabricated using a 0.11 mu m CMOS process, and the die area is 0.385 mm(2). The power consumption of the transmitter is 25 mW from the supply voltage of 1.1 V. The measured RMS and peak-to-peak jitter are 4.25 and 35.24 ps in HS-G2A mode, respectively.", "paper_title": "A 1.248-2.918 Gb/s low-power transmitter for MIPI M-PHY with 2-step impedance calibration loop in 0.11 mu m CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000353358800002"}
