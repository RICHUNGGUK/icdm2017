We compare the expressive power of these two approaches. As a formal model for the implicit approach we propose the color algebra, an adaptation of the relational algebra to deal with the annotations. We show that the color algebra is relationally complete: it is equivalent to the relational algebra on the explicit annotations. Our result extends a similar completeness result established for the query algebra of the MONDRIAN annotation system, from unions of conjunctive queries to the full relational algebra. We also show that the color algebra is nonredundant: no operator can be expressed in terms of the other operators. We also present a generalization of the color algebra that is relationally complete in the presence of built-in predicates on the annotations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
