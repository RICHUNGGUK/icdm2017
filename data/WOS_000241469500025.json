To reach the leading position in the Top500 supercomputing list, IBM had to put considerable effort into coding and tuning a limited range of low-level numerical kernel routines by hand. In this paper the Vienna MAP compiler is presented, which particularly targets signal transform codes ubiquitous in compute-intensive scientific applications. Compiling F-FTW code, MAP reaches as much as 80% of the optimum performance of Blue Gene systems. In an application code MAP enabled a sustained performance of 60 Tflop/s to be reached on BlueGene/L.", "paper_title": "Compiler technology for Blue Gene systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500025"}
