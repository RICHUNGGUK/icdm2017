We review the current immune applications of the AIS approach, and propose a number of suggestions to the AIS community that can be undertaken to help move the area forward. Despite many successes of AIS techniques, there remain some open issues which have to be addressed in order to make the AIS a real-world problem solving technique.", "paper_title": "A Survey of artificial immune applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000278347500002"}
