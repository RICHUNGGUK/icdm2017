The objective of this paper is to prove that sigma(lambda) is an analytic function and for every t is an element of R, sigma(lambda) (t) = lim(n ->infinity) (Sigma(k is an element of Z) lambda(1/n)(k) sinc(t-k))(n). This result can be consider as the general sufficient condition type theorem which generalizes the Shannon Whittaker Kotel'nikov's recomposition Theorem for the \"exponential-trigonometric type maps\" which have been long time looked for applications in the chemistry world. As a consequence we obtain, as a corollary, the results from [4] which were obtained by direct approach. Important applications to the signal theory are derived too since many signals can be written in sigma(lambda) format for a proper sequence lambda.", "paper_title": "Shannon-Whittaker-Kotel'nikov's Theorem Generalized", "paper_id": "WOS:000353424200007"}
