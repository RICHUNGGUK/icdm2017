While multi-core systems, computing clouds, and other parallel processing techniques dominate current technology trends, elementary particles governed by quantum mechanics have been borrowed from the physicists' laboratory and applied to computer engineering in the efforts to solve sophisticated computing and communications problems. In this paper, we review the quantum mechanical background of quantum computing from an engineering point of view and describe the possibilities offered by quantum-assisted and quantum-based computing and communications. In addition to the currently available solutions, the corresponding challenges will also be surveyed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
