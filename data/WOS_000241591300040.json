It attempts to make not only the user QoS requirements satisfied but also Pareto-optimum under Nash equilibrium on the network provider end-to-end utility and the user end-to-end utility achieved or approached along the found route by the proposed heuristic route selection algorithm based on the bi-directional Dijkstra algorithm and the intermediate list acceleration method. Simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme has better performance.", "paper_title": "A microeconomics-based fuzzy QoS unicast routing scheme in NGI", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300040"}
