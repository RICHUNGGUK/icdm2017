This paper explores two evolutionary approaches to solve this kind of problem from a practical perspective. A test case that captures the main characteristics present in real world applications is used to design and test the performance of a PSO agent and a GA agent, which are also systematically tuned to determine the best configurations using statistical analysis. We conclude that the PSO agent provides a better fit to the nature of loosely constrained permut-CSPs, resulting in better performance. This paper focuses on the trade-off between development costs (including tuning) and the performance of both evolutionary algorithms, and aims to help practitioners choose the best algorithm and configuration for these problems.", "paper_title": "EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS TO SOLVE LOOSELY CONSTRAINED PERMUT-CSPS: A PRACTITIONERS APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000306679500022"}
