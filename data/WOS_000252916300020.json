Design/methodology/approach - The finite element modeling takes into account the piezoelectric coupling. It is used with a non linear electrical circuit. The approach leads to an accurate tool to observe the behavior of the non linear damping techniques such as synchronized switch damping. Findings - The model has been validated by comparison with Ansys (R) but the CPU time required for the model is around one hundred times shorter. Research limitations/implications - The proposed model is 1D and the assumptions to use it are not verified for all structures. Practical implications - The authors obtain a useful tool for the design of damping structures (for example to find the best localisation of the piezoelectric patches and to test electrical circuits). Originality/value - The model is used for the design and conception of damping as well as for harvesting structures.", "paper_title": "Modeling of a beam structure with piezoelectric materials: introduction to SSD techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300020"}
