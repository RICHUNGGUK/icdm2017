One of the major changes was the hierarchical structure of the presentation in the search results. The main purpose of our study was to investigate how the hierarchical presentation of interface influences the searchers' behavior in XML document retrieval. To achieve this objective we analyzed the transaction logs from this year's experiment and compared the results to those of last year's experiment. The subjects' comments on the experiment and the system were also examined. The Daffodil XML retrieval system was used and 12 test persons participated in the experiment. SPSS for Windows 12.0 was used for statistical analysis.", "paper_title": "Users interaction with the hierarchically structured presentation in XML document retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425500032"}
