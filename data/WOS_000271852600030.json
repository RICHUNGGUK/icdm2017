Different causes of packet losses Should be dealt with by different strategies. For packet losses caused by router congestion, the TCP congestion control mechanism should be invoked to slow down the transmission rate. For packet. losses due to inferior channel conditions, it is a promising direction in adapting packet sizes based on monitored channel conditions. A new network transmission framework highlighting the concept of cross-layer co-design for packet loss reduction is presented in this article. The proposed framework takes into account the correlation between the packet loss rates and the packet sizes under a given channel condition, and assigns different tasks to layers involved: physical/ MAC layer for monitoring current channel statuses, IP layer for fragmentation, transport layer for bandwidth allocation, and application layer for the selection of coding method and compression rate. Our proposed scheme can detect current channel conditions, and then dynamically and rapidly adjusts parameters in each layer to match the changing channel status. Especially, when a mobile node is conducting a handover process, the radio signals and channel conditions will change rapidly. The proposed scheme can accommodate the variations quickly and prepares adequate data for corresponding node in advance, so that we can reduce the handover delay and make seamless handover possible.", "paper_title": "A CROSS-LAYER APPROACH TO PACKET SIZE ADAPTATION FOR IMPROVED UTILIZATION IN MOBILE WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271852600030"}
