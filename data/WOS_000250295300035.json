Three parameters for controlling the load-balancing activity of a node were used. The system was tested in different distributed systems, including different processing and communication speeds as well as network structures. Our experimental results showed that the system demonstrated an effective learning capability in balancing load among different processing nodes. It also showed that each of these three parameters played an important role in contributing to load-balancing, and that the system performance increased upon increasing the number of parameter changes simultaneously. The contribution made by evolutionary learning was significant as the variety of node processing speeds increased.
