The ant clustering filtering algorithm includes two clustering steps: the first step is called rough ant clustering, which involves the stochastic selection of each ant and its state local adjustment according to the current likelihood function and posterior intensity, respectively; while the second is called fine ant clustering, which employs these ants to extract the multiple-target state. Numerical simulations verify the tracking multiple-target capability of our proposed algorithm through performance comparison with the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
