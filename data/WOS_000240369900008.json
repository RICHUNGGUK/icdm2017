The hydrodynamic radius R-h was calculated and compared with the radius of gyration R-g for a series of fractal aggregates to get an insight in to the role of the aggregate size and fractal dimension. We show that R similar to N-f(1/D) and R-h/R-g = (D-f). In addition, a new characteristic radius R-beta has emerged from a scaling of numerical results. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
