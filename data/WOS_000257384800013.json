But the \"pure\" physically based representation of hair (and other animation elements) is not the only concern of the animators, who want to \"control\" the creation and animation phases of the content. This paper describes a sketch-based tool, with which a user can both create hair models with different styling parameters and produce animations of these created hair models using physically and key frame-based techniques. The model creation and animation production tasks are all performed with direct manipulation techniques in real-time.", "paper_title": "3D Hair sketching for real-time dynamic & key frame animations", "paper_id": "WOS:000257384800013"}
