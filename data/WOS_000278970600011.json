In this paper, we propose a joint dense motion/disparity estimation algorithm, designed to replace the classical temporal/inter-view unit within MVC, which uses a block-based motion/disparity estimation. The motion vector fields and the disparity vector fields are therefore simultaneously derived using the stereo-motion consistency constraint in a set theoretic convex optimization framework. The obtained displacement vector fields are then jointly segmented by minimizing a rate-distortion cost function, in line with the multiple reference frame strategy used in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method compared to the separated dense estimation scheme Or the block-based estimation technique. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
