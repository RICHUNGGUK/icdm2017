Four assessment factors influencing urban water hazard are selected; the ranges of risk levels are calculated according to the Pearson-III frequency curve and the comprehensive cloud model of all risk levels belonging to assessment factors are generated. Historical data of assessment factors are simulated and forecasted by RBF artificial neural network; distribution curves of certainty degrees of risk levels are drawn, which indicate the final water hazard risk. Comparative researches with ARIMA and fuzzy decision-making set showed RBF-ANN-Cloud's suitability and effectiveness in water hazard risk assessment. RBF- Cloud model provides a new way of forecast and assessment of urban water hazard.", "paper_title": "A risk assessment method based on RBF artificial neural network - cloud model for urban water hazard", "paper_id": "WOS:000343806200024"}
