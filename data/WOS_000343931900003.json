This property means appearance of a noiseless (perfectly reversible) subchannel in the tensor square of a channel having no noiseless subchannels. Then we describe a quantum channel with an arbitrary given level of symmetric superactivation (including the infinite value). We also show that superactivation of one-shot quantum zero-error capacity of a channel can be reformulated in terms of quantum measurement theory as appearance of an indistinguishable subspace for the tensor product of two observables having no indistinguishable subspaces.", "paper_title": "On Superactivation of One-Shot Quantum Zero-Error Capacity and the Related Property of Quantum Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000343931900003"}
