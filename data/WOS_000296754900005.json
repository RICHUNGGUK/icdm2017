As the various attack models, we need trust routing scheme to guarantee the security and trust for the network. So trust routing scheme is the main issue in security mobile ad hoc network. As the cooperation character of the network, trust routing is related to node behaviours. A novel trust routing scheme based on node behaviour evaluation is proposed to enhance security of the network. The definition of trust routing is proposed in the paper. Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol is used to validate trust routing scheme, Route Reply (RREP) Message is extended to record node behaviour.Ns-2 simulator is used to simulate the trust scheme under different node behaviours and experiment scenarios. Simulation results show that trust routing scheme can improve the security and performance of network effectively.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL TRUST ROUTING SCHEME BASED ON NODE BEHAVIOUR EVALUATION FOR MOBILE AD HOC NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296754900005"}
