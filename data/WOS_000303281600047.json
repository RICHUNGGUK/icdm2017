The determination of proper molding conditions, such as molding temperatures and length of time on the basis of cup sizes and styles, is crucial in achieving the required cup shape with high stability, which is regarded as the most challenging part of the molded bra making process. To determine the optimal process parameter settings, numerous process trials are generally required to evaluate the molding variables and their interactions. This study proposes a novel systematic methodology to identify the optimal molding process parameters based on design of experiment (DOE) and a parameterization-based remesh method to evaluate the 3D shape conformity of molded cups. By solving the regression equation obtained from a Box-Behnken design (BBD) and analyzing the response surface plots, the results prove that molding temperature has greater influence than the length of the dwell time on the 3D shape conformity of molded cups. The optimal molding conditions can be determined for the cup depths of different sized mold heads, which are validated by the experimental results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
