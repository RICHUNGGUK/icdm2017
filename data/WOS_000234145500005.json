First, texts are indexed and prepared to be processed by frequent itemset levelwise search. Association rules are then extracted and interpreted, with respect to a set of quality measures and domain knowledge, under the control of an analyst. The article includes an experimentation on a real-world text corpus holding on molecular biology.", "paper_title": "Towards a text mining methodology using association rule extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000234145500005"}
