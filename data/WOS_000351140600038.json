The differently implicational principles are improved from variable and generalized viewpoint. Furthermore, focusing on the FMP (fuzzy modus ponens) problem, unified forms of the new algorithm are obtained for R-implications and S-implications. Following that, the optimal differently implicational solutions are achieved for several specific R-implications and S-implications. Lastly, the new algorithm makes the current differently implicational algorithms compose a united whole.", "paper_title": "Variable differently implicational algorithm of fuzzy inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000351140600038"}
