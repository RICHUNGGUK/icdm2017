Using the complete design in this procedure gives a t-wise uniform set of permutations on n objects whose size is at most t(2n), the first non-trivial construction of an infinite family of t-wise uniform sets for t4. If a non-trivial design with suitable parameters is found, it will imply a corresponding improvement in the construction. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
