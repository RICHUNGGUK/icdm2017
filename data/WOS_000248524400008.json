That background consists of. (a) an overview of the state of the art of representing or processing narratives within artificial intelligence, (b) the narrative of the succession war in the Mughal empire, which led to the reign of Aurangzeb, (c) the basics of our method of representation, (d) a survey of topics relevant to the latter, and in particular, of computational work on argumentation. In the present Part 11, we propose a formalism which captures how Aurangzeb managed to deceive and capture his brother Murad, who had been his ally in the succession war. Steps toward achieving Aurangzeb's goal of capturing him included: attracting Murad into Aurangzeb's camp, reducing his alertness by making him drink, having him sleep in a tent inside the camp, attracting Murad's bodyguard outside that tent and overpowering him, and then removing Murad's own weapons and binding Murad's feet in golden fetters. A formal representation for legal or other narratives as previously introduced by the present author [16-21,23] is augmented and integrated with a representation for arguments, and applied to the setting into formulae of the particular historical episode. Cognitive states are paramount, and so are perception and communications, as well as authority relations between characters.", "paper_title": "Goals, arguments, and deception: A formal representation from the Aurangzeb project.
