Erdos and L. Lovasz concerning simple hypergraphs. Let m*(n, r) denote the minimum number of edges in an n-uniform simple hypergraph with chromatic number at least r + 1. The main result of the work is a new asymptotic lower bound for m*(n, r). We prove that for large n and r satisfying r <= n(1/9) the following inequality holds m* (n + 1, r) >= 1/2 r(2n-2)n(-6/t), where t = left perpendicular root min (lnn/lnr, lnn/2ln((4/3)lnn)right perpendicular. This bound improves previously known bounds for r < n(1/36). The proof is based on a method of random coloring. We have also obtained results concerning colorings of h-simple hypergraphs.
