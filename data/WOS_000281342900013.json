We present a class of features that are robust to the tilt of the attached sensor module and a state transition model suitable for HMM-based activity recognition. In addition, postprocessing techniques are applied to stabilize the recognition results. The proposed approach shows significant improvements in recognition experiments over a variety of human activity DB.", "paper_title": "Implementation of HMM-Based Human Activity Recognition Using Single Triaxial Accelerometer", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342900013"}
