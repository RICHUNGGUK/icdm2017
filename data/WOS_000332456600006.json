They can be characterized through some particular elements called minutiae. The identification of a given fingerprint requires the matching of its minutiae against the minutiae of other fingerprints. Hence, fingerprint matching is a key process. The efficiency of current matching algorithms does not allow their use in large fingerprint databases; to apply them, a breakthrough in running performance is necessary. Nowadays, the minutia cylinder-code (MCC) is the best performing algorithm in terms of accuracy. However, a weak point of this algorithm is its computational requirements. In this paper, we present a GPU fingerprint matching system based on MCC. The many-core computing framework provided by CUDA on NVIDIA Tesla and GeForce hardware platforms offers an opportunity to enhance fingerprint matching. Through a thorough and careful data structure, computation and memory transfer design, we have developed a system that keeps its accuracy and reaches a speed-up up to 100.8x compared with a reference sequential CPU implementation. A rigorous empirical study over captured and synthetic fingerprint databases shows the efficiency of our proposal. These results open up a whole new field of possibilities for reliable real time fingerprint identification in large databases.", "paper_title": "A High Performance Fingerprint Matching System for Large Databases Based on GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000332456600006"}
