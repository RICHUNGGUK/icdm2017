It is an open application which uses a database in ASCII format. The principal elements of this database are lists of whole numbers structured according to indexed colors in standard RGB format. This generates a rational system of indexes of numerical lists, which allows us to transmit knowledge in the different areas, which use images in their processes, with application in textile design, engineering graphics, mathematical transformations or indexation logic, among others.
