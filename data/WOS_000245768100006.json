Recently, there has been an interest in soft-decision decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, incorporating reliability information from the channel into the decoding process. The Koetter-Vardy algorithm is a soft-decision decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon codes which can provide several dB of gain over traditional hard-decision decoders. The algorithm consists of a soft-decision front end to the interpolation-based Guruswami-Sudan list decoder. The main computational task in the algorithm is a weighted interpolation of a bivariate polynomial. We propose a parallel architecture for the hardware implementation of bivariate interpolation for soft-decision decoding. The key feature is the embedding of both a binary tree and a linear array into a 2-D array processor, enabling fast polynomial evaluation operations. An field-programmable gate array interpolation processor was implemented and demonstrated at a clock frequency of 23 MHz, corresponding to decoding rates of 10-15 Mb/s.", "paper_title": "Architecture and implementation of an interpolation processor for soft-decision Reed-Solomon decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000245768100006"}
