However, it is obvious that these approaches are not always possible because the evaluation of the performance in classification problems is mostly based on the data distribution and learning methods; therefore this paper suggests a new approach to simultaneously deal with finding optimal regularization parameter and solution in classification and regression problems by introducing dynamically rescheduled momentum with modified SVM in kernel space.", "paper_title": "A new approach for finding an optimal solution and regularization by learning dynamic momentum", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000004"}
