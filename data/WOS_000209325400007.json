In the field of cellular technology, we can track the location of a mobile phone user by locating the cell connected with his/her mobile phone. When a mobile user moves from one location to another, we can track his/ her mobile device connecting from one cell to another cell. This work focuses on mining patterns from mobile user movement data. Two new algorithms are proposed, namely: location link and user link pattern mining algorithms. Both proposed algorithms are able to mine a pattern from another pattern instead of mining a pattern directly from a data source. Therefore, the pattern will be more concise and the processing time of both algorithms will be faster. Both algorithms have been evaluated from two perspectives: pattern mining generation and time processing. The experiment results from the processing time aspect indicate that larger datasets and lower values of user-defined thresholds lead to a longer processing time for both algorithms. Furthermore, the processing time of both proposed algorithms are dominated by the preparation process.", "paper_title": "Pattern mining from movement of mobile users", "paper_id": "WOS:000209325400007"}
