The tangent splash of is defined to be the set of points on that lie on a line of . This article investigates properties of the tangent splash. We show that all tangent splashes are projectively equivalent, investigate sublines contained in a tangent splash, and consider the structure of a tangent splash in the Bruck-Bose representation of in . We show that a tangent splash of is a -linear set of rank 3 and size ; this allows us to use results about linear sets from Lavrauw and Van de Voorde (Des.
