We propose to use a multi-classifier where each classifier, an AdaBoost of feed-forward back-propagation network, is trained using a single Sub-Window of the whole image, the classifiers are finally combined using the \"Sum Rule\". Only the best matchers, selected by running the Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS), are exploited in the fusion step. In our opinion our method (based on local AdaBoost) partially solves the problem of redundancy among global AdaBoost selected features, with a manageable computational requirement. Finally, we propose a systematic framework for fusing 2D and 3D face recognition systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
