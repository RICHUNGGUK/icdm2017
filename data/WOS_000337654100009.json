This paper presents a new data assimilation framework that enables the many Open Model Interface (OpenMI) 2.0.NET compliant hydrological models already available, access to a robust data assimilation library. OpenMI is an open standard that allows models to exchange data during runtime, thus transforming a complex numerical model to a 'plug and play' like component. OpenDA is an open interface standard for a set of tools, filters, and numerical techniques to quickly implement data assimilation. The OpenDA OpenMI framework is presented and tested on a synthetic case that highlights the potential of this new framework. MIKE SHE, a distributed and integrated hydrological model is used to assimilate hydraulic head in a catchment in Denmark. The simulated head over the entire domain were significantly improved by using an ensemble based Kalman filter. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
