Firstly, a five-layer network model is introduced, in which a perfect solution can always be achieved. Then, a network topology which belongs to the five-layer network model will be established from the given sensor networks so that the receivers can receive data at a higher rate without introducing excessive additional transmissions, which improves the energy efficiency as a result. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in a simulated instance, and the result shows that 9% of transmission overhead can be saved compared with traditional scheme.", "paper_title": "Network-Coding-Based Energy-Efficient Data Fusion and Transmission for Wireless Sensor Networks with Heterogeneous Receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000333839000001"}
