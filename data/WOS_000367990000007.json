This work presents a novel methodology to optimise KLT designs on FPGAs that outperform typical design methodologies, through a prior characterisation of the arithmetic units in the datapath of the circuit under various operating conditions. Limited by the ever-increasing process variation, the delay models available in synthesis tools are no longer suitable for extreme performance optimisation of designs, and as they are generic, they need to consider the worst-case performance for a given fabrication process. Hence, they heavily penalise the maximum possible achieved performance of a design by leaving safety margin. This work presents a novel unified optimisation framework which contemplates a prior characterisation of the embedded multipliers on the target FPGA device under process, voltage, and temperature variation. The proposed framework allows a design space exploration leading to designs without any latency overheads that achieve high throughput while producing less errors than typical methodologies, operating with the same throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms the typical implementation in three real-life design strategies: high performance, low power, and temperature variation; and it produced circuit designs that performed up to 18dB better when over-clocked.", "paper_title": "ARC 2014 Over-Clocking KLT Designs on FPGAs under Process, Voltage, and Temperature Variation", "paper_id": "WOS:000367990000007"}
