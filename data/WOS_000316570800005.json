Although clustering has long been realized as central to the discovery of gene functions and disease diagnostic, researchers have found the construction of good algorithms a surprisingly difficult task. In this paper, we address this problem by using a component-based approach for clustering algorithm design, for class retrieval from microarray data. The idea is to break up existing algorithms into independent building blocks for typical sub-problems, which are in turn reassembled in new ways to generate yet unexplored methods. As a test, 432 algorithms were generated and evaluated on published microarray data sets. We found their top performers to be better than the original, component-providing ancestors and also competitive with a set of new algorithms recently proposed. Finally, we identified components that showed consistently good performance for clustering microarray data and that should be considered in further development of clustering algorithms.", "paper_title": "Finding best algorithmic components for clustering microarray data", "paper_id": "WOS:000316570800005"}
