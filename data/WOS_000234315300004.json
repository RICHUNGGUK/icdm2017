The truncation error is estimated by restricting the solution obtained on a given grid to a coarser grid and calculating the image of the discrete Navier-Stokes operator of the coarse grid on the restricted velocity and pressure field. The proposed methodology is not a new concept but its application to colocated finite volume discretizations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is made possible by the introduction of a variant of the momentum interpolation technique for mass fluxes where the pressure part of the mass fluxes is not dependent on the coefficients of the linearized momentum equations. The theory presented is supported by a number of numerical experiments. The methodology is developed for two-dimensional flows, but extension to three-dimensional cases should not pose problems.
