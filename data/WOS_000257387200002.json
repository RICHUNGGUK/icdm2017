In this paper, a comprehensive study on the methods for determining dicing plans for MPW was carried out. Dicing plans can be used to determine the number of MPWs needed to be fabricated before chip fabrication and employed to saw the wafers after fabrication. Several methods based on integer linear programming formulation and a heuristic based on simulated annealing was proposed. Through conducting experiments with industrial test cases, these proposed methods can achieve up to 50% wafer reduction in some cases and on average 18% and 38% reduction for low- and high- volume production, respectively. This study makes a contribution to MPW dicing and is also instrumental in developing better reticlefloorplanning methods.", "paper_title": "Finding dicing plans for multiple project wafers fabricated with shuttle mask", "paper_id": "WOS:000257387200002"}
