Our extractor, for a given point P on E, outputs the first F(2)l-coefficient of the abscissa of the point P. We also propose a deterministic extractor for the main subgroup G of E, where E has minimal 2-torsion. We show that if a point P is chosen uniformly at random in G, the bits extracted from the point P are indistinguishable from a uniformly random bit-string of length l.", "paper_title": "Extractors for binary elliptic curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000258933600014"}
