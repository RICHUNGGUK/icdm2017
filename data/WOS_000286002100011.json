The majority of these mobile tourist guides are to be used via a constant network connection and some as proprietary standalone mobile applications installed on-device. Some are solely navigational assistants using positioning technologies for large cities offering exploratory services and others are used indoors, for example as museum guides. This research paper attempts to categorize these mobile guides using a detailed set of evaluation criteria in order to extract design principles which can be used by application designers and developers.", "paper_title": "Electronic mobile guides: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000286002100011"}
