As a case study we consider the ecological problem of stability of European water frog populations. The paper shows that MPP systems allow easy and concise modelling of real ecological problems. Moreover, MPP systems models can be easily simulated and translated into the PRISM input language to enable statistical model checking of properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
