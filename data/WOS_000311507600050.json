Positioning techniques and technologies have become available and affordable to incorporate more deeply into workshop operations. We present our 2-year effort into developing a general framework in location and manufacturing applications. We demonstrate the features of the proposed applications using a case study, a synthetic flexible manufacturing environment, with product-driven policy, which enables the generation of a location data stream of product trajectories over the whole plant. These location data are mined and processed to reproduce the manufacturing system dynamics in an adaptive simulation scheme. This article proposes an original method for the generation of simulation models in discrete event systems. This method uses the product location data in the running system. The data stream of points (product ID, location, and time) is the starting point for the algorithm to generate a queuing network simulation model.", "paper_title": "Generation of an adaptive simulation driven by product trajectories", "paper_id": "WOS:000311507600050"}
