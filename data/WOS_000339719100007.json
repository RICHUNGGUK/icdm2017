The response latency has been explored and estimation methods proposed mostly for excitatory stimuli, which means that the neuron reacts to the stimulus by an increase in the firing rate. We focus on the estimation of the response latency in the case of inhibitory stimuli. Models used in this paper represent two different descriptions of response latency. We consider either the latency to be constant across trials or to be a random variable. In the case of random latency, special attention is given to models with selective interaction. The aim is to propose methods for estimation of the latency or the parameters of its distribution. Parameters are estimated by four different methods: method of moments, maximum-likelihood method, a method comparing an empirical and a theoretical cumulative distribution function and a method based on the Laplace transform of a probability density function. All four methods are applied on simulated data and compared.", "paper_title": "Estimating latency from inhibitory input", "paper_id": "WOS:000339719100007"}
