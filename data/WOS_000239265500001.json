The velocity distributions for different flow conditions and geometric configurations are presented. By examination of the contours for the velocity magnitude, the size of the impingement zone is measured out for the first time. It is found that both the inlet jet Reynolds number and the geometry of the system have effects on the size of the impingement zone. Simulation results demonstrated that LBM is a potentially reliable computational tool for simulations of impinging streams.", "paper_title": "Simulation of laminar confined impinging streams using lattice Boltzmann method", "paper_id": "WOS:000239265500001"}
