Meanwhile, considerable findings on visual features of decision making have been derived from cognitive researches over past few years. A promising method of decision prediction in EB-HCI systems is presented in this article, which is inspired by the looking behavior when a user makes a decision. As two features of visual decision making, gaze bias and pupil dilation are considered into judging intensions. This method combines the history of eye movements to a given interface and the visual traits of users. Hence, it improves the prediction performance in a more natural and objective way. We apply the method to an either-or choice making task on the commercial Web pages to test its effectiveness. Although the result shows a good performance only of gaze bias but not of pupil dilation to predict a decision, it proves that hiring the visual traits of users is an effective approach to improve the performance of automatic triggering in EB-HCI systems.", "paper_title": "Decision Prediction Using Visual Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000325745600038"}
