Math. Comput. Chem. 70 (2013) 317-330] introduced stable traces as the appropriate mathematical description, yet we find them deficient in modeling graphs with either very small (<= 2) or large (>= 6) degree vertices. We introduce strong traces which remedy both of the above mentioned drawbacks. We show that every connected graph admits a strong trace by studying a connection between strong traces and graph embeddings. Further we also characterize graphs which admit parallel (resp. antiparallel) strong traces.", "paper_title": "Strong Traces Model of Self-Assembly Polypeptide Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000331779000014"}
