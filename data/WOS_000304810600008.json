The discrete dispersion relation is free of spurious solutions and approximates the continuous dispersion relation for well-resolved wavelengths and frequencies (k Delta << pi, omega Delta(t) << pi). For a specific choice of parameters, the discrete dispersion relation approximates the continuous dispersion relation for all wavelengths and frequencies up to the Nyquist limit. A few examples, amongst them one involving mode conversion, illustrate the new method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
