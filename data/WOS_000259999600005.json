Unlike other conventional reconstruction methods, the unknown pixel values are not estimated based on their local surrounding neighbourhood, but on the whole image. In particular, we exploit the multiple occurrence of characters in the scanned document. In order to take advantage of this repetitive behaviour, we divide the image into character segments and match similar character segments to filter relevant information before the reconstruction. A great advantage of our proposed approach over conventional approaches is that we have more information at our disposal, which leads to a better reconstruction of the high-resolution (HR) image. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method, which is expressed in a better optical character recognition (OCR) accuracy and visual superiority to other traditional interpolation and restoration methods.", "paper_title": "Robust reconstruction of low-resolution document images by exploiting repetitive character behaviour", "paper_id": "WOS:000259999600005"}
