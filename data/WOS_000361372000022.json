Based on the design of secure watermarking signal, this paper proposes a robust video information hiding solution for protecting fingerprint content. In our proposed method, construction of fingerprint watermarking signal from the compressed sensing (CS) measurements relies on the knowledge of the measurement matrix used for sensing, in which generation of the CS matrix can offer a natural method for the secret key. The key has the inherent advantage that encryption of the watermarking signal occurs implicitly in the sensing process, and does not require additional computation. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed secure watermarking signal can possess the better robustness in the video watermark application, and can reconstruct highly the original fingerprint image.", "paper_title": "On the Security and Robustness with Fingerprint Watermarking Signal via Compressed Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000361372000022"}
