The achievements in, for example, evolution are everywhere to be seen: complexity, resilience, inventive solutions and beauty. Evolvable Hardware (EH) is a field of evolutionary computation (EC) that focuses on the embodiment of evolution in a physical media. If EH could achieve even a small step in natural evolution's achievements, it would be a significant step for hardware designers. Before the field of EH began, EC had already shown artificial evolution to be a highly competitive problem solver. EH thus started off as a new and exciting field with much promise. It seemed only a matter of time before researchers would find ways to convert such techniques into hardware problem solvers and further refine the techniques to achieve systems that were competitive with or better than human designs. However, 15 years on-it appears that problems solved by EH are only of the size and complexity of that achievable in EC 15 years ago and seldom compete with traditional designs. A critical review of the field is presented. Whilst highlighting some of the successes, it also considers why the field is far from reaching these goals. The paper further redefines the field and speculates where the field should go in the next 10 years.", "paper_title": "Challenges of evolvable hardware: past, present and the path to a promising future", "paper_id": "WOS:000292814000002"}
