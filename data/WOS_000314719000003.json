High latency causes the system's feedback to lag behind user actions and thus significantly degrades the interactivity of the user experience. This paper presents algorithms for reducing latency when recognizing actions. We use a latency-aware learning formulation to train a logistic regression-based classifier that automatically determines distinctive canonical poses from data and uses these to robustly recognize actions in the presence of ambiguous poses. We introduce a novel (publicly released) dataset for the purpose of our experiments. Comparisons of our method against both a Bag of Words and a Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifier show improved recognition performance for both pre-segmented and online classification tasks. Additionally, we employ GentleBoost to reduce our feature set and further improve our results. We then present experiments that explore the accuracy/latency trade-off over a varying number of actions. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on two existing datasets.", "paper_title": "Exploring the Trade-off Between Accuracy and Observational Latency in Action Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000314719000003"}
