Recently, it has been shown that the Max Weight algorithm, which is throughput-optimal in networks with a fixed number of users, fails to achieve the maximum throughput in the presence of flow-level dynamics. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called Workload-based Scheduling with Learning, which is provably throughput-optimal, requires no prior knowledge of channels and user demands, and performs significantly better than previously suggested algorithms.", "paper_title": "Throughput-Optimal Opportunistic Scheduling in the Presence of Flow-Level Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000294007700010"}
