Our aim is to determine the cooperation strategies among the primary and secondary systems so as to maximize the sum-rate of SUs while maintaining quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of PUs. We formulate a joint optimization problem of PU transmission mode selection, SU (or relay) selection, subcarrier assignment, power control, and time allocation. By applying dual method, this mixed integer programming problem is decomposed into parallel per-subcarrier subproblems, with each determining the cooperation strategy between one PU and one SU. We show that, on each leased subcarrier, the optimal strategy is to let a SU exclusively act as a relay or transmit for itself. This result is fundamentally different from the conventional spectrum leasing in single-channel systems where a SU must transmit a fraction of time for itself if it helps the PU's transmission. We then propose a subgradient-based algorithm to find the asymptotically optimal solution to the primal problem in polynomial time. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance the network performance.", "paper_title": "Spectrum Leasing and Cooperative Resource Allocation in Cognitive OFDMA Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316038800013"}
