DGR constructs an application-specific number of multiple disjointed paths for a VN to transmit parallel FEC-protected H.26L real-time video streams over a bandwidth-limited, unreliable networking environment. The multiple paths in DGR facilitate load balancing, bandwidth aggregation, and fast packet delivery. Extensive simulation experiments over randomly generated WSNs show that DGR has the following advantages: (i) lower delay, (ii) substantially longer network lifetime, and (iii) a better received video quality. In particular, DGR improves the average video peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to 3dB, compared to a traditional geographic routing scheme. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
