The Generalized Cases I-III constructions for 4(q)-QAM (q >= 1) GCSs were additionally proposed by Li. In this paper, the Generalized Case IV and Generalized Case V constructions for 4(q)-QAM (q >= 3) GCSs are proposed using selected Gaussian integer pairs, each of which contains two distinct Gaussian integers with identical magnitude and which are not conjugate with each other.", "paper_title": "New Constructions of General QAM Golay Complementary Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000325981100044"}
