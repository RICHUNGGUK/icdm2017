However, p-cycle provisioning for dynamic traffic has not been fully addressed. Most related works have not considered link capacity in the construction of p-cycles, which may cause problems in practice because the protection paths may not have enough backup bandwidth. In this paper, with the consideration of link capacity, we present a sufficient and necessary condition that guarantees p-cycles for providing enough protection bandwidth. Based on this condition, we propose an effective solution to provide connections for dynamic requests with the property that each link used for a connection is protected by a p-cycle. Simulation results show that our dynamic p-cycle provisioning solution outperforms the traditional path protection scheme.
