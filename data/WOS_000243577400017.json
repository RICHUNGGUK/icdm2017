Free energy is directly correlated to the thermodynamic affinity constant, and, as a first step in druglikeness, a lead compound must have this constant in the range of micro- to nanomolar activity. Many efforts have been made to calculate it by rigorous computational approaches, such as free energy perturbation or linear response approximation. However, these methods are still computationally expensive. We focus our work on XIAP, an antiapoptotic protein whose inhibition can lead to new drugs against cancer disease. We report here a comparative evaluation of two completely different methodologies to estimate binding free energy, MMPBSA (a force field based function) and XSCORE (an empirical scoring function), in seven XIAP-peptide complexes using a representative set of structures generated by previous molecular dynamics simulations. Both methods are able to predict the experimental binding free energy with acceptable errors, but if one needs to identify slight differences upon binding, MMPBSA performs better, although XSCORE is not a bad choice taking into account the low computational cost of this method.", "paper_title": "Comparative evaluation of MMPBSA and XSCORE to compute binding free energy in XIAP-peptide complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000243577400017"}
