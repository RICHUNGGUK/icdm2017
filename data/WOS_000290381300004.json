However, when the shape aspect ratio is changed or the mirror reflection of the object is considered for retrieval, some of these measures are not effectively useful. In consideration of the aforesaid issues, a Fourier descriptor based 'aspect ratio' and 'mirror reflection' invariant shape matching algorithm is presented here. This algorithm is also RST invariant.
