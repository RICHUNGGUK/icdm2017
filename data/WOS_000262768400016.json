The proposed 0-1 integer programming model has three objectives with fuzzy constraints, and NSGA-II is applied to solve the optimization model with a small modification of the constraint-handling rule. A simulation experiment illustrating the application of the proposed model is presented and Pareto-optimal solutions are obtained through a modified NSGA-II algorithm. A comparison among NSGA-II, PSO, and DE shows that modified NSGA-II has some advantages over PSO and DE. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
