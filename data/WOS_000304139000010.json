However, to match the 3D model feature points with the corresponding pixels in a texture image, surface parameterization must satisfy specific positional constraints. However, despite numerous research efforts, the construction of a mathematically robust, foldover-free parameterization that is subject to positional constraints continues to be a challenge. In the present paper, this foldover problem is addressed by developing radial basis function (RBF)-based reparameterization. Given initial 2D embedding of a 3D surface, the proposed method can reparameterize 2D embedding into a foldover-free 2D mesh, satisfying a set of user-specified constraint points. In addition, this approach is mesh free. Therefore, generating smooth texture mapping results is possible without extra smoothing optimization.", "paper_title": "An RBF-Based Reparameterization Method for Constrained Texture Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000304139000010"}
