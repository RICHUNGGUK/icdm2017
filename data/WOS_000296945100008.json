The extended model describes the drug activity and delivery of the pharmacologically active form to the DNA target as well as the catalysis of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme and the elimination of drug from the cytoplasm via the efflux pump. Verification of the proposed model is achieved using scanning-laser microscopy data from live human breast cancer cells. Before estimating the unknown model parameters from the experimental in vitro data it is essential to determine parameter uniqueness (or otherwise) from this imposed output structure. This is formally performed as a structural identifiability analysis, which demonstrates that all of the unknown model parameters are uniquely determined by the output structure corresponding to the experiment.
