However, since the generalization error is inaccessible in practice, the model parameters are usually determined so that an estimator of the generalization error is minimized. The regularized subspace information criterion (RSIC) is such a generalization error estimator for model selection. RSIC includes an additional regularization parameter and it should be determined appropriately for better model selection. A meta-criterion for determining the regularization parameter has also been proposed and shown to be useful in practice. In this paper, we show that there are several drawbacks in the existing meta-criterion and give an alternative meta-criterion that can solve the problems. Through simulations, we show that the use of the: new meta-criterion further improves the model selection performance.", "paper_title": "A new meta-criterion for regularized subspace information criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000251226900006"}
