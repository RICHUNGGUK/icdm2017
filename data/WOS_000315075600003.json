In this paper, based on the Issue-based Information System (IBIS) model, a new ontology-based semantic representation model for DR information; the integrated issue, solution, artifact and argument (ISAA) model; is proposed. The ISAA model introduces the ontology-based semantic representation mode to the DR representation and expands the concept elements of IBIS. The class of concept elements and the semantic relationships among them are defined by Web Ontology Language (OWL). The axioms and rules which are used to reason and analyze DR are defined and encoded with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), which enrich the semantic relations defined by OWL The ISAA model represents the directed graph of IBIS to the Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph and serializes to an RDF/XML document which lays the foundation for retrieving and reasoning semantic information of DR. A semantic annotator integrating with the visual product design model was developed, by which the discrete information of thinking is captured and abstracted to a conceptual representation of the ISAA model. Finally, an example of DR representation for the spring operating mechanism of a high-voltage circuit breaker product is given. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
