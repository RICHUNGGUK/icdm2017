To accommodate rapid and volatile wind power variations, dynamic security assessment (DSA) against foreseeable disturbances is required to be carried out online and provide security monitoring results within sufficiently small time frame. Based on soft computing (SC) technologies, this paper develops an intelligent framework for real-time DSA of power systems with large penetration of wind power. It consists of a DSA engine whose role is to perform real-time DSA of the power system, a wind power and load demand (W&LF) forecasting engine for offline and online predicting wind power generation and electricity load demand, a database generation (DBG) engine for generating instances to train the DSA engine, and a model updating (MU) engine for online updating the DSA engine. Case studies are conducted on two benchmark systems where high DSA efficiency and accuracy are obtained. This framework can be an ideal candidate for advanced security monitoring in the future SmartGrid control centres.", "paper_title": "An Intelligent Dynamic Security Assessment Framework for Power Systems With Wind Power", "paper_id": "WOS:000310388400027"}
