We show that on the basis of most of these models there is a system of functional equations such that, in many cases, the origin of impossibility results in a social choice model is the non-existence of a solution for the corresponding system. Among I he functional equations considered, we pay a particular attention to general means and associativity, proving that the existence of an associative bivariate mean is equivalent to the existence of a semilatticial partial order. This key result allows us to explain how the knowledge of associative bivariate means can be used to solve social choice paradoxes. In our analysis we deal both W Oh crisp and fuzzy settings.", "paper_title": "AGGREGATION OF PREFERENCES IN CRISP AND FUZZY SETTINGS: FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS LEADING TO POSSIBILITY RESULTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289201400007"}
