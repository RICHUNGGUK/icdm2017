Here, the particle transport method for a convection-reaction problem is combined with an Eulerian finite-element method for diffusion in the framework of the operator-splitting approach. The technique possesses a special spatial adaptivity to resolve solution singularities possible due to convection and reaction terms. A monotone projection technique is used to transfer the solution of the convection-reaction subproblem from a moving set of particles onto a fixed grid to initialize the diffusion subproblem. The proposed approach exhibits good mass conservation and works with structured and unstructured meshes. The performance of the presented algorithm is tested on one- and two-dimensional benchmark problems. The numerical results confirm that the method demonstrates good accuracy for the convection-dominated as well as for convection-diffusion problems.
