The agent's intentions are a consistent set of desires that are achievable together. This paper proposes the first argumentation system for PR that computes in one step the possible intentions of an agent, avoiding thus the drawbacks of the existing systems. The proposed system is grounded on a recent work on constrained argumentation systems, and satisfies the rationality postulates identified in argumentation literature, namely the consistency and the completeness of the results.
