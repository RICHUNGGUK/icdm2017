In recent years, interoperability has been improved at the technological level by the introduction of service-oriented architectures and web-service technology and at the semantic level by the creation of ontologies and the use of semantic technologies. Yet, at a pragmatic level, many research questions remain unanswered. In this paper the authors introduce the concept of service portfolios, a pragmatic web instrument used to support the composition and reconfiguration of manufacturing chains. A service portfolio contains an overview of the services provided by the organisations in a business network that can potentially be used to create a supply chain. Stakeholders can use a service portfolio for communication and synchronisation of meaning among stakeholders and make decisions. The concept of service portfolios is illustrated on the basis of a computer manufacturing case study, indicating that a service portfolio can improve the agility of a business network and speed up the formation of supply chains at lower costs, as it enables the rapid composition of supply chain processes from reusable components.", "paper_title": "Service portfolios for supply chain composition: Creating business network interoperability and agility", "paper_id": "WOS:000281856000006"}
