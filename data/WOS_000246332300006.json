The synthesized feature signals hold the shape information with minimum loss by excluding simply the translation dependent and noise-contaminated bands. The SAIF is shown excellent in the invariance property and representative in describing the original shape for automated recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that automated shape recognition based on the SAIF achieves high correctness and significantly outperforms those using conventional wavelet affine invariant functions.
