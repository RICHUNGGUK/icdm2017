We show that the problem is computationally hard by reducing it to a special case of the three-index assignment problem. On the positive side, we show that the size of instances in practice is such that a state-of-the-art integer programming solver is able to find globally optimal solutions in little computing time.", "paper_title": "On the Computational Complexity of Peer-to-Peer Satellite Refueling Strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000307133400004"}
