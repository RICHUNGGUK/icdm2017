To solve this problem, we develop an adaptive energy-saving scheme or DCAPS in parallel disk systems. We show that adaptability in energy conservation can be achieved through the integration of a dynamic disk scheduling scheme and power management in parallel disk systems. DCAPS consists of a data partitioning mechanism, a response time estimator, and an adaptive energy-conserving mechanism. The Data partitioning mechanism allows DCAPS to adjust the parallelism degrees of write requests based on dynamic workload conditions. Apart from supporting the data partitioning mechanism, the response time estimator makes it possible for the adaptive energy-conserving mechanism to dynamically adjust voltage supply levels while guaranteeing desired response times. We conducted extensive experiments to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed energy-conserving strategy. Experimental results consistently show that DCAPS significantly reduces energy consumption of parallel disk systems in a dynamic environment over the same disk systems without using DCAPS.
