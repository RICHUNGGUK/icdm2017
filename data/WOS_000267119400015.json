Therefore, these applications need an efficient design that allows them to simultaneously handle these two requirements. Although several proposals have focused on the software architectures for these systems, no proposals have focused on the computer systems supporting them. In this paper, we analyze the computer architectures used in the literature to support distributed virtual environments. Also, we propose a distributed computer architecture which is efficient enough to support simulations of thousand of autonomous agents. This proposal consists of a cluster of interconnected computers in order to improve flexibility and robustness, as well as a hierarchical software architecture that efficiently provides consistency. Performance evaluation results show that the trade-off between flexibility and consistency allows to efficiently manage thousands of autonomous agents. Therefore, this network-based system architecture can provide the required scalability for large-scale crowd simulations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
