We consider how missing rate levels (10%, 20%, 30%, and 50%) and the six missed data imputation methods (Listwise, Serial Mean, Linear Interpolation, Linear Trend, EM, and Regression) affect the structure of a test. A simulation study is conducted using the SPSS 15.0 EFA and CFA programs. The EFA results for the six methods are similar, and all results obtained two factors. The CFA results also fit the hypothesized two factor structure model for all six methods. However, we observed that the EM method fits the EFA results relatively well. When the percentage of missing data is less than 20%, the impact of the imputation methods on test dimensionality is not statistically significant. The Serial Mean and Linear Trend methods are suggested for use when the percentage of missing data is greater than 30%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
