The results of a test application showed that simulated storm damage was more strongly influenced by the input data (e.g. tree species and tree height) than by the different forest management regimes. However, early, intense thinnings as well as reducing target diameters by 10% led to reduced storm damage, with decreases as large as 50% of the damage in certain forest stands. The coupled modeling framework was able to simulate interactions between forest growth, storm damage and forest management regimes. Further testing of the prototype appears necessary to investigate a wider range of tree species, soil and site conditions. Also, the use of computational system resources needs improvement.
