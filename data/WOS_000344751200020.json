This characteristic makes the PDE subject to an inhomogeneous boundary condition. A state transformation is introduced to make the inhomogeneous boundary condition homogeneous, and a composite Lyapunov function that involves a fuzzy Lyapunov function and an entropy-like Lyapunov function is constructed for the transformed system. Based on this composite Lyapunov function, a sufficient condition for the closed-loop exponential stability of the cascaded system is presented in terms of a set of algebraic linear matrix inequalities in space. Using the sector bound approach and the finite spatial domain, a linear matrix inequality-based fuzzy control design procedure is developed from the obtained stability analysis result. Finally, simulation results on two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and merit of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Control Design for Nonlinear ODE-Hyperbolic PDE-Cascaded Systems: A Fuzzy and Entropy-Like Lyapunov Function Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000344751200020"}
