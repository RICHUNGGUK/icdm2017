Modeling of corrected permeability as a petrophysical parameter can help in decision making processes. The objective of this study is to construct a comprehensive and quantitative characterization of a carbonate gas reservoir in marine gas field. Artificial neural network is applied for prediction of permeability in accordance with other petrophysical parameters at well location. Correlation coefficient for this method is 84 %. In the study, the geological reservoir model is developed in two steps: First, the structure skeleton of the field is constructed, and then, reservoir property is distributed within it by applying new stochastic methods. Permeability is modeled by three techniques: kriging, sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) and collocated co-simulation using modeled effective porosity as 3D secondary variable. This paper enhances the characterization of the reservoir by improving the modeling of permeability through a new algorithm called collocated co-simulation. Kriging is very simple in modeling the reservoir permeability, and also, original distribution of the data changes considerably in this model. In addition, the SGS model is noisy and heterogeneous, but it retains the original distribution of the data. However, the addition of a 3D secondary variable in third method resulted in a much more reliable model of permeability.", "paper_title": "Permeability prediction and construction of 3D geological model: application of neural networks and stochastic approaches in an Iranian gas reservoir", "paper_id": "WOS:000325809300024"}
