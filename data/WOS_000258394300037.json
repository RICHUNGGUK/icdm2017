We aim to remove these limitations by reducing the information rate of the constructed threshold secret sharing schemes. In this paper we propose recursive construction algorithms of (t, n) threshold secret sharing schemes, based on the generalized vector space construction. Using these algorithms we are able to construct a (t, n) threshold secret sharing scheme for any arbitrary n.", "paper_title": "On increasing the number of users in (t, n) threshold secret sharing schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300037"}
