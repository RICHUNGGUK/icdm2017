An LTE network can exploit the correlated traffic characteristics of such devices by proactively assigning resources to devices based upon the activity of neighboring devices in the same group. This can reduce latency compared to waiting for each device in the group to request resources reactively per the standard LTE protocol. In this paper, we specify a new low complexity predictive resource allocation algorithm, known as the one way algorithm, for use with delay sensitive event based M2M applications in the LTE uplink. This algorithm requires minimal incremental processing power and memory resources at the eNodeB, yet can reduce the mean uplink latency below the minimum possible value for a non-predictive resource allocation algorithm. We develop mathematical models for the probability of a prediction, the probability of a successful prediction, the probability of an unsuccessful prediction, resource usage/wastage probabilities, and mean uplink latency. The validity of these models is demonstrated by comparison with the results from a simulation. The models can be used offline by network operators or online in real time by the eNodeB scheduler to optimize performance.", "paper_title": "A Predictive Resource Allocation Algorithm in the LTE Uplink for Event Based M2M Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000364856900003"}
