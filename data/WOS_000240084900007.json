In this paper, we study cost minimization for locating mobile users under delay constraints in mobile wireless networks. Specifically, a new location tracking algorithm is developed to determine the position of mobile terminals under delay constraints, while minimizing the average locating cost based on a unimodal property. We demonstrate that the new algorithm not only results in minimum locating cost, but also has a lower computational complexity compared to existing algorithms. Furthermore, detailed searching procedures are discussed under both deterministic and statistic delay bounds. Numerical results for a variety of location probability distributions show that our algorithm compares favorably with existing algorithms. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
