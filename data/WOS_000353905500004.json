Solitary type EM waves, having compact support, may easily be modeled in this context since they turn out to be explicit solutions. From the numerical viewpoint, the interaction of these waves with a material body is examined. Computations are carried out via a parallel high-order finite-differences code. Due to the presence of a gradient of pressure in the model equations, waves hitting the obstacle may impart acceleration to it. Some explicative 2D dynamical configurations are then studied, enabling the simulation of photon-particle iterations through classical arguments.", "paper_title": "Simulation of electromagnetic scattering with stationary or accelerating targets", "paper_id": "WOS:000353905500004"}
