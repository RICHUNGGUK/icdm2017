Network is obtained by interconnecting six IEEE 802.15.4 beacon enabled network clusters in triangular topology using slave-slave (SS) bridge with CSMA-CA access. We investigate the interactions among local nodes, local bridges and remote bridges. Our findings show that amount of traffic which reaches the sink under this network design is low. The problem has to be rectified by either non-acknowledged packet transfer and/or by GTS access towards and from the bridge.", "paper_title": "Can we use Acknowledged Transfer in Large Multi-Cluster Beacon Enabled 802.15.4 Networks?", "paper_id": "WOS:000205770100005"}
