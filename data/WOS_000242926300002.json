Automatic grading of a student program is achieved by calculating semantic similarities between the Student program and each correct model program after they are standardized. This approach was implemented in an on-line examination system for the programming language C. Different form other existing approaches, it can evaluate how close a student's source code is to a correct solution and give a matching accuracy. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
