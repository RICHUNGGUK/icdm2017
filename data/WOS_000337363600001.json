A multi-objective optimisation model based on disaster scenario information updates is proposed in an attempt to coordinate efficiency and equity through timely and appropriate decisions regarding issues such as vehicle routing and relief allocation. An optimal stopping rule is also proposed to determine the optimum period of delay before responding to disaster, because decision making requires accurate disaster information. The main contribution of this paper is solving relief allocation problem in a novel way by correlating operational research with statistical decision making and Bayesian sequential analysis. Finally, a case is presented based on the post-disaster rescue in Eastern China after supertyphoon Saomai to test the applicability and show the potential advantages of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Coordinating efficiency and equity in disaster relief logistics via information updates", "paper_id": "WOS:000337363600001"}
