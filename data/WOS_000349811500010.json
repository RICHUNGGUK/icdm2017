This work proposes a novel method to decide the liveness of a class of unbounded generalized Petri nets called omega-independent unbounded nets, breaking the existing limits to one-place-unbounded nets. An algorithm to construct a macro liveness graph (MLG) is developed and a critical condition based on MLG deciding the liveness of omega-independent unbounded nets is proposed. Examples are provided to demonstrate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Macro liveness graph and liveness of omega-independent unbounded nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000349811500010"}
