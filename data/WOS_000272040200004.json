Substate theorem: Let rho and sigma be quantum states in the same Hilbert space with relative entropy S(rho parallel to sigma) := Tr rho(log rho - log sigma) = c. Then for all epsilon > 0, there is a state rho' such that the trace distance parallel to rho' - rho parallel to(tr) := Tr root(rho' - rho)(2) <= epsilon, and rho'/2(O(c/epsilon 2)) <= sigma. It states that if the relative entropy of rho and sigma is small, then there is a state rho' close to rho, i.e. with small trace distance parallel to rho' - rho parallel to(tr), that when scaled down by a factor 2(O(c)) 'sits inside', or becomes a 'substate' of, sigma. This result has several applications in quantum communication complexity and cryptography. Using the substate theorem, we derive a privacy trade-off for the set membership problem in the two-party quantum communication model. Here Alice is given a subset A subset of [n], Bob an input i epsilon [n], and they need to determine if i epsilon A. Privacy trade-off for set membership: In any two-party quantum communication protocol for the set membership problem, if Bob reveals only k bits of information about his input, then Alice must reveal at least n/(2O(k)) bits of information about her input. We also discuss relationships between various information theoretic quantities that arise naturally in the context of the substate theorem.", "paper_title": "A Property of Quantum Relative Entropy with an Application to Privacy in Quantum Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000272040200004"}
