The underlying numerical scheme is based upon a second-order finite difference discretization in space and a second-order, fully implicit, adaptive scheme in time. At each time step, this leads to the need to solve a large system of nonlinear algebraic equations, for which the full approximation storage multigrid algorithm is employed. The motion of the contact line between the three phases (liquid, air and the solid substrate) is based upon the assumption Of a thin precursor film, with a corresponding disjoining pressure term in the governing equations. It is the inclusion of this precursor film in the model that motivates the need for a parallel solution method. This is because the thickness of such a film must be very small in order to yield realistic predictions, while the finite difference grid must be correspondingly fine in order to obtain accurate numerical Solutions. Results are presented which demonstrate that the parallel implementation is sufficiently efficient and robust to allow reliable numerical solutions to be obtained for a level of mesh resolution that is an order of magnitude finer than is possible using a single processor.
