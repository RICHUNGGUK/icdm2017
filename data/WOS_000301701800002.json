However, traditional touchscreens impose an inevitable visual workload demand that has implications for safety, especially in automotive use. Recent developments in touchscreen technology have enabled feedback to be provided via the haptic channel. A study was conducted to investigate the effects of visual and haptic touchscreen feedback on visual workload, task performance and subjective response using a medium-fidelity driving simulator. Thirty-six experienced drivers performed touchscreen 'search and select' tasks while engaged in a motorway driving task. The study utilised a 3 x 2 within-subjects design, with three levels of visual feedback: 'immediate', 'delayed', 'none'; and two levels of haptic feedback: 'visual only', 'visual + haptic'. Results showed that visual workload was increased when visual feedback was delayed or absent; however, introducing haptic feedback counteracted this effect, with no increases observed in glance time and count. Task completion time was also reduced when haptic feedback was enabled, while driving performance showed no effect due to feedback type. Subjective responses indicated that haptic feedback improved the user experience and reduced perceived task difficulty. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
