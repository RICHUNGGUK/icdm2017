An existing elasto-plastic constitutive model. the Single Hardening Model, utilizing isotropic hardening serves as the basic framework in these formulations. To this framework is added the capability of handling cross-anisotropic behavior as well as the kinematic hardening mechanism to capture inherent anisotropy of the sand in addition to the large stress-reversals. The model involves thirteen parameters, which can be determined from simple laboratory experiments, such as isotropic compression, drained triaxial compression and triaxial extension tests. The results from a series of true triaxial tests with large stress-reversals performed on loose cross-anisotropic Santa Monica Beach sand are employed for comparison with predictions.
