Here we describe pathogen identification using short RNA subtraction and assembly (SRSA), a detection method that overcomes the requirement of prior knowledge and culturing of pathogens, by using degraded small RNA and deep sequencing technology. We prove our approach's efficiency through identification of a combined viral and bacterial infection in human cells.", "paper_title": "Pathogen detection using short-RNA deep sequencing subtraction and assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000292778700001"}
