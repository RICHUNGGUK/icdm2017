It is composed of two infinite-valued versions called GH(infinity) and WGH(infinity) and a sequence of finitary valued versions (GH(n))(0<n<infinity). We define decision procedures for both WGFI(infinity) and (GH(n))(0 < n <infinity) that are based on particular sequents and on a set of proof rules dealing with such sequents. As these rules are strongly invertible the procedures naturally allow one to generate countermodels. Therefore we prove the decidability and the finite model property for these logics. Finally, from the decision procedure of WGH(infinity) we design a sound and complete sequent calculus for this logic. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
