Modern GPU architectures have limited capability for error detection and fault tolerance since they are originally designed for graphics processing. However, the rigorous execution correctness is required for general-purpose applications, which makes reliability a growing concern in the GPGPU architecture design. With CMOS processing technologies continuously scaling down to the nano-scale, on-chip soft error rate (SER) has been predicted to increase exponentially. GPGPUs with hundreds of cores integrated into a single chip are prone to manifest high SER. This paper explores a first step to model and characterize GPGPU reliability in light of soft errors. We develop GPGPU-SODA (GPGPU SOftware Dependability Analysis), a framework to estimate the soft-error vulnerability of GPGPU microarchitecture. By using GPGPU-SODA, we observe that several microarchitecture structures in GPGPUs exhibit high soft-error susceptibility, and the structure vulnerability is sensitive to the workload characteristics (e.g. branch divergences, memory access pattern). We further investigate the impact of several architectural optimizations on GPU soft-error robustness. For example, we find that increasing the number of threads supported by GPU significantly affects the GPGPU soft-error robustness. However, changing the warp scheduling policy has little impact on the structure vulnerability. The observations made in this study provide designers the useful guidance to build resilient GPGPUs: a comprehensive resiliency solution for GPGPUs should consider the entire GPGPU design instead of solely focusing on a particular structure.
