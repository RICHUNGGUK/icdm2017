A newly proposed curve fitting approach and precise segmentation of complex curves make the system highly efficient and accurate. A good quality curve-fit using piecewise cubic Bezier spline is obtained. Computation of target curve does not involve in complex analysis like curvature study, least-squares fit or error minimization. Before fitting curve, the outline is divided into various segments using division points. These points are located by a corner detector. Curve fitting is then performed over each segment recursively by optimally subdividing the curve wherever needed. As compared to previous approaches, proposed technique causes considerable decrease in computational complexity and number of determined data points without any compromise to the quality of approximation.
