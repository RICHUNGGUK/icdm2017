The term shape memory refers to ability of certain materials to \"remember\" a shape, even after rather severe deformations: once deformed at low temperatures, these materials will stay deformed until heated, whereupon they will return to their original, pre-deformed \"learned\" shape [2]. This property can be used to generate motion and/or force in electromechanical devices and micro-machines. However, the accuracy of SMA actuators is severely limited by their highly nonlinear stimulus-response characteristics. In this work, modeling, simulation, and experimental efforts to precisely control the position of a Ni-Ti based shape memory alloy wire is presented. In this content three separate control strategies are tried and very good positioning accuracies are obtained.", "paper_title": "Precise position control using shape memory alloy wires", "paper_id": "WOS:000284179900013"}
