One example is the assumption that the entropy of binding of the macromolecule is not influenced significantly by the different ligands. Recent experimental data on ligands binding to HIV-1 protease challenge this assumption.", "paper_title": "Limiting assumptions in structure-based design: binding entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000299929400002"}
