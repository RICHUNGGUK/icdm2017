Our main purpose is to fill the gap of this paper. We find that our new code C(P5)(7) enjoys more symmetry, and it has more codewords of minimum distance in general. However, over some special fields F(2)m, C(P5(5)) and C(P5)(7) have the same number of the codewords of minimum distance.", "paper_title": "Notes on classification of toric surface codes of dimension 5", "paper_id": "WOS:000266643400004"}
