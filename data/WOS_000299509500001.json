Our ultimate goal is to provide hardware-assisted solutions to improve the middleware performance in cloud computing environments. As a starting point, in this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate specialized hardware instructions to accelerate GC operations. We select GC because it is a common component in virtual machine designs and it incurs high performance and energy consumption overheads. We performed a profiling study on various GC algorithms to identify the GC performance hotspots, which contribute to more than 50% of the total GC execution time. By moving these hotspot functions into hardware, we achieved an order of magnitude speedup and significant improvement on energy efficiency. In addition, the results of our performance estimation study indicate that the hardware-assisted GC instructions can reduce the GC execution time by half and lead to a 7% improvement on the overall execution time.", "paper_title": "Achieving middleware execution efficiency: hardware-assisted garbage collection operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000299509500001"}
