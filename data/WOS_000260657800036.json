The model coating layers consisted of randomly arranged spherical pigment and latex particles with commercially relevant size distributions. Effects of coating characteristics, toner size, multiple toner layers, toner melting energy, toner thermal conductivity, coating layer thermal conductivity, and fuser roll temperature and pressure were investigated. Iso-thermal contours of fusing time were generated to demonstrate the relative importance of different fusing conditions and toner properties. Simulation results showed that temperature variation highly depended on the toner size, toner melting energy and the fuser roll temperature. Moreover, simultaneous coupling of the compressive stress and heat transfer indicated that the pressure exerted by the fuser roll did not significantly affect the rate of heat transfer.
