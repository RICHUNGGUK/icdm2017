Among these resources, knowledge is a critical one that requires special attention in order to support problem-solving activities and decision-making processes and provide strategic advantage. This article presents an initial proposal for the creation of dynamic knowledge-based virtual organizations, as a way to share knowledge in order to support problem-solving activities. This approach is based on behavioral elements, identified by other researchers, that affect group interactions; these items are represented inside the e-decisional community in a manner that allows software agents to interact similarly to their human counterparts. An initial model and a functional prototype have been developed and used to obtain a set of preliminary results, which show human-like behavior in our test system.", "paper_title": "USING HUMAN BEHAVIOR TO DEVELOP KNOWLEDGE-BASED VIRTUAL ORGANIZATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000284610200003"}
