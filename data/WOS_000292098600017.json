The self-biased and multi-band PLL with self-initialization technique is used for the wide-operating range of 140 Mb/s to 1.96 Gb/s and fast frequency acquisition time of 7.2 mu s. A linear phase detector which has no dead-zone problem is proposed for a phase adjustment with a low-jitter performance. The rms jitter of the recovered clock is 11.4 ps at 70 MHz operation. The overall transceiver consumes 388 mW at 2.5 V supply and occupies 3.41 mm(2) in a 0.25-mu m 1P5M CMOS technology.", "paper_title": "A 140 Mb/s to 1.96 Gb/s Referenceless Transceiver With 7.2 mu s Frequency Acquisition Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000292098600017"}
