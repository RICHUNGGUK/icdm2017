The purpose of this research is to balance loads for reducing Internet traffic jams. Using the novel line detection prediction approach, the main benefit of the presented algorithm is that it does not need to trace the system load every instant but achieves a far better load balancing than the traditional Round-Robin does. In addition, CDWRR keeps multiple links balanced in both input and output links. Mathematical equations are developed for predicting the best time instant of detecting, and both theoretical and practical approaches are provided for performance comparisons. Results obtained from the simulations show that CDWRR is effective and is efficient in maintaining load balance for multiple input and output network structures.", "paper_title": "An in-out combined dynamic weighted Round-Robin method for network load balancing", "paper_id": "WOS:000250049000004"}
