The location of sampling stations is one of the most critical factors in monitoring network design. Most previous studies have focused on mathematical aspects of monitoring network design, whereas human activities within a river basin are often not considered comprehensively. In this study, a new water monitoring network design procedure is introduced to identify representative river water quality sampling locations. The new procedure combines river mixing length, human activities, and geographic information systems (GIS) to locate position of sampling points. An implementation of a new potential pollution score (PPS) model of land use helps to classify the importance of each sampling point prior to selecting the most appropriate locations for an entire river system. With the study area, urban and agriculture are mainly concentrated in the downstream area and were the primary non-point pollution sources in this region. Seven sampling points are proposed to monitor river water quality in the study area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
