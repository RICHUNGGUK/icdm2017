As part of the Cohorts arm of the UK10K project, genetic variants called from low-read depth (average 7 x) whole genome sequencing of 3621 cohort individuals were analysed for statistical associations with 64 different phenotypic traits of biomedical importance. Here, we describe a novel genome browser based on the Biodalliance platform developed to provide interactive access to the association results of the project.", "paper_title": "An interactive genome browser of association results from the UK10K cohorts project", "paper_id": "WOS:000366630400029"}
