This result generalizes Winter's measurement compression theorem for fixed independent and identically distributed inputs to arbitrary inputs, and more importantly, it identifies the quantum mutual information of a measurement as the information gained by performing it, independent of the input state on which it is performed. Our result is a generalization of the classical reverse Shannon theorem to quantum-to-classical channels. In this sense, it can be seen as a quantum reverse Shannon theorem for quantum-to-classical channels, but with the entanglement assistance and quantum communication replaced by shared randomness and classical communication, respectively. The proof is based on a novel one-shot state merging protocol for classically coherent states as well as the postselection technique for quantum channels, and it uses techniques developed for the quantum reverse Shannon theorem.", "paper_title": "Identifying the Information Gain of a Quantum Measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000345511400039"}
