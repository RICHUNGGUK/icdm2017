However, vertical correlation (VC), which is a notion of inherent correlation between the vertically adjacent entries in 2DPPC, can weaken the robustness against statistical analysis attacks. When the orientation of 2DGabor filter approaches vertical orientation, the real and imaginary parts of Gabor features can be transposed to suppress the VC in 2DPPC. Yet, the VC analysis and orientation range of transposition for 2DPPC generation are remained unsolved. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the relation between the orientation of 2DGabor filter and the VC in 2DPPC. By following the analysis, we determine the exact orientation range of transposition for VC suppression.", "paper_title": "Orientation range of transposition for vertical correlation suppression of 2DPalmPhasor Code", "paper_id": "WOS:000365446600031"}
