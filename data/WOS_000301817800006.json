In this paper we propose q-analogs of the Wiener index, motivated by the theory of hypergeometric series. The basic properties of these q-Wiener indices are established, as well as their relations with the Hosoya polynomial. Some possible chemical interpretations and applications of the q-Wiener indices are considered.", "paper_title": "q-Analog of Wiener Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000301817800006"}
