But, solving the SVM model is time-consuming. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose a rapid method to solve the robust SVM model and use it to tune the parameters of fuzzy if then rules. The robust SVM is an extension of SVM for interval-valued data classification. We compare our proposed method with SVM, robust SVM, ISVM-FC (incremental support vector machine-trained fuzzy classifier), BSVM-FC (batch support vector machine-trained fuzzy classifier), SOTFN-SV (a self-organizing TS-type fuzzy network with support vector learning) and SCLSE (a TS-type fuzzy system with subtractive clustering for antecedent parameter tuning and LSE for consequent parameter tuning) by using some real datasets. According to experimental results, the use of proposed approach leads to very low training and testing time with good misclassification rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
