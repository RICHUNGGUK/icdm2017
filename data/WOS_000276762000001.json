It comprises a finite volume (FV) discretization using semi-discrete, non-staggered central schemes for colocated variables prescribed on a mesh of polyhedral cells that have an arbitrary number of faces. We describe the solver in detail, explaining the choice of variables whose face interpolation is limited, the choice of limiter, and a method for limiting the interpolation of a vector field that is independent of the coordinate system. The solution of momentum and energy transport in the Navier Stokes equations uses an operator-splitting approach: first, we solve an explicit predictor equation for the convection of conserved variables, then an implicit corrector equation for the diffusion of primitive variables. Our solver is validated against four sets of data: (1) an analytical solution of the one-dimensional shock tube case; (2) a numerical solution of two dimensional, transient, supersonic flow over a forward-facing step; (3) interferogram density measurements of a supersonic jet from a circular nozzle; and (4) pressure and heat transfer measurements in hypersonic flow over a 25 degrees-55 degrees biconic. Our results indicate that the central-upwind scheme of Kurganov, Noelle and Petrova (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 2001; 23:707-740) is competitive with the best methods previously published (e.g. piecewise parabolic method, Roe solver with van Leer limiting) and that it is inherently simple and well suited to a colocated, polyhedral FV framework.
