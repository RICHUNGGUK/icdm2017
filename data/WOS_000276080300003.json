This paper addresses the urgent need for interoperability by providing an exhaustive set of benchmark suites for evaluating RDF(S) import, export and interoperability. It also demonstrates, in an extensive field study, the state-of-the-art of interoperability among six Semantic Web tools. From this field study we have compiled a comprehensive set of practices that may serve as recommendations for Semantic Web tool developers and ontology engineers.", "paper_title": "RDF(S) INTEROPERABILITY RESULTS FOR SEMANTIC WEB TECHNOLOGIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000276080300003"}
