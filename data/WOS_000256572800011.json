The control method leads to improved frequency ability of integrated systems. The proposed solution, based only on computing flow modification, could be easily integrated into all future designs, ranging from a portable computing to a multi-core computing. A new approach to the thermal control method is described along with simulation results. An example of incorporation in current and future integrated circuits into mainstream designs is presented with exemplary algorithms and final simulation results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
