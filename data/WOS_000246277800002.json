Besides a set of surface points, the point-and-edge model also includes edge points representing the sharp edges in the model. The surface points and the sharp edges are relatively independent of each other. We present a feedback algorithm to simplify the point-and-edge model with bounded error based on an edge-preserving clustering method. An efficient constrained splatting method is used to preserve the sharp edges in the rendering, regardless of the surface point density.", "paper_title": "Point-and-edge model for edge-preserving splatting", "paper_id": "WOS:000246277800002"}
