All hardness amplification results in the literature suffer from \"size loss\" meaning that . We show that proofs using \"non-uniform reductions\" must suffer from such size loss. A reduction is an oracle circuit which given oracle access to any function D that computes Amp(f) correctly on a fraction of inputs, computes f correctly on a 1 - delta fraction of inputs. A non-uniform reduction is allowed to also receive a short advice string that may depend on both f and D. The well-known connection between hardness amplification and list-decodable error-correcting codes implies that reductions showing hardness amplification cannot be uniform for . We show that every non-uniform reduction must make at least queries to its oracle, which implies size loss. Our result is the first lower bound that applies to non-uniform reductions that are adaptive, whereas previous bounds by Shaltiel & Viola (SICOMP 2010) applied only to non-adaptive reductions. We also prove similar bounds for a stronger notion of \"function-specific\" reductions in which the reduction is only required to work for a specific function f.", "paper_title": "Lower Bounds on the Query Complexity of Non-uniform and Adaptive Reductions Showing Hardness Amplification", "paper_id": "WOS:000331631700002"}
