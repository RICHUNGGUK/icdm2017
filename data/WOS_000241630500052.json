The steel building industry has standardized on CIS/2. More broadly AEC has been striving to move IFCs into practice. STEP, the international product data standard ISO 10303, serves as the basic format for both CIS/2 and the IFCs. An overview of both formats accompanies example exchange files. An example one-way translation from CIS/2 to IFC2x3 illustrates some of the difficulties that must be overcome if the sought for harmonization of these standards is to be achieved.", "paper_title": "Interoperability in building construction using exchange standards", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630500052"}
