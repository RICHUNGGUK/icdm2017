However, the nonuniform latencies between intranode and internode communications on these machines introduce new challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve optimal performance. In this paper, a novel hybrid solver that is especially designed for supercomputers of multicore and multinode architectures is proposed. The new hybrid solver is characterized by its two-level parallel computing approach on the basis of the strategies of two-level partitioning and two-level condensation. It distinguishes intranode and internode communications to minimize the communication overheads. Moreover, it further reduces the size of interface equation system to improve its convergence rate. Three numerical experiments of structural linear static analysis were conducted on DAWNING-5000A supercomputer to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method. Test results show that the proposed approach was superior in performance compared with the conventional Schur complement method.
