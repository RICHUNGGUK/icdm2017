In this context, the question of cross-wind stability of ropeways is of particular concern. The real cross-inclination of the gondola and its correlation to wind speed and direction on an operating ropeway are of great interest for ropeway manufacturers and responsible authorities as well as for ropeway operators. As presented in this paper, a mathematical model for simulation was developed in order to gain a better understanding of the cross-wind behaviour of bicable ropeways. This model was established for a numerical dynamic simulation of the movement of gondolas with stiff connections, 'hangercabins', due to arbitrary cross-wind loads acting at a section of the studied span of the ropeway. All equations were solved using the program MATLAB (R) and the toolbox SIMULINK (R). In addition, the results of a simulation of a real ropeway are presented.", "paper_title": "Modelling and simulation of bicable ropeways under cross-wind influence", "paper_id": "WOS:000244667500004"}
