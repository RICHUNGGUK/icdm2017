We show that the worst-case delay problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, whose size grows exponentially with the number of nodes involved. Furthermore, we present approximate solution schemes to find upper and lower delay bounds on the worst-case delay. Both only require to solve just one linear programming problem and yield bounds that are generally more accurate than those found in the previous work, which are computed under more restrictive assumptions.", "paper_title": "Exact Worst-Case Delay in FIFO-Multiplexing Feed-Forward Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000363254100002"}
