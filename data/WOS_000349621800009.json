Our hypothesis is that depending on the data set nature, there can be advantages using a model that preserves text structure over one that does not, and vice versa. The key is to determine the best way of representing a particular data set, based on the data set itself. In this work, we proposde B\"orjae to investigate this problem by combining text distortion and algorithmic clustering based on string compression. Specifically, a distortion technique previously developed by the authors is applied to destroy text structure progressively. Following this, a clustering algorithm based on string compression is used to analyze the effects of the distortion on the information contained in the texts. Several experiments are carried out on text data sets and artificially-generated data sets. The results show that in strongly structural data sets the clustering results worsen as text structure is progressively destroyed. Besides, they show that using a compressor which enables the choice of the size of the left-context symbols helps to determine the nature of the data sets. Finally, the results are contrasted with a method based on multidimensional projections and analogous conclusions are obtained.", "paper_title": "Discovering Data Set Nature through Algorithmic Clustering Based on String Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000349621800009"}
