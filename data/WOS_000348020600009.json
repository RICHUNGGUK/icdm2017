These converging and diverging behaviors cause that the curved mirrors show different image types depending on the distance between the object and the mirror. We model such optical phenomena metaphorically into the searching process of numerical optimization by a new algorithm called optics inspired optimization (OIO). OIO treats the surface of the numerical function to be optimized as a reflecting surface in which each peak is assumed to reflect as a convex mirror and each valley to reflect as a concave one. Each individual is assumed to be an artificial object (or light point) that its artificially glittered ray is reflected back by the function surface, given that the surface is convex or concave, and the artificial image is formed (a candidate solution is generated within the search domain) based on the mirror equations adopted from physics of optics. Besides OIO, we introduce different variants of it, called ROIO (Rotation based OIO), and COIO (Convex combination based OIO) algorithms and conduct an extensive computational effort to find out the merit of the new algorithms. Our comparisons on benchmark test functions and a real world engineering design application (i.e., optimization of a centrifuge pump) demonstrate that the new algorithms are efficient and compete better than or similar to most of state of the art optimization algorithms with the advantage of accepting few input parameters.
