First, a novel delay-dependent piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (DDPLKF) is proposed in which both the upper bound of delays and the delay interval are considered. Based on this DDPLKF, the delay-dependent stability criteria for discrete-time systems with constant or time-varying delays are obtained, respectively. Then, delay-dependent full-order and reduced-order H-infinity filter design approaches are proposed. The filter parameters can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simulation examples are also given to illustrate the performance of the proposed approaches. It is shown that our approaches are less conservative and that the corresponding H-infinity filters can achieve better performance than the existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Delay-Dependent H-infinity Filter Design for Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000266677000010"}
