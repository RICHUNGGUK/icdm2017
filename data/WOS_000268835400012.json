This new method has been successfully applied to a composite material and will be checked to describe other complex materials. Design/methodology/approach - This surface potential function is calculated by a numerical approximation of Laplace's equation with three variables reduced to two variables by using the continuity assumptions on the potential. Findings - The results are particularly satisfactory and allow future developments in electron microscopy picture analysis to be forecasted. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates new approximated operator of the surface potential with good accordance between experimental and calculated values.", "paper_title": "Electron microscopy pictures, mathematical model and approximate solution of the surface potential", "paper_id": "WOS:000268835400012"}
