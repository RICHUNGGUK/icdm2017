The proposed CCI has high voltage swings on ports X and Y and very low equivalent impedance on port X due to super source follower configuration. It also has high voltage swings (close to supply voltages) on input and output ports and wideband current and voltage transfer ratios. Furthermore, two novel grounded inductance simulator circuits are proposed as application examples. Using HSpice, it is shown that the simulation results of the proposed CCI and also of the presented inductance simulators are in very good agreement with the expected ones.", "paper_title": "High Performance Wideband CMOS CCI and its Application in Inductance Simulator Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000308290500003"}
