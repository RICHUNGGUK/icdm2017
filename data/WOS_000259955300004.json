We propose an approach aimed at finding the team size where the project effort has its minimum. The approach was applied to the ISBSG repository containing nearly 4000 software projects. Based on the results we provide our recommendation for the optimal or near-optimal team size in seven project groups defined by four project properties. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
