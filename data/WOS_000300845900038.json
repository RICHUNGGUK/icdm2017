There are p(m)+1/2 distinct decimated sequences m(dt + l) since gcd(d, p(n) - 1) = (p(m)+1)/2. It is shown that the magnitude of the cross-correlation values is upper bounded by p+1/2 p(n/2) + 1. We also construct the sequence family F from these sequences, where the family size is p(m) and the correlation magnitude is upper bounded by p+1/2 p(n/2) + 1.", "paper_title": "On the Cross-Correlation of a p-Ary m-Sequence of Period p(2m)-1 and Its Decimated Sequences by (p(m)+1)(2)/2(p+1)", "paper_id": "WOS:000300845900038"}
