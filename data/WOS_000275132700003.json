The downside of this overwhelming amount of content is that it becomes increasingly difficult for users to identify the content they really need, resulting into considerable research efforts concerning personalized search and content retrieval. On the other hand, this enormous amount of content raises new possibilities: existing services can be enriched using this content, provided that the content items used match the user's personal interests. Ideally, these interests should be obtained in an automatic, transparent way for an optimal user experience. In this paper two models representing user profiles are presented, both based on keywords and with the goal to enrich real-time communication services. The first model consists of a light-weight keyword tree which is very fast, while the second approach is based on a keyword ontology containing extra temporal relationships to capture more details of the user's behavior, however exhibiting lower performance. The profile models are Supplemented with a set of algorithms, allowing to learn user interests and retrieving content from personal content repositories. In order to evaluate the performance, an enhanced instant messaging communication service was designed. Through Simulations the two models are assessed in terms of real-time behavior and extensibility. User evaluations allow to estimate the added value of the approach taken. The experiments conducted indicate that the algorithms succeed in retrieving content matching the user's interests and both models exhibit a linear scaling behavior. The algorithms perform clearly better in finding content matching several user interests when benefiting from the extra temporal information in the ontology based model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
