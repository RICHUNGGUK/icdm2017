Then a series of generalizations of consecutive-k systems are discussed, such as consecutive-k-out-n:F systems with sparse d, M consecutive-k-out-of-n:F systems with sparse d, and (n, f, k):F systems with sparse d. We present the formulation for the system reliability of these generalized consecutive-k systems with various component settings in terms of the finite Markov Chain imbedding idea, along with two numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Reliability for sparsely connected consecutive-k systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249309600017"}
