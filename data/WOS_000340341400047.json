First, the hybrid switching and impulsive controller is introduced. Second, the algebraic form of the system is given. Third, sufficient and necessary conditions for the stabilization and controllability of the system are presented, respectively. At last, an illustrative example shows the effectiveness of the main results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
