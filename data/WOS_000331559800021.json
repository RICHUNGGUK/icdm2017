We conduct analysis from two perspectives. On the one hand, we examine how long it takes before the articles' downloads reach 50 %/80 % of the total; on the other hand, we compare the percentage of total downloads in 7, 30, and 100 days after publication. In general, papers are downloaded most frequently within a short time period right after their publication. And we find that compared with non-Open Access papers, readers' attention on Open Access publications are more enduring. Based on the usage data of a newly published paper, regression analysis could predict the future expected total usage counts.", "paper_title": "Usage history of scientific literature: Nature metrics and metrics of Nature publications", "paper_id": "WOS:000331559800021"}
