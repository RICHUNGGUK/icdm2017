Two approaches have been developed, such as minimization of norm of feet forces and minimization of norm of joint torques using the least squared method. Results of these two approaches have been compared with each other, and with those of available literature. As both of these approaches are found to be computationally fast, these are suitable for real-time control of the six-legged robot. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
