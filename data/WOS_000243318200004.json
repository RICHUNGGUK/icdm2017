In principle, this protocol provides teleportation of discrete N-level spatial states of an object with various degrees of freedom, e.g. spin, in ordinary three-dimensional space. All necessary Bell states and their corresponding operators to measure and reconstruct the initial state are represented.", "paper_title": "A scheme for spatial wavefunction teleportation in three dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000243318200004"}
