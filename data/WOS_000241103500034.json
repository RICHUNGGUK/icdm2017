Co-occurrence information extracted from the translation context, i.e., the set of words which have already been translated, is used to define the order in which disambiguation rules produced by a machine learning algorithm are applied. Experiments on the English-Portuguese translation of seven verbs yielded a significant improvement on the accuracy of a rule-based model: from 0.75 to 0.79.", "paper_title": "Exploiting the translation context for multilingual WSD", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500034"}
