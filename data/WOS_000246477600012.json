The MCP problem is known to be NP-complete. One popular approach is to use the shortest path with respect to a single edge weighting function as an approximate solution to MCP. In a pioneering work, Jaffe showed that the shortest path with respect to a scaled 1-norm of the K edge weights is a 2-approximation to MCP in the sense that the sum of the larger of the path weight and its corresponding constraint is within a factor of 2 from minimum. In a recent paper, Xue et al. showed that the shortest path with respect to a scaled oo-norm of the K edge weights is a K-approximation to MCP, in the sense that the largest ratio of the path weight over its corresponding constraint is within a factor of K from minimum. In this paper, we study the relationship between these two optimization criteria and present a class of provably good approximation algorithms to MCP. We first prove that a good approximation according to the second optimization criterion is also a good approximation according to the first optimization criterion, but not vice versa. We then present a class of very simple K-approximation algorithms according to the second optimization criterion, based on the computation of a shortest path with respect to a single edge weighting function.", "paper_title": "Multiconstrained QoS routing: A norm approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000246477600012"}
