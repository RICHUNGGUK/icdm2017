However, censoring restricts the ability to observe failure times exactly. If the lifetime distribution is not normal, incomplete information contained in censored data often causes difficulties with employing the experimental design methods to conduct statistical inferences in engineering applications. The paper develops three new modified maximum likelihood predictors (MMLPs) to predict. type II censored data for the Weibull distribution. Once the censored data are predicted, the predicted information can be merged with uncensored data as a pseudo-complete data set. The robust 2(k) factorial design method [13] can be employed to identify the significant factors from the experiment for the pseudo-complete data set. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and an example regarding engineering is presented for illustration.", "paper_title": "PREDICTING TYPE II CENSORED DATA FROM 2(k) FACTORIAL DESIGNS FOR THE WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800003"}
