This class of codes generalizes and extends some of the codes presented in papers by Wolfmann in 2005 and Vega and Wolfman in 2007. The aim of this note is to show that the class of codes presented by Ma et al. is properly contained in a superclass of two-weight cyclic codes that was introduced by Vega in 2008.", "paper_title": "A Note About Two-Weight Non-Irreducible Cyclic Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000302079800018"}
