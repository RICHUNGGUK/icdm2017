We call this database the Korea University Gesture (KUG) database. Using 3D motion cameras and 3 sets of stereo cameras, we captured 3D motion data and 3 pairs of stereo-video data in 3 different directions for normal and abnormal gestures. In case of command gestures, 2 pairs of stereo-video data were obtained by 2 sets of stereo cameras with different focal lengths in order to capture views of whole body and upper body, simultaneously. The 2D silhouette data was synthesized by separating a subject and background in 2D stereo-video data. In this paper, we describe the gesture capture system, the organization of database, the potential usages of the database and the contact point for the KUG database. We expect that this database would be very useful for the study of 2D/3D human gesture and its application.", "paper_title": "A full-body gesture database for human gesture analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000251719800007"}
