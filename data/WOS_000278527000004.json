For instance, many subjects in virtual distance learning are organized as online groups of students, who use groupware tools to complete their learning tasks. In this paper, we address the efficient management of peer groups in JXTA-based P2P systems as a key issue in many P2P applications that use peer group as a unit such as for remote execution of tasks in parallel and distributed applications. From this perspective, we consider peer grouping as the basis in the development of groupware tools in P2P systems. Motivated by the need to support online teams of real virtual campuses, in this work we propose the management of peer groups in JXTA-Overlay, a JXTA-based P2P middleware for the development of P2P applications. To this end, by taking advantage of the peerGroup entity in JXTA library we have designed and implemented a set of primitives as part of JXTA-Overlay aiming to support efficient peer group management. We show the usefulness of using JXTA-Overlay for the development of P2P groupware tools for supporting online teams of students in a virtual campus. Our approach distinguishes from existing studies by using groupware tools in a customized way and tailored to the specific needs of small online teams of students who consider group monitoring and autonomy, confidentiality and security as important concerns. The groupware tools developed for P2P systems include instant messaging and chat rooms, task execution in peer group's resources and file sharing system. We successfully deployed these tools based on JXTA-Overlay in a real P2P network. The experimental results showed the feasibility of our approach when applied to small groups of students who use standard desktop and laptop computers and have rather limited bandwidth of Home Net connections. On the other hand, the JXTA library showed some performance limitations, such as CPU consumption, when using the P2P file sharing system and sharing about three hundred files among all peers of a real small network made up of limited computational resources and rather small bandwidth.", "paper_title": "Efficient peerGroup management in JXTA-Overlay P2P system for developing groupware tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000278527000004"}
