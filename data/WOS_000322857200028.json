We describe the whole procedure, from the original images to the segmented individual nuclei, paying particular attention to the binarization of the images, which is not straightforward, due to the technical difficulties related to the visualization of nuclei as individual objects and incomplete and irregular staining. We have focused on the division of clusters of nuclei that appear frequently in these images. Thus we have developed a clump-splitting algorithm to separate touching or overlapping nuclei allowing us to accurate account for both the number and size of the nuclei. The results presented in the paper show that the proposed algorithm performs well on different sets of images from different layers of the cerebral cortex. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
