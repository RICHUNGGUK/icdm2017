The multi-parameters expression of weighting coefficients are given. Moreover, the 4-WFRFT of discrete sequences is defined by introducing DFT into it, which makes it suitable for digital communication systems. After analyzing the properties of WFRFT, a typical scheme for modulation/demodulation is proposed, which could make the statistics properties of the real and image part on both of the time and frequency domain and the phase properties have a significant variation. Such a variation could be controlled by the adjustment of transform parameters. If the WFRFT of multi-parameters is implemented, it will be more difficult to intercept and capture the modulated signals than normal.", "paper_title": "Research on the application of 4-weighted fractional Fourier transform in communication system", "paper_id": "WOS:000278159000015"}
