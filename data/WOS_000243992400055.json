As an illustration, we analyze the different dimer interfaces between the CXCL8 chemokine family with the CCL4 and CCL2 chemokine families to discover the changes that disfavor CXCL8 of quaternary structure. Results: In comparison with known experimental results, our method identifies evolutionarily conserved sequence changes in the CC families that inhibit CXCL8 quaternary structure. Therefore, we find positive selection of negative design elements. Furthermore, our approach predicts that a two-residue deletion conserved in the CCL4 chemokine family disfavors CXCL8 dimerization.", "paper_title": "Detecting protein dissimilarities in multiple alignments using Bayesian variable selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000243992400055"}
