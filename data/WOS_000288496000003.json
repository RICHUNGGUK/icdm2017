For such classes we can solve some open questions related to unambiguity, finite ambiguity and complementation. Then we reformulate a necessary condition for recognizability stated by Matz, introducing a new complexity function. We solve an open question proposed by Matz, showing that all the known necessary conditions for recognizability of a language and its complement are not sufficient. The proof relies on a family of languages defined by functions.", "paper_title": "CLASSES OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL LANGUAGES AND RECOGNIZABILITY CONDITIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288496000003"}
