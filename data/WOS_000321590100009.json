In this work, we study the predictive power of social connections to determine the preferences or behaviors of individuals such as whether a user supports a certain political view, whether one likes a product, whether she would like to vote for a presidential candidate, etc. Since an actor is likely to participate in multiple different communities with each regulating the actor's behavior in varying degrees, and a natural hierarchy might exist between these communities, we propose to zoom into a network at multiple different resolutions and determine which communities reflect a targeted behavior. We develop an efficient algorithm to extract a hierarchy of overlapping communities. Empirical results on social media networks demonstrate the promising potential of the proposed approach in real-world applications.", "paper_title": "Learning with multi-resolution overlapping communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000321590100009"}
