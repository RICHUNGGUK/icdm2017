The Transformed Field Expansion methodology we use is not only numerically stable, but also employs a spectrally accurate Fourier/Chebyshev collocation method which delivers high-fidelity solutions. This implementation follows directly from the authors' previous theoretical work on analyticity, properties of functional variations of Dirichlet-Neumann operators. These variations can be computed in a number of ways, but we establish, via a variety of computational experiments, the superior effectiveness of our new approach as compared with another popular Boundary Perturbation algorithm (the method of Operator Expansions).
