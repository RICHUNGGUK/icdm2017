Attempts to instantiate some of the delta-rules present in the literature within our framework allowed us to pinpoint unsoundness problems for two of them. In both cases, we propose revised versions that are proved sound by reducing them within our framework.", "paper_title": "A sound framework for delta-rule variants in free-variable semantic tableaux", "paper_id": "WOS:000244687800003"}
