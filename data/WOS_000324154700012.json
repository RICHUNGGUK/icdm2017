In this study, we applied the support vector machine method to build a malignant neutrophil prediction model based on nine CML patients and nine healthy donors. This approach effectively differentiated between malignant and normal neutrophils with high specificity and sensitivity (<= 95.80% and <= 95.30%, respectively). This approach may broaden the application of flow cytometry for differentiation between CML and normal neutrophils and become an important diagnostic tool in CML. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
