In particular, the method aims to extract the iris pattern from the eye image acquired at the visible wavelength, in an uncontrolled environment where reflections and occlusions can also be present, on-the-move and at variable distance. The method achieves the iris segmentation by the following three main steps. The first step locates the centers of the pupil and the iris in the input image. Then two image strips containing the iris boundaries are extracted and linearizated. The last step locates the iris boundary points in the strips and it performs a regularization operation by achieving the exclusion of the outliers and the interpolation of missing points. The obtained curves are then converted into the original image space in order to produce a first segmentation output. Occlusions such as reflections and eyelashes are then identified and removed from the final area of the segmentation. Results indicate that the presented approach is effective and suitable to deal with the iris acquisition in noisy environments. The proposed algorithm ranked seventh in the international Noisy Iris Challenge Evaluation (NICE.I). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
