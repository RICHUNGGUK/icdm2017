This paper proposes a Self Organizing Sensor (SOS) network based on an intelligent clustering algorithm which does not require many user defined parameters and random selection to form clusters like in Algorithm for Cluster Establishment (ACE) [2]. The proposed SOS algorithm is compared with ACE and the empirical results clearly illustrate that the SOS algorithm can reduce the number of cluster heads.", "paper_title": "Self Organizing Sensor networks using intelligent clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800005"}
