However, due to discretization effects, such DTs have limited precision, including reduced rotational and translational invariance. We show in this paper that a significant improvement in performance of Euclidean DTs can be achieved if voxel coverage values are utilized and the position of an object boundary is estimated with sub-voxel precision. We propose two algorithms of linear time complexity for estimating Euclidean DT with sub-voxel precision. The evaluation confirms that both algorithms provide 4-14 times increased accuracy compared to what is achievable from a binary object representation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
