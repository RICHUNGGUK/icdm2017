Aimed at the puzzles in current HLA-based simulation system, and with the combination of a new grid idea, a framework of simulation grid has been presented. This article is absorbed in the aim how to schedule the task under simulation grid environment and explore the dynamic dispatch to the parallel tasks in the federation entity level. Finally a mended heuristic scheduling algorithm has been designed. This algorithm dynamically adjusted decision-making through using the information of systematical real-time operating status, be able to making a timely response dynamically according to the changes of the characteristics of simulation system, re-achieve balance and improve the system performance, fault-tolerant and load-balance ability according to the adjustment of the dynamic fluctuations of the loading. Taking the air-to-ground warfare simulation system as an example, simulation results verify that the method is effective and useful, and it could contribute to enhance using resource quotient and construct the large-scale military simulation applications.
