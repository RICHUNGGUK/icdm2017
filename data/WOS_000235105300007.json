A key distinguishing feature of current DHT systems, such as Chord, Pastry, CAN and Tapestry, is the way they handle locality in the underlying network. Topology-based node identifier assignment, proximity routing, and proximity neighbor selection are examples of heuristics used to minimize message delays in the underlying network. While these heuristics are sometimes effective, they all rely on a single global overlay that may install the key of a popular object at a node far from most of the nodes accessing it. Furthermore, a response to a lookup message does not contain any locality information about the nodes holding a copy of the object. We address these issues in Plethora, a novel two-level overlay P2P network. A local overlay in Plethora acts as a locality-aware cache for the global overlay, grouping nodes close together in the underlying network. Local overlays are constructed by exploiting the organization of the Internet into autonomous systems (ASs). We present a detailed experimental study that demonstrates performance gains in response time of up to 60% compared to a single global Pastry overlay. We also present efficient distributed algorithms for maintaining local overlays in the presence of node arrivals and departures. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
