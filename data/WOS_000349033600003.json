Data was collected from 322 potential services users in Taiwan. The empirical results indicated that perceived need and perceived enjoyment were key factors that determined whether or not an individual would adopt 3G service. Furthermore, this study confirmed the importance of perceived over performance and relative advantage on the perceived need for 3G service. Perceived price was also found to be positively correlated with purchasability, but purchasability and network effect did not significantly impact adoption behavior. At the end of this paper, we discuss several implications for 3G service management practices and future research regarding innovative technology acceptance.", "paper_title": "Factors Affecting Third-Generation Mobile Services: Applying the Purchase Intention Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000349033600003"}
