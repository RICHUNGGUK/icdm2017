This paper presents the kernel bundle extension of the LDDMM framework that allows multiple kernels at multiple scales to be incorporated in the registration. We combine sparsity priors with the kernel bundle resulting in compact representations across scales, and we present the mathematical foundation of the framework with derivation of the KB-EPDiff evolution equations. Through examples, we illustrate the influence of the kernel scale and show that the method achieves the important property of sparsity across scales. In addition, we demonstrate on a dataset of annotated lung CT images how the kernel bundle framework with a compact representation reaches the same accuracy as the standard method optimally tuned with respect to scale.", "paper_title": "Sparse Multi-Scale Diffeomorphic Registration: The Kernel Bundle Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000320280800003"}
