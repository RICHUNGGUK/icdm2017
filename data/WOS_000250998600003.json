The main goal of this project was to define a unified authentication and authorisation system for federated services hosted in the eduroam network. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the main initiatives and technologies related to the DAMe project and some first designs that show how the main goals are already being achieved. Findings - At present, there are several activities of DAMe in progress, such as the design and implementation of a multiplatform. PEAP supplicant, the middleware for managing the SSO tokens and the design of new common services for eduGAIN. Originality/value - This paper is based on results from the DAMe project and the knowledge of the authors and will be of interest to those in the same field.", "paper_title": "Deploying authorisation mechanisms for federated services in eduroam (DAMe)", "paper_id": "WOS:000250998600003"}
