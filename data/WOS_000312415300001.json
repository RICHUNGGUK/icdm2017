In this kind of scenarios, where the backend search system is unable to generate answers to queries, approximate answers can be generated by exploiting the previously computed query results available in the result cache of the search engine. In this work, we propose two alternative strategies to implement this cache-based query processing idea. The first strategy aggregates the results of similar queries that are previously cached in order to create synthetic results for new queries. The second strategy forms an inverted index over the textual information (i.e., query terms and result snippets) present in the result cache and uses this index to answer new queries. Both approaches achieve reasonable result qualities compared to processing queries with an inverted index built on the collection.", "paper_title": "Cache-Based Query Processing for Search Engines", "paper_id": "WOS:000312415300001"}
