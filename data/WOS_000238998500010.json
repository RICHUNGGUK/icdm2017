Contrary to other physical hypercomputers, where one believes that a physical process \"computes\" a (recursive-theoretic) non-computable function simply because one believes the physical theory that presumably governs or describes such process, believing the theory (i.e., quantum mechanics) in the case of the quantum adiabatic \"hypercomputer\" is tantamount to acknowledging that the hypercomputer cannot perform its task.", "paper_title": "Quantum hypercomputability?", "paper_id": "WOS:000238998500010"}
