Kim and T. Kim established some identities of higher order Bernoulli and Euler polynomials arising from Bernoulli and Euler basis respectively. Using the idea developed in [9], we present a study of some families of higher order Genocchi numbers an polynomials. In particular, by using the basis property of higher order Genocchi polynomials for the space of polynomials of degree less than and equal to n, we derive some interesting identities for the higher order Genocchi polynomials.", "paper_title": "SOME IDENTITIES OF HIGHER ORDER GENOCHI POLYNOMIALS ARISING FROM HIGHER ORDER GENOCCHI BASIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000330603200013"}
