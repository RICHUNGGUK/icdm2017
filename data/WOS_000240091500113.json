Level designers adjust the attributes of the game characters and opponent behavior to create appropriate levels of difficult, and avoid player frustration. Generally, opponent behavior is defined by a static script, however, this results in repetitive levels and environments, making in difficult to maintain the player's interest. Accordingly, this paper proposes a dynamic scripting method that can sustain the degree of interest intended by the level designer by adjusting the opponent behaviors while playing the game. The player's countermeasure pattern for dynamic level design is modeled using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The proposed method is applied to a shooter game, and the experimental results maintain the degree of interest intended by the level designer.", "paper_title": "Dynamic game level design using Gaussian mixture model", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500113"}
