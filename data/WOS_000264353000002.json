Previously, such an exponential separation was known only for a relational problem. The communication problem corresponds to a strong extractor that fails against a small amount of quantum information about its random source. Our proof uses the Fourier coefficients inequality of Kahn, Kalai, and Linial. We also give a number of applications of this separation. In particular, we show that there are privacy amplification schemes that are secure against classical adversaries but not against quantum adversaries; and we give the first example of a key-expansion scheme in the model of bounded-storage cryptography that is secure against classical memory-bounded adversaries but not against quantum ones.", "paper_title": "EXPONENTIAL SEPARATION FOR ONE-WAY QUANTUM COMMUNICATION COMPLEXITY, WITH APPLICATIONS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY", "paper_id": "WOS:000264353000002"}
