In the constructive approach, by employing an intuitionistic fuzzy implicator I and an intuitionistic fuzzy triangle norm T, lower and upper approximations of intuitionistic fuzzy sets with respect to an intuitionistic fuzzy approximation space are first defined. Properties of (1,T)-intuitionistic fuzzy rough approximation operators are examined. The connections between special types of intuitionistic fuzzy relations and properties of intuitionistic fuzzy approximation operators are established. In the axiomatic approach, an operator-oriented characterization of (21, T)-intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets is proposed. Different axiom sets characterizing the essential properties of intuitionistic fuzzy approximation operators associated with various intuitionistic fuzzy relations are explored.
