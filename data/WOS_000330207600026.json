They adopted resistive load and LC resonator load, respectively. On-chip circuits are used for biasing the main amplifiers and active baluns are used for single-ended-to-differential conversions. Using the power-constrained simultaneous input and noise matching technique, the LNAs achieve input matching and noise optimization simultaneously at two bands. Implemented in SMIC 0.18 mu m CMOS process, both LNAs consume less than 8 mA dc current with a power supply voltage of 1.8 V. The proposed LNA with resistive load exhibits measured gains of 13 and 11.5 dB, and noise figures of 1.58 and 3.1 dB at 1.217 and 1.568 GHz, respectively. The LC load LNA has measured gains of 16 and 14.8 dB, and noise figures of 2.2 and 2.35 dB at 1.217 and 1.568 GHz, respectively.", "paper_title": "Concurrent dual-band LNA for dual-system dual-band GNSS receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000330207600026"}
