In this paper we propose a wrapper method for gene selection based on simulated annealing and unsupervised clustering. The proposed approach, even if computationally intensive, permits to select the most relevant features (genes), and to rank their relevance, allowing to improve the results of clustering algorithms.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised gene selection and clustering using simulated annealing", "paper_id": "WOS:000236462400028"}
