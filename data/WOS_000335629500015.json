Two critical issues of FMEA are the representation and handling of various types of assessments and the determination of risk priorities of failure modes. Many different approaches have been suggested to enhance the performance of traditional FMEA; however, deficiencies exist in these approaches. In this paper, based on a more effective representation of uncertain information, called D numbers, and an improved grey relational analysis method, grey relational projection (GRP), a new risk priority model is proposed for the risk evaluation in FMEA. In the proposed model, the assessment results of risk factors given by FMEA team members are expressed and modeled by D numbers. The GRP method is used to determine the risk priority order of the failure modes that have been identified. Finally, an illustrative case is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
