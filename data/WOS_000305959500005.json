In this algorithm, the operations required in several contiguous iterations of a previously reported algorithm based on the extended Euclid's algorithm are represented as a matrix. These operations are performed at once through the matrix by means of a polynomial multiply instruction on GF(2). When the word size of a processor is 32 or 64 and m is larger than 233 for National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-recommended irreducible polynomials, the proposed algorithm computes inversion with less polynomial multiply instructions on GF(2) and exclusive-OR instructions required by previously reported inversion algorithms on an average.", "paper_title": "Fast inversion algorithm in GF(2(m)) suitable for implementation with a polynomial multiply instruction on GF(2)", "paper_id": "WOS:000305959500005"}
