They, however, seem inadequate to describe new network architectures, such as Software Defined Networks, where programs are allowed to manipulate the infrastructure. In this paper we present the Network Conscious pi-calculus (NCPi), a proper extension of the pi-calculus with an explicit notion of network: network links and nodes are represented as names, in full analogy with ordinary pi-calculus names, and observations are routing paths through which data is transported. However, restricted links do not appear in the observations, which thus can possibly be as abstract as in the pi-calculus. Then we construct a presheaf-based coalgebraic semantics for NCPi along the lines of Turi-Plotkin's approach, by indexing processes with the network resources they use: we give a model for observational equivalence in this context, and we prove that it admits an equivalent nominal automaton (HD-automaton), suitable for verification. Finally, we give a concurrent semantics for NCPi where observations are multisets of routing paths. We show that bisimilarity for this semantics is a congruence, and this property holds also for the concurrent version of the pi-calculus. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
