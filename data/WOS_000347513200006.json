In order to obtain the comprehensive values of alternatives, two induced generalized interval-valued hesitant fuzzy hybrid operators based on the Shapley function are defined, which globally consider the importance of elements and their ordered positions as well as reflect the interactions between them. If the weight information is incompletely known, models for the optimal weight vectors on the attribute set and on the ordered set are respectively established. Furthermore, an approach to interval-valued hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision making with incomplete weight information and interactive characteristics is developed. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to show the concrete application of the proposed procedure.", "paper_title": "An Approach to Interval-Valued Hesitant Fuzzy Multi-Attribute Decision Making with Incomplete Weight Information Based on Hybrid Shapley Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000347513200006"}
