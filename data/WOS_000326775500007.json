In this model, the MFS is used to account for the presence of an infinite soil surrounding an elastic structure, which is modeled using the FEM. Application examples concerning the vibration introduced in an infinite soil by a dynamic load acting within a tunnel are presented, in order to illustrate the usefulness and practical applicability of the method.
