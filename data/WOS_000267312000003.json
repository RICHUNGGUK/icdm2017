The proposed method can be categorized in exemplar-based error concealment approaches. In this category, a patch of corrupted pixels are replaced by another patch of the image that contains correct pixels. For splitting the erroneous block to different patches, a novel context-dependent exemplar-based algorithm based on a previously proposed segmentation method is proposed. The capability of the proposed method for concealment in diverse image regions is depicted. Our detailed conducted experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art spatial error concealment methods in terms of output quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
