Based on an iterative approach, we identified and implemented different agent roles. While there is no explicit team concept, the agents cooperate by informing each other of their perceptions and intentions, which leads to emergent team behavior which very dynamically and flexibly reacts to the state of the game.", "paper_title": "Herding cows with JIAC V", "paper_id": "WOS:000289728100004"}
