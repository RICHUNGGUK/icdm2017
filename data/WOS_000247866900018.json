After a while, however, impostors' keystroke patterns become available from failed login attempts. We propose to employ the retraining framework where a novelty detector is retrained with the impostor patterns to enhance authentication accuracy. In this paper, learning vector quantization for novelty detection and support vector data description are retrained with the impostor patterns. Experimental results show that retraining improves the authentication performance and that learning vector quantization for novelty detection outperforms other widely used novelty detectors.
