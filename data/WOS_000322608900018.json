The use of PWM power supplies induces additional magnetic losses in the magnetic circuit of the electrical machine. The aim of this paper is to present a novel analytical approach to account for these losses. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology proposed here consists in identifying the analytical method with a static Preisach hysteresis model. The Preisach model was validated by comparing it with measurements obtained from an Epstein frame. Then, the results obtained with this approach were compared with a basic analytical method that is widely used. Findings - The authors' model provides a fast way for estimating the minor loop iron losses introduced by static convertors. They compared the proposed model with another analytical model (J. Lavers model) for different wave forms. One can observe that the J. Lavers model overestimates the iron losses introduced by the non-centred minor loops. Originality/value - In this paper, an improved analytical model is presented which estimates the non-centred minor loop iron losses. In order to do a precise estimation of the iron loss introduced by the minor loops, the authors' model takes into account the position and the size of the minor loop. The proposed model is identified from a static Preisach model.", "paper_title": "Improved iron loss calculation for non-centered minor loops", "paper_id": "WOS:000322608900018"}
