Logarithmic estimates are obtained under the assumption of the service time distribution having a light tail, thus supplementing recent results for the heavy-tailed setting. Our proof gives insight into the way a large sojourn time occurs, enabling the construction of an (asymptotically efficient) importance sampling algorithm. Finally our results for PS are compared to a number of other service disciplines, such as FCFS, LCFS, and SRPT.", "paper_title": "Large deviations of sojourn times in processor sharing queues", "paper_id": "WOS:000237341900001"}
