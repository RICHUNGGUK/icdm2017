Our approach is based on the phase map decomposition (de Beaudrap et al. 2006; de Beaudrap et al. 2008) and leads to some preliminary results on the connection between the column structure of a given unitary and the angles of measurements in a pattern that implements it. Our characterisation highlights the role of entanglement in the efficiency of the simulation of a one-way pattern, and it is a step forward towards a full characterisation of those unitaries that have an efficient one-way model implementation.", "paper_title": "Extended phase map decompositions for unitaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000315459100007"}
