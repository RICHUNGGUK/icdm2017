However, so far an appropriate method is still not found to provide high-quality, low-cost graphene in a large quantity. To overcome this issue, we demonstrate that massive graphene sheets can be synthesized by electrochemical exfoliation process using artificial graphite as a starting material. The product is mainly composed of bilayer thin graphene sheets. Their lateral size can be up to several to 20 mu m, and the quality determined by Raman spectroscopy is better than the reduced graphene oxide derived from graphene oxide. The transparent conducting films made of electrochemically exfoliated graphene can be simply prepared by an airbrush spraying method, which is easy to scale up for large-area deposition, and compatible with flexible polymer substrates.
