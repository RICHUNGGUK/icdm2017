We are interested in optimal rate allocation policies for throughput maximisation over time and thus we formulate the problem as a discrete stochastic dynamic program. This dynamic program is exponentially complex in the number of users, which renders it impractical and therefore we use an approximate dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to obtain suboptimal rate allocation policies in real time. The numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms a number of different baseline greedy heuristics. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
