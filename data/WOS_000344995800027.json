Industry is one of the major consumers of electric power. In this study, we propose a DR energy management scheme for industrial facilities based on the state task network (STN) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The scheme divides the processing tasks in industrial facilities into nonschedulable tasks (NSTs) and schedulable tasks (STs), and takes advantage of distributed energy resources (DERs) to implement DR. Based on day-ahead hourly electricity prices, the scheme determines the scheduling of STs and DERs in order to shift the demand from peak periods (with high electricity prices) to offpeak periods (with low electricity prices), which not only improves the reliability of the electric power system, but also reduces energy costs for industrial facilities.", "paper_title": "A Demand Response Energy Management Scheme for Industrial Facilities in Smart Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000344995800027"}
