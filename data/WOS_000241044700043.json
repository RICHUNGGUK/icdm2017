The proposed neural network, called hyper-spherical ARTMAP network (HS-ARTMAP network), is a synthesis of an RBF-network-like module and an ART-like module. The HS-ARTMAP network is trained via a training algorithm similar to the training algorithm for the fuzzy ARTMAP system. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed HS-ARTMAP network, several pattern recognition and function approximation problems were tested. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
