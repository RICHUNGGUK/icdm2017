If G is L-list colorable for any list assignment with vertical bar L(v)vertical bar >= k for all v epsilon V, then G is said k-choosable. In [M. Voigt, A not 3-choosable planar graph without 3-cycles, Discrete Math. 146 (1995) 325-328] and [M. Voigt, A non-3-choosable planar graph without cycles of length 4 and 5, 2003, Manuscript], Voigt gave a planar graph without 3-cycles and a planar graph without 4-cycles and 5-cycles which are not 3-choosable. In this note, we give smaller and easier graphs than those proposed by Voigt and suggest an extension of Erdos' relaxation of Steinberg's conjecture to 3-choosability. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
