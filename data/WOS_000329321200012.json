Multi-Spreader Routing includes Epidemic Routing and Two-Hop Forwarding as special cases, and it can manage trade-off between message delivery delay and resource consumption effectively. We analyze various performance measures of Multi-Spreader Routing with a recovery scheme called VACCINE, and we evaluate its performance. Further, through simulation experiments with real mobility trace data, we demonstrate that Multi-Spreader Routing shows stable performance in various network environments.", "paper_title": "Multi-Spreader Routing for sparsely populated mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329321200012"}
