In GMA system, driving magnetic field was provided by variable magnetic field generated by exciting coil current and offset magnetic field generated by permanent magnet. And Terfernol-D was used as the giant magnetostrictive materials (GMM). GMA's control model was analysed and the whole control system was established. In the computer digital control system, the control core were single-chip microcomputer and PC with modularization thinking. And the control algorithm was PID. Design for system's hardware and software was completed and software package was developed. Experiment shows that the GMA system is controlled automatically and monitored real-time. It lays a foundation of further improving control precision of GMA, improving the entire system's dynamic characteristics and realizing automatic control. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
