While these devices face the same information security risks as any other windows platform, NWOS devices present additional challenges to vendors and buyers throughout the product lifecycle. It appears that NWOS devices are particularly vulnerable to information security threats because of the vendors' and buyers' lack of awareness of the security risks associated with such devices. Based on evidence collected from a manufacturer of Digital Storage Oscilloscopes, the paper offers a set of challenges faced and solution applied by this vendor in its interactions with buyers. In order to reduce the vulnerability of NWOS devices, the paper considers several information security measures for the production, sales and after-sales phases. Lastly, the paper outlines the business reasoning for both vendors and buyers to pursue this information security strategy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
