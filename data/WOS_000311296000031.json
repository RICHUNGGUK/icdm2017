Functions operating on such types often end up having many similar-looking cases. Different languages often make use of similar-looking constructions. We propose a generic model of abstract syntax trees capable of representing a wide range of typed languages. Syntactic constructs can be composed in a modular fashion enabling reuse of abstract syntax and syntactic processing within and across languages. Building on previous methods of encoding extensible data types in Haskell, our model is a pragmatic solution to Wadler's \"expression problem\". Its practicality has been confirmed by its use in the implementation of the embedded language Feldspar.", "paper_title": "A Generic Abstract Syntax Model for Embedded Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000311296000031"}
