By applying Krasnosel'skii's fixed-point theorem in Banach spaces, some sufficient conditions guaranteeing the existence of at least one positive solution if f is either superlinear or sublinear are established for the above boundary value problem. The results obtained extend and complement some known results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
