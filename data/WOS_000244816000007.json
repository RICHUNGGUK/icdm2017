There is a set of criteria on which to judge sequences of product models in terms of the effective utilization of this line. In this paper, we consider three objectives, simultaneously: minimizing total utility work, total production rate variation, and total setup cost. A multi-objective sequencing problem and its mathematical formulation are described. Since this type of problem is NP-hard, a new multi-objective scatter search (MOSS) is designed for searching locally Pareto-optimal frontier for the problem. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, in terms of solution quality and diversity level, various test problems are made and the reliability of the proposed algorithm, based on some comparison metrics, is compared with three prominent multi-objective genetic algorithms, i.e. PS-NC GA, NSGA-II, and SPEA-II. The computational results show that the proposed MOSS outperforms the existing genetic algorithms, especially for the large-sized problems. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
