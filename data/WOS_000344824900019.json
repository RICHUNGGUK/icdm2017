This work was originally motivated by the CERN neutrino beam to Gran Sasso (CNGS) experiment for which the OPERA detector collaboration reported a time shift in a broad distribution with an accuracy of +/- 7.8 ns, while the fluctuation of the average time turns with +/- 23.8 ns out to be much larger. Although the physical result of a big shift has been withdrawn, statistical methods that make an identification in a broad distribution with such a small error possible remain of interest.
