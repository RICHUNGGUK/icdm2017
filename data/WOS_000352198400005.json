The Fibonacci cube Gamma(d) and the Lucas cube Lambda(d) are the graphs Q(d) (11) and Q(d) ((11) over bar), respectively. It is proved that the connectivity and the edge-connectivity of d as well as of Gamma(d) are equal to [d+2/3]. Connected generalized Lucas cubes are characterized and generalized Fibonacci cubes are proved to be 2-connected. It is asked whether the connectivity equals minimum degree also for all generalized Fibonacci/Lucas cubes. It was checked by computer that the answer is positive for all f and all d <= 9.", "paper_title": "Connectivity of Fibonacci cubes, Lucas cubes, and generalized cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000352198400005"}
