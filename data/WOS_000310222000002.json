The problem is to use the frequencies efficiently, i.e. minimize the span of frequencies used. The frequency allocation problem can be regarded as a multicoloring problem on a weighted hexagonal graph, where every vertex knows its position in the graph. We present a 1-local 7/5-competitive distributed algorithm for multicoloring a hexagonal graph, thereby improving the previous 1-local 17/12-competitive algorithm.", "paper_title": "1-Local 7/5-Competitive Algorithm for Multicoloring Hexagonal Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000310222000002"}
