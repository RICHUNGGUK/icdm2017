The tendency is to yield classification models that are biased towards the overrepresented (majority) class. This paper investigates this class imbalance problem in the context of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The consequences of the equal cost (loss) assumption on imbalanced data are formally discussed from a statistical learning theory point of view. A new cost-sensitive algorithm (CSMLP) is presented to improve the discrimination ability of (two-class) MLPs. The CSMLP formulation is based on a joint objective function that uses a single cost parameter to distinguish the importance of class errors. The learning rule extends the Levenberg-Marquadt's rule, ensuring the computational efficiency of the algorithm. In addition, it is theoretically demonstrated that the incorporation of prior information via the cost parameter may lead to balanced decision boundaries in the feature space. Based on the statistical analysis of results on real data, our approach shows a significant improvement of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and G-mean measures of regular MLPs.", "paper_title": "Novel Cost-Sensitive Approach to Improve the Multilayer Perceptron Performance on Imbalanced Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000317786000004"}
