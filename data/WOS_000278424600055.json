It is reported in the literature that the complexity of even two-machine flowshop problem, where both agents wish to complete their jobs as soon as possible, is shown NP-hard. Motivated by the limitation and suggestions, this paper proposes a branch-and-bound algorithm and a simulated annealing heuristic algorithm to search for the optimal solution and near-optimal solutions, respectively. Computational results are also presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
