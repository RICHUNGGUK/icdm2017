We call such a FA a partially blind multihead FA. We show some results regarding the decision problems and closure properties of blind multihead DFA and NFA. We also compare these devices with 1-way NFA augmented by reversal bounded counters. Finally, we also present some results regarding the simulation of a partially blind DFA and NFA by a probabilistic finite automaton. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
