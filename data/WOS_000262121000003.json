The error analysis indicates that each version will be very different when big values of the energy are involved. The stability and phase properties are examined. It is found that the new methods are P-stable The phase properties are in agreement with the error analysis. An application to the well-known Woods-Saxon resonance problem confirms the theory Some additional tests show that one of the new methods is more efficient than sixth-order EF multistep algorithms.", "paper_title": "Efficient one-step methods for the Schrodinger equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000262121000003"}
