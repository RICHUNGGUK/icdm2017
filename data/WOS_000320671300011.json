The resource reservation can be blocked due to spectrum contention of different concurrent RSVP instances (called backward blocking), and it is the predominant blocking contribution when traffic load is low and arrival highly dynamic. Also, due to its flexible traffic granularity in FBON, the backward collision would happen more frequently and the collision scenario would be more complicated than that in wavelength-routed networking; thus the need for a collision evaluation and avoiding method. So, a collision-avoiding routing with maximum available spectrum allocation (SA) options and an SA scheme to search the spectrum segment with minimum collision possibility are proposed for backward blocking reduction, as well as an extension to the RSVP-TE. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm could achieve better blocking performance through significantly reducing the backward reservation collision but with acceptable forward blocking deterioration. At the same time, with the proposed algorithm, different granularity traffic could be served more fairly in FBON.", "paper_title": "Collision-Aware Routing and Spectrum Assignment in GMPLS-Enabled Flexible-Bandwidth Optical Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000320671300011"}
