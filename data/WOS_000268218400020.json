Image gradients are good for expressing object shapes, but difficult to express the flow or movements of objects. In real painting, the use of brush strokes corresponding to the actual movement of objects allows viewers to recognize objects' motion better and thus to have an impression Of the dynamic. In this paper; we propose a novel painterly rendering algorithm to express dynamic objects based on their motion information. We first extract motion information (magnitude, direction, standard deviation) of a scene from a set of consecutive image sequences from the same view. Then the motion directions are used for determining stroke orientations in the regions with significant motions, and image gradients determine stroke orientations where little motion is observed. Our algorithm is useful for realistically and dynamically representing moving objects. We have applied our algorithm for rendering landscapes. We could segment a scene into dynamic and static regions, and express the actual movement of dynamic objects using motion based strokes.", "paper_title": "Motion based Painterly Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000268218400020"}
