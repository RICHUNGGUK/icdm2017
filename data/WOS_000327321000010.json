It has been more difficult to realize division by odd numbers, such as divide-by-3. In this paper we present simulations of an RF CMOS ILFD that can operate equally well in both divide-by-2 and divide-by-3 modes. The ILFD is based on a cross-coupled CMOS LC oscillator with direct injection and an auxiliary injection path. The paper presents two variants of the circuit architecture and Cadence simulations in the multi-GHz frequency range using a standard TSMC 65 nm CMOS process design kit.", "paper_title": "A high frequency \"divide-by-odd number\" CMOS LC injection-locked frequency divider", "paper_id": "WOS:000327321000010"}
