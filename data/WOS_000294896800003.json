They are very compactly implemented compared to single-layer optical cross-connect systems that use only WSSs. We have developed a prototype of one of the proposed HOXC architectures and experimentally confirmed its feasibility.", "paper_title": "Development of Hierarchical Optical Path Cross-Connect Systems Employing Wavelength/Waveband Selective Switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000294896800003"}
