By employing theoretical analysis, we can obtain the energy consumption in different regions of the network. The first nodal death time (FDT) and all nodal death time (ADT) are calculated and the results show that the FDT and ADT are related to the nodal transmission radius r, which has nothing to do with nodal density. Finally, the occurrence region and size of the energy hole can also be accurately obtained. The simulation results are consistent with theoretical analysis, which can be a good guidance for WSNs.
