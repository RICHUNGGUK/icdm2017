Since wireless signals do not require line-of-sight and can traverse through walls, WiSee enables novel human-computer interfaces for remote device control and building automation. Further, it achieves this goal without requiring instrumentation of the human body with sensing devices. We integrate WiSee with applications and demonstrate how WiSee enables users to use gestures and control applications including music players and gaming systems. Specifically, our demo will allow SIGCOMM attendees to control a music player and a lighting control device using gestures.", "paper_title": "Whole-Home Gesture Recognition Using Wireless Signals (Demo)", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900059"}
