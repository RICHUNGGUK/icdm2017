It is observed that the classical TV l1 and TV l2 regularization, on the one hand, do not favor higher-gradient structures over lower-gradient details as expected for structure preserving image processing, and on the other hand, tend to reduce the horizontal and vertical gradients, and thus inevitably blur the oblique edges in images. In this paper, we address these two problems by defining Oriented Total Variation l1/2 (OTV l1/2). It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that applying l1/2 regularization to the directional derivatives of images leads to superior structure preservation. OW l1/2 regularization can be applied to image denoising and video compression, and the experimental results verify that OW l1/2 outperforms other similar models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
