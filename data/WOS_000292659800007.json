We assume that attributes take values from a totally ordered domain and allow constraints that involve arithmetic comparisons. We show that the containment problem is Pi(P)(2)-complete in the general case, but remains co-NP complete for tree patterns with left semi-interval (<, <=, =) or right semi-interval (>, >=, =) attribute constraints.
