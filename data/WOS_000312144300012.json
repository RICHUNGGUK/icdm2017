The biomechanical characterisation of the small intestine allows for the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for these injuries. Studies reported in the literature focus principally on quasi-static tests, which do not take into account the stresses experienced during high kinetic trauma. In addition, the use of embalmed human tissue can alter the recorded response. The stress-strain curves from 43 tensile tests performed at 1 m/s were analysed. Samples were prepared from four fresh human intestines and from four embalmed cadaveric intestines. The data indicated a two-phase response, with each response consisting of a quasi-linear increase in the stress followed by an inflection in the curve before a peak preceding the loss of stress. The fresh tissue was more deformable than the embalmed tissue, and its first peak stress was lower (P = 0.034). A complementary histological analysis was performed. The results of the analysis enable an investigation of the response of the intestinal wall layers to stress as a two-layer structure and highlight the high sensitivity of the structure's mechanical behaviour to the speed of loading and the method of preservation.", "paper_title": "Biomechanical characterisation of fresh and cadaverous human small intestine: applications for abdominal trauma", "paper_id": "WOS:000312144300012"}
