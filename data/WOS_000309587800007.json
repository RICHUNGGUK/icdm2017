A lot of software trustworthiness evaluation (STE) models and systems have been proposed in the literature. While scholars have concentrated their efforts on the design and development of trustworthiness metrics, other STE characteristics have been neglected, such as various types of uncertainties and objective of the attribute weights determination. This paper focuses on the STE problems that include both quantitative and qualitative indicators with uncertainties. We propose an objective weight based evidential reasoning approach that employs total uncertainty measure to solve STE problems with specific trustworthiness requirements. A complex software is evaluated by the proposed STE model to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "A software trustworthiness evaluation model using objective weight based evidential reasoning approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000309587800007"}
