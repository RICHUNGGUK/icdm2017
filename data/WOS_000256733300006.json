In additional to the usual constraints of the pair correlation functions and average coordination, the code also incorporates an optional energy constraint. This energy constraint is in the form of either the Environment Dependent Interatomic Potential (applicable to silicon and carbon) and the original and modified Stillinger-Weber potentials (applicable to silicon). The code also allows porous systems to be modeled via a constraint on porosity and internal surface area using a novel restriction on the available simulation volume.", "paper_title": "HRMC: Hybrid Reverse Monte Carlo method with silicon and carbon potentials", "paper_id": "WOS:000256733300006"}
