A new notion of CA was developed according to an empirical method for modelling macroscopic phenomena: its application to PYR, a CA model for simulating pyroclastic flows, generated PYR2, which permitted an improvement of the model and a more efficient implementation. PYR2 was utilised for the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines islands and for the 1996 eruption of the Soufriere Hills in the Montserrat Island. Results of the simulations are satisfactory if the comparison between real and simulated event is performed, considering the area involved by the event and the variations of thickness of the deposit, as generated by collapsing volcanic columns.
