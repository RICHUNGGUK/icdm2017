We use an analytically-based tensor approximation approach for function-related tensors, which reduces calculations to multilinear algebra operations. The algorithm scales with N-4/3 for N computational cells used and with N-2/3 (sublinear) when magnetization is given in canonical tensor format. In the final section we confirm our theoretical results concerning computing times and accuracy by means of numerical examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
