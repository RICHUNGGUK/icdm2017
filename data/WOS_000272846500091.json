Unfortunately, their results have not been satisfied at all yet. In this paper, a new hybrid swarm intelligence algorithm consists of particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing technique and multi-type individual enhancement scheme is presented to solve the job-shop scheduling problem. The experimental results show that the new proposed job-shop scheduling algorithm is more robust and efficient than the existing algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
