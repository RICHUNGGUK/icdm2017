We show that in the Halfin-Whitt regime, the sequence of stationary distributions corresponding to the normalized state processes is tight. As a consequence, we establish an interchange of heavy-traffic and steady-state limits for GI/Ph/n + M queues.", "paper_title": "Validity of heavy-traffic steady-state approximations in many-server queues with abandonment", "paper_id": "WOS:000341866100001"}
