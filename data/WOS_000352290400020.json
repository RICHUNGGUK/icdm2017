Virtualization allows to instantiate virtual machines (VMs) on top of fewer physical systems managed by a VM manager. Performance evaluation of clouds is required to evaluate and quantify the cost-benefit of a strategy portfolio and the quality of service (QoS) experienced by end-users. Such evaluation is not feasible by means of simulation or on-the-field measurement, due to the great scale of parameter spaces that have to be traversed. In this study, we present a stochastic-queuing-network-based approach to performance analysis of migration-enabled clouds in error-prone environment. Several performance metrics are defined and evaluated: utilization, expected task completion time, and task rejection rate under different load conditions and error intensities. To validate the proposed approach, we obtain experimental performance data through a real-world cloud and conduct a confidence-interval analysis. The analysis results suggest the perfect coverage of theoretical performance results by corresponding experimental confidence intervals.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Modeling and Performance Analysis of Migration-Enabled and Error-Prone Clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000352290400020"}
