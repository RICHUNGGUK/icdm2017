We design monitors to enforce constraints for minimal siphons in a Petri net model. A key point of this paper is how to select the input and output arcs of a monitor when there exist uncontrollable and unobservable transitions. After the enforcement of constraints, an iterative algorithm is developed to obtain a controlled system with liveness. A sufficient and necessary condition is established to decide the existence of a monitor enforcing a constraint in a plant with uncontrollable and unobservable transitions.", "paper_title": "Deadlock Prevention for a Class of Petri Nets With Uncontrollable and Unobservable Transitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000303068200016"}
