By using the portal, users can instruct software modules to (virtually) move from one place (data source) to another on the Web of Data, interpret knowledge and trigger actions much in the same spirit of intelligent agents. Instructions are specified via navigational expressions in the NAUTILOD language. Such expressions are included into swget scripts that is, RDF documents that can be shared, modified, and reused. We discuss examples with real data in different scenarios showing the usefulness and potentialities of the portal. We also provide an evaluation of the performance of the portal.
