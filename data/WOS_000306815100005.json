The membrane considered here is a ceramic membrane contactor. A comprehensive mass transfer model was developed in order to predict the absorption of SO2 in N, N-dimethylaniline as solvent. The governing equations including continuity and momentum equations were solved numerically by utilizing CFD techniques. The simulations were focused on the behavior of gas and liquid phases in order to obtain the distribution of SO2 concentration in the membrane contactor. The effect of the operating parameters on the performance of the ceramic contactor was investigated. The developed model can predict the formation of concentration boundary layer in the membrane contactor. The simulation results revealed that increasing gas velocity in the contactor decreases SO2 removal. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
