In this paper, a novel graph model for document summarization is presented, that not only sentences relevance but also phrases relevance information included in sentences are utilized. In a word, we construct a phrase-sentence two-layer graph structure model (PSG) to summarize document(s). We use this model for generic document summarization and query-focused summarization. The experimental results show that our model greatly outperforms existing work.", "paper_title": "PSG: a two-layer graph model for document summarization", "paper_id": "WOS:000329625400008"}
