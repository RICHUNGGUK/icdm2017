In FMEA, the monotonicity property of the RPN scores is important. To maintain the monotonicity property of an FIS-based RPN model, a complete and monotonically-ordered fuzzy rule base is necessary. However, it is impractical to gather all (potentially a large number of) fuzzy rules from FMEA users. In this paper, we introduce a new two-stage approach to reduce the number of fuzzy rules that needs to be gathered, and to satisfy the monotonicity property. In stage-1, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to search for a small set of fuzzy rules to be gathered from FMEA users. In stage-2, the remaining fuzzy rules are deduced approximately by a monotonicity-preserving similarity reasoning scheme. The monotonicity property is exploited as additional qualitative information for constructing the FIS-based RPN model. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a real case study with information collected from a semiconductor manufacturing plant is conducted. The outcomes indicate that the proposed approach is effective in developing an FIS-based RPN model with only a small set of fuzzy rules, which is able to satisfy the monotonicity property for prioritization of failures in FMEA.", "paper_title": "A New Two-Stage Fuzzy Inference System-Based Approach to Prioritize Failures in Failure Mode and Effect Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000360794600005"}
