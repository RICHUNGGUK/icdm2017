This paper presents PERFUME, a system that simultaneously guarantees power and performance targets with flexible tradeoffs and service differentiation among co-hosted applications while assuring control accuracy and system stability. Based on the proposed fuzzy MIMO control technique, it effectively controls both the throughput and percentile-based response time of multi-tier applications due to its novel self-adaptive fuzzy modeling that integrates the strengths of fuzzy logic, MIMO control and artificial neural network. Furthermore, we address an important challenge of pro-actively avoiding violations of power and performance targets in anticipation of future workload changes. We implement PERFUME in a testbed of virtualized blade servers hosting multi-tier RUBiS applications. Performance evaluation based on synthetic and real-world Web workloads demonstrates its control accuracy, flexibility in selecting tradeoffs between conflicting targets, service differentiation capability and robustness against highly dynamic and bursty workloads. It outperforms a representative utility based approach in providing guarantee of the system throughput, percentile-based response time and power budget.", "paper_title": "Coordinated Power and Performance Guarantee with Fuzzy MIMO Control in Virtualized Server Clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000346572100010"}
