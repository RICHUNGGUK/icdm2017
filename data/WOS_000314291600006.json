This approach is based on lazy learning, and it can easily scale to datasets with tens of thousands of images and hundreds of labels. Given a test image, it first performs global scene-level matching against the training set, followed by superpixel-level matching and efficient Markov random field (MRF) optimization for incorporating neighborhood context. Our MRF setup can also compute a simultaneous labeling of image regions into semantic classes (e.g., tree, building, car) and geometric classes (sky, vertical, ground). Our system outperforms the state-of-the-art nonparametric method based on SIFT Flow on a dataset of 2,688 images and 33 labels. In addition, we report per-pixel rates on a larger dataset of 45,676 images and 232 labels. To our knowledge, this is the first complete evaluation of image parsing on a dataset of this size, and it establishes a new benchmark for the problem. Finally, we present an extension of our method to video sequences and report results on a video dataset with frames densely labeled at 1 Hz.", "paper_title": "Superparsing", "paper_id": "WOS:000314291600006"}
