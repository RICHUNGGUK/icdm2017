The OSPs were fabricated by a dispersion polymerization method and dipping method using porous micro spheres. Two representative oxygen indicator molecules, platinum octaethyl porphyrin (PtOEP) and platinum (II) meso-tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin (PtTFPP), were used to make four kinds of OSPs. A ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED, M385L2, THORLABs) with a wavelength of 383 nm, a microscope with a 20X objective lens and a high-speed camera were adopted for the high-speed imaging of OSPs. The photo-bleaching characteristics of the OSPs were compared according to the time and power of UV-LED. The dispersion-polymerized OSPs had higher photostability than the porous OSPs, and the PtTFPP-embedded porous OSPs were more stable than the PtOEP-embedded porous OSPs due to the molecular structural characteristics. The dispersion-polymerized OSPs incorporated with PtOEP were more stable than the dispersion-polymerized OSPs incorporated with PtTFPP.", "paper_title": "Photo-bleaching characteristics of oxygen-sensitive particles", "paper_id": "WOS:000353409400017"}
