The properties are written in PSL, under the form of assertions in declarative form. The method includes the construction of a library of primitive digital components for the PSL temporal and sequence operators. These building blocks are interconnected to construct complex properties, resulting in a synthesizable digital module that can be properly linked to the digital system under scrutiny.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of property monitors for online fault detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000256095700007"}
