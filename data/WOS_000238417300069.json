The system changes the forecast as new data is received. We encapsulate the model code and apply an ensemble Kalman filter in time-space with a highly parallel implementation. In this paper, we discuss how we will demonstrate that our system works using a DDDAS testbed approach and data collected from an earlier fire.", "paper_title": "Demonstrating the validity of a wildfire DDDAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300069"}
