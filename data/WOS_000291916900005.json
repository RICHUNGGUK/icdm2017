This new attempt applies artificial intelligent algorithms to intelligentise LSA by discovering suitability classification rules. The methodology is implemented as a tool called ACO-LSA. The tool can generate rules which are straightforward and comprehensible for users with high classification accuracy and simple rule list in solving CRD problems. A case study in the Macintyre Brook Catchment of southern Queensland in Australia is proposed to demonstrate the feasibility of this new modeling technique. The results have addressed the major advantages of this novel approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
