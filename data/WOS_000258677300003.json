We develop a formula for the asymptotic variance rate of the form lambda* + Sigma v(i) where lambda* is the rate of outputs and v (i) are functions of the birth and death rates. We show that if the birth rates are non-increasing and the death rates are non-decreasing (as is common in many queueing systems) then the values of v(i) are strictly negative and thus the limiting index of dispersion of counts of the output process is less than unity. In the M/M/1/K case, our formula evaluates to a closed form expression that shows the following phenomenon: When the system is balanced, i.e. the arrival and service rates are equal, Sigma v(i)/lambda* is minimal. The situation is similar for the M/M/c/K queue, the Erlang loss system and some PH/PH/1/K queues: In all these systems there is a pronounced decrease in the asymptotic variance rate when the system parameters are balanced.", "paper_title": "The asymptotic variance rate of the output process of finite capacity birth-death queues", "paper_id": "WOS:000258677300003"}
