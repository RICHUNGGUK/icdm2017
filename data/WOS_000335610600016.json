The building blocks as well as possible configurations are discussed. The methods to avoid pitfalls and face the challenges in the future for expanding the testbed are indicated. The testbed was planned to be flexible and able to test various applications and services as well as to run hundreds of applications. The testbed provides an opportunity to build a number of sample operator networks, that is, Autonomous Systems (ASS). The setting has been used to emulate a system of peer-to-peer swarms in the multi-operator environment with the economic traffic management concepts tested. A short illustration of the study is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
