The decomposition is performed on the space of the optimization input arguments. The method is firstly tested on the optimization of the mathematical functions. Afterwards, the decomposition method is used to optimize the geometry of a guide vane blade of a reversible water turbine. The objectives of the optimization are the maximal efficiency of the whole turbine and the minimal volume of a single blade with the condition that the blade remains undamaged during the normal operation of the turbine. The fluid analysis is performed with the use of the finite volume method, while the structural analysis is performed either with the finite element method or with the meshless method. The comparison of the two structural analysis methods shows that they have a different result sensitivity about the mesh distortion. A comparison of optima, obtained on the basis of both structural analysis methods, is made in order to assess the impact of the mesh distortion on results of the design optimization.", "paper_title": "Structure and fluid optimization of the guide vane blade with the decomposition of the optimization problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000350896500015"}
