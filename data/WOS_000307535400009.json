Such a large-scale biometric system needs to consider template protection, accuracy and efficiency issues. This is a challenging problem since there are tradeoffs among these three issues. In order to simultaneously handle these issues, we extract both global and local features via controlling the sparsity of random bases without training. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused with a sequential classifier. In the proposed system, the random basis features are not stored for security reason. The non-training based on feature extraction followed by a sequential learning contributes to computational efficiency. The overall accuracy is consequently improved via an ensemble of classifiers. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system using equal error rate under a stolen-token scenario. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is robust over severe local deformation with efficient computation for simultaneous transactions. Although we focus on face biometrics in this paper, the proposed method is generic and can be applied to other biometric traits.", "paper_title": "Service-oriented architecture based on biometric using random features and incremental neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000307535400009"}
