This brings on the visual information retrieved from adjacent camera nodes usually exhibits high levels of correlation. In this paper, first, based on the analysis of 3D directional sensing model of camera sensor nodes, a correlation model is proposed by measuring the intersection area of multiple camera nodes' field of views. In this model, there is a asymmetrical relationship of the correlation between two camera nodes. Then, to farthest eliminate the data redundancy and use the node collaboration characteristic of wireless (multimedia) sensor networks, two kinds of cluster structure, camera sensor nodes cluster, and common sensor nodes cluster are established to cooperate on image processing and transmission tasks. A set of experiments are performed to investigate the proposed correlation coefficient. Further simulations based on a sample of monitoring a crossing by three correlative camera nodes show that the proposed network topology and image fusion and transmission scheme released the pressure of camera node greatly and reduce the network energy consumption of communication of the whole network efficiently.", "paper_title": "A Camera Nodes Correlation Model Based on 3D Sensing in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000311444300001"}
