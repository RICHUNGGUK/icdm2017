Novel methods to study the global dynamical behavior of these systems are proposed. Employing the properties of diffusion operator and the method of delayed inequalities analysis, we investigate global exponential stability, positive invariant sets and global attracting sets of the neural networks under consideration. Furthermore, conditions sufficient for the existence and uniqueness of periodic attractors for periodic neural networks are derived and the existence range of the attractors is estimated. Finally two examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of these results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
