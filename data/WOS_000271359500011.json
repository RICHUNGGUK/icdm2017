Our purpose is to elaborate daily assignment of employees to workstations in order to minimize simultaneously the operational costs and personnel dissatisfactions. The proposed approach considers the individual competencies, mobility and preferences of each employee, as well as the personnel and competency requirements associated with each assembly activity given both the current master assembly schedule and the line balancing for each product. To benchmark the performance of the multi-agent approach, we use optimal solutions obtained through a linear programming model resolution using a commercial solver. Experimental results show that our multi-agent approach can produce high-quality and efficient solutions in a short computational time. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
