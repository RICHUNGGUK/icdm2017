The method extracts features by employed discreate cosine transform (DCT) and Gabor wavelets, and then fuses then independent features which are extracted with ICA respectively As a holistic feature extraction method, the DCT converts high-dimensional face images into low-dimensional spaces in which more significant facial features such as outline of hair and face, position of eyes, nose and mouth are maintained. On the contrary, the Gabor wavelets transformed face images exhibit strong characteristics of spatial locality, scale and orientation selectivity. which produce salient local features For this reason, Gabor features are more suitable for face recognition So, we used Gabor wavelets for the local features and then integrated Gabor features with DCT coefficients Furthermore, because ICA can reduce redundant features and represent more explicitly the independent features which are most useful for subsequent pattern discrimination and associative recall, ICA has been used for extracting then independent features respectively. And then, the independence property of the independent Gabor features and DCT features is applied to the support vector machine (SVM) for classification Finally, the computer simulation illustrates the efficiency of this method on Georgia Tech face database and ORL face database", "paper_title": "ICA-BASED FEATURES FUSION FOR FACE RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400028"}
