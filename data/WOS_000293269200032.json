For this purpose, we use underground images obtained with ground penetrating radar (GPR) as a method that does not alter the system conditions and environmental characteristics (non-destructive methods). The study focuses on wave amplitude and uses intensive matrix manipulation. We obtain promising results as the methodology, which is non-subjective and repeatable, visualizes buried pipes with efficiency. This tool will help WSS managers obtain a more accurate picture of WSS and so offer a better service to users. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
