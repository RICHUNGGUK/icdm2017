Using this fact, a new monitoring statistic is defined whose value for given m depends on the pattern parameters but not on the process parameters. A control chart for this statistic for given m, therefore, will be globally applicable to normal processes. The simulation study reveals that the proposed statistic approximately follows normal distribution. The performances of the globally applicable control chart in terms of average run lengths (ARLs) are evaluated and compared with the X chart. Both in-control ARL and out-of-control ARLs with respect to different abnormal process conditions are found to be larger than the X chart. However, the proposed concept is promising because it can eliminate the burden of designing separate control charts for different quality characteristics or processes in a manufacturing set-up.", "paper_title": "Globally applicable control chart for online monitoring of stability of process mean", "paper_id": "WOS:000299727100006"}
