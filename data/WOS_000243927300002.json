We extend previous work on pretenuring as follows: (1) We produce pretenuring advice that is neutral with respect to the garbage collector algorithm and configuration. We thus can and do combine advice from different applications. We find for our benchmarks that predictions using object lifetimes at each allocation site in Java programs are accurate, which simplifies the pretenuring implementation. (2) We gather and apply advice to both applications and Jikes RVM, a compiler and runtime system for Java written in Java. Our results demonstrate that building combined advice into Jikes RVM from different application executions improves performance, regardless of the application Jikes RVM is compiling and executing. This build-time advice thus gives user applications some benefits of pretenuring, without any application profiling. No previous work uses profile feedback to pretenure in the runtime system. (3) We find that application-only advice also consistently improves performance, but that the combination of build-time and application-specific advice is almost always noticeably better. (4) Our same advice improves the performance of generational, Older First, and Beltway collectors, illustrating that it is collector neutral. (5) We include an immortal allocation space in addition to a nursery and older generation, and show that pretenuring to immortal space has substantial benefit.", "paper_title": "Profile-based pretenuring", "paper_id": "WOS:000243927300002"}
