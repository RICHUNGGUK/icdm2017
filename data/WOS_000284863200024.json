The integration of fuzzy Delphi method, the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique, and the analytic network process (ANP) is employed to construct a technology selection model regarding the economic and industrial prospects. On the other hand, the patent co-citation approach (PCA) is applied to objectively draw key technology fields as technology alternatives for the technology selection model from patent data. The emerging organic light emitting diode (OLED) display technology is used as a case in order to verify the applicability of proposed a novel hybrid MCDM method for the best technology selection. The result of this hybrid process can help top managers of technology-based companies or policy makers of governments to more objectively and effectively determine future research and development direction.
