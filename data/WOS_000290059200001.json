However, sensitivity analysis has been proved to be a useful tool in the car and aircraft industries. Evaluation of sensitivity analysis is a mandatory step in the way towards an efficient automated optimum design process which would represent a huge jump in the conception of long span bridges. Some of the authors of this paper were pioneers in establishing a methodology for obtaining the sensitivity analysis of flutter speed in suspension bridges a few years ago. That approach was completely analytical and required the evaluation of many matrices related to the phenomenon. In those works the total mass of the deck was considered as constant and such a circumstance supposed a limitation of the method. In the present paper the complete analytical formulation of the sensitivity analysis problem in bridges considering variable deck mass is presented, as well as its application to the design problem of the Great Belt Bridge. Analytical evaluation of sensitivities is a time demanding task, and in order to avoid excessive computation times, distributed computing strategies have been implemented which can be considered as an additional benefit of this approach. For the application example, it has been found that deck cross-section area and torsional inertia are the structural properties with the greatest influence on the flutter performance.
