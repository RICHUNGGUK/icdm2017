Meanwhile, to maximize its profit, the MCSP needs an online management mechanism to operate the hybrid cloud efficiently. In this paper, we study how to maximize an MCSP's profit from provisioning multimedia services to geographically distributed users with a hybrid cloud. We first design a service provisioning model to manage the resources in the hybrid cloud. Here, in order to make the model practical and address the different situations in private and public clouds, we consider different time granularities for resource reservations. Then, we leverage the Lyapunov optimization technique to maximize the profit of MCSP and propose an online algorithm that can manage the hybrid cloud in the distributed manner. Specifically, the algorithm determines the access control and routing of each multimedia service request, and allocates the resources in the hybrid cloud accordingly. We also apply the epsilon-persistent technique to ensure that the worst-case latency of the provisioned requests is bounded. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated with extensive simulations using both synthetical and real traces. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm can manage the hybrid cloud efficiently and maximize the profit of MCSP.", "paper_title": "Distributed Online Hybrid Cloud Management for Profit-Driven Multimedia Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358233000015"}
