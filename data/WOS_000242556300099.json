An Immune Clonal Selection Scheduling Algorithm (ICSSA) is proposed by applying ICSA to the input-queued packet switch scheduling in this paper. ICSSA is compared with other previous algorithms about two performance measures: the average delay and the maximum throughput of the switch. Closed-form expressions for these measures are derived under uniform i.i.d. Bernoulli, diagonal and bursty traffic model. The experimental results show that better performances can be obtained by ICSSA, and 100% throughput can be guaranteed for these traffic models.", "paper_title": "An immune clonal selection scheduling algorithm for input-queued switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300099"}
