For d(1) > d(2) >= d(3) and t >= 3, denote by T-a the tree formed from a path P-t on t vertices by attaching d(1) - 1 P-2's on one end and d(2) - 1 P-2's on the other end of the path P-t, and T-b the tree formed from Pt+2 by attaching d(1) - 1 P-2's on an end of the Pt+2 and d(2) - 2 P-2's on the vertex next to the end. In [14] Yen showed that among trees of order n and two vertices of maximum degree d(1) and second maximum degree d(2) > (12), the maximal energy tree is either the graph T-a or the graph T-b, where t = n + 4 - 2d(1) - 2d(2) >= 3. However, she could not determine which one of T-a and T-b is the maximal energy tree. This is because the quasi-order method is invalid for comparing their energies. In this paper, we use a new method to determine the maximal energy tree. We prove that the maximal energy tree is T-b if d(1) >= 7, d(2) >= 3 or d(1) = 6, d(2) = 3. Moreover, for d(1) = 4 and d(2) = 3, the maximal energy tree is the graph T-b if t = 4, and the graph T-a otherwise. For other cases, the maximal energy tree is the graph T-a if (i) d(1) = 5, d(2) = 4, t is odd and 3 <= t <= 45. (ii) d(1) = 5, d(2) = 3, t is odd and 3 <= t <= 29, (iii) d(1) = 6, d(2) = 5, t = 3,5,7, (iv) d(1) = 6, d(2) = 4, t = 5; and for all the remaining cases, the maximal energy tree is the graph T-b.", "paper_title": "On the Maximal Energy Trees with One Maximum and One Second Maximum Degree Vertex", "paper_id": "WOS:000301817800019"}
