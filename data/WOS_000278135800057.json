This can often be an obstacle for efficient data exchange and interactive work with such objects. We propose to replace such large polygon meshes with a relatively small set of coefficients of the patchwise partial differential equation (PDE) function representation. With this model, the approximations of the original shapes can be rendered with any desired resolution at interactive rates. Our approach can directly work with any common 3D reconstruction pipeline, which we demonstrate by applying it to a large reconstructed medical data set with irregular geometry.", "paper_title": "A PDE method for patchwise approximation of large polygon meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800057"}
