This is done by demonstrating that the problem of constructing central difference stencils that have minimal dispersion error in the infinity norm can be recast into a problem of approximating a continuous function from a finite dimensional subspace with a basis forming a Chebyshev set. In this new formulation, characterising and numerically obtaining optimised schemes can be done using established theory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
