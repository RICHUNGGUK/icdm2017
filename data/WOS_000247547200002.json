This paper shows how to map any Boolean function into an arbitrary programmable logic block (PLB) architecture without any custom decomposition techniques. The authors illustrate several useful applications of this technique by showing how this technique can be used for architecture evaluation and area optimization. When evaluating the FPGA architecture, the authors focus on the basic building block of the FPGA, which they refer to as PLB. In order to illustrate the flexibility of their evaluation framework, several unrelated PLB architectures are evaluated in an automated fashion. Furthermore, the authors show that using their technique is able to reduce FPGA resource usage by 27% on average in common subcircuits found in digital design.", "paper_title": "FPGA PLB architecture evaluation and area optimization techniques using Boolean satisfiability", "paper_id": "WOS:000247547200002"}
