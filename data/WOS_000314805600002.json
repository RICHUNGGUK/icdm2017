This advanced feature, recognized as application mobility, brings many challenges to the pervasive computing community. For a better understanding of the challenges and existing approaches to application mobility, this paper surveys related work with a classification and comparison framework established along four dimensions of design concerns in application migration: temporal, spatial, entity and other concerns. Through this survey this paper attempts to provide a systematic reference for developers to leverage off among different migration strategies for seamless application mobility. Moreover, it sheds some light on future work directions. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
