The dynamics is described by the Euler equations, and numerical approximations are computed using state-of-the-art high-resolution finite-volume schemes. These schemes are based upon an explicit time discretisation and are therefore ideal candidates for parallel implementation.", "paper_title": "Solving the Euler equations on graphics processing units", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500034"}
