While existing approaches detect noisy probes based on external information such as genomic alignments, we introduce and validate a targeted probabilistic method for analyzing probe reliability directly from expression data and independently of the noise source. This provides insights into the various sources of probe-level noise and gives tools to guide probe design.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Analysis of Probe Reliability in Differential Gene Expression Studies with Short Oligonucleotide Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000283926400019"}
