Such optical networks generally employ wavelength routing at intermediate nodes and are known as wavelength-routed optical networks (WRONs). In WRON-based long-haul networks, optical reach (OR) of a transponder represents the maximum distance over which its optical signal can travel without any optical/electrical/optical regeneration and plays a significant role in deciding the power consumption and cost of the optical layer. In IP-over-WDM network setting, IP routers are directly interfaced with WRON and bandwidth requests are equal to the lightpath capacity. In IP-over-MPLS-over-WDM network setting, IP routers are interfaced with WRON via MPLS routers and bandwidth requests arrive as label-switched paths, which are generally lower than the lightpath capacity. We examine the above networks with mixed-OR nodes (transponders in each WRON node having different OR values but all transmitting at 10 Gbps) and fixed-OR nodes (transponders in each WRON node having same OR value and 10 Gbps transmission rate). In this investigation, two types of control planes are considered, namely unified control plane and isolated control plane. The network with unified control plane supports automated and dynamic resource provisioning for both short-term and long-term bandwidth requests. The study on nonautomated network using isolated control plane considers resource provisioning only for long-term bandwidth requests. Simulation-based network provisioning is carried out using C++, considering appropriate traffic models, OR constraints, node configurations and network architectures. The results of our simulations indicate in general how OR of the transponders can influence the total network cost and power consumption in optical layer. Overall, the nonautomated networks with mixed-OR configuration are found to save power and offer lower cost with respect to fixed-OR configuration, while the automated networks with mixed-OR configuration can save power while the cost increases with respect to fixed-OR option.", "paper_title": "On methodologies to estimate optical-layer power consumption and cost for long-haul WDM networks with optical reach constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000348133600002"}
