In this paper, we investigate nonuniform complexity classes of w-machine, based on three complexity measures, namely, size, time, and word length. We show that the class of languages which can be generated by constant size nonuniform w-machines contain infinitely many Turing undecidable languages. Also, we show that polynomial size nonuniform w-machines generate all NP languages, and every NP-hard language requires at least polynomial time and polynomial size nonuniform w-machines to be generated. We prove that the class of languages which can be generated by polynomial size nonuniform w-machines is equal to NP/poly, and almost all languages require exponential size and polynomial time nonuniform w-machines to be generated.", "paper_title": "On the complexity of nonuniform wavelength-based machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000335748600012"}
