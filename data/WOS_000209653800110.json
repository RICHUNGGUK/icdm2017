To support the ever-growing cloud computing needs, the number of servers in today's data centers are increasing exponentially, which in turn leads to enormous challenges in designing an efficient and cost-effective data center network. With data availability and security at stake, the issues with data center networks are more critical than ever. Motivated by these challenges and critical issues, many novel and creative research works have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we investigate in data center networks and provide a general overview and analysis of the literature covering various research areas, including data center network interconnection architectures, network protocols for data center networks, and network resource sharing in multitenant cloud data centers. We start with an overview on data center networks and together with its requirements navigate the data center network designs. We then present the research literature related to the aforementioned research topics in the subsequent sections. Finally, we draw the conclusions.", "paper_title": "Rethinking the Data Center Networking: Architecture, Network Protocols, and Resource Sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800110"}
