In particular, this class of functions is proven to be bent for a special case. Although it is shown that the obtained bent functions are equivalent to the Leander-Kholosha's class of bent functions, a direct and much simpler proof for the bentness of this kind of Niho functions is provided.", "paper_title": "On the Walsh Transform of a Class of Functions From Niho Exponents", "paper_id": "WOS:000321925900038"}
