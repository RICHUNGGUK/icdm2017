These specimens were scaled to 40% and represented the lower three stories of a six-storied RC building. The main purposes of the experimental tests were to evaluate the shear behavior and to identify the influence of opening ratios on the cracks distribution and shear strength of RC structural walls. The shear strength of the specimens was estimated by combining the shear strength of structural wall without openings and the reduction factor that takes into account the openings. Experimental and analytical results showed that the shear strength was different depending on the loading direction due to opening locations. A two-dimensional finite element analysis was carried out to simulate the performance of the tested specimens. The constructed finite elements model simulated the lateral load-drift angle relations quite well.", "paper_title": "Investigation of the shear behaviour of multi-story reinforced concrete walls with eccentric openings", "paper_id": "WOS:000310406500003"}
