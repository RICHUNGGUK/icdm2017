Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the approach. The results show that, the approach can be used to reveal the dynamic fracture mechanisms of concrete structures by considering the trans-scale coupling process from mesa-damage to local failure in vulnerable area and eventually to structural failure; and it can obtain satisfactory results with sufficient precision and lower cost, especially for large scale computations.
