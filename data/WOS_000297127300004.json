We aim to detect and track the face and eyes of the driver during several driving scenarios, allowing for further understanding of a driver's visual search pattern behavior. Traditionally, detection and tracking of objects in visual media has been performed using specific techniques. These techniques vary in terms of their robustness and computational cost. This research proposes a real-time framework that is built upon a foundation synonymous to boosting, which we extend from learners to trackers and demonstrate that the idea of an integrated framework employing multiple trackers is advantageous in forming a globally strong tracking methodology. In order to model the effectiveness of trackers, a confidence parameter is introduced to help minimize the errors produced by incorrect matches and allow more effective trackers with a higher confidence value to correct the perceived position of the target.", "paper_title": "A real-time framework for eye detection and tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000297127300004"}
