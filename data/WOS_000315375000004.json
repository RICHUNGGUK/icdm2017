In this approach, we divide an execution sequence into several sections and compute the pattern distribution in each section. The distribution of all patterns is then used as features to train a classifier. This approach outperforms conventional frequency based methods by more effectively identifying software failures occurring through misused software patterns. Comparative experiments show the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Using Pattern Position Distribution for Software Failure Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000315375000004"}
