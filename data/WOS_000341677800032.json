The new method contains three phases. First, the image is partitioned into small regions modeled by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and the GMM is solved by an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with a newly proposed Image Reconstruction Criterion, named EM-IRC. Second, the distances among the GMM components are measured using Kullbacic-Leibler (KL) divergence, and a revised Floyd's algorithm developed from Zadeh's operations is used to build the similarity matrix based on those distances. Finally, spectral clustering is applied to this improved similarity matrix to merge the GMM components, i.e., the corresponding small image regions, to obtain the final segmentation result. Our contributions include the new EM-IRC algorithm, the revised Floyd's algorithm, and the novel overall framework. The experimental evaluation on the IRIS dataset and the real-world image segmentation problem demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
