The end-to-end security for mobile applications can be made robust by developing dynamic schemes at application level which makes use of the existing security techniques varying in terms of space, time, and attacks complexities. In this paper we present a security techniques selection scheme for mobile transactions, called the Transactions-Based Security Scheme (TBSS). The TBSS uses intelligence to study, and analyzes the security implications of transactions under execution based on certain criterion such as user behaviors, transaction sensitivity levels, and credibility factors computed over the previous transactions by the users, network vulnerability, and device characteristics. The TBSS identifies a suitable level of security techniques from the repository, which consists of symmetric, and asymmetric types of security algorithms arranged in three complexity levels, covering various encryption/decryption techniques, digital signature schemes, and hashing techniques. From this identified level, one of the techniques is deployed randomly. The results shows that, there is a considerable reduction in security cost compared to static schemes, which employ pre-fixed security techniques to secure the transactions data.
