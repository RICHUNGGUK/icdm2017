The new algorithm, RETE-ADH, extends RETE to enhance systems that are based on the composite context-aware service architecture. RETE-ADH increases the speed of matching by searching only a subset of the rules that can be matched. In addition, RETE-ADH is scalable and suitable for parallelization. We describe the design of the proposed algorithm and present experimental results from a simulated smart office environment to compare the proposed algorithm with other pattern matching algorithms, showing that the proposed algorithm outperforms original RETE by 85%.", "paper_title": "RETE-ADH: An Improvement to RETE for Composite Context-Aware Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000335299000001"}
