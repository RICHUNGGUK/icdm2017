These chatterbots were further loaded with varying degrees of conversational, telecommunications, and terrorism knowledge. From our prior experiments using 347 participants, we obtained 33 446 human/chatterbot interactions. It was found that asking the ALICE chatterbots \"are\" and \"where\" questions resulted in higher response satisfaction levels, as compared to other interrogative-style inputs because of their acceptability to vague, binary, or cliched chatterbot responses. We also found a relationship between the length of a query and the users perceived satisfaction of the chatterbot response, where shorter queries led to more satisfying responses.", "paper_title": "Interaction Analysis of the ALICE Chatterbot: A Two-Study Investigation of Dialog and Domain Questioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000272844600004"}
