Our approach is based on SECTET-PL [5], a predicative language for modeling access rights based on the concept of Role Based Access Control (RBAC). SECTET-PL is part of the SECTET framework for model-driven security for 13213 workflows. Our Rights Delegation Model combines the concept of roles from RBAC with the predicative specification of SECTET-PL. The Rights Delegation Models are translated into XACML Delegation Policies, which are interpreted by a security gateway.", "paper_title": "A framework for modeling restricted delegation in service oriented architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000241622700015"}
