A downhill dominating set DDS is a set S subset of V having the property that every vertex v is an element of V lies on a downhill path originating from some vertex in S. The downhill domination number gamma(dn)(G) equals the minimum cardinality of a DDS of G. A DDS having minimum cardinality is called a gamma(dn)-set of G. In this note, we give an enumeration of all the distinct gamma(dn)-sets of G, and we show that there is a linear time algorithm to determine the downhill domination number of a graph.
