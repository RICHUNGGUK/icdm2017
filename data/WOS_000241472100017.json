Within this formulation, the learning problem for the multilayer perceptron lies in terms of finding a function which is an extrernal for some functional. As we will see, a variational formulation for the multilayer perceptron provides a direct method for the solution of general variational problems, in any dimension and up to any degree of accuracy. In order to validate this technique we use a multilayer perceptron to solve some classical problems in the calculus of variations.", "paper_title": "A variational formulation for the multilayer perceptron", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100017"}
