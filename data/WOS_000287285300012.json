Current localization algorithms mainly focus on checking the localizability of a network and/or how to localize as many nodes as possible given a static set of anchor nodes and distance measurements. In this paper, we study a new optimization problem, minimum cost localization problem, which aims to localize all sensors in a network using the minimum number (or total cost) of anchor nodes given the distance measurements. We show this problem is very challenging and then present a set of greedy algorithms using both trilateration and local sweep operations to address the problem. Extensive simulations have been conducted and demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
