Dvir, P. Gopalan, and S. Yekhanin (2010, 2011) [2,3] proposed an elementary construction of bounded family of matching vectors with size k = 1/m'+1(m'/n-1)((n-1)/2) for m' >= n and ((n-1)(m')) for m' < n. This parameter, however, is not optimized. In this paper, we improve their results by establishing a new construction with larger size, i.e., k = (m'+1/n-2)((n-2)/2) for m' >= n and ((n)(m')) for m' < n. This yields a Matching Vector code with more information bits, when the length of the codewords, i.e., N = m(n), is fixed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
