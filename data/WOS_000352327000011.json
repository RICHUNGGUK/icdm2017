The paper investigates application of contact algorithm to eliminate the interpenetration and introduces a stiffness correction in volumes made redundant because of coincidence of the embedded and the host meshes. Different fibre configurations (two intersecting yarns and a 3D woven reinforced composite) are considered and a good agreement is observed between the continuously meshed and EE models in prediction of the homogenised properties and strain-stress profiles in loaded unit cells.
