In this paper, we introduce some basic concepts of sparse signal processing theory, and then apply it to the traditional radar imaging system to get the mathematical model of sparse microwave imaging system. We analyze the factors that determine the performance of sparse microwave imaging radar, including scene, waveform and platform. According to the radar model, we analyze how these factors influence the radar system and how to optimize them. Simulation results of the sparse microwave imaging radar system are also provided.", "paper_title": "Influence factors of sparse microwave imaging radar system performance: approaches to waveform design and platform motion analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000308814500013"}
