While theoretical investigations have long been concentrated mainly on unimolecular decompositions, bimolecular reactions have received little theoretical attention. In this paper, we investigate theoretically the bimolecular reactions between nitromethane (CH3NO2)-the simplest nitro-containing explosive-and its decomposition products, such as NO2, NO and CO, that are abundant during the decomposition process of CH3NO2. The structures and potential energy surface (PES) were explored at B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3P86/6-31G(d) and MP2/6-311+G(d,p) levels, and energies were refined using CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ methods. Quantum chemistry calculations revealed that the title reactions possess small barriers that can be comparable to, or smaller than, that of the initial decomposition reactions of CH3NO2. Considering that their reactants are abundant in the decomposition process of CH3NO2, we consider bimolecular reactions also to be of great importance, and worthy of further investigation. Moreover, our calculations show that NO2 can be oxidized by CH3NO2 to NO3 radical, which confirms the conclusion reached formerly by Irikura and Johnson [(2006) J Phys Chem A 110: 13974-13978] that NO3 radical can be formed during the decomposition of nitramine explosives.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study of the reaction mechanism of CH3NO2 with NO2, NO and CO: the bimolecular reactions that cannot be ignored", "paper_id": "WOS:000348306800016"}
