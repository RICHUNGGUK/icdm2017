Based on a multiple linear copositive Lyapunov function, and by using the average dwell time approach, some sufficient stability criteria of global uniform exponential stability are established in both the continuous-time and the discrete-time cases, respectively. Finally, some numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of switched positive linear systems with stable and unstable subsystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340193600002"}
