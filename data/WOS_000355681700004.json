To benefit fully from MBT, automation support is required. The goal of this systematic review is determining the current state of the art of prominent MBT tool support where we focus on tools that rely on state-based models. We automatically searched different source of information including digital libraries and mailing lists dedicated to the topic. Precisely defined criteria are used to compare selected tools and comprise support for test adequacy and coverage criteria, level of automation for various testing activities and support for the construction of test scaffolding. Simple adequacy criteria are supported but not advanced ones; data(-flow) criteria are seldom supported; support for creating test scaffolding varies a great deal. The results of this review should be of interest to a wide range of stakeholders: software companies interested in selecting the most appropriate MBT tool for their needs; organizations willing to invest into creating MBT tool support; researchers interested in setting research directions.", "paper_title": "A systematic review of state-based test tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000355681700004"}
