This paper presents two variants of the FRQR algorithm in order to improve its performance: 1) Combining Fuzzy-Rough Dependency Degree with Correlation-based FS merit to deal with a dilemma situation in feature subset selection and 2) Hybridizing the newly proposed method with the threshold based FRQR. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches are proven over sixteen UCI datasets; smaller subsets of features and higher classification accuracies are achieved.", "paper_title": "Novel Improvements on the Fuzzy-Rough QuickReduct Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589100029"}
