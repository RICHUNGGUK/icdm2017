Due to the uncertainty of vehicle arrivals, a signal timing plan optimized with a fixed demand pattern may lead to ineffective control. In response to this need, this study adopts the theory of interval analysis and defines a set of demand intervals to represent the demand fluctuations. Depending on the demand interval patterns, an optimization model is proposed to maximize the overall robustness of signal design while maintaining an acceptable level of efficiency. A recursive two-stage solution procedure is also developed to solve the optimization problem. To ensure the global optimization, a modified branch-and-bound algorithm is developed for the exploration of solutions. The extensive experimental analyses in comparison with the deterministic optimization model reveal that the proposed model is quite promising for applications, especially under highly fluctuated demand patterns.
