For commodity hardware, tomorrow's performance gains will instead come from multi-core architectures in which a whole set of CPUs executes concurrently. Taking advantage of the full power of multi-core processors for network intrusion prevention requires an in-depth approach. In this work we frame an architecture customized for parallel execution of network attack analysis. At the lowest layer of the architecture is an 'Active Network Interface', a custom device based on an inexpensive FPGA platform. The analysis itself is structured as an event-based system, which allows us to find many opportunities for concurrent execution, since events introduce a natural asynchrony into the analysis while still maintaining good cache locality. A preliminary evaluation demonstrates the potential of this architecture.
