Each packet has, in addition to its source and its destination, a release time and a deadline. The goal of an algorithm is to maximize the number of packets that arrive to their destinations by their respective deadlines, given the network constraints. We consider the line network, and a setting where each node has a buffer of size B packets (where B can be finite or infinite), and each edge has capacity Ca parts per thousand yen1. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to study time-constrained scheduling in a setting when buffers can be of limited size. We give approximation algorithms that achieve expected approximation ratio of O(max {log (au) n-log (au) B,1}+max {log I-au a'log pound (au) C,1}), where n is the length of the line, and I pound is the maximum slack a message can have (the slack is the number of time steps a message can be idle and still arrive within its deadline). A special case of our setting is the setting of buffers of unlimited capacity and edge capacities 1, which has been previously studied by Adler et al. (Theory Comput. Syst. 35(6):599-623, 2002). For this case our results considerably improve upon previous results: We obtain an approximation ratio of O(min{log*n,log*Sigma,log*M}) (where M is the number of messages in the instance), which is a significant improvement upon the results of Adler et al. who obtained a guarantee of O(min {log n,log I pound,log M}).", "paper_title": "Approximation Algorithms for Time-Constrained Scheduling on Line Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000295519200009"}
