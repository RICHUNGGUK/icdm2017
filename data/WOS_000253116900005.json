This paper develops a general approach and a system toot for digitization agile process preparation (DAPP). First, according to modern manufacturing concept and the bottleneck problems of computer integrated manufacturing system (CIMS), a concept of DAPP is proposed. Secondly, after analysis of the characteristics of the process preparation system (DAPPS), the needs for DAPPS are explored in depth. Thirdly a framework is proposed to support DAPPS by providing computer-aided and database environments for DAPPS, advisory tools for product structure manufacturability, evaluation, rapid process planning, tooling design, process consumption determination as well as field process preparation, and knowledge bases incorporated in the advisory tools. Fourthly, according to the framework, a design support strategy for DAPPS is investigated to guide the coordination of preparation activities. Finally, based on the proposed approach and strategy, the system prototype has been developed employing the knowledge-based approach. The results of this research will facilitate the rationalization of process preparation and thus shorten the preparation time. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
