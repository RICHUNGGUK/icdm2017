Due to the revolutionary new technologies of biological data collection, an enormous amount of information on specific factors and genes responsible for cell differentiation is available. However, the mechanisms controlling stem cell self-renewal, maintenance and differentiation are still poorly understood and there exists no general characterization of stem cells based on observable cell properties. We address these problems with the help of mathematical models. Stem cells are described as the cell type that is most responsive to certain environmental signals. This results in a dynamic characterization of stemness that depends on environmental conditions and is not necessarily linked to a unique cell population. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
