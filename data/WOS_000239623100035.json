Our goal is to cope with changing illumination condition by on-line adapting both the parametric color model and its structure/complexity. Other authors used parametric statistics to model color distribution in segmentation and tracking problems, but with a fixed complexity model. Our approach is able to on-line adapt also the complexity of the model, to cope with large variations in the scene illumination and color temperature.", "paper_title": "On-line color calibration in non-stationary environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623100035"}
