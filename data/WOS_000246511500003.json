Members of a group belong to organizations in which each one fulfils general and specific enterprise objectives. This paper presents a proposal, from the perspective of the CSCW (Computer-Supported Cooperative Work) systems, for modelling enterprise organization and developing groupware applications. This research work focuses on two specific models for the proposal: a conceptual domain model formalized through a domain ontology, and a system model built using a UML-based notation. The second stems from the first and each provides a Computation Independent View (CIV) with different objectives. Respectively, they allow a common vocabulary for knowledge sharing to be established, and organization functional requirements to be specified, particularly those concerning communication, coordination and collaboration. Furthermore, these models are part of a concrete MDA-based development process of groupware applications that is also introduced. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
