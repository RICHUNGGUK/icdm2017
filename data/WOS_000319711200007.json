Methods: The sensor network estimates the data-source, a target patient, from the position of a vital sign sensor obtained from a newly developed proximity sensing system. The proximity sensing system estimates the positions of the devices using a Bluetooth inquiry process. Using Bluetooth access points and the positioning system newly developed in this project, the sensor network collects vital sign and its 4W (who, where, what, and when) supplemental data from any Bluetooth ready vital sign sensors such as Continua-ready devices. The prototype was evaluated in a pseudo clinical setting at Kyoto University Hospital using a cyclic, paired comparison and statistical analysis. Results: The result of the cyclic paired analysis shows the subjects evaluated the proposed system is more effective and safer than POCS as well as paper-based operation. It halves the times for vital signs input and eliminates input errors. On the other hand, the prototype failed in its position estimation for 12.6% of all attempts, and the nurses overlooked half of the errors. A detailed investigation clears that an advanced interface to show the system's \"confidence\", i.e. the probability of estimation error, must be effective to reduce the oversights. Conclusions: This paper proposed a clinical sensor network system that relieves nurses from vital signs input tasks. The result clearly shows that the proposed system increases the efficiency and safety of the nursing process both subjectively and objectively. It is a, step toward new generation of point of nursing care systems where sensors take over the, tasks of data input from the nurses.", "paper_title": "Prototyping Sensor Network System for Automatic Vital Signs Collection Evaluation of a Location Based Automated Assignment of Measured Vital Signs to Patients", "paper_id": "WOS:000319711200007"}
