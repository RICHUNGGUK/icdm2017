Once generalize the formulas given by Ban et al. [J. Cellular Automata 6 (2011) 385-397] for measure-theoretic entropy and topological pressure of one-dimensional cellular automata, we calculate the measure entropy and the topological pressure of the linear cellular automata with respect to the Bernoulli measure on the set Z(m)(z). Also, it is shown that the uniform Bernoulli measure is the unique equilibrium measure for linear cellular automata. We compare values of topological entropy and topological directional entropy by using the formula obtained by Akin [J. Computation and Appl. Math. 225 (2) (2009) 459-466]. The topological directional entropy is interpreted by means of figures. As an application, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff of the limit set of a linear cellular automaton is the unique root of Bowen's equation. Some open problems remain to be of interest.", "paper_title": "On the Quantitative Behavior of the Linear Cellular Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000327556800005"}
