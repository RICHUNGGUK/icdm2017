The power consumption is related to basic circuit requirements, as dynamic range, bandwidth, noise figure and sampling speed and is considering basic device and device scaling behavior. Several kinds of circuits are treated, as samplers, amplifiers, filters and oscillators. The objective is to derive lower bounds to power consumption in analog circuits, to be used as design targets when designing power-constrained analog systems.", "paper_title": "Power consumption of analog circuits: a tutorial", "paper_id": "WOS:000282224500001"}
