The number of steps needed is called the small Chvatal rank (SCR) of A. We characterize matrices for which SCR is zero via the notion of supernormality which generalizes unimodularity. SCR is studied in the context of the stable set problem in a graph, and we show that many of the well-known facet normals of the stable set polytope appear in at most two rounds of our procedure. Our results reveal a uniform hypercyclic structure behind the normals of many complicated facet inequalities in the literature for the stable set polytope. Lower bounds for SCR are derived both in general and for polytopes in the unit cube.", "paper_title": "Small Chvatal Rank", "paper_id": "WOS:000280154400005"}
