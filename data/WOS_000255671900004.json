Because Aspen Plus does not contain membrane modules in its Model Library, the pervaporation membrane is simulated within Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Excel VBA is then linked with Aspen Plus to perform the hybrid simulation. In this way, the user can control the simulation even during the calculations. Case studies, in which industrially relevant hybrid distillation-pervaporation processes are simulated, are used to test the program. First, the dehydration and recycling of ethanol in an industrial plant is looked at, to explore whether an economic improvement can be established with a hybrid process. Secondly, the same is done for the purification of acetic acid in an industrial plant. The results presented here indicate the value of this software as a design tool. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
