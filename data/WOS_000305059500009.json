A general measurement model for TDOA accounting for non line of sight conditions is developed; then, several simplifying working assumptions regarding this model are discussed to allow the efficient implementation of a particle filter localization algorithm. This algorithm is tested and compared with an extended Kalman filter procedure, both in simulation, generating artificial measures, and with real data.", "paper_title": "TDOA positioning in NLOS scenarios by particle filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000305059500009"}
