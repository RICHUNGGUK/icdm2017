The method utilizes stored histories of possible optimal policies and constructs a specialized tree structure during the learning process. The constructed tree facilitates the process of identifying frequently used action sequences together with states that are visited during the execution of such sequences. The tree is constantly updated and used to implicitly run corresponding options. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated empirically by conducting extensive experiments on various domains with different properties.", "paper_title": "Improving reinforcement learning by using sequence trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000282427700004"}
