We show that with the communication modes, we can estimate various affects on service consumers during their interactions with web services. With this information, a web-service management system can automatically prevent and compensate potential negative affects, and even take advantage of positive affects.", "paper_title": "Affective web service design", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500010"}
