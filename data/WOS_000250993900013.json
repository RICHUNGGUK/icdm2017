How to learn and obtain desired knowledge efficiently has become an important but complicated problem. We hope that there are methods can give us some suggestions about how to learn knowledge efficiently. In this paper, we introduced some learning behavior of people, and then use our designed Effective Learning Curve Model to imitate this learning phenomenon. Using our learning function model, we can imitate people's learning behavior through pretesting. Every one has different learning behavior functions on learning distinct courses. Different learning sequence of courses will cause different learning efficiency. From this view, we proposed Max Learning Efficiency Slope First Algorithm (MLESFA) by differential learning functions to give people some suggestions about courses learning sequence and obtain desired knowledge efficiently. These algorithms also can help us to understand how much time we have to spend on each course in order to get better learning efficiency under time limitation. Finally, we make some learning example and compare simulation results with other courses learning algorithms. From the simulation results, we can see that our MLESFA algorithm has better learning efficiency than others.", "paper_title": "Effective Learning Model and activate learning algorithm for improving learning efficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000250993900013"}
