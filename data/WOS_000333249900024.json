It calculates the shortest path between a set of metabolites (e. g. biomarkers from a metabonomic study) and plots the connectivity between metabolites as links in a network graph. The resulting graph can be edited and explored interactively. Furthermore, nodes and edges in the graph are linked to the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes compound and reaction pair web pages.", "paper_title": "MetaboNetworks, an interactive Matlab-based toolbox for creating, customizing and exploring sub-networks from KEGG", "paper_id": "WOS:000333249900024"}
