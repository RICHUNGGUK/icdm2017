In this paper, to solve online the time-varying complex generalized inverse (in most cases, the pseudoinverse) problem in the complex domain, a new type of complex-valued ZNN is further proposed and investigated. The design of such a complex ZNN is based on a complex Zhang function (ZF) which is indefinite and quite different from the usual error function (specially, the scalar-valued energy function) in the studies of conventional algorithms. By introducing five different complex ZFs, five different complex ZNN models (termed complex ZNN-I, ZNN-II, ZNN-III, ZNN-IV, and ZNN-V models) are proposed, developed, and investigated for the online solution of the time-varying complex generalized inverse matrices. Theoretical results of convergence analysis are presented to show the desirable properties of complex ZNN models. In addition, we discover the link between the proposed complex ZNN models and the Getz-Marsden dynamic system in the complex domain. Computer-simulation results further demonstrate the effectiveness of complex ZNN models based on different complex ZFs for the time-varying complex generalized inverse matrices.", "paper_title": "Different Complex ZFs Leading to Different Complex ZNN Models for Time-Varying Complex Generalized Inverse Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000343704700004"}
