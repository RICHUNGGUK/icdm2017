This article proposes a relaxed gain-flatness requirement based on system level investigations. Considering the wireless transceiver front-end with antenna and propagation channel, the unflat-gain low-noise amplifier with an incremental gain characteristic does not degrade the performance of overall system. As an alternative to its flat-gain counterpart, the proposed unflat gain requirement tolerates gain ripple as large as 10 dB, which greatly eases the design challenges to low-noise amplifier for ultra-wideband wireless receivers. Two low-noise amplifier examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility and design flexibility under the proposed gain-flatness requirement.
