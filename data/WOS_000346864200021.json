By using the unique wavelength routing property of AWGRs together with electrical switching inside the processors, Hi-LION can scale beyond 100,000 nodes. A comparison with a legacy fat-tree network with a 3:1 oversubscription ratio shows that Hi-LION can achieve 2.5-fold throughput increases while using less than 20% of the global switches and cables.", "paper_title": "Hi-LION: Hierarchical Large-Scale Interconnection Optical Network With AWGRs", "paper_id": "WOS:000346864200021"}
