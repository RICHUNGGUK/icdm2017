The optimum conditions of synchronous fluorometric determination of HSA were investigated and the method was successfully applied to the determination of 5-ASA added to serum, urine, and saliva samples. The linear range of the determination of HSA and 5-ASA were 1.60- 414 mu g mL(-1) and 0.76-22.95 mu g mL(-1), the detection limits were 0.552 mu g mL(-1) and 0.38 mu g mL(-1), respectively. In addition, the effect of various common ions on the determination of HSA with 5-ASA was also discussed at room temperature.", "paper_title": "Synchronous fluorescence determination and molecular modeling of 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) interacted with human serum albumin", "paper_id": "WOS:000260376100001"}
