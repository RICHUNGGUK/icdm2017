Specifically, the module is based on short-time analysis with time-domain and frequency-domain features and classification using support vector machines. The seizure detection module was evaluated on three subjects with diagnosed idiopathic generalized epilepsy manifested with absences. The achieved seizure detection accuracy was approximately 90% for all evaluated subjects. Feature ranking investigation and evaluation of the seizure detection module using subsets of features showed that the feature vector composed of approximately the 65%-best ranked parameters provides a good trade-off between computational demands and accuracy. This configurable architecture allows the seizure detection module to operate as part of a healthcare system in offline mode as well as in online mode, where real-time performance is needed.
