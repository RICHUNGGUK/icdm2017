The interfacing protocol involves a control field, generating EIT for the very weak field that carries the quantum signal to be stored and enabling its mapping into the collective hyperfine coherence of the cold atomic ensemble. For the demonstration of multimode storage, the signal pulse at the single photon level is prepared in a mode with (OAM), while the control field is in a TEM00 mode. After the writing process, the information is kept in the memory register. In the retrieval phase, the information is read back from atoms to light and we show that these pulses at the single photon level with OAM can be stored and retrieved with a preserved spatial phase and a good efficiency.", "paper_title": "TOWARDS A MULTIMODE QUANTUM MEMORY FOR SINGLE PHOTONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000316129600012"}
