The benefits of both lists of textual requirements (usually written in natural language) and software engineering models (usually specified in graphical form) can be brought together by combining the two approaches in the specification of system and software requirements documents. If, moreover, textual requirements are generated from models in an automatic or closely monitored form, the effort of specifying those requirements is reduced and the completeness of the specification and the management of the requirements traceability are improved. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature related to the generation of textual requirements specifications from software engineering models. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
