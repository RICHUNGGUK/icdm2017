Design/methodology/approach - When physiological activity occurs, signals are generated. By measuring these signals, human activity can be monitored. With the help of a new network module named Waseda Hibikino Module-2, which can transmit not only data, but also based of physiological signals, a wireless sensor network is established. Findings - While measuring physiological signals, a stable system is required. From human body to the terminal in a hospital, data must be sent completely, especially for example the heartbeat rate. And a stable transmission protocol must be applied during this process of wireless transmission. Originality/value - This technology represents a new real-time monitoring system of human physiological signals. With single data processing, it can prevent different kind of situations before a bad status like a heart attack occurs.", "paper_title": "A wireless sensor network of human physiological signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000277371500016"}
