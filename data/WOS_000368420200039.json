The first technique is a quantum generalization of the superposition coding scheme for the classical broadcast channel. We use a quantum simultaneous nonunique decoder and obtain a proof of the rate region stated in Yard et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 57 (10), 2011. Our second result is a quantum generalization of the Marton coding scheme. The error analysis for the quantum Marton region makes use of ideas in our earlier work and an idea recently presented by Radhakrishnan et al. in arXiv:1410.3248. Both results exploit recent advances in quantum simultaneous decoding developed in the context of quantum interference channels.", "paper_title": "Classical Codes for Quantum Broadcast Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000368420200039"}
