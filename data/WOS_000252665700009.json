The approach is based on stability conditions issued from vector norms corresponding to a vector-Lyapunov function. In particular, for considered second-order TSK models we show that Zadeh's t-norm, logic product min, gives the largest estimation of stability domain. (c) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
