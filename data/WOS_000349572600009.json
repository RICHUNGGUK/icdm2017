The performance of publish/Subscribe communication systems depends on the effectiveness of the event matching between events and subscribers. Semantic Web technologies, including ontology, provide a platform and tools for event matching in publish/subscribe systems. Since semantic ambiguity exists in the ontologies, however, matching performance is not ideal. To improve event matching performance, we propose an ontology-based quantitative similarity metric where the frequency of keywords is used to measure the quantitative similarity. When compared to another ontology technique for semantic matching, the approximate semantic matching method, our evaluation results show a performance improvement in precision, recall, and F-measure.
