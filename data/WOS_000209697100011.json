The linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) demodulator is used to reduce the complexity and to avoid error propagation. Furthermore, sliding window MUDD is proposed to circumvent an increase of the decoding latency due to SC interleaving. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that SC interleaving can improve the performance of the iterative LMMSE MUDD for regular low-density parity-check codes.", "paper_title": "Iterative Multiuser Detection and Decoding with Spatially Coupled Interleaving", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697100011"}
