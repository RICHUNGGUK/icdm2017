There are two steps of operations in the new algorithm. The first is to decompose a local region into a scale part and a detail one by wavelet analysis. The second is to reconstruct the surface by removing the detail part and then replacing the local region by the scale one. Because the scale part constitutes a T-spline, the new algorithm can not only realize local fairing, but also simultaneously reduce the control points. The effectiveness of the new approach is verified by three examples, which also demonstrate that the major advantage of the new algorithm over the traditional ones lies in its local fairing capability.", "paper_title": "Wavelet based local fairing algorithm for surfaces with data compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000362883000011"}
