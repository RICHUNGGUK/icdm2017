First, the interactions between the nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain of G3BP and the SH3 domain of RasGAP were studied by a well-designed protocol, which combines homology modeling, protein/protein docking, molecular dynamics simulations, molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) free energy calculations, and MM/GBSA free energy decomposition analysis together. Then, based on the theoretical predictions, two novel peptides were designed and synthesized for biological assays, and they showed an obvious sensitizing effect on cis-platin. Furthermore, the deigned peptides had no significant effects on normal cells, while cis-platin did. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to use the peptides to enhance the efficacy of clinical drugs and to kill cancer cells selectively. We believe that our work should be very useful for finding new therapies for cancers.", "paper_title": "Structure-Based Design of Peptides against G3BP with Cytotoxicity on Tumor Cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000275858000006"}
