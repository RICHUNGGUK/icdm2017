We propose a viable solution for these applications by designing a video tone-mapping operator that controls the visibility of the noise, adapts to display and viewing environment, minimizes contrast distortions, preserves or enhances image details, and can be run in real-time on an incoming sequence without any preprocessing. To our knowledge, no existing solution offers all these features. Our novel contributions are: a fast procedure for computing local display-adaptive tone-curves which minimize contrast distortions, a fast method for detail enhancement free from ringing artifacts, and an integrated video tone-mapping solution combining all the above features.", "paper_title": "Real-time noise-aware tone mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200035"}
