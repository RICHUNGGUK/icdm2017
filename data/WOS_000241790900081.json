The algorithm is divided in two stages. In a first step, local density is estimated at each data point. In a second stage, a hierarchical approach is used by merging clusters according to the introduced cluster distance, based on heuristic measures about how modes overlap in a distribution. Experimental results on synthetic and real databases show the validity of the method.", "paper_title": "Non parametric local density-based clustering for multimodal overlapping distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900081"}
