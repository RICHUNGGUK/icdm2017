The parallel computing technologies provide promising solutions to such problems. Evenly decomposing the visualization task into multiple subtasks is one of the key issues in parallel visualization of vector data. This study focuses on the decomposition of polyline and polygon data for parallel visualization. Two key factors impacting the computational intensity were identified: the number of features and the number of vertices of each feature. The computational intensity transform functions (CITFs) were constructed based on the linear relationships between the factors and the computing time. The computational intensity grid (CIG) can then be constructed using the CITFs to represent the spatial distribution of computational intensity. A noninterlaced continuous space-filling curve is used to group the lattices of CIG into multiple sub-domains such that each sub-domain entails the same amount of computational intensity as others. The experiments demonstrated that the approach proposed in this paper was able to effectively estimate and spatially represent the computational intensity of visualizing polylines and polygons. Compared with the regular domain decomposition methods, the new approach generated much more balanced decomposition of computational intensity for parallel visualization and achieved near-linear speedups, especially when the data is greatly heterogeneously distributed in space.", "paper_title": "A spatially adaptive decomposition approach for parallel vector data visualization of polylines and polygons", "paper_id": "WOS:000359789900007"}
