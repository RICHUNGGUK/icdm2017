Entries-into-service are often characterized by low maturity and early life failures, for which conventional reliability metrics are not useful. The objective of our project was to develop and implement a value-based assessment method of the supportability for a new aircraft entering into service by exploring the relation between the logistic support resources, the fleet's availability, and the cost. This article applies the general trade-off framework of the Value Operations Methodology, a value engineering method aimed at facilitating decision making. Value in this context represents supportability effectiveness, and describes what is important to a stakeholder during decision making. Based on interviews and literature, Value is found to be determined by both the fleet's availability and the total cost of logistic support. The average stakeholder's preferences indicate a slight preference for maximizing a fleet's availability. To implement the required availability and cost models, data analyses, a survey amongst operators and suppliers, the design of a stochastic fleet simulation, as well as the creation of General Linear Models have been conducted. Three component types are investigated: engine major units, line replaceable units with a NO GO dispatch condition (inoperable), and line replaceable units with a GO IF (operable under certain conditions) dispatch condition. The logistic elements of spare provisioning level and repair capacity are found to be mutually significant. Also, the number of airline operators to be supported is classified as significant, except for components with a GO IF dispatch condition. The final result is a simple assessment tool, able to provide a quick assessment of supportability strategies, implemented at, and accepted by our industrial partner.", "paper_title": "A Value-Based Assessment Method of the Supportability for a New Aircraft Entering Into Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000345904000001"}
