Although the domain of audio identification is very active, both in the industry and the academic world, there is at present no common basis to compare the proposed techniques. This is because corpuses and evaluation protocols differ among the authors. The framework we present here corresponds to a use-case in which audio excerpts have to be detected in a radio broadcast stream. This scenario, indeed, naturally provides a large variety of audio distortions that makes this task a real challenge for fingerprinting systems. Scoring metrics are discussed with regard to this particular scenario. We then describe a whole evaluation framework including an audio corpus, together with the related groundtruth annotation, and a toolkit for the computation of the score metrics. An example of an application of this framework is finally detailed, that took place during the evaluation campaign of the Quaero project. This evaluation framework is publicly available for download and constitutes a simple, yet thorough, platform that can be used by the community in the field of audio identification to encourage reproducible results.", "paper_title": "A PUBLIC AUDIO IDENTIFICATION EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR BROADCAST MONITORING", "paper_id": "WOS:000300407900006"}
