RATEWeb supports a cooperative model in which Web services share their experiences of the service providers with their peers through feedback ratings. The different ratings are aggregated to derive a service provider's reputation. This in turn is used to evaluate trust. The overall goal of RATEWeb is to facilitate trust-based selection and composition of Web services. We propose a set of decentralized techniques that aim at accurately aggregating the submitted ratings for reputation assessment. We conduct experiments to assess the fairness and accuracy of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "RATEWeb: Reputation Assessment for Trust Establishment among Web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000268548800003"}
