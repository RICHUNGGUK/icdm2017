Here we focus on clustering uncertain data and describe a general framework for this purpose that also allows to visualize and understand the impact of uncertainty using different uncertainty models on the data mining results. Our framework constitutes release 0.7 of ELKI (http://elki.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/) and thus comes along with a plethora of implementations of algorithms, distance measures, indexing techniques, evaluation measures and visualization components.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Clustering Uncertain Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800080"}
