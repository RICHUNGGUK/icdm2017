The inverse kinematics problem of a humanoid manipulator can be formulated as an equivalent minimization problem, and thus it can be solved using some numerical optimization methods. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is a new biogeography inspired optimization algorithm, and it can be adopted to solve the inverse kinematics problem of a humanoid manipulator. The standard BBO algorithm that uses traditional migration and mutation operators suffers from slow convergence and prematurity. A hybrid biogeography-based optimization (HBBO) algorithm, which is based on BBO and differential evolution (DE), is presented. In this hybrid algorithm, new habitats in the ecosystem are produced through a hybrid migration operator, that is, the BBO migration strategy and DE/best/1/bin differential strategy, to alleviate slow convergence at the later evolution stage of the algorithm. In addition, a Gaussian mutation operator is adopted to enhance the exploration ability and improve the diversity of the population. Based on these, an 8-DOF (degree of freedom) redundant humanoid manipulator is employed as an example. The end-effector error (position and orientation) and the 'away limitation level' value of the 8-DOF humanoid manipulator constitute the fitness function of HBBO. The proposed HBBO algorithm has been used to solve the inverse kinematics problem of the 8-DOF redundant humanoid manipulator. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.", "paper_title": "A hybrid biogeography-based optimization method for the inverse kinematics problem of an 8-DOF redundant humanoid manipulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000358396500008"}
