It uses curl-conforming and divergence-conforming basis functions for E and B, respectively, with the same order of interpolation. In this way, higher accuracy is achieved at lower memory consumption than the conventional approach based on the field variables E and H. The centered flux and Riemann solver are both used to treat interfaces with non-conforming meshes, and both explicit Runge-Kutta method and implicit Crank-Nicholson method are implemented for time integration. Numerical examples for realistic cases will be presented to verify that the proposed method is a non-spurious and efficient DGTD scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
