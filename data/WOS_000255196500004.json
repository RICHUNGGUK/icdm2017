The activation functions are supposed to be bounded and globally Lipschitz continuous. Delay-dependent passivity condition is proposed by using the free-weighting matrix approach. These passivity conditions are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can be investigated easily by using standard algorithms. Two illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.", "paper_title": "A delay-dependent approach to passivity analysis for uncertain neural networks with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000255196500004"}
