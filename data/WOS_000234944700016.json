We study the cross-correlation function between two m-sequences for Niho type decimations d = (2(k) - 1)s + 1. We develop a new technique to study the value distribution of these cross-correlation functions, which makes use of Dickson polynomials. As a first application, we derive here the distribution of the six-valued cross-correlation function for s = 3 and odd k, up to a term which depends on Kloosterman sums. In addition, applying simpler methods, we prove a theorem providing Niho type decimations with four-valued cross-correlation functions and their distribution. We conjecture that the latter result actually covers all such decimations.", "paper_title": "Niho type cross-correlation functions via Dickson polynomials and Kloosterman sums", "paper_id": "WOS:000234944700016"}
