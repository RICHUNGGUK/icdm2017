Based on this accurate, robust and reliable ERM-PLS model, an in silica screening study was performed, which resulted in some new and potent cognition agents, some of which show equal or even better affinity and ADMET properties than the previous structures. The effects of structural moieties on the activity of the compounds were discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
