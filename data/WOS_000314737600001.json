A standardized representation of FCMs accompanied by a system that would assist decision makers to simulate their own developed Fuzzy Cognitive Maps would be highly appreciated by them, and would help the dissemination of FCMs. In this paper, (a) a RuleML representation of FCM is proposed and (b) a system is designed and implemented in Prolog programming language to assist experts to simulate their own FCMs. This system returns results in valid RuleML syntax, making them readily available to other cooperative systems. The representation capabilities and the design choices of the implemented system are discussed and a variety of examples are given to demonstrate the use of the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
