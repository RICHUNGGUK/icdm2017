The impulse sensitivity function (ISF) is used to carry out qualitative and quantitative analyses of the noise contributions exhibited by each circuit component in each topology, allowing an understanding of their impact on phase noise. The comparative analyses show the existence of five distinct frequency regions in which the four topologies rank unevenly in terms of best phase noise performance. Moreover, the results obtained from the ISF show the impact of flicker noise contribution as the major effect leading to phase noise degradation in nanoscale CMOS LC oscillators.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Phase Noise in 28 nm CMOS LC Oscillator Differential Topologies: Armstrong, Colpitts, Hartley and Common-Source Cross-Coupled Pair", "paper_id": "WOS:000350569400009"}
