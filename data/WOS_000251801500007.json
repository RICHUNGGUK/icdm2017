In the first part of the current work, we consider joint source-channel state channel coding. In particular, we deal with lossy transmission of a source, over a cost-constrained state controlled channel where the receiver gets full SI and the transmitter receive coded partial SI. We derive a single-letter characterization of the achievable distortion-cost triples. From this characterization, a separation principle follows for both, coding of the main source and the transmitter SI. In the second part, we consider channel coding when the transmitter receives multiple partial, rate-limited descriptions of the state, and the receiver gets full SI. Two rate-limited descriptions of the state sequence are generated and conveyed to the transmitter, where each description can be lost independently during this transmission. For three different possible partial SI at the transmitter, we explore a channel coding strategy with three different forward channel rates. Inner and outer bounds are derived on the set of achievable partial description and forward channel rates. Furthermore, special cases where the inner bound is tight are studied. Similarities between coding of SI as multiple partial descriptions and the multiple description problem of source coding theory are pointed out.", "paper_title": "Coding problems for channels with partial state information at the transmitter", "paper_id": "WOS:000251801500007"}
