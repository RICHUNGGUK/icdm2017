These vector networks contain massive numbers of river reaches with associated geographical features, including topological connections and topographical parameters. These features create challenges for efficient map display and data management. Of particular interest are the requirements of data management for multi-scale hydrological simulations using multi-resolution river networks. In this paper, a hierarchical pyramid method is proposed, which generates coarsened vector drainage networks from the originals iteratively. The method is based on the Horton-Strahler's (H-S) order schema. At each coarsening step, the river reaches with the lowest H-S order are pruned, and their related sub-basins are merged. At the same time, the topological connections and topographical parameters of each coarsened drainage network are inherited from the former level using formulas that are presented in this study. The method was applied to the original drainage networks of a watershed in the Huangfuchuan River basin extracted from a 1-m-resolution airborne LiDAR DEM and applied to the full Yangtze River basin in China, which was extracted from a 30-m-resolution ASTER GDEM. In addition, a map-display and parameter-query web service was published for the Mississippi River basin, and its data were extracted from the 30-m-resolution ASTER GDEM. The results presented in this study indicate that the developed method can effectively manage and display massive amounts of drainage network data and can facilitate multi-scale hydrological simulations.
