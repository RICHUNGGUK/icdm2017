The methods can be viewed as a natural extension of subgradient projection type algorithms, and are based on using non-Euclidean projection-like maps, which generate interior trajectories. The resulting algorithms are easy to implement and rely on a single projection per iteration. We prove several convergence results and establish rate of convergence estimates under various and mild assumptions on the problem's data and the corresponding step-sizes.", "paper_title": "Projected subgradient methods with non-Euclidean distances for non-differentiable convex minimization and variational inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000265043800003"}
