When we see fish in an aquarium, they appear closer and distorted due to light distortion. In order to correct the distortion, light rays travelling in the aquarium directly towards an observer should hit him/her after emerging from the aquarium. In this manuscript, those light rays are captured by a perspective camera at specific positions, not the observer position. And then it is shown that the taken images are successfully merged as a single one that is not affected by light distortion.", "paper_title": "Correcting Distortion of Views into Aquarium and Its Accuracy", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784600043"}
