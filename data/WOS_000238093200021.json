In this paper, we present SCALER(1), an efficient algorithm for XML query answering based on UDFTS2 and effective twig structure matching scheme. UDFTS not only constructs a one-to-one correspondence between trees and sequences but also maintains critical parent-child relationships for twig structure matching. With SCALER, XML queries can be performed by subsequence matching without breaking twigs into sub paths and evaluating these paths individually. Thus, costly join operations can be avoided elegantly. We also show the correctness of query answering by eliminating false dismissals and false alarms naturally in SCALER. By a thorough experimental study on various real-life data, we prove the efficiency and scalability of SCALER over the previous known alternative.", "paper_title": "Exploit Sequencing to accelerate XML twig query answering", "paper_id": "WOS:000238093200021"}
