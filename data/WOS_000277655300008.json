This process can be augmented by a corresponding adjoint solver, and based on the resulting approximate reduced derivatives, also an optimization iteration that updates the design variables simultaneously. To coordinate the three iterative processes, we use an exact penalty function of a doubly augmented Lagrangian type that should be consistently reduced. Some numerical experiments on a variant of the Bratu problem are presented.", "paper_title": "Properties of an augmented Lagrangian for design optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000277655300008"}
