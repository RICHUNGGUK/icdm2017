Several SI algorithms have been developed that replicate the behavior of honeybees. This study integrates two of these, the artificial bee colony (ABC) and bees algorithms (BA), into a hybrid ABC-BA algorithm. In ABC-BA, an agent can perform as an ABC agent in the ABC sub-swarm and/or a BA agent in the BA sub-swarm. Therefore, the ABC and BA formulations coexist within ABC-BA. Moreover, the population sizes of the ABC and BA sub-swarms vary stochastically based on the current best fitness values obtained by the sub-swarms. This paper conducts experiments on six constrained optimization problems (COPs) with equality or inequality constraints. In addressing equality constraints, this paper proposes using these constraints to determine function variables rather than directly converting them into inequality constraints, an approach that perfectly satisfies the equality constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the ABC-BA approximates or exceeds the winner of either ABC or BA. Therefore, the ABC-BA is recommended as an alternative to ABC and BA for handling COPs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
