Combined with the sparsity of battery loading stations, the complete transition to E-mobility still seems a long way to go. In this paper, we consider the problem of placing as few loading stations as possible so that on any shortest path there are sufficiently many not to run out of energy. We show how to model this problem and introduce heuristics which provide close-to-optimal solutions even in large road networks.", "paper_title": "Placement of Loading Stations for Electric Vehicles: No Detours Necessary!", "paper_id": "WOS:000365176400013"}
