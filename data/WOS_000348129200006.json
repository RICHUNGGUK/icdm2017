However, investigations on XOR-based VC are not sufficient. In this paper, we exploit some extended capabilities for XOR-based VC. Actually, two XOR-based VC algorithms are proposed, namely XOR-based VC for general access structure (GAS) and adaptive region incrementing XOR-based VC. The first algorithm aims to implement complicated sharing strategy using GAS, while maintaining merits such as perfect reconstruction of secret, no pixel expansion, and no code book requirement. In the second algorithm, the concept of adaptive security level is first introduced, where the security levels are recovered in accordance with the qualified sets instead of the quantity of stacked shares. Adaptive region incrementing XOR-based VC further enriches the application scenarios. Theoretical analysis on the proposed algorithms are provided, as well as extensive experimental results and evaluations for demonstrating the effectiveness and advantages of the two methods.", "paper_title": "Extended Capabilities for XOR-Based Visual Cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000348129200006"}
