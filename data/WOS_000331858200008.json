This can be achieved by using file replication, which efficiently reduces file service time and access latency, increases file availability and improves system load balancing. However, replication entails various costs such as storage and energy consumption for holding replicas. This article proposes a multi-objective offline optimization approach for replica management, in which we view the various factors influencing replication decisions such as mean file unavailability, mean service time, load variance, energy consumption and mean access latency as five objectives. It makes decisions of replication factor and replication layout with an improved artificial immune algorithm that evolves a set of solution candidates through clone, mutation and selection processes. The proposed algorithm named Multi-objective Optimized Replication Management (MORM) seeks the near optimal solutions by balancing the trade-offs among the five optimization objectives. The article reports a series of experiments that show the effectiveness of the MORM. Experimental results conclusively demonstrate that our MORM is energy effective and outperforms default replication management of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and MOE (Multi-objective Evolutionary) algorithm in terms of performance and load balancing for large-scale cloud storage cluster.
