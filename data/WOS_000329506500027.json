A charge locating inside the cylinder cavity, where ion channel proteins and ions are given explicit atomistic representations, will be influenced by the polarization field of the surrounding implicit dielectric/electrolyte medium. Two numerical techniques, a specially designed boundary integral equation method and an image charge method, will be investigated and compared in terms of accuracy and efficiency for computing the electrostatic potential. The boundary integral equation method based on the three-dimensional layered Green's functions provides a highly accurate solution suitable for producing a benchmark reference solution, while the image charge method is found to give reasonable accuracy and highly efficient and viable to use the fast multipole method for interactions of a large number of charges in the atomistic region of the hybrid solvation model.
