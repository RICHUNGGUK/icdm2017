In order to characterize the influence of chamber geometry on ventricular coupling, the ventricles and septum are modeled as portions of ellipsoidal shells, and configuration is derived as a function of pressure gradients by combining shell element equilibrium equations through static boundary conditions applied at the sulcus. Diastolic volume (v) surfaces are calculated as a function of pressure (p), contralateral pressure (clp) and intrathoracic pressure (p(t) ) and match literature data where available. Ventricular interaction is characterized in terms of partial derivatives in v-p-clp-p(t) space both under physiological and altered (selectively stiffened walls) conditions. The model allows prediction of diastolic ventricular v-p-clp-p(t) interplay in a variety of physiopathological circumstances.", "paper_title": "Interventricular coupling coefficients in a thick shell model of passive cardiac chamber deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000256929000002"}
