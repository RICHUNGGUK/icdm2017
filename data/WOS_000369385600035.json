Users in such obstructed environments (especially in home environments) will find it difficult to perform on-site navigation. It is important to create a standalone pedestrian tracking system that provides better location determination services with less computational complexity and deployment cost. One promising way to implement this service is through the use of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. This tracking method provides the pinpointing of standalone tracking information but is handicapped by missing stance phase during pedestrian walking activities. A new pedestrian stance detection using simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) will be designed in this paper with a focus on robust indoor positioning systems. We will present our preliminary results to illustrate the performance of the system for an indoor environment set-up at the end of this paper.", "paper_title": "Optimization of Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter in Activity Pedestrian Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (SLAM): An Initial Proposal", "paper_id": "WOS:000369385600035"}
