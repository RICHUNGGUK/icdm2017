The rationale for doing so is found in the potential of such a system to increase cost efficiency, service and safety for different transport-related actors. Although, at present several comparable systems exist, their current implementation is far from successful because of technological and economic obstacles. The new expert communication platform put forward here (called MamMoeT) addresses these two issues by using a software agent-based approach. Software agents are pieces of software representing a single user. They are autonomous, communicative and intelligent. The MamMoeT system developed can be described as a real-time decision support system in which intelligent software agents handle communicative tasks, exchange desired amounts of information among different users using common exchange protocols which act as translators between different systems.
