To describe the generation of a new spike train from the incoming spike trains Spike Response Model has been utilized and the Lyapunov stability method has been adopted in the derivation of the update rules for the neurocontroller parameters. The results of the real-time experiments indicate that stable online tuning and fast learning speed are the prominent characteristics of the proposed algorithm.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
