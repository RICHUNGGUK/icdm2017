Many distinct structures may be defined simultaneously on the same original content for matching different documentary tasks. For example, a document may have both a structure for the logical organization of content (logical structure), and a structure expressing a set of content formatting rules (physical structure). In this paper, we present MSDM, a generic model for multi-structured documents, in which several important features are established. We also address the problem of efficiently encoding multi-structured documents by introducing MultiX, a new XML formalism based on the MSDM model. Finally, we propose a library of Xquery functions for querying MultiX documents. We will illustrate all the contributions with a use case based on a fragment of an old manuscript.
