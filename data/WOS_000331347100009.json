Weighted sum and Kalman filter are indeed the common approaches used to fuse and filter the data in most cases. These approaches are limited by the periodic nature of the angular data. In this article, the error of angular measurements is assumed to follow a von Mises distribution. Under this assumption, a multi-sensor fusion operator is proposed. Under the same assumption, a a magnetometer and a gyroscope. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
