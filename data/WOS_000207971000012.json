For an interference-limited environment, the closed-form expressions for the probability density functions of the signal-to-interference ratio are derived and applied to analyze the outage probability with three typical types of co-channel MIMO interferers: STBC, open-loop spatial multiplexing and closed-loop spatial multiplexing. Both theoretical analyses and simulation results show that the performance of STBC is independent of the MIMO modes used in the interfering links.", "paper_title": "Outage analysis of interference-limited systems using STBC with co-channel MIMO interferers", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971000012"}
