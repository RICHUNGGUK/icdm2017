In this paper, we study the question of how to efficiently infer haplotypes from genotypes of individuals related by a pedigree, assuming that the hereditary process was free of mutations (i.e., the Mendelian law of inheritance) and recombinants. The problem has recently been formulated as a system of linear equations over the finite field of F(2) and solved in O(m(3)n(3)) time by using standard Gaussian elimination, where m is the number of loci (or markers) in a genotype and n the number of individuals in the pedigree. We give a much faster algorithm with running time O(mn(2) + n(3) log(2) n log log n). The key ingredients of our construction are (i) a new system of linear equations based on some spanning tree of the pedigree graph and (ii) an efficient method for eliminating redundant equations in a system of O(mn) linear equations over O(n) variables. Although such a fast elimination method is not known for general systems of linear equations, we take advantage of the underlying pedigree graph structure and recent progress on low-stretch spanning trees.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS FOR RECONSTRUCTING ZERO-RECOMBINANT HAPLOTYPES ON A PEDIGREE BASED ON FAST ELIMINATION OF REDUNDANT LINEAR EQUATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266018400005"}
