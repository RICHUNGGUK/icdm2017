SED can effectively describe images and represent image local features. Moreover, SED can extract and describe color and texture features. The image structure elements' histogram (SEH) is computed by SED, and HSV color space is used (it has been quantized to 72 bins). SEH integrates the advantages of both statistical and structural texture description methods, and it can represent the spatial correlation of color and texture. The results demonstrate that the method has a better performance than other image retrieval methods in the experiments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
