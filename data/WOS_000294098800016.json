This paper is directed towards the development of a novel Computer-aided Diagnosis (CADx) system for the diagnosis of breast masses. It aims at intensifying the performance of CADx algorithms as well as reducing the FNR by utilizing Zernike moments as descriptors of shape and margin characteristics. The input Regions of Interest (ROIs) are segmented manually and further subjected to a number of preprocessing stages. The outcomes of preprocessing stage are two processed images containing co-scaled translated masses. Besides, one of these images represents the shape characteristics of the mass, while the other describes the margin characteristics. Two groups of Zernike moments have been extracted from the preprocessed images and applied to the feature selection stage. Each group includes 32 moments with different orders and iterations. Considering the performance of the overall CADx system, the most effective moments have been chosen and applied to a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, employing both generic Back Propagation (BP) and Opposition-based Learning (OBL) algorithms. The Receiver Operational Characteristics (ROC) curve and the performance of resulting CADx systems are analyzed for each group of features. The designed systems yield Az=0.976, representing fair sensitivity, and Az=0.975 demonstrating fair specificity. The best achieved FNR and FPR are 0.0% and 5.5%, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
