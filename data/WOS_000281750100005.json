In this paper, we concentrate on the configuration number and fixed-outline constraints in the floorplanning for 3-D ICs. Extended sequence pair, named partitioned sequence pair (in short, P-SP), is used to represent 3-D IC floorplans. We prove that the number of configuration of 3-D IC floorplans represented by P-SP is less than that of planar floorplans represented by sequence pair (SP) and decreases as the device layer number increases. Moreover, we applied the technique of block position enumeration, which have been successfully used in planar fixed-outline floorplanning, to fixed-outline multi-layer floorplanning. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
