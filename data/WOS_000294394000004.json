We develop a novel playout adaptation algorithm to reduce playback interruptions by jointly considering the active playout buffer status and adaptive playout rate. We also propose a packet priority analysis method based on the layer information of Scalable Video Coding (SVC). Based on the priority of the video packet and the adaptive playout-deadline, an optimal packet scheduling algorithm is proposed. Packets are selected for transmission to minimize the quality degradation caused as well as to reduce the playout latency. We also adopt a benchmark for the packet priority analysis by calculating the distortion impact of each packet with the consideration of the packet dependency in SVC. When compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms as well as the benchmark, our proposed scheduling algorithm shows a good trade-off between the video quality and the playout latency.
