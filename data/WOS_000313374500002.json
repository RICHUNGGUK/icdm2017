We hypothesize that such harmony-related responses result from adapting to natural harmonic sounds by using sparse coding, a computational model that originally related natural image statistics to the neural properties of the primary visual cortex (V1). Our previous work has shown that a set of harmonic responses found in A1 of marmoset monkeys can emerge by sparse coding of highly harmonic sounds; however, the work was only preliminary, because the specific sounds we used were unfamiliar to monkeys. In the present study, we recorded voices of marmosets, and showed that the same model applied to the conspecific vocalizations can reproduce the harmony-related responses. This result more directly supports the hypothesis that A1 adapts to natural sounds, in particular voices comprising harmonic overtones, under the principle of sparse coding. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
