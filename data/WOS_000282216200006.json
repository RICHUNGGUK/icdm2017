The strokes in the initial set are disposed by the fuzzy theorems and grouped based on the confidence of the classifiers. The training sample space is constructed by the Affinity Propagation (AP) algorithm and the Biomimetic Pattern Recognition (BPR) theory. The strokes are arranged in a sequence divided by calculating the distance of each subsequence to the relative subspace. Finally, with the maximum posterior (MAP) criterion, the optimal segmentation hypotheses described in a probabilistic model is found. Our system is validated by experimental results from samples of real Chinese bank checks, achieving a correct rate of without 95.23% rejection.", "paper_title": "DIVISION OF SPACE BASED SEGMENTATION SYSTEM OF UNCONSTRAINED NUMERAL STRINGS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282216200006"}
