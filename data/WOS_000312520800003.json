In this paper, we generalize f-generated implications and get a new class of fuzzy implications called (f, g)-implications, which is different from the usual known classes of fuzzy implications. We discuss the basic algebraic properties of (f, g)-implications and study some classical logic tautologies (i.e., law of importation, contrapositive symmetry and distributivity over t-norms or t-conorms) for (f, g)-implications. Characterization of solutions to the corresponding fuzzy functional equations is obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
