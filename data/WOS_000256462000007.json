This paper presents compact roundtrip routing schemes with (O) over tilde(root N) sized local tables(4) and stretch 6 for any strongly connected directed network with arbitrary edge weights. A scheme with local tables of size (N) over tilde(epsilon(-1)n(2/k)) and stretch min((2(k/2) - 1)(k + epsilon), 8k(2) + 4k - 4), for any epsilon > 0 is also presented in the case where edge weights are restricted to be polynomially-sized. Both results are for the topology-independent node-name model. These are the first topology-independent results that apply to routing in directed networks. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
