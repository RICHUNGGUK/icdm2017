In this case, the security issues of SIP become a very critical problem simultaneously. Through studying the security of SIP, this paper validates five attack ways in practical circumstances, including Registration Hijacking, INVITE attack, re-INVITE attack, Tearing Down Sessions, and DoS. Finally, through synthetic analysis and experiments, proposes four available measures to enhance the security of SIP: Improved Identity Authentication for HTTP Digest, Encryption with Hop-by-Hop, Forbidding the Lawless Third Part Register, Forbid the rewriting in 'From' Field and 'To' Field.", "paper_title": "Security analysis of session initiation protocal", "paper_id": "WOS:000244974000019"}
