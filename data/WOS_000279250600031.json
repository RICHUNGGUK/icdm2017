Adaptive image interpolation methods tend to create higher visual quality images than traditional interpolation methods such as bicubic interpolation. These methods, however, often suffer from high computational costs and production of inadequate interpolated pixels. We propose a novel method to overcome these problems. Our approach is to estimate the enlarged image from the original image based on an observation model. Obtaining an image with edge-directed smoothness, we constrain the estimated image to have many edge-directed smooth pixels which are measured by using the edge-directed smoothness filter introduced in this paper. Additionally, we also propose a simplification of our algorithm to run with lower computational complexity and smaller memory. Simulation results show that the proposal method produces images with high visual quality and performs well on PSNR and computational times.", "paper_title": "Image Interpolation Using Edge-Directed Smoothness Measure Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250600031"}
