For this, a hardware-in-the-Loop implementation is developed using several multi-channel A/D Cards, integrated to a computer network system. Variant time delays are considered over Ethernet and CANBUS networks. Fuzzy logic is used to deal with the complexity of the integrated computer network as well as with the dynamics of the system. Two fuzzy logic control systems are coupled for both signals of the helicopter case study: yaw and pitch. Both these tend to concentrate around desired references, considering variant time delays.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Control Design for a Class of Nonlinear Network Control System: Helicopter Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000302511300014"}
