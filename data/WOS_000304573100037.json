The data are embedded in an original audio signal and transmitted through the air by playing back the data-embedded audio using a loudspeaker. At the receiver, the data are extracted from the received audio signal captured by a microphone. In our previous work, we proposed an acoustic data transmission system designed based on phase modification of the modulated complex lapped transform (MCLT) coefficients. In this paper, we propose the spectral magnitude adjustment (SMA) technique which not only enhances the quality of the data-embedded audio signal but also improves the transmission performance of the system.", "paper_title": "Spectral Magnitude Adjustment for MCLT-Based Acoustic Data Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000304573100037"}
