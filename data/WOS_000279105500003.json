Various pulsing schemes aiming to reduce operation power without compromising performance are assessed based on a calibrated model. Our results suggest that optimisation of power consumption can be done simply by design of pulsing techniques.", "paper_title": "Low power design of phase-change memory based on a comprehensive model", "paper_id": "WOS:000279105500003"}
