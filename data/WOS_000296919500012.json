This makes them ill-suited for public key signatures. However, their weakness in computation is offset by their communication strength and operation fashion. A server-aided verification signature scheme is very suitable for this scenario, which is composed of a digital signature scheme and a server-aided verification protocol. With the help of a powerful server, a verifier can check a signature with less computational cost compared with the original verification algorithm. This paper provides three specific contributions. First, we define a new security model of server-aided verification signature (SAV-Sigma) scheme. Then, we design an efficient (SAV-Sigma) based on the Paillier signature scheme [6] by using its homomorphic property. Finally, we prove that our scheme is secure under our security model.
