Functional correctness of a STM design (i.e., a design developed with STM) could often be expressed as invariant properties. In this paper, we first present a formalization of the static and dynamic aspects of STM designs. Consequentially, based on this formalization, we investigate a symbolic encoding approach, through which a STM design could be bounded model checked w.r.t. invariant properties by using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving technique. We have built a prototype implementation of the proposed encoding and the state-of-the-art SMT solver - Yices, is used in our experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Two attempts for accelerating SMT solving are also reported.", "paper_title": "An SMT-Based Approach to Bounded Model Checking of Designs in State Transition Matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000292619600002"}
