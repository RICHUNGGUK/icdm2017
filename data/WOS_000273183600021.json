The optimization consists of minimizing the number of terms that remain unintegrated. Further, the algorithm imposes an ordering of terms so that the differential order of these remaining terms is minimal. A different method for the Summation of difference expressions is presented in Appendix B. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
