The main idea is to present a mathematical description of high pressure processes in liquids at compressible conditions, quantifying the effect of density variations on the flow pattern due to those pressure variations. The improved mathematical approach is coupled to a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) solver. The main code was developed by OpenSource Ltd. for OpenFOAM, and the authors have introduced the additional expressions in order to calculate particular variables. For validating the code improvement, the LES solver is applied to a modern common-rail nozzle injector used in diesel engines. Results have been compared against other calculations that assumed constant properties and simultaneously validated with experimental data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
