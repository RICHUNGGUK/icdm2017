In this regard scalable video coding (SVC) has been actively studied due to its advantage of channel adaptation. We explore an optimal solution for maximizing the expected visual entropy over an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based broadband network from the perspective of cross-layer optimization. An optimization problem is parameterized by a set of source and channel parameters that are acquired along the user location over a multicell environment. A suboptimal solution is suggested using a greedy algorithm that allocates the radio resources to the scalable bitstreams as a function of their visual importance. The simulation results show that the greedy algorithm effectively resists ICI in the cell border region, while conventional nonscalable coding suffers severely because of ICI.", "paper_title": "Optimal Channel Adaptation of Scalable Video Over a Multicarrier-Based Multicell Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000269776700003"}
