It is a system of first-order partial differential equations (PDE) combined with an algebraic equation. The classical approach to its solution is to use the Taylor series with undetermined coefficients. In this contribution, another path is followed: the equation is solved using the finite-element method which is, nevertheless, suitable to solve PDE part only. This paper presents two methods to handle the algebraic condition: the first one is based on iterative minimization of a cost functional defined as the integral of the square of the algebraic expression to be equal to zero. The second method converts the algebraic-differential equation into a singularly perturbed system of partial differential equations only. Both methods axe compared and the simulation results axe presented including on-line control implementation to some practically motivated laboratory models.", "paper_title": "A COMPARISON OF TWO FEM-BASED METHODS FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE NONLINEAR OUTPUT REGULATION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000267932600005"}
