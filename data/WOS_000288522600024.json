These indices can provide look-ahead situation awareness for operators concerning impending large power grid blackouts. These indices are also easy to interpret and can be used to identify the location of critical edge components in terms of blackouts with cascading failures. In this paper, results from the application of the indices to 118-bus test power system are presented.", "paper_title": "POWER GRID NODE AND LINE DELTA CENTRALITY MEASURES FOR SELECTION OF CRITICAL LINES IN TERMS OF BLACKOUTS WITH CASCADING FAILURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600024"}
