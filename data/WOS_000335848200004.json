Thus, it seems to be the appropriate time to shed light over the achievements of the last decade, on the questions that have been successfully addressed, as well as on remaining challenging issues. In the present paper, we review the literature related to the areas of agent-based traffic modelling and simulation, and agent-based traffic control and management. Later we discuss and summarize the main achievements and the challenges.", "paper_title": "A review on agent-based technology for traffic and transportation", "paper_id": "WOS:000335848200004"}
