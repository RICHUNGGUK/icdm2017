There are many types of symmetric multiwavelets such as GHM and CL. However, the matrix filters generating the GHM system multiwavelets do not satisfy the symmetric property. Apparently, GHM cannot solve the edge problem accurately. For this reason, this paper presents some formulas for constructing the symmetric orthogonal matrix filters, which leads the symmetric orthogonal multiwavelets (SOM). Moreover, we analyze the frequency property by vanishing moments and prefilter technology to get a good combining frequency property. To prove the good property of SOM in image compression application, we compared the compression effect with other writers' work, which was in published literature. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our new symmetric orthogonal matrix filters combining with the prefilter technology and coefficient reorganization exhibit performance equal to, or in several cases superior to the GHM and CL symmetric multiwavelets.", "paper_title": "The application of symmetric orthogonal multiwavelets and prefilter technique for image compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600300005"}
