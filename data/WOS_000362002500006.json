This is a considerable improvement over previous performance of large-theory AI/ATP methods measured on the whole MML. To achieve that, a large suite of AI/ATP methods is employed and further developed. We implement the most useful methods efficiently, to scale them to the 150000 formulas in MML. This reduces the training times over the corpus to 1-3 seconds, allowing a simple practical deployment of the methods in the online automated reasoning service for the Mizar users (MIZAR ).", "paper_title": "MizAR 40 for Mizar 40", "paper_id": "WOS:000362002500006"}
