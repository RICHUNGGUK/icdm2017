It is demonstrated that the bound on free distance of periodically time-varying LDPC convolutional codes approaches the bound on free distance of general (nonperiodic) time-varying LDPC convolutional codes as the period increases. The proof of the bound is based on lower bounding the minimum distance of corresponding tail-biting LDPC convolutional codes, which is of interest in its own right.", "paper_title": "Distance Bounds for Periodically Time-Varying and Tail-Biting LDPC Convolutional Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000283072400009"}
