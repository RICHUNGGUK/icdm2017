We define a natural notion of flip between these arrangements and study the graph of these flips. In particular, we provide an enumeration algorithm for arrangements with a given support, based on the properties of certain greedy pseudoline arrangements and on their connection with sorting networks. Both the running time per arrangement and the working space of our algorithm are polynomial. As the motivation for this work, we provide in this paper a new interpretation of both pseudotriangulations and multitriangulations in terms of pseudoline arrangements on specific supports. This interpretation explains their common properties and leads to a natural definition of multipseudotriangulations, which generalizes both. We study elementary properties of multipseudotriangulations and compare them to iterations of pseudotriangulations.", "paper_title": "Multitriangulations, Pseudotriangulations and Primitive Sorting Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000304119600008"}
