Limitations in the traditional fitting programs require strict control of external parameters such as temperature, pH, etc. Recent developments in fitting programs combine the analysis of non-ideal data with the global analysis of several different measurements. There are several advantages, the methods circumvent the necessity of external control of these parameters (thermostatting, buffering), they simplify experimental design, and they deliver additional information such as activation parameters and reaction enthalpies. Several practical examples and applications are given. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.
