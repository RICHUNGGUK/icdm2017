In this paper, we propose a new tree modeling system based on L-system that allows the user to control the overall appearance and the depth of recursion, which represents the level of growth, easily and directly, by drawing a single stroke. We introduce a new module into L-system whose growth direction is determined by a user-drawn stroke. As the user draws the stroke, the system gradually advances the growth simulation and creates a tree model along the stroke. Our technique is the first attempt to control the growth of a simulation in L-system using stroke input.", "paper_title": "The sketch L-system: Global control of tree modeling using free-form strokes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566000013"}
