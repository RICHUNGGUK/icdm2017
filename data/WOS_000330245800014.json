We formulate video summarization as a discrete optimization problem, where the optimal summary is determined by adopting Lagrangian relaxation and convex-hull approximation to solve a resource allocation problem. To trade-off playback speed and perceptual comfort we consider information associated to the still content of the scene, which is essential to evaluate the relevance of a video, and information associated to the scene activity, which is more relevant for visual comfort. We perform clip-level fast-forwarding by selecting the playback speeds from discrete options, which naturally include content truncation as special case with infinite playback speed. We demonstrate the proposed summarization framework in two use cases, namely summarization of broadcasted soccer videos and surveillance videos. Objective and subjective experiments are performed to demonstrate the relevance and efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Resource Allocation for Personalized Video Summarization", "paper_id": "WOS:000330245800014"}
