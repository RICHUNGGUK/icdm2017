The main purpose is to identify the conspirators and make a priority list based on the given message traffic in a certain crime case. To identify one person, we firstly quantify the topics through Analytic Hierarchy Process, then establish the network model based on Graph Theory and finally conclude the relative relevance from this person to the known conspirators and non-conspirators. The flexibility of the model is illustrated and the results show that the method is effective. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
