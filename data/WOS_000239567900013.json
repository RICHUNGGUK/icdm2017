However, exact mu-bases may have high degree with complicated rational coefficients and are often hard to compute (especially for surfaces), and sometimes they are not easy to use in geometric modeling and processing applications. In this paper, we introduce approximate mu-bases for rational curves and surfaces, and present an algorithm to compute approximate mu-bases. The algorithm amounts to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem and some quadratic programming problems with linear constraints. As applications, approximate implicitization and degree reduction of rational curves and surfaces with approximate mu-bases are discussed. Both the parametric equations and the implicit equations of the approximate curves/surfaces are easily obtained by using the approximate mu-bases. As indicated by the examples, the proposed algorithm may be a useful alternative to other methods for approximate implicitization.", "paper_title": "Approximate mu-bases of rational curves and surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900013"}
