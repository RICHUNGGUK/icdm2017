First, different legitimate packet discard situations are modeled, such as those generated by collisions, channel errors or mobility related droppings. Second, we propose an anomaly-based IDS system based on an enhanced windowing method to carry out the collection and analysis of selected cross-layer features. Third, a real deployment of the IDS is also considered by suggesting a methodology for the collection of the selected features in a distributed manner. We evaluate our proposal in a simulation framework and the experimental results show a considerable enhancement in detection results when compared with other approaches in the literature. For instance, our scheme shows a 22% improvement in terms of true positives rate and a remarkable 83% improvement in terms of false positives rate when compared to previous well-known statistical solutions. Finally, it is notable the simplicity and lightweightness of the proposal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
