This paper presents a novel approach of examining multi-criteria weight sensitivity of a GIS-based MCDM model. It explores the dependency of model output on the weights of input parameters, identifying criteria that are especially sensitive to weight changes and to show the impacts of changing criteria weights on the model outcomes in spatial dimension. A methodology was developed to perform simulations where the weights associated with all criteria used for suitability modelling were varied one-at-a-time (OAT) to investigate their relative impacts on the final evaluation results. A tool which incorporates the OAT method with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) within the ArcGIS environment was implemented. It permits a range of user defined simulations to be performed to quantitatively evaluate model dynamic changes, measures the stability of results with respect to the variation of different parameter weights, and displays spatial change dynamics. A case study of irrigated cropland suitability assessment addressing the application of the new GIS-based AHP-SA tool is described. It demonstrates that the tool is spatial, simple and flexible.
