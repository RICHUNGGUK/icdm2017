The proposed method discriminates between the shadow and the moving object by cascading three estimators which use the properties of chromaticity, brightness, and local intensity ratio. In the spatial adjustment step, the method compensates for accumulated errors in the cascading process. Experimental results show that our scheme can operate in real-time, outperforms existing methods, and rapidly adapts to variations in the environment. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
