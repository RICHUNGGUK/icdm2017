However, such mechanisms suffer from inevitable prediction errors, which in turn degrade the overall performance in real implementations. To circumvent such problems, we propose a fundamental framework to efficiently manage the harvested energy in a prediction free manner. In particular, we theoretically derive a set of Budget Assigning Principles (BAPs) to maximize the amount of harvested energy that Can be utilized by a sensor in the presence of battery energy storage inefficiencies, which in turn maximize the sensor's performance level in terms of the sensor's average duty cycle. A Prediction FREE Energy Neutral (P-FREEN) power management mechanism is then proposed to implement the BAPs based solely on current observed energy harvesting rate and battery residual energy level. The performance of P-FREEN is verified via theoretical analysis and extensive computer simulations using real life energy harvesting data sets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
