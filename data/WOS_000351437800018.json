Its different basic variants have been widely explored in the literature. Even though it has been studied for years, the research around it is still very active. The new tendency is mainly focused on applying this study case to real-life problems. Due to this trend, the Rich VRP arises: combining multiple constraints for tackling realistic problems. Nowadays, some studies have considered specific combinations of real-life constraints to define the emerging Rich VRP scopes. This work surveys the state of the art in the field, summarizing problem combinations, constraints defined, and approaches found.", "paper_title": "Rich Vehicle Routing Problem: Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000351437800018"}
