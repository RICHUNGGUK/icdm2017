The proposed method enables a quick and precise detection of marginal bone destructions around teeth including implant through multi-template matching in reference to Region of Interest (ROI) obtained from applicable teeth using information about their geometric forms to solve problems single-template matching is exposed to. Actually, the performance test showed that it was possible not only to quickly and precisely detect marginal bone destructions around teeth, but also to get more objective and quantitative results through the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Marginal bone destructions in dental radiography using multi-template based on Internet services", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900109"}
