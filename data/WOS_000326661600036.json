To strive to balance power consumption and performance, this paper proposes an adaptive workload-driven dynamic power management policy for homogeneous clusters, which dynamically adjusts the power mode of computing nodes according to workload variation. The proposed policy combines the pre-wakeup method and the feedback mechanism to reduce performance degradation due to the wakeup delay. The experimental results demonstrate that, as compared with two existing timeout policies, adaptive workload-driven dynamic power management effectively reduced the performance loss with a slight increase in power consumption.
