In this paper, we focus on the photonic switching networks built on the banyan-based. architecture and directional coupler technology. We explore the capability of these networks to support general f-cast traffic, which covers the unicast traffic (f = 1) and multicast traffic (f = N) as special cases, and determine the conditions for these networks to be f-cast strictly nonblocking under various crosstalk constraints. In particular, we, propose an optimization framework to determine the nonblocking condition of an f-cast photonic network when a general crosstalk constraint is imposed.", "paper_title": "Strictly nonblocking f-cast photonic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256967100019"}
