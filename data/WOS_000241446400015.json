A new concept of adaptive individual niche radius, introduced here for the first time, is applied to the ES Niching with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA) method. The proposed method is described in detail, and then tested on high-dimensional theoretical test functions. It is shown to be robust and to achieve satisfying results.", "paper_title": "Niche radius adaptation in the CMA-ES niching algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400015"}
