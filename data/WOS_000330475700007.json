P2P content discovery techniques including structured and unstructured can be employed in MANETs by considering its special characteristics and limitations. The most important characteristic of MANETs is the mobility of the nodes which creates a dynamic topology. A novel framework is presented to evaluate the effect of mobility and its models on the resource discovery. By using several metrics, this framework is capable of evaluating the effect of mobility on the underlay structure and subsequent changes on the overlay structure. The results obtained from extensive simulation, presented here, clarify the significant role of the mobility models on the performance of P2P content discovery protocols. These results are supported by mathematical analysis of content discovery protocols.", "paper_title": "The impact of mobility models on the performance of P2P content discovery protocols over mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330475700007"}
