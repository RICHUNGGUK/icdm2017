One of the main drawback of this method, however, is that it is based on reference data. When they are obtained for one single set of parameter values, the resulting model can reproduce the reference dynamics very accurately but generally lack of robustness away from the reference state. It is therefore crucial to enlarge the validity range of these models beyond the parameter values for which they were derived. This paper presents two strategies based on shape sensitivity analysis to partially address this limitation of the POD for parameters that define the geometry of the problem at hand (design or shape parameters.) We first detail the methodology to compute both the POD modes and their Lagrangian sensitivities with respect to shape parameters. From them, we derive improved reduced-order bases to approximate a class of solutions over a range of parameter values. Secondly, we demonstrate the efficiency and limitations of these approaches on two typical flow problems: (1) the one-dimensional Burgers' equation; (2) the two-dimensional flows past a square cylinder over a range of incidence angles.
