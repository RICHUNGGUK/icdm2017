It is shown here that an ordinary time-invariant (TI) Volterra analysis with fitted polynomial models can be used in such a non-linear application as mixers and switching power amplifiers, where time-varying (TV) Volterra analysis has often been used. TI and TV Volterra analyses are compared behaviorally, and the use of TI Volterra with fitted polynomial coefficients is illustrated by analyzing two highly non-linear example circuits using a recently developed Volterra-on-Harmonic-Balance (VoHB) analysis tool.", "paper_title": "Comparison of ordinary and time-varying Volterra analysis for finding distortion contributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000312769900002"}
