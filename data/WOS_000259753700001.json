In addition to the standard explicit, implicit schemes and the spectral methods, a novel scheme SRK which is based on a time-splitting approach combined with the Runge-Kutta method is presented. We demonstrate that not only the SRK scheme is efficient compared to the split step spectral methods, but it can apply directly to problems with general boundary conditions. The conservation properties of the numerical schemes are discussed. Numerical simulations are reported for case studies with different types of initial data. The present study enhances our understanding of the behavior of nonlinear dispersive waves in the semi-classical limit. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
