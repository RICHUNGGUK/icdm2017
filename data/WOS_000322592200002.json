In these systems one must satisfy the pedagogical constraint: the user must give an example of any introduced notion. In formal terms, for instance in the propositional case, the main modification is that we replace the usual rule (hyp) by the rule (p-hyp) F is an element of Gamma/Gamma proves F(hyp) F is an element of Gamma proves sigma center dot Gamma/Gamma proves F(p-hyp) where sigma denotes a substitution which replaces variables of Gamma with an example. This substitution sigma is called the motivation of Gamma. First we expose the reasons of such a constraint and properties of these \"pedagogical\" calculi: the absence of negation at logical side, and the \"usefulness\" feature of terms at computational side (through the Curry-Howard correspondence). Then we construct a simple pedagogical restriction of the calculus of constructions (CC) called CCr. We establish logical limitations of this system, and compare its computational expressiveness to Godel system T. Finally, guided by the logical limitations of CCr, we give a formal and general definition of a \"pedagogical calculus of constructions\".", "paper_title": "Investigations on a Pedagogical Calculus of Constructions", "paper_id": "WOS:000322592200002"}
