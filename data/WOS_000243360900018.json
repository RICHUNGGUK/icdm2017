The combline structure provides a way to reduce the final dimension of the filter. The characteristic impedance and phase constant equations of the combline coupler are derived in terms of impedance and phase constant of the single microstrip coupled lines. Reduction of 30% has been achieved. (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "Coupled microstrip comblines filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000243360900018"}
