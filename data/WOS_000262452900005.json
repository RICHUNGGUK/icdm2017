Since co-located events are meant to be executed synchronously, the behaviour of such systems is captured by step transition systems, where arcs are labelled by sets of events rather than by single events. We completely characterise transition systems generated by ENCL-systems after extending the standard notion of a region - defined as a certain set of states - with explicit information about events which, in particular, are responsible for crossing its border. As a result, we are able to construct, for each such transition system, a suitable ENCL-system generating it.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of Elementary Net Systems with Context Arcs and Localities", "paper_id": "WOS:000262452900005"}
