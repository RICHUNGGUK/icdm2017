A number of solutions have been proposed in public key settings. Hierarchical identity-based cryptography is a generalization of identity-based encryption that mirrors an organizational hierarchy, which allows a root private key generator to distribute the work load by delegating private key generation and identity authentication to lower-level private key generators. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical identity-based proxy re-encryption (HIBPRE) scheme which achieves IND-PrID-CCA2 security without random oracles. This is the first HIBPRE scheme up to now, and our scheme satisfies unidirectionality, non-interactivity and permits multiple re-encryptions.", "paper_title": "HIERARCHICAL IDENTITY-BASED PROXY RE-ENCRYPTION WITHOUT RANDOM ORACLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000286806000013"}
