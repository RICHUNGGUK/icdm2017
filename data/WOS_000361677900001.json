However, the huge energy consumption caused by video encoding and transmitting and the slowly evolving battery technologies become the major bottlenecks that hinder the development of video streaming services. Hence energy efficient video coding and transmitting solutions are required to be investigated. Yet, energy consumption reduction of mobile video devices will be accompanied with Quality of Experience (QoE) degradation of video applications. Such diverse tendency makes it difficult to encode and transmit video streams with less energy as well as better QoE. This paper analyzes the major energy consuming factors in mobile video devices. A specific energy consumption model concerning encoding bitrates and transmitting power level is built. Further, a noninvasive QoE perceptive model is adopted so that the energy efficiency problem becomes a cross-layer optimization problem. Chaos particle swarm optimization is used to solve this cross-layer optimization problem with fast convergence. By this method, energy consumption of mobile video device is minimized with acceptable QoE for video users. At last, Pareto front of energy and QoE is analyzed to certify the performance of our method.", "paper_title": "QoE Perceptive Cross-Layer Energy Efficient Method for Mobile Video Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000361677900001"}
