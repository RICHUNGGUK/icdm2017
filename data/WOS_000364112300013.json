Also, services provided such as: Clouding, storage system, online banking and e-commerce are very common and used on daily basis, still there are many missing components regarding more human interaction with the web page, rather than just seeing and clicking. In this paper, we implemented a system that's capable of identifying mouse location onto a web page and capturing that component (mostly images) extracting its meta-data and Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF) information, this information is processed further by a basic natural language processing subsystem providing it with text parsing results after tokenizing the string, this is to come with a single conclusion: What dose this image represents. The result is normally a single descriptive word corresponds to that image sent to a micro-controller to be analyzed through a table with corresponding values essentially a set of pulses and signals data, to display it as a smell corresponds to the item under the mouse by applying the pulses to the atomizer to give the user the smell of that object. We found that the system has high successful identification ratio over websites with fairly accurate image identification ratio.", "paper_title": "Smelling the Web Olfactory Display for Web Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000364112300013"}
