This paper proposes an approximate solution approach to the EM to facilitate its computation. We refer to the approach as a linear programming approximation to the EM, or LPAEM for short. As the name implies, the LPAEM simplifies the nonlinear eigenvalue equations as a linear programming for solution. It produces true weights for perfectly consistent pairwise comparison matrices. Numerical examples are examined to show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed LPAEM and its significant advantages over a recently developed linear programming method entitled LP-GW-AHP in rank preservation.
