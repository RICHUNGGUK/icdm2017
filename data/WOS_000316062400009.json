The equivalent capacitance between the power plane and the HIS and the self-inductance of the patch can be increased significantly, while the self-inductance of the power plane is decreased. The proposed EBG structure performs excellent ultra-wide band simultaneous switching noise mitigation and keeps signal integrity in high-speed digital circuits. The suppression bandgap of the design is from 0.6 to 15 GHz at -30 dB. Good performance is validated by both simulation and measurement. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
