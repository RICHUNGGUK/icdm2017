While this coexistence of RATs offers various advantages, it also imposes many challenges for the network operator, whose aim is to maximize the generated revenue while satisfying the customers' increasing demands. One important mechanism in heterogeneous wireless networks (HWN) is the RAT selection. It is normally triggered when a new call arrives, and provides the decision on whether the call can be admitted or not, and by which RAT it has to be served. Different approaches can be used to tackle the problem of RAT selection in HWNs. In this paper, we study Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based RAT selection in a cellular/WLAN heterogeneous network where the maximization of the revenue is considered as objective. An optimal RAT selection policy is therefore derived. The performance of the optimal scheme is evaluated in comparison with two other policies, namely Cellular-First policy and Load Balancing policy.
