In this paper, we have developed a new algorithm for learning BNs which employs a recently introduced meta-heuristic: artificial bee colony (ABC). All the phases necessary to tackle our learning problem using this meta-heuristic are described, and some experimental results to compare the performance of our ABC-based algorithm with other algorithms are given in the paper.", "paper_title": "An artificial bee colony algorithm for learning Bayesian networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319018500006"}
