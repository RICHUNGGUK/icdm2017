Unlike traditional approaches for optimising production cost, this paper deals with optimising the cutting operation considering the current state of the cutting tool. Artificial intelligence techniques for modelling (artificial neural networks) and optimising (genetic algorithms and mesh adaptive direct search algorithms) are applied for this purpose. As a result, the production cost estimation from the proposed approach is 13% lower than the one obtained by the traditional approach with 76% less uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Adaptive control optimisation system for minimising production cost in hard milling operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000331864000004"}
