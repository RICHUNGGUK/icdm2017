Data were classified according to the original Computing Classification System (CCS) classification and co-categories were used for similarity metrics calculation. The authors' approach based on MDS was enriched by algorithm mapping to spherical topology. Three other methods were based on VOS, VxOrd and SOM mapping techniques. Visualization of the classified collection was done for three different decades. Tracking the changes in visualization patterns, the authors sought the method that would reveal the real evolution of the CCS scheme, which is still being updated by the editorial board. Comparative analysis is based on qualitative methods. Changes in those properties over two decades were evaluated for the benefit of the authors' method of mapping. The qualitative analysis shows clustering of proper categories and overlapping of other ones in the authors' approach, which corresponds to the current changes in the classification scheme and computer science literature.", "paper_title": "Study of dynamics of structured knowledge: Qualitative analysis of different mapping approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000351071800005"}
