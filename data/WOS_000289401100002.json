In this paper, a novel approach for reconstructing point clouds by a hierarchical template model is presented. The template model is composed of three types of primitive geometric shape in a hierarchical manner. Compared to previous approaches which are based on an iterative fitting process, the primitive shapes are represented in algebraic form and fit to a point cloud by solving a least-square linear system. This non-iterative process makes the proposed approach feasible and robust for modeling huge amounts of point data. Furthermore, some geometric constraints are integrated into the least-square fitting system to retain the geometric relations between the primitive shapes in the template model, which can improve modeling quality. The experiment results for various point cloud:, show that the proposed approach is capable of handling point clouds with both noise and sharp features.", "paper_title": "POINT CLOUD MODELING USING ALGEBRAIC TEMPLATE", "paper_id": "WOS:000289401100002"}
