This is achieved by eliminating most of the noise from the residual signal through an autorgressive (AR) modeling. The AR model parameters are estimated in real time. Computer experiments using experimental data from NASA Langley Research Center are used to demonstrate an implementation of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Reduction of false alarms in fault detection problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255400001"}
