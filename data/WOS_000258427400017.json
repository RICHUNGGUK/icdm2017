In contrast to existing BMAs, the proposed algorithm uses an asymmetrical search pattern and a predicted motion vector in the initial search step, and then dynamically adjusts the size of the search pattern throughout the remainder of the search procedure in order to minimize the total number of search points required. The performance of the AAPS algorithm is evaluated using an MPEG-4 encoding platform. The experimental results show that compared to the diamond search algorithm and the adaptive rood pattern search algorithm, AAPS improves the search speed by 56 similar to 65% and 20%, respectively, while simultaneously maintaining a high peak-signal-to-noise ratio.", "paper_title": "A novel fast block-matching algorithm for motion estimation using adaptively asymmetric patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400017"}
