At the macroblock (MB) level, we derive the normalization factors based on the structural similarity (SSIM) index as an attempt to transform the discrete cosine transform domain frame residuals to a perceptually uniform space. We further develop an MB level perceptual mode selection scheme and a frame level global quantization matrix optimization method. Extensive simulations and subjective tests verify that, compared with the H.264/AVC video coding standard, the proposed method can achieve significant gain in terms of rate-SSIM performance and provide better visual quality.", "paper_title": "Perceptual Video Coding Based on SSIM-Inspired Divisive Normalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000318016600014"}
