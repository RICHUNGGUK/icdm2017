Separable codes can be used to construct fingerprints resistant to the averaging collusion attack on multimedia contents. In this paper, we investigate (t) over bar -separable codes from a combinatorial point of view. We first derive several upper bounds on the sizes of (t) over bar -separable codes, and then turn our attention to the constructions of optimal (2) over bar -separable codes with short length. Two infinite families of optimal (2) over bar -separable codes of length 2 are constructed from projective planes, and all optimal (2) over bar -separable codes of length 3 are explicitly constructed by means of difference matrices. These optimal (2) over bar -separable codes with short length can be used to construct good (2) over bar -separable codes with long length by a known composition construction.", "paper_title": "Separable Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000300845900031"}
