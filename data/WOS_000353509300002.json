To date, most of the SADP-related literature has focused on enabling SADP-legal routing in physical design tools while few attempts have been made to address the impact SADP routing has on local, standard cell (SC) I/O pin access. At the same time, via layers are used to connect the local SADP routing layers to the I/O pins on lower metal layers. Due to the high via density on the Via-1 layer, the litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE)-aware Via-1 design becomes a necessity to achieve legal pin access at the SC level. In this paper, we present the first study on SADP-aware pin access and layout optimization at the SC level. Accounting for SADP-specific and Via-1 design rules, we propose a coherent framework that uses depth first search, mixed integer linear programming, and backtracking method to enable LELE friendly Via-1 design and simultaneously optimize SADP-based local pin access and within-cell connections. Our experimental results show that, compared with the conventional approach, our framework effectively improves pin access of the SCs and maximizes the pin access flexibility for routing.", "paper_title": "Self-Aligned Double Patterning Aware Pin Access and Standard Cell Layout Co-Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000353509300002"}
