The numerical simulation was carried out by using a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model. An interface element with a suitable damage model was used to model the connection between concrete surface and SRG reinforcing layer. The reliability of the finite element 3D-model was checked using experimental data obtained on a set of three RC beams. The parameters taken into consideration were the external configuration, with or without U-end anchorages, the concrete strength, the amount of internal tensile steel reinforcement. Conclusions were made concerning the strength and the ductility of the strengthened beams by varying the parameters and on the effectiveness of the SRG reinforcing system applied with two types of external strengthening configuration.", "paper_title": "Experimental study and numerical investigation of behavior of RC beams strengthened with steel reinforced grout", "paper_id": "WOS:000348594100005"}
