Segmentation is a difficult task and challenging problem in the brain and breast medical images for diagnosing Breast and Brain cancer related diseases before the image goes for treatment plan. This paper presents three new effective fuzzy clustering techniques: Robust KFCM (Kernel Fuzzy C-Means) with spatial information, Effective Robust FCM based Kernel function, Modified fuzzy c-means algorithm with weight Bias Estimation. In experiments, the presented methods are compared with other reported methods. Experimental results on both breast and brain MR images show that the proposed algorithms have better performance than the standard algorithms. Thus, the proposed method is capable of dealing with the intensity in-homogeneities and noised image effectively.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED FUZZY CLUSTERING SEGMENTATION FOR MEDICAL IMAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000280426100011"}
