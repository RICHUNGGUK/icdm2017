AVS stenoses are often associated with blood sounds, resulting from turbulent flow over the narrowed blood vessel. Phonoangiography provides a noninvasive technique to monitor the sounds of the AVS. Since the power spectra changes in frequency and amplitude with the degree of AVS stenosis, it is difficult to make a human-made decision to judge the degree using a combination of those variances. The Burg autoregressive (AR) method is used to estimate the frequency spectra of a phonoangiographic signal and identify the characteristic frequencies. A rule-based decision-making method, FPNs, is designed as a decision-making system to evaluate the degree of stenosis (DOS) in routine examinations. For 42 long-term follow-up patients, the examination results show the proposed diagnosis system has greater efficiency in evaluating AVS stenosis.", "paper_title": "A Rule-Based Decision-Making Diagnosis System to Evaluate Arteriovenous Shunt Stenosis for Hemodialysis Treatment of Patients Using Fuzzy Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000332987400035"}
