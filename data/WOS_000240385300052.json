In this paper, a new blocking artifacts reduction algorithm is proposed to reduce blocking artifacts and preserve edges adequately. We introduce the definition of homogeneous block and the measurement with an alterable threshold for judging whether a shifted block is homogeneous or inhomogeneous. For each row of the homogeneous blocks, an adaptive Sigmoid function is used to replace the step function to reduce blocking artifacts. For the inhomogeneous blocks, Sigma filter is used to smooth two adjacent blocks' boundary. Simulation results evaluated by both visual and numerical quality metrics show that the proposed blocking artifacts reduction algorithm outperforms the original algorithms.", "paper_title": "Sigmoid function activated blocking artifacts reduction algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300052"}
