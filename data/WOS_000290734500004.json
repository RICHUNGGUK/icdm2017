In this paper, we present a novel computer-aided design flow for redundancy-based applications on FPGAs in order to mitigate the impact of SEUs in the configuration bitstreams. We introduce the notions of modular redundancy conflicts and vulnerability-gap conflicts which maintain the fundamental assumption underlying the integrity of redundancy-based designs (i.e., self-containment of SEU-induced faults within a single replica of redundant resources). When the impact of SEU-induced bridging faults is considered in high-level synthesis as well as physical synthesis, on average more than 30% improvement in the number of potential SEU-induced bridging faults can be reached as well as improvements in the performance and area utilization, compared to post-synthesis TMR, in which the voters are applied to the feedback structures in the circuit. Compared to the extreme case of post-synthesis TMR in which the voters are applied at the end of every configurable logic block, we reach 38% (26%) improvement in performance(area) of the implemented circuits.", "paper_title": "SEU-Aware High-Level Data Path Synthesis and Layout Generation on SRAM-Based FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000290734500004"}
