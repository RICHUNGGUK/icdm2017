The fuzzy system is based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model that is often used to represent the complex nonlinear systems in terms of fuzzy sets and fuzzy reasoning. To reflect more realistic dynamical behaviors of the system, both the parameter uncertainties and the stochastic disturbances are considered, where the parameter uncertainties enter into all the system matrices and the stochastic disturbances are given in the form of a Brownian motion. We first propose the definition of robust passivity in the sense of expectation. Then, by utilizing the Lyapunov functional method, the Ito differential rule and the matrix analysis techniques, we establish several sufficient criteria such that, for all admissible parameter uncertainties and stochastic disturbances, the closed-loop stochastic fuzzy time-delay system is robustly passive in the sense of expectation. The derived criteria, which are either delay-independent or delay-dependent, are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that can be easily checked by using the standard numerical software. Illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
