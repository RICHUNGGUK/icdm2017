A hybrid model is established based on the complementarities between continuous chaos and digital chaos. An impulse-like controller along with a state feedback controller is designed to guarantee the robust synchronization of uncertain continuous chaotic systems and reduce the dynamical degradation of digital chaotic systems respectively. Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the hybrid model. Compared with the existing synchronization schemes, this model can realize the synchronization of two uncertain continuous chaotic systems without transmission of synchronization control signals and has better robustness. Meanwhile, it can make the properties of given digital chaotic systems achieve desirable levels, while the existing remedies for digital chaotic systems fail to. Thus, the hybrid model is very applicable to cryptography, secure communication and other potential applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
