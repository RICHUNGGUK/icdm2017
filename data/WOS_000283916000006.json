However, it can be difficult to quantify their utility and it is essential to ensure that students are achieving the learning outcomes required rather than just learning to play a game. Maintaining engagement and encouraging reflection are critical elements in ensuring that effective learning is occurring. Recent work using simulation games for teaching construction project planning and control is described with reference to a range of methods employed by the authors. The paper focuses on a teaching module at the University of Nottingham employing simulation games as the primary source of instruction in a self-directed learning exercise. This style of teaching is not suited to all students and current work to extend the learning experience to suit a wider audience is described. Preliminary findings from the work are given along with discussion of plans for further development Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
