These descriptors have been applied for QSPR modelling of the H-bond basicity scale pKBHX, measured by the 1:1 complexation constant of a series of organic acceptors (H-bond bases) with 4-fluorophenol as the reference H-bond donor in CCl4 at 298K. Unlike previous QSPR studies of H-bond complexation, the models based on these new descriptors are able to predict the H-bond basicity of different acceptor centres on the same polyfunctional molecule. QSPR models were obtained using support vector machine and ensemble multiple linear regression methods on a set of 537 organic compounds including 5 bifunctional molecules. They were validated with cross-validation procedures and with two external test sets. The best model displays good predictive performance on a large test set of 451mono- and bifunctional molecules: a root-mean squared error RMSE=0.26 and a determination coefficient R2=0.91. It is implemented on our website (http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr/webserv/VSEngine.html) together with the estimation of its applicability domain and an automatic detection of potential H-bond acceptors.", "paper_title": "Individual Hydrogen-Bond Strength QSPR Modelling with ISIDA Local Descriptors: a Step Towards Polyfunctional Molecules", "paper_id": "WOS:000337624900012"}
