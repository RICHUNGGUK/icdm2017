The past study showed that a greedy strategy can give a good approximate solution to the problem. However, a conventional greedy method faces a computational problem. We propose a method of efficiently finding a good approximate solution to the problem under the greedy algorithm on the basis of bond percolation and graph theory, and compare the proposed method with the conventional method in terms of computational complexity in order to theoretically evaluate its effectiveness. The results show that the proposed method is expected to achieve a great reduction in computational cost. We further experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method is much more efficient than the conventional method using large-scale real-world networks including blog networks.", "paper_title": "Extracting influential nodes on a social network for information diffusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000273812400004"}
