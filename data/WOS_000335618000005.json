The analysis examines 145 contributions made by a teacher to two groups of postgraduate students (group 1: 5 students; group 2: 4 students) of the same course whose task was to develop collaboratively a rubric for assessing teacher competencies by means of the Knowledge Forum platform. The results show that the teacher offered both elaboration and verification feedback, not only regarding the learning content but also the students' approach to the academic task and their social participation in the group. This would seem appropriate in terms of supporting the process of knowledge building in this kind of setting. The results also highlight that, when evaluating whether the feedback given is well matched to the needs of student groups engaged in online collaborative learning, it is important to take into account the timing of the teacher's interventions.
