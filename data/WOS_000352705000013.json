In this paper we develop near-exact approximations for the distribution of linear combination of independent Gumbel random variables based on a shifted generalized near-integer gamma distribution and on the distribution of the difference of two independent generalized integer gamma distributions. These near-exact distributions are computationally appealing and numerical studies confirm their accuracy, as assessed by a proximity measure used in related studies. We illustrate the proposed approximations on applied problems in networks engineering, computational biology, and flood risk management.", "paper_title": "On the distribution of linear combinations of independent Gumbel random variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000352705000013"}
