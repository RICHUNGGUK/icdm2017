However, it is still difficult for researchers to choose the best method due to the lack of an effective comparison. For the first time we have made an extensive study on methods for feature extraction for the problem of HIV-1 protease. We show that a fusion of classifiers trained in different feature spaces permits to obtain a drastically error reduction with respect to the performance of the state-of-the-art.
