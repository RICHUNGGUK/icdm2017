Kullback-Leibler divergence is introduced to the stochastic distribution control, and the parameter of the stochastic distribution controller is updated at each sample interval rather than using a batch mode. It is shown that the estimated weight vector will converge to its ideal value and the system will be asymptotically stable under the rank-condition, which is much weaker than the persistent excitation condition. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by simulation.", "paper_title": "Sliding-Mode Control Design for Nonlinear Systems Using Probability Density Function Shaping", "paper_id": "WOS:000330040800007"}
