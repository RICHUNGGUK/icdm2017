The tiny distributed wireless microsensor network systems, however, should be designed to overcome various constraints such as limited energy, bandwidth limit, and unexpected failure of communication under disturbances. In addition, their network topologies need to be managed with designated communication protocols. Thus, design of microsensor network protocols still needs to be application-specific. It should be also evaluated through designated tools at each level of networking characteristics. This research describes essential factors that affect the performance of sensor network systems in the design of wireless microsensor network protocols, and presents effective time-based network protocol and performance evaluation tool which are applicable for various protocols in industrial applications. The developed network evaluation tool, called TIE/MEMS, also includes functional comparison with recent protocols proposed for wireless microsensor networks, and provides design guidelines for multi-sensor network systems needed for emerging industrial applications.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of wireless sensor network protocols for industrial applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000256080900009"}
