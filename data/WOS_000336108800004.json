Prefixes of u with increasing length are constructed using a pseudopalindromic closure operator. We show that generalized Thue-Morse words tb.,, with b, m E N and b, m 2, are generalized pseudostandard words if and only if tb,m is a periodic word or b m. This extends the result of de Luca and De Luca obtained for the classical Thue-Morse words. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
