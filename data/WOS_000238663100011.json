This system consists of four CCD cameras, two for capturing instantaneous flow fields and two for tracking a solid body. The three-dimensional vector fields around a cylinder are measured while the motion of the cylinder forced by the flow field is measured simultaneously with the constructed system. The cylinder is suspended in the circulating water channel and the surface of the working fluid is forced sinusoidal to make the cylinder bounced. Reynolds number for the mean main stream is about 3500. The interaction between the flow fields and the cylinder motion is examined quantitatively.", "paper_title": "Non-contact 3D flow-structure interaction measurement (FSIM) system for motion and flow fields - Interactions of a vertical cylinder motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000238663100011"}
