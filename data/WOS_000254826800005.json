In this context, Multi-User Session Control (MUSC) is proposed to allow fixed and mobile users to access multi-user sessions ubiquitously, while providing QoS mapping, QoS adaptation and connectivity control in heterogeneous environments with mobile receivers and static senders. By interacting with resource allocation controllers, MUSC allows the construction of QoS-aware distribution trees over networks with different QoS models and aims to keep sessions with an acceptable quality of experience in congestion periods. Furthermore, by interacting with mobility controllers, MUSC assures the session continuity with QoS and connectivity support. MUSC was evaluated in a simulation and in an experimental environment to analyze its convergence time as well as its efficiency in allowing seamless mobility and in keeping sessions with an acceptable quality level during handover.
