This paper studies the achievable DMT of the same network when the relay is constrained to make use of standard (non-WZ) source coding. Under a short-term power constraint at the relay, using source coding without side information results in a significant loss in terms of the DMT. For multiplexing gains r <= 2/3 this loss can be fully compensated for by using power control at the relay. On the contrary, for r is an element of (2/3, 1), the loss with respect to WZ coding remains significant.", "paper_title": "Quantifying the Loss of Compress-Forward Relaying Without Wyner-Ziv Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632200007"}
