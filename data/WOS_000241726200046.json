NeuroQL is designed primarily for neuroinformatics database users and aims to enable users to directly interact with neuroscience databases in their professional concepts and terms with the help of a conceptual data model. NeuroQL is DBMS independent and can be translated into traditional query language such as SQL, OQL and XQuery. It integrates some object-oriented features, and supports neuron domain-specific data types and query operators, which can dynamically evolve when the underlying database schema evolves.", "paper_title": "NeuroQL: A domain-speciflc query language for neuroscience data", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200046"}
