The planning method is based on Statistical Deformation Model (SDM) which is generated from Point Distribution Model (PDM) by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. The position from which the individual factor coefficients are observed clearly and the principal shape features are identified distinctly is the best viewpoint. The observed times of landmark are used to exclude the redundancy among views. So, in an iteration process new SDM is repeatedly computed to pick out the optimal viewpoints until all the landmarks are observed sufficiently. Therefore abundant information with the minimum redundancy is provided by fewer cameras, and an experiment which layout cameras for foot reconstruction was demonstrated.", "paper_title": "A camera planning method for the 3D reconstruction of a single object based on statistical deformation model", "paper_id": "WOS:000316483000011"}
