Recently proposed Hole-Filler model is low consuming for XML fragments transmission and evaluation, however existing work addressed the multiple query problem over XML tuple streams instead of XML fragment streams. By taking advantage of schema information for XML, this paper proposes a model of tid+ tree to construct multiple queries over XML fragments and to prune off duplicate and dependent operations. Based on tid+ tree, it then proposes a notion of FQ-Index as the core in M-XFPro to index both multiple queries and XML fragments for processing multiple XPath queries involving simple path and twig path patterns. We illustrate the effectiveness of the techniques developed with a detailed set of experiments.", "paper_title": "Efficient evaluation of multiple queries on streamed XML fragments", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700006"}
