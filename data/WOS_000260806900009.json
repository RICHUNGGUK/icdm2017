This paper proposes a multiagent Reinforcement Learning approach, that uses coordinated actions, which we call strategies and a fusing process to guide the agents. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct experiments in the Predator-Prey domain and compare it with other learning techniques. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A HYBRID MULTIAGENT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING APPROACH USING STRATEGIES AND FUSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000260806900009"}
