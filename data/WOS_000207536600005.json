In the course of a multiyear development several technological features and design methods have been made available to enhance the operation of capacitive switches. This work analyzes their effects by reviewing the behaviour of the FBK capacitive switches at three different stages of this optimization process. Improvements have been assessed by means of DC electromechanical characterizations, which use a simple quasistatic C-V measurement to extract the switch actuation voltage and the capacitance in the on and or states (C(on) and C(off)) and RF measurements. The addition of floating metal layer into the process flow has allowed a great increase of the switch on state capacitances, getting C(on)/C(off) ratios of 200, up to 50 times greater than the ones obtained for the same structures without this feature.", "paper_title": "Development of High C(on) C(off) Ratio RF MEMS Shunt Switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000207536600005"}
