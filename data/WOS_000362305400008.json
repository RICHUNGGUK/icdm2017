In this process, prevalent critical success factors are transformed into five so called global efficiency factors (GEF's) and applied in a multi-attribute evaluation model. The GEFs represent the elements of the global ERP project design: (1) Business process re-engineering based on ERP system requirements, (2) Legacy systems, (3) System configuration, (4) Alignment with the corporate level and (5) Project Synergy. The evaluation model evaluates each project phase from the perspective of these GEFs. We analyzed five case studies to show the impact of the GEFs on each project outcome. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
