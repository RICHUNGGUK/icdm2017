However, the current PPDM methods damaged the values of original data where knowledge from the mined data cannot be verified from the original data. In this paper, we combine the concept and technique based on the reversible data hiding to propose the reversible privacy preserving data mining scheme in order to solve the irrecoverable problem of PPDM. In the proposed privacy difference expansion (PDE) method, the original data is perturbed and embedded with a fragile watermark to accomplish privacy preserving and data integrity of mined data and to also recover the original data. Experimental tests are performed on classification accuracy, probabilistic information loss, and privacy disclosure risk used to evaluate the efficiency of PDE for privacy preserving and knowledge verification.", "paper_title": "Reversible privacy preserving data mining: a combination of difference expansion and privacy preserving", "paper_id": "WOS:000326461100019"}
