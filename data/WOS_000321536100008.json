Examples of the systems covered include infinite streams, deterministic automata, Mealy machines and labeled transition systems. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to decide whether two expressions are bisimilar or not. The procedure is implemented in the automatic theorem prover CIRC, by reducing coinduction to an entailment relation between an algebraic specification and an appropriate set of equations. We illustrate the generality of the tool with three examples: infinite streams of real numbers, Mealy machines and labeled transition systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
