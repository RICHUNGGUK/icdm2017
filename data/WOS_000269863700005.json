Different wavelet kernels are included in the formulation of the RVM. We also propose a new wavelet-based feature extraction method that extracts lesser number of features as compared to other wavelet-based feature extraction methods. Experimental results confirm the superiority of RVM over SVM in terms of the trade-off between slightly reduced accuracy but substantially enhanced sparseness of the solution, and also the ease of free parameters tuning.", "paper_title": "Content-based image classification with wavelet relevance vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000269863700005"}
