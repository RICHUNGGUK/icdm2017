By taking advantage of FPGA technology, some work offers high performance and flexible solutions for cryptographic algorithms. But FPGAs still have some drawbacks. To overcome inherent shortages of FPGA, a novel asynchronous reconfigurable cryptographic engine (ARCEN) is introduced. In this architecture, reconfigurable cryptographic array is the kernel. It routes signals asynchronously between adjacent cells through Neighbor-to-Neighbor wires with 4-phase handshaking protocol. Computation circuit for reconfigurable cell is developed with modified DSDCVS logic. Experiment results show that the architecture has a better performance than FPGA.", "paper_title": "Design of a reconfigurable cryptographic engine", "paper_id": "WOS:000241449500042"}
