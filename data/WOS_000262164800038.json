In this paper, a new signal construction method named Adaptive Carrier Interferometry OSDM (ACI-OSDM) is proposed for time-frequency selective fading channel. Particularly, the Adaptive Cl codes originated from CI-OFDM are employed in the frequency domain of OSDM signal. Compared with traditional OFDM, the ACI-OSDM improves the performance considerably of broadband transmission, i.e., spectrum efficiency, Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) mitigation and interference cancelation in the high speed mobile environment with multipath emission, e.g. super express train with speed more than 250 km/h.", "paper_title": "Adaptive CI-OSDM in Time-Frequency Selective Fading Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800038"}
