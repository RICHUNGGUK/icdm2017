HMM has been applied to a wide range of applications in information processing, but not so much in TC applications. The Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) is utilized for prior knowledge in the model. A prototype for an HMM-based TC model is designed, and an experimental model based on the prototype is implemented so as to categorize medical documents into MeSH. A subset of OHSUMED is used for the experiments. Our results show that the performance of our model is comparable to those reported in the literature.", "paper_title": "A hidden Markov model-based text classification of medical documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000262371700004"}
