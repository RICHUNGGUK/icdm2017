Connection admission control (CAC) deals with the question of whether or not an ATM switch can accept it new connection. This paper presents the design of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for CAC of Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) audio and video streams in an ATM network. Our approach is different from the plain use of sample input-output data for automating FLC design as frequently reported in the literature. One of the differences is that we do not use any sample data that happen to be available. Instead, we perform intensive simulations of the system, to generate sample data which are then processed to obtain unique entries for the selected combination of the values of the input variables. We compared the performance of our fuzzy-CAC to conventional CACs such as those based on average bandwidth, peak bandwidth and equivalent bandwidth and we found our scheme to produce better results.
