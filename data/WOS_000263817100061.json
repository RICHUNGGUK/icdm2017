The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique plays one of the important roles for signal feature extraction in the proposed system. The abnormal transient signals will show in different decomposition levels and can be used to recognize the various faults by the DWT figure. However, many fault conditions are hard to inspect accurately by the naked eye. In the present study, the feature extraction method based on discrete wavelet transform with energy spectrum is proposed. The different order wavelets are considered to identify fault features accurately. The database is established by feature vectors of energy spectrum which are used as input pattern in the training and identification process. Furthermore, the ANFIS is proposed to identify and classify the fault gear positions and the gear fault conditions in the fault diagnosis system. The proposed ANFIS includes both the fuzzy logic qualitative approximation and the adaptive neural network capability. The experimental results verified that the proposed ANFIS has more possibilities in fault gear identification. The ANFIS achieved an accuracy identification rate which was more satisfactory than traditional vision inspection in the proposed system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
