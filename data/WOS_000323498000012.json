A multispectral iris image database is created by the proposed capture device, and then, we use the multispectral score-level fusion to further investigate the effectiveness of the proposed capture device by the 1-D Log-Gabor wavelet filter approach. Experimental results are also presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "Handheld System Design for Dual-Eye Multispectral Iris Capture With One Camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000323498000012"}
