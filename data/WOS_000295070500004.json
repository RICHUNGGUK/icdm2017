The discontinuity can be bounded by an arbitrary geometric invariant (epsilon) over right arrow as the tolerance. The method first handles the six types of the compatibility problems by continuity-preserving reparameterization, knot-insertion and local control-point tuning. The transformed boundary conditions are then parametrically compatible, so the Coons strategy can be applied to construct the final interpolant. Not only can it be used in the reliable geometric modeling, but the approach also can be applied to many other algorithms that require compatibility guarantee. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
