In order to enhance the recognition performance of the state SVM network, two innovative techniques are presented: state transition correction and transition quality estimation. The classification results are also merged into the video indexing graph, which facilitates the search speed. A reinforcement algorithm with an efficient scheduling scheme significantly reduces both the power consumption and time. The experimental results show the proposed state SVM network was able to achieve a precision rate as high as 83.83% and the query results of the indexing graph reached 80% accuracy. The experiments also demonstrate the performance and feasibility of our system.", "paper_title": "Video Search and Indexing with Reinforcement Agent for Interactive Multimedia Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000327432400007"}
