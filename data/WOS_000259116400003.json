This paper presents an introduction to Synthetic Biology from various viewpoints. First, we survey the concepts and tools from Systems Science along with several issues on social impact. Then, we discuss the recent progress in Molecular Biology that supports Synthetic Biology.", "paper_title": "Synthetic Biology", "paper_id": "WOS:000259116400003"}
