The admission control, designed to reduce the incoming traffic in periods of congestion, scales with the size of the system. For a class of Markovian models with this scaled control, we identify the QED limits for two stationary performance measures. We also derive corrected QED approximations, generalizing earlier results for the Erlang B, C and A models. These results are useful for the dimensioning of large systems equipped with an active control policy. In particular, the corrected approximations can be leveraged to establish the optimality gaps related to square-root staffing and asymptotic dimensioning with admission control.
