Our results show that consensus can be solved even in the presence of O(n(2)) moving omission and/or arbitrary link failures per round, provided that both the number of affected outgoing and incoming links of every process is bounded. Providing a step further toward the weakest conditions under which consensus is solvable, our findings are applicable to a variety of dynamic phenomena such as transient communication failures and end-to-end delay variations. We also prove that our model surpasses alternative link failure modeling approaches in terms of assumption coverage.", "paper_title": "IMPOSSIBILITY RESULTS AND LOWER BOUNDS FOR CONSENSUS UNDER LINK FAILURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000208048500005"}
