This paper aims to derive temporal postural synergies from kinematic synergies extracted from joint angular velocity profiles of rapid grasping movements. The rapid movements constrain the kinematic synergies to combine instantaneously, and thus, the movements can be approximated by a weighted summation of synchronous synergies. After being extracted by using singular value decomposition, the synchronous kinematic synergies were translated into temporal postural synergies, which revealed strategies of enslaving, metacarpal flexion for larger movements, and hierarchical recruitment of joints, adapted by subjects while grasping.", "paper_title": "Temporal Postural Synergies of the Hand in Rapid Grasping Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280480700012"}
