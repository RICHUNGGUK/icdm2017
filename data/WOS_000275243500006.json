However, scanning a multi-domain protein against a database of domain sequence profiles can often produce conflicting and overlapping matches. We have developed a novel method that employs heaviest weighted clique-finding (HCF), which we show significantly outperforms standard published approaches based on successively assigning the best non-overlapping match (Best Match Cascade, BMC). Results: We created benchmark data set of structural domain assignments in the CATH database and a corresponding set of Hidden Markov Model-based domain predictions. Using these, we demonstrate that by considering all possible combinations of matches using the HCF approach, we achieve much higher prediction accuracy than the standard BMC method. We also show that it is essential to allow overlapping domain matches to a query in order to identify correct domain assignments. Furthermore, we introduce a straightforward and effective protocol for resolving any overlapping assignments, and producing a single set of non-overlapping predicted domains.", "paper_title": "A fast and automated solution for accurately resolving protein domain architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000275243500006"}
