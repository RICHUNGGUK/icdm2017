This model has been widely discussed and applied these years. It is shown that the model of fuzzy rough sets is sensitive to noisy samples, especially sensitive to mislabeled samples. As data are usually contaminated with noise in practice, a robust model is desirable. We introduce a new model of fuzzy rough set model, called soft fuzzy rough sets, and design a robust classification algorithm based on the model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Robust fuzzy rough classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000295444200002"}
