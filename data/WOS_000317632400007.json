The theoretical results indicate that for the downlink, the log-amplitude variance of the Kolmogorov model is always smaller than that of the three-layer model, while for the uplink, there is a point of intersection in the log-amplitude variance curves of the two models. The different phenomena for the downlink and uplink are analyzed in detail. Further, we find a method to ascertain precise values of the boundary layer altitudes for the three-layer model under various atmospheric conditions through the analysis for the point of intersection. And at the point of intersection, the Kolmogorov model can be used to replace the three-layer model to simplify the analysis of the system performance. Moreover, the log-amplitude variance increases with the increase of the zenith angle.", "paper_title": "Optical propagation through non-Kolmogorov turbulence", "paper_id": "WOS:000317632400007"}
