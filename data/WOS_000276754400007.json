The sizes of the base width of the microprism and the sub-pixel of the panel were corresponding. After the selection of the appropriate vertex angles, two images could be delivered to left and right viewing zones of the panel. This research also used flexible material polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with high transmission as the optical film. Besides, it utilized LightTools software to process the ray tracing, which obtained the left and the right images, respectively, delivered to the visual angles of -47.5 to +16.5 degrees and -11.5 to +48.5 degrees. Slight crosstalk only located within -31.5 to -25.5 degrees and +28.5 to +30.5 degrees, respectively. It shows that the microprism sheet can actually make general panels have dual-view display function. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
