This may lead to specifying systems requirements that do not account for cognitive strengths and limitations of the prospective users. This paper proposes integration of cognitive work demands in the systems engineering process through development of a Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) framework and a Tutorial using Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The CWA framework provides a structured approach for defining, managing, organizing, and modeling cognitive work requirements in systems engineering process.", "paper_title": "Application of Systems Modeling Language (SySML) for Cognitive Work Analysis in Systems Engineering Design Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000298048200004"}
