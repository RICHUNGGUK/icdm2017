This paper addresses a problem related to the origin of wiggles occurring in fully-implicit C-grid models. The situation considered is the computation of three-dimensional thermally-driven steady flows in a midlatitude spherical sector. We determine the reason why in a coarse resolution C-grid implicit model, the values of the lateral friction coefficients are restricted to far higher values than for the same B-grid model. The analysis also reveals why the B-grid discretization is superior for the computation of this type of flows. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
