A Wi-Fi fingerprint localization system makes use of a radio map that contains Wi-Fi signals received at various locations, and uses the map for location estimation. Thus, the accuracy of a Wi-Fi fingerprint localization system greatly depends on the quality of its radio map. This paper explores various properties of a metropolitan radio map that may affect the accuracy of Wi-Fi fingerprint localization systems. In this study, metropolitan-scale radio maps are obtained using war walking and war driving. These maps contain hundreds of thousands of access points and signal samples. A detailed comparison analysis of selected radio map properties reveals how different map properties affect the difference between the positional accuracies of the driving and walking radio maps in Wi-Fi fingerprint-based localization.", "paper_title": "Accuracy Performance Analysis between War Driving and War Walking in Metropolitan Wi-Fi Localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000281990200005"}
