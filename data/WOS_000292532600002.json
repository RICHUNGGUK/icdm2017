In this paper, a framework is proposed to discover interoperation paths among identity providers (IdP) located in different circles of trust (CoT). According to the proposed framework, interoperation path and path discovery algorithm are proposed to establish a trust relationship between different CoTs. Security of the interoperation path is improved by the deployment of authentication assurance level (AAL) conversion and role mapping. Moreover, security of the path discovery process is guaranteed by path authentication which can resist security violation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
