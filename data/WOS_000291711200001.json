A reversible steganographic method can reconstruct an original image without loss from the stego-image after extracting the embedded data. Unlike traditional reversible methods in which data is hidden in uncompressed images, we propose a reversible scheme for BTC (block truncation coding)-compressed images. The secret data embedded in the compressed image are more difficult to detect than in the uncompressed image. To achieve reversibility, the properties of side matching and BTC-compressed code are applied. The experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible for BTC-compressed images and can embed one more bit in each BTC-encoded block.", "paper_title": "Reversible Steganography for BTC-compressed Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711200001"}
