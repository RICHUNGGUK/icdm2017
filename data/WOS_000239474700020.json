Assume that an optimum solution of an instance is given and the goal is to determine if one can maintain a good solution when the instance is subject to minor modifications. We study the case where nodes are inserted in, or deleted from, the graph. When inserting a node, we show that the reoptimization problem for MinTSP is approximable within ratio 4/3 if the distance matrix is metric. We show that, dealing with metric MaxTSP, a simple heuristic is asymptotically optimum when a constant number of nodes are inserted. In the general case, we propose a 4/5-approximation algorithm for the reoptimization version of MaxTSP.", "paper_title": "Reoptimization of minimum and maximum traveling salesman's tours", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474700020"}
