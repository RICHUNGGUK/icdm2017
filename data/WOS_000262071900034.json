This method is an extension of the standard Krylov subspace method for multiple-inputs multiple-outputs (MIMO) Systems. By employing the congruence transformation with global Krylov subspaces, both one-sided Arnoldi and two-sided Lanczos oblique projection methods are explored for both single expansion point and multiple expansion points. In order to further reduce the computational complexity for multiple expansion points, adaptive-order multiple points moment matching algorithms, or the so-called rational Krylov space method, are also studied. Two algorithms, including the adaptive-order rational global Arnoldi (AORGA) algorithm and the adaptive-order global Lanczos (AOGL) algorithm, are developed in detail. Simulations of practical dynamical systems will be conducted to illustrate the feasibility and the efficiency of proposed methods. (C) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
