Factors for adapting degree consist of two parts, adapting degree of ambient chromaticity and color saturation. These can be applied to color appearance models (CAM), actually improve the performance of color matching of CAM, hence would produce the method of image reproduction to general display systems.", "paper_title": "Factors of incomplete adaptation for color reproduction considering subjective white point shift for varying illuminant", "paper_id": "WOS:000256862800018"}
