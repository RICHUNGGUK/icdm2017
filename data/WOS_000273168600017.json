The additional possibility of gravity-mediated decays, through a variable number of eV(-1)-sized extra dimensions into which only gravity extends, is also available. The implementation covers the lowest lying Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of Standard Model particles, except for the excitations of the Higgs fields, with the mass spectrum calculated at one loop. 2 -> 2 tree-level production cross sections and unpolarized KK number conserving 2-body decays are included. Mixing between iso-doublet and -singlet KK excitations is neglected thus far, and is expected to be negligible for all but the top sector.", "paper_title": "One universal extra dimension in PYTHIA", "paper_id": "WOS:000273168600017"}
