As complexity rises, it is necessary to study the effects of system energy at the circuit level and to develop accurate fault models to ensure system dependability. Our approach to designing reliable hardware involves techniques for hierarchical power efficiency system (HPES) design and a judicious mixture of verification method is verified by this formal refinement. This design methodology is validated by the low power adder with functional verification at the chip level after satisfying the design specification. It also describes a new HPES integration method combining low power circuit for special purpose computers. The use of new circuits and their corresponding HPES design techniques leads to minimal system failure in terms of reliability, speed, low power and design complexity over a wide range of integrated circuit (IC) designs.", "paper_title": "Design and verification for hierarchical power efficiency system (HPES) design techniques using low power CMOS digital logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200097"}
