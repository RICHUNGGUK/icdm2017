In order to protect the Mobile Node (MN) from being attacked by the forged Binding Updates from anywhere else in the Internet, the MIPv6 protocol presents a security mechanism between the mobile node and the corresponding node, Return Routability (RR), which can provide security authorization between them. However, the procedure is built on network layer, and it needs constant processing time to finish the handover. The IEEE 802.11r is based on MAC protocol of IEEE 802.11 standard, and it decreases the authorization time in the IEEE 802.11i by providing the fast handover. In this paper, we provide a new authorization mechanism, SeMIPv6, in MIPv6 integrating IEEE 802.11r and MIH, which not only enhances the handover security between the nodes, but also decreases the handover delay during the roaming.", "paper_title": "SeMIPv6: Secure and Efficient Roaming Mechanism Based on IEEE 802.11r and MIH", "paper_id": "WOS:000285732400003"}
