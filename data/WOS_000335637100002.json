In particular, they often have parallel singularities at some poses, and the robots may become uncontrollable, and could even be damaged, in such configurations. The computation of the connected components. in the set of nonsingular reachable configurations, called generalized aspects, is therefore a key issue in their design. This paper introduces a new method, based on numerical constraint programming, to compute a certified enclosure of the generalized aspects. Though this method does not allow counting their number rigorously, it constructs inner approximations of the nonsingular workspace that allow commanding parallel robots safely. It also provides a lower-bound on the exact number of generalized aspects. It is moreover the first general method able to handle any parallel robot in theory, though its computational complexity currently restricts its usage to robots with three degrees of freedom. Finally, the constraint programming paradigm it relies on makes it possible to consider various additional constraints (e.g., collision avoidance), making it suitable for practical considerations.
