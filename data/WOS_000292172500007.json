In this work, we demonstrate theoretically that it is possible to achieve quantum memory for light on demand via a quantum dot system coupled to a nanomechanical resonator. This quantum memory for light is based on mechanically induced exciton polaritons, which makes the dark-state polariton reaccelerated and converted back into a photon pulse. Our presented device could open the door to all-optical routers for light memory devices and quantum information processing.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM MEMORY FOR LIGHT WITH A QUANTUM DOT SYSTEM COUPLED TO A NANOMECHANICAL RESONATOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000292172500007"}
