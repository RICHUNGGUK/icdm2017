SERVE comprises a four-tuple, where each element is an integer representing the Euler number of the partial binary image formed by certain pixel overlap relations among the four most significant bit planes of the gray- tone image. Computation of SERVE is simple, fast, and does not involve any floating point operation. SERVE can be used to augment other features to improve the performance of image retrieval significantly. Experimental results on the COIL database are reported to demonstrate its performance.", "paper_title": "Stacked Euler Vector (SERVE): A gray-tone image feature based on bit-plane augmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242826900014"}
