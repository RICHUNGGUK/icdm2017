In this paper, the theory of the natural immune system is first briefly introduced. Next, we compare some well-known AIS and their applications. Several representative artificial immune networks models are also discussed. Moreover, we demonstrate the applications of artificial immune networks in various engineering fields.", "paper_title": "Artificial Immune Networks: Models and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000264143700007"}
