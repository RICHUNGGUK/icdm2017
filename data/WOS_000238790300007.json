If an ISO-certified organization wishes to improve its processes continuously, implementing CMMI would be a good choice, as it provides more detailed practices for process improvement than the ISO standards. However, there are two issues that need to be resolved when an ISO-certified organization implements CMMI. First, it is not easy to identify any reusable parts of the ISO standards, and it would be advantageous to be able to reuse selected portions of the ISO standards during CMMI adoption in order to use existing resources to their best advantage. Second, it is difficult for an ISO-certified organization to implement CMMI in a straightforward, easy manner because of the differences in the language, structure, and details of the two sets of documents. In this paper, we present our unified model for ISO 9001:2000 and CMMI that resolves these two issues. Our model would be an extremely useful tool for ISO-certified organizations that plan to implement CMMI. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
