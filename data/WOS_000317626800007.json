In this paper a model for user profile tuning in document retrieval systems is considered. Methods for tuning the user profile based on analysis of user preferences dynamics are experimentally evaluated to check whether with growing history of user activity the created user profile can converge to his preferences. As the statistical analysis of series of simulations has shown, proposed methods of user profile actualization are effective in the sense that the distance between user preferences and his profile becomes smaller and smaller along with time.", "paper_title": "Tuning user profiles based on analyzing dynamic preference in document retrieval systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317626800007"}
