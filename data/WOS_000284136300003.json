Our bound is an explicit function of s, d, k and tau, and does not contain any undetermined constants. We also prove a similar bound on the radius of a ball guaranteed to intersect every connected component of S (including the unbounded components). While asymptotic bounds of the form 2(tau d0(k)) on these quantities were known before, some applications require bounds which are explicit and which hold for all values of s, d, k and tau. The bounds proved in this paper are of this nature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
