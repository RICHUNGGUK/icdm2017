This model is based on cellular learning automata (CLA) and differential evolution algorithm. The main idea is to learn the most promising regions of the search space using cellular learning automata. Learning automata in the CLA iteratively partition the search dimensions of a problem and learn the most admissible partitions. In order to facilitate incorporation among the CLA cells and improve their impact on each other, differential evolution algorithm is incorporated, by which communication and information exchange among neighboring cells are speeded up. The proposed model is compared with some evolutionary algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness. Experiments are conducted on a group of benchmark functions which are commonly used in the literature. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve near optimal solutions in all cases which are highly competitive with the ones from the compared algorithms.", "paper_title": "CLA-DE: a hybrid model based on cellular learning automata for numerical optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000303479800015"}
