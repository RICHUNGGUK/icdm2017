In this paper, a classification method of supervised LLE (SLLE) based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is proposed. First, samples are classified according to their label values, and low dimensional features of intra-class data are expressed through LLE manifold learning. Then, the base vectors in Fisher subspace of the low dimensional features are generated through LDA learning. This method increases inter-class variation, and decreases the intra-class variation when samples are projected to the Fisher subspace. Hence, the samples of different labels can be recognized, and the recognition rate and robustness of the LLE learning are improved. Experiments on handwritten digit recognition show that the proposed method is featuring high recognition rate.", "paper_title": "A Supervised Manifold Learning Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000272897000010"}
