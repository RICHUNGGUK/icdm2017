[Li J, Hoschek J, Hartmann E. G(n-1)-functional splines for interpolation and approximation of curves, surfaces and solids. Computer Aided Geometric Design 1990;7:209-20] presented a functional method for constructing G(n-1) curves and surfaces which are called functional splines. In this paper, functional splines with different degrees of smoothness are presented and applied to some typical problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
