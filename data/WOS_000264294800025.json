Firstly, the passing people are roughly counted by the area of people image captured by a zenithal video camera. To refine the initial count, the pedestrians will be recognized by tracking their image patterns with intersection of their bounding-boxes or color vector matching. Besides, both inherent problems of image pattern overlapping and merge/split phenomenon will be also overcome. Experimental results show that 100% accuracy of bi-directional counting can be achieved if the pedestrians walk in a normal speed and the people number of an image pattern is less titan three. When compared to other reported methods of using a zenithal camera setting scheme, the proposed method can obtain higher count accuracy over 95%.", "paper_title": "A COST-EFFECTIVE PEOPLE-COUNTER FOR PASSING THROUGH A GATE BASED ON IMAGE PROCESSING", "paper_id": "WOS:000264294800025"}
