Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) has been of particular interest in this field because of the possibility to implement simultaneously soft-modeling constraints and kinetic models on a multibatch resolution. This approach allows circumventing a rank deficiency inherent to time resolved difference data, even in presence of interferent species. The methodology is illustrated using examples from femtosecond photochemistry and biochemistry.
