The analysis is limited to flow at Mach 9 around a double-wedge selected to generate an interaction of type IVr that does not fit into Edney's classification. It is generally known that the interaction of type IV are associated with very high local loads in pressure and heat transfer. The numerical resolution of the Navier Stokes equations allows the prediction of the structure of flow field. The numerical method used is based on a finite volume formulation defined on a structured multi block mesh. Particular emphasis is given to the contribution of real gas effects on the topological characteristics and dynamic structure of the flow field. A comparative study of the contours of Mach numbers and pressure is shown. The results obtained showed that the flow field is highly sensitive to real gas effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
