In this paper, we propose a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based method for finding community structure. We first evaluate several similarity measures, such as diffusion kernel similarity, shortest path based similarity on several widely well-studied networks. Then, we apply NMF with diffusion kernel similarity to a large biological network, which demonstrates that our method can find biologically meaningful functional modules. Comparison with other algorithms also indicates the good performance of our method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
