Simulation of architecture models, early in the design process, is also necessary to detect and fix errors and performance issues. In this context, transaction level modeling approaches, supported by languages like SystemC, represent promising solutions to allow performances of networked architectures to be assessed with a good compromise between accuracy and simulation speed. This article presents the application of a simulation-based approach for performance evaluation of a networked embedded system inspired by the automotive domain. The presented modeling approach is defined to efficiently capture the characteristics of architectures for real-time image processing applications. The originality of this paper concerns the considered case study which corresponds to the modeling of a video transmission system made of three electronic controller units and based on a specific power line communication protocol. Compared with traditional communication protocols used in the automotive domain, power line communication is considered here to improve integration of advanced real-time image processing applications. The created model incorporates the description of the different communication layers involved in the studied distributed architecture. Simulation of the model allows evaluating time properties of the architecture according to the various system parameters. Furthermore, the memory cost inferred is also evaluated. Architecture parameters can then be correctly tuned to fully meet the expected requirements.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of an automotive distributed architecture based on a high speed power line communication protocol using a transaction level modeling approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000331639800020"}
