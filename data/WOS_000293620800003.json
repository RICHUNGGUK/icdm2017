A recent method called restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) allows to sample sequence information at reduced complexity across a target genome using the Illumina platform. Single-end RAD-seq has proven to provide a large number of informative genetic markers in reference as well as non-reference organisms. Results: Here, we present a method for de novo assembly of paired-end RAD-seq data in order to produce extended contigs flanking a restriction site. We were able to reconstruct one-tenth of the guppy genome represented by 200-500 bp contigs associated to EcoRI recognition sites. In addition, these contigs were used as reference allowing the detection of thousands of new polymorphic markers that are informative for mapping and population genetic studies in the guppy.", "paper_title": "Paired-end RAD-seq for de novo assembly and marker design without available reference", "paper_id": "WOS:000293620800003"}
