In this paper we address the effect of randomization in greedy-like algorithms. More specifically, we consider approximation ratios within the context of randomized priority algorithms. As case studies, we prove inapproximation results for two well-studied optimization problems, namely facility location and makespan scheduling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
