Experiments are carried out on a fingerprint database acquired in a real-life scenario and show that the evaluated system is highly vulnerable to the proposed attack scheme, granting access in over 75% of the attempts (for a high-security operating point). Thus, the study disproves the popular belief of minutiae templates non-reversibility and raises a key vulnerability issue in the use of non-encrypted standard templates.
