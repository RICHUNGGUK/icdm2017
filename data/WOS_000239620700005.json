In this paper we will introduce the concept of agents' private and semi-private knowledge and we will explain the difference between the alliance - a semi-permanent organizational structure and a coalition - a goal-oriented, non-permanent organizational structure. We will provide the reader with an analysis on how does the agents' social knowledge, stored in the tri-base acquaintance model, contributes to permanent confidentiality of agents' private knowledge, preferences, decision making models, resources, etc. The study has been experimentally verified in the domain of planning for humanitarian relief operations within a high number of hardly collaborating and vaguely linked nongovernmental organizations is a challenging problem.
