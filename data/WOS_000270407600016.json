By introducing intelligent control, agile all-optical networks can serve dynamic and flexible bandwidth on demand. Metro networks with a ring topology are considered, and the protection of critical demands in agile all-optical networks is investigated. A protection scheme for single-duct ring networks is proposed followed by a rearrangeable bandwidth allocation scheme to decrease blocking in critical connection setup. Inefficient network resource utilization and signal degradation are two issues in survivable single-duct ring networks. Therefore, a survivable dual-duct ring infrastructure is presented as a solution for the survivability of this type of network in order to improve the efficiency of network resource utilization and signal quality.", "paper_title": "Protection of Dynamic and Flexible Bandwidth on Demand in Metro Agile All-Optical Ring Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270407600016"}
