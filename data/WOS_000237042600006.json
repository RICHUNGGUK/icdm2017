This proposal comes from the results of an experiment conducted in the France Telecom R&D's Natural Language laboratory using TiLT (Linguistic Treatment of Texts), an automatic syntactic analyser and generator. The aim of this approach is to develop a model that will be used to animate an avatar through a previous computational linguistics treatment, respecting French Sign Language as a proper human language.", "paper_title": "French Sign Language processing: Verb agreement", "paper_id": "WOS:000237042600006"}
