This regularization also results in loss of resolution in the reconstructed images. A frame work, that is attributed by model-resolution, to improve the reconstructed image characteristics using the basis pursuit deconvolution method is proposed here. The proposed method performs this deconvolution as an additional step in the image reconstruction scheme. It is shown, both in numerical and experimental gelatin phantom cases, that the proposed method yields better recovery of the target shapes compared to traditional method, without the loss of quantitativeness of the results.", "paper_title": "Model-Resolution-Based Basis Pursuit Deconvolution Improves Diffuse Optical Tomographic Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000334667000009"}
