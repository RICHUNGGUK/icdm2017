By applying a novel Lemma and Lyapunov functional method, the less conservative exponential stability criteria are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Meanwhile, the exponential convergence rate can be estimated. Two numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness and improvement of the proposed method. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
