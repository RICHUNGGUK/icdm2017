The core idea of the proposed method was to remove the main gradient artifacts by the maximum cross-correlation method and to remove the residual artifacts by the rolling-ball algorithm and lowpass filtering. The results showed that the proposed algorithm had a better performance and was robust in the sense that its performance was maintained when the sampling rate of EEG data was decreased from 10 KHz to 200 Hz.
