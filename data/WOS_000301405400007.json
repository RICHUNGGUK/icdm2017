To maximize the power produced by the DMFC stack in stable operation, high loading with batteries is employed for balancing power flow. Keeping the power produced by the DMFC stack at high efficiency with low loading prevents the problem of methanol crossover. In consideration of the characteristics of DMFC stack during actual operation, we use a bidirectional DC/DC converter connecting the battery to the DC bus to manage the power distribution between the fuel cell and the battery. PIDNN control allows for adequate pulse-width modulation (PWM) control of the bidirectional DC/DC converter with fast response, increases the transient performance of the DMFC fuel cell system and satisfies the requirement of energy management. The active control is designed to achieve the abovementioned multiple objectives. To verify the reliability and stability of the proposed control, an experiment was performed; the results show that the proposed control can efficiently achieve the multiple objectives.", "paper_title": "THE ACTIVE CONTROL DESIGN FOR DMFC/BATTERY HYBRID SYSTEM USING PIDNN", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405400007"}
