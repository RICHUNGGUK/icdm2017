We prove that MinLOB is polynomial-time solvable for acyclic digraphs. In general, MinLOB is NP-hard and we consider three parameterizations of MinLOB. We prove that two of them are NP-complete for every value of the parameter, but the third one is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). The FPT parameterization is as follows: given a digraph D of order n and a positive integral parameter k, check whether D contains an out-branching with at most n - k leaves (and find such an out-branching if it exists). We find a problem kernel of order O(k(2)) and construct an algorithm of running time O(2(O(k log k)) + n(6)), which is an 'additive' FPT algorithm. We also consider transformations from two related problems, the minimum path covering and the maximum internal out-tree problems into MinLOB, which imply that some parameterizations of the two problems are FPT as well.
