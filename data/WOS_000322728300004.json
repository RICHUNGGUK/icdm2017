Recently, stochastic geometry models have been shown to provide tractable yet accurate performance bounds for multi-tier and cognitive cellular wireless networks. Given the need for interference characterization in multi-tier cellular networks, stochastic geometry models provide high potential to simplify their modeling and provide insights into their design. Hence, a new research area dealing with the modeling and analysis of multi-tier and cognitive cellular wireless networks is increasingly attracting the attention of the research community. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on the literature related to stochastic geometry models for single-tier as well as multi-tier and cognitive cellular wireless networks. A taxonomy based on the target network model, the point process used, and the performance evaluation technique is also presented. To conclude, we discuss the open research challenges and future research directions.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Geometry for Modeling, Analysis, and Design of Multi-Tier and Cognitive Cellular Wireless Networks: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000322728300004"}
