The unbounded repulsion ensures the independence among autonomous agents in social potential fields, which consist of obstacles to avoid and targets to move towards. Simulation results show that the aggregating swarm can construct various formations by changing its anisotropy coefficient, and the collective behavior of mass individuals emerges from combination of the inter-individual interactions and the interaction of the individual with outer circumstances.", "paper_title": "Collective behavior of an anisotropic swarm model based on unbounded repulsion in social potential fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400018"}
