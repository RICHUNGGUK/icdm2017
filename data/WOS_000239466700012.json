The program widely used to calculate T is Nestedness Temperature Calculator (NTC). NTC analyses matrices individually, turning the analysis of large sets time-consuming. We introduce ANINHADO, a program developed to perform rapid and automatic calculation of T over 10,000 matrices. ANINHADO can be useful to minimize the time spent in analysis and to compare real data against a variety of null models that typically generate a large number of replicates. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
