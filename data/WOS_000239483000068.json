The new method fulfils intelligent extraction of water, road and other plane-like objects from remote sensing images in a hierarchical manner. It firstly extracts water and road information by a SVM and pixel-based knowledge post-processing method, then removes them from original image, and then segments other plane-like objects using the SVM model and computes their features such as texture, elevation, slope, shape etc., finally extracts them by the polygon-based uncertain reasoning method. Experimental results indicate that the new method outperforms the single SVM and moreover avoids the complexity of single knowledge reasoning technique.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical extraction of remote sensing data based on support vector machines and knowledge processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000068"}
