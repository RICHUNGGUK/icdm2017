Antimicrobial activity was expressed by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 (classification I) and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 (classification II). The ROSE 2 (Rough Sets Data Explorer) and LEM 2 (Minimal Set Covering Algorithm) software were used to perform the analysis. Attributes with continuous values were discretized. 45 decision rules were generated in the classification I, and 38 rules in the classification II. Those described the most important dependencies between structure, surface-active properties of analyzed chlorides and their antimicrobial activity. Strong decision rules supported by large number of objects provide guidelines which may facilitate synthesis of new compounds with preferable antimicrobial properties.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Relationships Between Structure, Surface Properties, and Antimicrobial Activity of Quaternary Ammonium Chlorides", "paper_id": "WOS:000270439900007"}
