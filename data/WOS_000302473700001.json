Basic properties of these implications are discussed. It is shown that the (g, min)-implications are really a new class different from the known (S, N)-, R-, QL- and Yager's f- and g-implications. Generalizations of three classical logic tautologies with implications, viz. law of importation, contraction law and distributivity over triangular norms (t-norms) and triangular conorms (t-conorms) are investigated. A series of necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed, under which the corresponding functional equations are satisfied.", "paper_title": "ON A NEW CLASS OF IMPLICATIONS: (g, min)-IMPLICATIONS AND SEVERAL CLASSICAL TAUTOLOGIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000302473700001"}
