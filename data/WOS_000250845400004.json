The final graph is usually 2-regular, but is not uniformly distributed. Some properties of this final graph are already known, but the asymptotic probability of being a Hamilton cycle was not known. We answer this question along with some related questions about cycles arising in the process. 9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "Hamiltonicity of random graphs produced by 2-processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000250845400004"}
