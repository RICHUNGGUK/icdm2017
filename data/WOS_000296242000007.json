For the sustainable growth of the mobile industry, energy efficiency (EE) of wireless systems has to be significantly improved. Plenty of efforts have been invested in achieving green wireless communications. This article provides an overview of network energy saving studies currently conducted in the 3GPP LTE standard body. The aim is to gain a better understanding of energy consumption and identify key EE research problems in wireless access networks. Classifying network energy saving technologies into the time, frequency, and spatial domains, the main solutions in each domain are described briefly. As presently the attention is mainly focused on solutions involving a single radio base station, we believe network solutions involving multiple networks/systems will be the most promising technologies toward green wireless access networks.", "paper_title": "NETWORK ENERGY SAVING TECHNOLOGIES FOR GREEN WIRELESS ACCESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296242000007"}
