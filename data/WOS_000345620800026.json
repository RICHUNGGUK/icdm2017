Hence, modeling a turn-to-turn short-circuit fault in more than one phase and a phase-to-ground fault is the first novelty of this paper for calculating phase currents under faulty conditions. This strategy uses the extracted features from the corresponding three-phase current pattern in 3-D space. Identification of faulty phases and of the severity of the fault is the outcome of this technique. This technique is also capable of detecting a phase-to-ground fault. This method just requires current sensors that are available in most drive systems to provide good controllability, and details of the machine design are not necessary. Experimental results are included to show the ability of the proposed strategy for detecting and locating phase/phases under different faults and load conditions.", "paper_title": "Online Detection of Induction Motor's Stator Winding Short-Circuit Faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000345620800026"}
