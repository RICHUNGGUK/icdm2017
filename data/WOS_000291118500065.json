In the real-world situations, due to the relevant features that could exhibit the real machine condition are often unknown as priori, condition monitoring systems based on unimportant features, e.g. noise, might suffer high false-alarm rates, especially when the characteristics of failures are costly or difficult to learn. Therefore, it is important to select the most representative features for unsupervised learning in fault diagnostics. In this paper, a hybrid feature selection scheme (HES) for unsupervised learning is proposed to improve the robustness and the accuracy of fault diagnostics. It provides a general framework of the feature selection based on significance evaluation and similarity measurement with respect to the multiple clustering solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed HFS method is demonstrated by a bearing fault diagnostics application and comparison with other features selection methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
