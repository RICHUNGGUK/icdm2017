The intelligent system is based on the application of evolutionary and neural computation in conjunction with identification systems, which makes it possible to optimize the implementation conditions in the manufacturing process of high precision parts, including finishing precision, while saving time, financial costs and/or energy. Empirical verification of the proposed hybrid intelligent system is performed in a real industrial domain, where a case study is defined and analyzed. The experiments are carried out based on real dental milling processes using a high precision machining centre with five axes, requiring high finishing precision of measures in micrometers with a large number of process factors to analyze. The results of the experiments which validate the performance of the proposed approach are presented in this study.", "paper_title": "A novel hybrid intelligent system for multi-objective machine parameter optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000347834800002"}
