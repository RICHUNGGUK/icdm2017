In addition to being used as temporal redundancy, with technology advancements, slack time in a system can also be used by energy management schemes to save energy. In this paper, we consider the combination of modular and temporal redundancy to achieve energy efficient reliable real-time service provided by multiple servers. We first propose an efficient adaptive parallel recovery scheme that appropriately processes service requests in parallel to increase the number of faults that can be tolerated and thus system reliability. Then we explore schemes to determine the optimal redundant configurations of the parallel servers to minimize system energy consumption for a given reliability goal or to maximize system reliability for a given energy budget. Our analysis results show that small requests, optimistic approaches, and parallel recovery favor lower levels of modular redundancy, while large requests, pessimistic approaches and restricted serial recovery favor higher levels of modular redundancy.", "paper_title": "Energy efficient redundant configurations for real-time parallel reliable servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000263525400002"}
