The agents can perform an integrative negotiation with multi-issue in a one-to-many way. The negotiation protocol follows the offer-counteroffer principal, and an adapted mechanism of offer generation strategy. With the utility theory, agent could evaluate the offers and determine the following actions. In order to yield a top-quality deal and shorten the negotiation period, agents propose multiple offers, which consist of a particular combination of issue values and have the identical utility with the given utility. The experiment shows that the model ensures the participants could reach a mutually beneficial agreement in a short time.", "paper_title": "An agent-based multi-issue negotiation model in e-commerce", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300058"}
