It is based on the lattice Boltzmann equation with external forcing term proposed by Guo et al. [Z. Guo, C. Zheng, B. Shi, Discrete lattice effects on the forcing term in the lattice Boltzmann method, Phys. Rev. E 65 (2002) 046308], which can well consider the effect of external force to the momentum and momentum flux as well as the discrete lattice effect. In this model, the velocity is contributed by two parts. One is from the density distribution function and can be termed as intermediate velocity, and the other is from the external force and can be considered as velocity correction. In the conventional IB-LBM, the force density (external force) is explicitly computed in advance. As a result, we cannot manipulate the velocity correction to enforce the non-slip boundary condition at the boundary point. In the present work, the velocity corrections (force density) at all boundary points are considered as unknowns which are computed in such a way that the non-slip boundary condition at the boundary points is enforced. The solution procedure of present IB-LBM is exactly the same as the conventional IB-LBM except that the non-slip boundary condition can be satisfied in the present model while it is only approximately satisfied in the conventional model. Numerical experiments for the flows around a circular cylinder and an airfoil show that there is no any penetration of streamlines to the solid body in the present results. This is not the case for the results obtained by the conventional IB-LBM. Another advantage of the present method is its simple calculation of force on the boundary. The force can be directly calculated from the relationship between the velocity correction and the force density. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
