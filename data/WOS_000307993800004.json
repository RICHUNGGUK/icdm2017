The cell is composed of an industrial robotic manipulator, a camera, range sensing and component segmentation visual algorithms. The cell prototype allows for robotic sensory-driven disassembly under uncertainty. An online genetic algorithm model for selective disassembly is also proposed for optimal and near/optimal disassembly sequencing.", "paper_title": "A Robotic-Driven Disassembly Sequence Generator for End-Of-Life Electronic Products", "paper_id": "WOS:000307993800004"}
