The difficulty lies in not only that there are enormous local minima on the potential energy surface but also that we must determine both the coordinate position and the atom type for each atom and thus have to deal with both continuous and combinatorial optimization. This paper presents a heuristic algorithm (denoted by 3OP) which makes extensive use of three perturbation operators. With these operators, the proposed 3OP algorithm can efficiently move from a poor local minimum to another better local minimum and detect the global minimum through a sequence of local minima with decreasing energy. The proposed 3OP algorithm has been evaluated on a set of 96 x 6 instances with up to 100 atoms. We have found most putative global minima listed in the Cambridge Cluster Database as well as discovering 12 new global minima missed in previous research.", "paper_title": "Global Optimization of Binary Lennard-Jones Clusters Using Three Perturbation Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000288738000006"}
