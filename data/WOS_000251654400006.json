In contrast to piecewise constant approximation (PCA) techniques that approximate each time series with constant value segments, the proposed method-piecewise vector quantized approximation-uses the closest (based on a distance measure) codeword from a codebook of key-sequences to represent each segment. The new representation is symbolic and it allows for the application of text-based retrieval techniques into time series similarity analysis. Experiments on real and simulated datasets show that the proposed technique generally outperforms PCA techniques in clustering and similarity searches. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
