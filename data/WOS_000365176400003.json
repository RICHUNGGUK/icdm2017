This logic is studied and then used to embed three logics of strategic interaction, namely atemporal STIT, the coalition logic of propositional control (CL-PC) and the starless fragment of the dynamic logic of propositional assignments (DL-PA). The embeddings highlight a common ceteris paribus structure underpinning the key operators of all these apparently very different logics and show, we argue, remarkable similarities behind some of the most influential formalisms for reasoning about strategic interaction.", "paper_title": "The Ceteris Paribus Structure of Logics of Game Forms", "paper_id": "WOS:000365176400003"}
