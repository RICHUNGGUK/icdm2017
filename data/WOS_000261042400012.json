Our study presents a hybrid e-Procurement decision support model that is composed of two modeling processes; first is the screening of candidate suppliers by multi-criteria decision making, and second is optimization modeling based on rule-based reasoning for supplier selection and allocation. This enables purchasers to specify purchase requirements effectively and find optimal suppliers that satisfy the requirements. We show with experiments that the purchase requirements for filtering suppliers reduce the risk that gives purchasers infeasible solutions, and also reduce the computational time for solving the optimization model. This study contributes significantly to the selection of highly qualified suppliers in B2B e-marketplaces.", "paper_title": "A HYBRID DECISION SUPPORT MODEL FOR SELECTING HIGHLY QUALIFIED SUPPLIERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261042400012"}
