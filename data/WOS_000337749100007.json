The parasitic inductances and resistances are extracted under pinch-off condition. The initial intrinsic elements are determined by conventional analytical method. Advanced design system (agilent commercial circuit simulator) is used to optimize the whole model parameters with small deviation of initial values. An excellent agreement between measured and simulated S-parameters is obtained for 2 x 20 mu m(2) gate width HEMT up to 40 GHz.
