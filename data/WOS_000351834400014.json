The proposed scheme achieves prescribed bounds on the transient and steady-state performance of the output tracking errors despite the uncertainty in system nonlinearities. Contrary to the current state of the art, however, only a single neural network is utilized to approximate a scalar function that partly incorporates the system nonlinearities. Furthermore, the loss of model controllability problem, typically introduced owing to approximation model singularities, is avoided without attaching additional complexity to the control or adaptive law. Simulations are performed to verify and clarify the theoretical findings.", "paper_title": "A Simplified Adaptive Neural Network Prescribed Performance Controller for Uncertain MIMO Feedback Linearizable Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000351834400014"}
