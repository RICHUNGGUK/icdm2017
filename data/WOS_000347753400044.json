In this paper, we analyze the learning dynamics near singularities in multilayer perceptrons by using traditional methods. We obtain the explicit expressions of the averaged learning equations which play a significant role in theoretical and numerical analysis. After obtaining the best approximation on overlap singularity, the stability of overlap singularity is analyzed. Then we take the numerical analysis on singular regions. Real averaged dynamics near the singularities are obtained in comparison with the theoretical learning trajectories near singularity. In the simulation we analyze the averaged learning dynamics, batch mode learning dynamics and on-line learning dynamics, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
