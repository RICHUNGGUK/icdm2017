In this paper we have implemented robustness analysis for node multilateration localization in wireless sensor networks. A robustness criterion, called orthogonal projection algorithm (OPA), to detect flip ambiguity for range-based nodes multilateration localization method is proposed. The basic idea of OPA comes from the orthogonal projection principle, and it has the low computational complexity. On the basis of OPA, we further derive an expression to quantify the probability of flip ambiguity occurrences. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results demonstrate that OPA has good detection results and the low computational complexity, the expression for calculating probability of flip ambiguity occurrences is feasible.", "paper_title": "Robustness analysis for node multilateration localization in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356096800004"}
