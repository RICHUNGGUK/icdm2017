We investigate and relate four generalizations of bisimulation to this setting, providing conditions under which the four different generalizations coincide. We study transfinite sequences whose limits are the greatest bisimulations.", "paper_title": "RELATING COALGEBRAIC NOTIONS OF BISIMULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000290278900013"}
