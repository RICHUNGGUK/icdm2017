Therefore, these patterns can be used as digital signatures to verify the identity of computer users remotely over the Internet or locally at a specific workstation. In particular, keystroke recognition can enhance the username and password security model by monitoring the way that these strings are typed. To this end, this paper proposes a novel up-up keystroke latency (UUKL) feature and compares its performance with existing features using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based verification system that utilizes an adaptive and user-specific threshold based on the leave-one-out method (LOOM). The results show that the UUKL feature significantly outperforms the commonly used key hold-down time (KD) and down-down keystroke latency (DDKL) features. Overall, the inclusion of the UUKL feature led to an equal error rate (EER) of 4.4% based on a database of 41 users, which is a 2.1% improvement as compared to the existing features. Comprehensive results are also presented for a two-stage authentication system that has shown significant benefits. Lastly, due to many inconsistencies in previous works, a formal keystroke protocol is recommended that consolidates a number of parameters concerning how to improve performance, reliability, and accuracy of keystroke-recognition systems.", "paper_title": "Gaussian Mixture Modeling of Keystroke Patterns for Biometric Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000260899300008"}
