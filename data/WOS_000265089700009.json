In order to address these problems, in this paper, a data-driven fuzzy modeling method is employed to identify the dynamic model of an integrated SOFC/capacitor system. A novel offset-free input-to-state stable fuzzy predictive controller is developed based on the obtained fuzzy model. Both the rapid power load following and safe SOFC operation requirements are taken into account in the design of the closed-loop control system. Simulations are also given to demonstrate the load following control performance of the proposed fuzzy predictive control strategy for the SOFC/capacitor power system.", "paper_title": "Rapid Load Following of an SOFC Power System via Stable Fuzzy Predictive Tracking Controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000265089700009"}
