A good pseudo-random number generator is an essential tool in cryptography. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-random number generator based on the controlled combination of the outputs of several digitized chaotic Renyi maps. The generated pseudo-random sequences have passed both the NIST 800-22 Revision 1a and the DIEHARD tests. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed pseudo-random number generator requires less operation time than existing generators and is highly sensitive to the seed.", "paper_title": "A PSEUDO-RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR EMPLOYING MULTIPLE RENYI MAPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000325768800004"}
