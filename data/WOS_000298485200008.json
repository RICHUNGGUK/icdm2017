We assume the receiver feeds back perfectly estimated channel state information (CSI) to the transmitter after a processing delay. The objective of the power allocation is to maximize throughput subject to quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The QoS measure of our consideration is a triplet of data rate, delay, and delay bound violation probability. A two-step sub-optimal power allocation scheme is proposed to address the impact of outdated CSI. In the first step, the total transmission power that can be used within one block is determined according to the summation of the channel gains of all the channels. In the second step, the total transmission power is allocated among all the channels. The proposed power control scheme is less sensitive to the feedback delay. Compared to the optimal power allocation scheme designed for the perfect CSI scenario, it has lower computational complexity while achieving comparable capacity.
