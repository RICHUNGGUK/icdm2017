It is based on a set of deltas specifying modifications that are incrementally applied to a core product. The applicability of deltas depends on feature-dependent conditions. This paper presents abstract delta modeling, which explores delta modeling from an abstract, algebraic perspective. Compared to previous work, we take a more flexible approach with respect to conflicts between modifications and introduce the notion of conflict-resolving deltas. We present conditions on the structure of deltas to ensure unambiguous product generation.", "paper_title": "Abstract Delta Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000287306700003"}
