The choice of a method depends on A's symmetry property and/or definiteness), and MINRES is really just a special case of GMRES. This paper establishes error bounds on and sometimes exact expressions for residuals of CG, MINRES, and GMRES on solving a tridiagonal Toeplitz linear system, where A is Hermitian or just normal. These expressions and bounds are in terms of the three parameters that define A and Chebyshev polynomials of the first or second kind.", "paper_title": "Convergence of cg and gmres on a tridiagonal toeplitz linear system", "paper_id": "WOS:000249502700007"}
