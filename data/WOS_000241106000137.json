It can be used to monitor the network in real time and lightened the burden of the network monitoring management. With the application of the multi-agent Markov Decision Processes in the network management, an appropriate policy model of SNMP polling with the reinforcement learning is given. The simulations results show that the reinforcement-learning model can provide effective fault localization meanwhile decrease the overhead of network management remarkably.", "paper_title": "Analyzing fault monitoring policy for hierarchical network with MMDP environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000137"}
