It is proposed that uncertain variable should be used to reflect the experts' subjective estimation of security returns. Regarding the security returns as uncertain variables, the paper introduces a risk curve and develops a mean-risk model. In addition, the crisp form of the model is provided. The presented numerical examples illustrate the application of the mean-risk model and show the disaster result of mistreating uncertain returns as random returns.", "paper_title": "Mean-risk model for uncertain portfolio selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000290034100006"}
