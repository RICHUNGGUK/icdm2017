Smart Identifier NETwork (SINET) is one of the novel architectures. Embedded with the status awareness function, SINET can reallocate network resource according to the fluctuation of environmental conditions, thus to optimize resource utilization and enhance user experience. So how to transmit the status message becomes a key issue. Based on the basic framework and theories of SINET, this paper focuses on the status message transmission mechanism between diffierent layers in SINET. We firstly propose two alternative approaches, Bottom-Up Report and Top-Down Inquiry, and analyze their overheads. Then we build a proof-of-concept implementation, carry out experiments under diffierent scenarios and make performance evaluation based on the experimental results. The implementation results demonstrate the feasibility of two proposed approaches in small scale deployment, and also prove that: the BottomUp approach has the advantage of almost zero-overhead; the Top-Down Inquiry approach outperforms the other in aspect of accuracy, while the accuracy of the Bottom-Up Report depends on the duration of flow. Finally, we analyze the real data traces from Tier-1 ISP, considering the tradeoff between overhead and accuracy we recommend the Bottom-Up Report approach as the status message transmission mechanism in SINET.", "paper_title": "Status Message Transmission Mechanism in Smart Identifier NETwork", "paper_id": "WOS:000359612800015"}
