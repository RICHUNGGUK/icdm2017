In this paper, a special simulation-based and lifestyle-oriented CAD system is introduced to help the user in engineering design of thermal quality clothing. The engineering-oriented simulation models endowed with explicit data availability arose from the material parameters that are the key issue for engineering application. To offer an easy-to-use tool, this system is implemented with a lifestyle-oriented design procedure. It can facilitate the designers to quickly implement design and simulate on the wearing scenario, and evaluate and optimize their design. Due to the design of thermal quality clothing can be achieved without making physical prototypes, it is able to speed up the design cycle and reduce the design and development cost.", "paper_title": "Engineering design of thermal quality clothing on a simulation-based and lifestyle-oriented CAD system", "paper_id": "WOS:000295170100009"}
