The presented system contains three parts: a power signal generator, a receiver and a transmitter. We also propose an all-digital coherent-like frequency shift keying (FSK) demodulator for the receiver of the system. The proposed demodulator based on the use of multi-bit XOR gates and a mean value filter can improve bit error ratio (BER) performance without increasing obvious complexity. Differential bi-phase level (DBPL) coding is adopted to ensure the reliability of the transmitter. The FSK demodulator and DBPL coder was implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA). Hardware test results show that the equipment based on the presented system has good application in reading and writing data of the Euro-balise.", "paper_title": "THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A WIRELESS DATA ACQUISITION/TRANSMITTING SYSTEM FOR EURO-BALISE", "paper_id": "WOS:000327669200012"}
