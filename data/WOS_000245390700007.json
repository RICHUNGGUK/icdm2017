The approximated classifier is expected to have worse performance, here measured by the probability of correct classification. We present an analysis valid in general, and easily computable formulas for estimating the degradation in probability of correct classification when compared to the optimal classifier. An example of an approximation is the Naive Bayes classifier. We show that the performance of the Naive Bayes depends on the degree of functional dependence between the features and labels. We provide a sufficient condition for zero loss of performance, too.", "paper_title": "Bounds for the loss in probability of correct classification under model based approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000245390700007"}
