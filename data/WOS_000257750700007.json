The considered formulae are linear combinations of basis functions, which can be computed with high relative accuracy. We have taken into account that all steps but the last one can be computed to high relative accuracy. The exactness of the initial data is crucial for obtaining low error bounds. The Lagrange interpolation formula and related formulae are considered and numerical experiments are provided.", "paper_title": "Roundoff errors for polynomial evaluation by a family of formulae", "paper_id": "WOS:000257750700007"}
