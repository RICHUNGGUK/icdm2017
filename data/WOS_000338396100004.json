In this article, a novel ant colony algorithm is proposed to efficiently tackle this multi-objective combinatorial problem. Both heuristic information and phenomenon are described as multiple matrices and a dynamic random weighted strategy is introduced to compute selection probability. A linear independent relationship is presented to guide a feasible solution construction process. An external archive is used to improve the convergence speed. Moreover, the TOPSIS method is adopted to aid in multi-criteria decision making with respect to Pareto-optimal solutions. The proposed method is successfully applied to a multi-objective design problem of a steam metering network of a methanol production plant. The results illustrate that the proposed method could find a set of global Pareto-optimal solutions, which is helpful for understanding the relationship among cost, precision and reliability, and consequently is helpful for final decision support. Therefore, the integrated methodology of a multi-objective ant colony algorithm and a multi-criteria decision making technique provides a promising tool for the optimal design of sensor networks by simultaneously considering multiple conflicting objectives.
