To this end, we have used an adaptive-learning-rate neural network for automatic classification of four types of cardiac arrhythmia. In doing so, we have employed a mix of linear, nonlinear, and chaotic features of the R-R interval signal to significantly reduce the required information needed for analysis, and substantially improve the accuracy, as compared to existing systems (both ECG-based and R-R interval-based). For normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and atrial fibrillation (AF), the discrimination accuracies of 99.59%, 99.32%, 99.73%, and 98.69% were obtained, respectively on the MIT-BIH database, which are superior to all existing classifiers.", "paper_title": "AN ADAPTIVE BACKPROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORK FOR ARRHYTHMIA CLASSIFICATION USING R-R INTERVAL SIGNAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000314321300004"}
