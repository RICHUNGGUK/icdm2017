Some of the obtained OOCs are optimal or asymptotically optimal with respect to the Johnson bound. Also, we are able to show the existence of new optimal frequency hopping sequences (FHSs) with respect to the Singleton bound from our observation on a relation between OOCs and FHSs. The last construction is based on residue rings of polynomials over finite fields, and it yields a new large class of asymptotically optimal (q - 1, k, k - 2)-OOCs for any prime power q with gcd (q - 1, k) = 1. Some infinite families of optimal ones are included as a subclass.", "paper_title": "UNIFIED COMBINATORIAL CONSTRUCTIONS OF OPTIMAL OPTICAL ORTHOGONAL CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000331079200004"}
