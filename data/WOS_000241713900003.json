Moreover, subharmonic operation reduces local oscillator (LO) frequency requirements and therefore provides a very good option for millimetre-wave systems. In this paper, a fully balanced SOM structure at high harmonics with high conversion gain is presented. The balanced structure provides inherent RF-LO isolation and suppression of harmonics and noise. In addition, it removes the input balun from the design, thereby permitting integration into a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC).", "paper_title": "Self-oscillating mixing technique and its application to low-cost receiver architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241713900003"}
