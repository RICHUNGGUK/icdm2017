We give an approximation algorithm for the block sorting problem with an approximation ratio of 2 and run time O(n(2)). The approximation algorithm is based oil the related concept of block deletion. We show that finding an optimum block deletion sequence can be done in O(n(2)) time, even though block sorting is known to be N P-hard. Block sorting has importance in connection with optical character recognition (OCR) and is related to transposition sorting in computational biology.
