The factor k(1) reflects the curtain safety at the dam heel, k(2) describes the structural mutation stage for the adjustment of the multiple arch-cantilever system, and k(3) reflects the ultimate bearing capacity of the entire dam structure. A comparative study on the performance and ultimate bearing capacity of dams is performed to give a more reasonable evaluation criterion of safety factors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
