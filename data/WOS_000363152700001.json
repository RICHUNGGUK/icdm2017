In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods, this paper presents an intrusion tolerance method against malicious nodes. Different from the traditional intrusion tolerance methods based on encryption, authentication, and multirouting, the proposed method uses active protection to achieve intrusion tolerance. Small power consumption of many normal nodes is exchanged for large power consumption of relatively small number of malicious nodes to decrease the lifetime of malicious nodes. Theoretical analysis and test results show that the proposed methods not only prolong the lifetime of the sensor network but also achieve the effective protection against malicious nodes. The active protection method provides new ideas for the security in WSN.", "paper_title": "An Intrusion Tolerance Method Based on Energy Attack for Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000363152700001"}
