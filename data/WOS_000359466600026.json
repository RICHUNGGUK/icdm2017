Based the proposed mappings and the existing binary mutually uncorrelated complementary sequence sets (MUCSSs), a construction producing QAM periodic complementary sequence sets (PCSSs) is presented. The resultant QAM PCSSs have the same numbers and periods of sub-sequences as the binary MUCSSs employed, and the family size of new sequence sets is increased with exponent of periods of sub-sequences. The proposed QAM PCSSs can be applied to CDMA or OFDM communication systems so as to suppress multiple access interference (MAI) or to reduce peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR), respectively.", "paper_title": "QAM Periodic Complementary Sequence Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466600026"}
