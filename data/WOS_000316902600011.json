Transmission gate (TG) switch is used to implement the switch circuit, which results in a reduction in the effect of charge injection during sampling phase and an improved linearity. The parasitic capacitance connected to the top plate of battery capacitor is minimized for higher output voltage. The switch has been simulated in Spectre using an SMIC 0.18 mu m CMOS technology at 3.3 V and been applied to a 4-bit multiplying DAC (MDAC) in a 14-bit 100 MS/s pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The 4-bit MDAC has shown a satisfying dynamic performance.", "paper_title": "A LOW DISTORTION BOOTSTRAPPED SWITCH FOR 4-BIT MDAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000316902600011"}
