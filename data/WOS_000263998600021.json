A suitable superstructure is introduced, based on partitioning a general polygeneration energy system into four major blocks, for each of which alternative available technologies and types of equipment are considered. A detailed case study, involving a coal-based polygeneration plant producing electricity and methanol, is presented to demonstrate the key features and applicability of the proposed approach.
