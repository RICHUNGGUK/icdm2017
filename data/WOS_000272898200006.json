In this paper, we show that Shieh et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to guessing attacks, forgery attacks and key compromise attacks. To eliminate these weaknesses, an improvement of Shieh et al.'s scheme with increased security is proposed. The security and efficiency of the improved scheme raises the attractiveness for implementation.", "paper_title": "Attacks and Improvement of an Efficient Remote Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000272898200006"}
