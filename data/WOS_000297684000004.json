Virtual feature streams are, in general, impossible to determine a priori, but the paper introduces an algorithm that stops the computation of features as soon as it can be proved that they are no longer needed thus generating, albeit in a roundabout and more expensive than the ideal way, a feature stream that is less expensive than the complete one to compute and safe: the queries that accept the virtual feature stream are those (and only those) that would accept the original feature stream.", "paper_title": "Efficient Computation of Queries on Feature Streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000297684000004"}
