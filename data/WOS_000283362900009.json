The resulting linear ridgelet network can learn more rapidly from training samples and handle more effectively the complicated fault information of circuit under test than wavelet network and ridgelet network, classifying these faults efficiently and correctly and achieving a high classification accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.", "paper_title": "A linear ridgelet network approach for fault diagnosis of analog circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000283362900009"}
