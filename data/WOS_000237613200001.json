The model is composed of a discrete-time linear dynamic system and a bounded static delayed (or non-delayed) nonlinear operator. By combining various Lyapunov functionals with the S-procedure, sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability and global exponential stability of the DDSNNM are derived, which are formulated as linear or nonlinear matrix inequalities. Most discrete-time delayed or non-delayed RNNs, or discrete-time neural-network-based nonlinear control systems can be transformed into the DDSNNMs for stability analysis and controller synthesis in a unified way. Two application examples are given where the DDSNNMs are employed to analyze the stability of the discrete-time cellular neural networks (CNNs) and to synthesize the neuro-controllers for the discrete-time nonlinear systems, respectively. Through these examples, it is demonstrated that the DDSNNM not only makes the stability analysis of the RNNs much easier, but also provides a new approach to the synthesis of the controllers for the nonlinear systems.", "paper_title": "Discrete-time delayed standard neural. network model and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000237613200001"}
