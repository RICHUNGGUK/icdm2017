Real-time implementation of such beamforming systems requires modeling of computational electromagnetics for the antennas, radio frequency (RF) analog design aspects for low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixed-signal aspects for signal quantization and sampling and finally, digital architectures for the spatially bandpass plane wave filters proposed in Joshi et al. (IEEE Trans Very Large Scale Integr Syst 20(12):2241-2254, 2012). Multi-dimensional spatio-temporal spectral properties of down-converted RF plane wave signals are reviewed and derivation of the spatially bandpass filter transfer function is presented. An example of a wideband antipodal Vivaldi antenna is simulated at 1 GHz. Potential RF receiver chains are identified including a design of a tunable combline microstrip bandpass filter with tuning range 0.8-1.1 GHz. The 1st-order sensitivity analysis of the beam filter 2-D -domain transfer function shows that for a 12-bits of fixed-point precision, the maximum percentage error in the 2-D magnitude frequency response due to quantization is as low as . Monte-Carlo simulations are used to study the effect of quantization on the bit error rate (BER) performance of the beamforming system. 5-bit analog to digital converter (ADC) precision with 8-bit internal arithmetic precision provides a gain of approximately 16 dB for a BER of with respect to the no beamforming case. ASIC Synthesis results of the beam filter in 45 nm CMOS verifies a real time operating frequency of 429 MHz.", "paper_title": "Electronically scanned RF-to-bits beam aperture arrays using 2-D IIR spatially bandpass digital filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000331979900005"}
