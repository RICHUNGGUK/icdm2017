The main characteristics of the samples are learned after being trained. In order to realize unsupervised learning of neural network structure with convex constraint, an iterative computation method is proposed that makes use of alternating projection between two convex sets. The final example proves that this method can detect instructions without a mass of supervised data and it converges fast. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
