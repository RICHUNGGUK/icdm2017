This serious agricultural problem can be partially tackled in many ways, but not all the methods look sustainable, e.g., by using chemical agents at the first signs of the infestation. Sustainable solutions could be adopted with the use of interactive simulation tools in order to permit developing scenarios and testing different strategies. This paper outlines the model and exhibits a first partial application.", "paper_title": "FlySim: A Cellular Automata model of Bactrocera oleae (olive fruit fly) infestation and first simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300035"}
