Many tone-mapping algorithms have been proposed to meet this end, the choice of which depends on display characteristics such as luminance range, contrast ratio and gamma correction. An ideal HDR tone-mapping processor should have a robust core functionality, high flexibility, and low area consumption, and therefore an ARM-core-based system-on-chip (SOC) platform with a HDR tone-mapping application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is suitable for such applications. In this paper, we present a systematic methodology for the development of a tone-mapping processor of optimized architecture using an ARM SOC platform, and illustrate the use of this novel HDR tone-mapping processor for both photographic and gradient compression. Optimization is achieved through four major steps: common module extraction, computation power enhancement, hardware/software partition, and cost function analysis. Based on the proposed scheme, we present an integrated photographic and gradient tone-mapping processor that can be configured for different applications. This newly-developed processor can process 1,024 x 768 images at 60 fps, runs at 100 MHz clock and consumes a core area of 8.1 mm(2) under TSMC 0.13 mu m technology, resulting in a 50% improvement in speed and area as compared with previously-described processors.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Tone-Mapping Processor with Integrated Photographic and Gradient Compression using 0.13 mu m Technology on an Arm Soc Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000290452300007"}
