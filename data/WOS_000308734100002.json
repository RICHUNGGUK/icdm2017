Results showed IT investment in the 20th century supported an increasingly decentralized hierarchical functional corporate organization structure, and shifted during the early decades of the 21st century toward an IT-enabled global network organization structure. IT investment context changed from an inward focus to an outward, IT-ecosystem focus. IT had penetrated every facet of the corporation creating IT ubiquity. But while IT was everywhere, IT strategic leadership remained fragmented and nowhere. Further research is required to define strategic IT leadership and its locus in the modern corporation.
