It contains a collection of recent contributions to the field of knowledge representation and reasoning, a field that McCarthy founded and that has been a main focus of his research during the last half century. In this introductory article, we survey some of McCarthy's major contributions to the field of knowledge representation and reasoning, and situate the papers in this special issue in the context of McCarthy's previous work.
