It has the potential of reducing the number of active elements and interconnection lines. More data may be transferred trough a single wire using logic signals having more than two levels. However, in spite of their potential advantages, developments in multi-valued systems are not satisfactory. In particular, it is very difficult to find circuits to implement the multilevel sequential circuits. The flip-flop is the basic building block of sequential circuits and may be used to design sequential circuits such as counter/dividers and other sequential circuits. In this regard, a new multilevel flip-flop, called the AB flip-flop, was developed and published by the authors recently (Sarica and Morgul, Electron Lett 47(5):297-298, 2011). In this paper we present a new latch and restoration circuit which improves the performance of the previously designed flip-flop circuit. It is also shown that any sequential circuit may be implemented by using this flip-flop.", "paper_title": "Basic circuits for multi-valued sequential logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000312769900010"}
