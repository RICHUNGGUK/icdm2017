First, some theorems and results are presented to simplify systems of fuzzy relational equations. Next, the feasible set of the optimization problem is reduced. Then, the linear fractional multi-objective optimization problem is converted to a linear one using Nykowski and Zolkiewski's approach. Furthermore, the efficient solutions are obtained by applying the improved c-constraint method. In addition, we design an algorithm to generate consistent systems of fuzzy relational equations, randomly, using the covering problem. Finally, the proposed method is effectively tested by solving a randomly generated consistent test problem.
