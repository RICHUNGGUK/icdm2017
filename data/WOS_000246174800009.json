Specifically, for any n-Venn diagram of convex k-gons, we prove that k >= (2(n)-2-n)/(n(n-2)). In the process we prove that Venn diagrams of seven curves, simple or not, cannot be formed from triangles. We then give an example achieving the new lower bound of a ( simple, symmetric) Venn diagram of seven convex quadrilaterals.
