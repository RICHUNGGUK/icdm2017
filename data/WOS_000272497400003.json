By using the average dwell-time approach and the piecewise Lyapunov function technique, a sufficient condition is first proposed, which guarantees the error system to be mean-square exponentially stable with a weighted H-infinity performance. Then, the model reduction is solved by using the projection approach, which casts the model reduction into a sequential minimisation problem Subjected to linear matrix inequality constraints by employing the cone complementary linearisation algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory.", "paper_title": "H-infinity model reduction for continuous-time switched stochastic hybrid systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272497400003"}
