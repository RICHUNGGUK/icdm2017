The trilinear-based multiuser detection algorithm (Trilinear-MUDE) that we presented exploits the versatile diversity in MC-CDMA system while require neither channel information nor statistical characteristics. The algorithmic performance indicates that the proposed algorithm is very close to the nonblind MMSE method, and better than minimum output energy (MOE) receiver and matched filter. Numerical results also reveal its compatibility in condition of small sampling sizes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
