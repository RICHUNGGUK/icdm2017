While no human infections are reported to date, the rapid mutations in flu viruses can lead to more pathogenic subtypes. We have investigated such possibilities and have shown that H5N4, H5N9 and H5N6 are the most likely candidates for next round of viral reassortments, amongst which H5N9, if reassorted from Asiatic strains, could be highly pathogenic. We discuss here possibilities of anticipatory rational vaccine design based on work done earlier.", "paper_title": "Prognosis of Possible Reassortments in Recent H5N2 Epidemic Influenza in USA: Implications for Computer-Assisted Surveillance As Well As Drug/Vaccine Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000365622000003"}
