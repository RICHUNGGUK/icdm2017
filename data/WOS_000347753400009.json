Even when we stare at a fixed point, small involuntary movements take place in our eyes in an imperceptible manner. Researchers agree on the presence of three main contributions to eye movements when we fix the gaze: microsaccades, drifts and tremor. These small movements carry the image across the retina stimulating the photoreceptors and thus avoiding fading. Nowadays it is commonly accepted that these movements can improve the discrimination performance of the retina. In this paper, several retina models with and without fixational eye movements were implemented by mean of RetinaStudio tool to test the feasibility of these models to be incorporated in future neuroprostheses. For this purpose each retina model has been stimulated with natural scene images in two experiments. Results are discussed from the point of view of a neuroprosthesis development.
