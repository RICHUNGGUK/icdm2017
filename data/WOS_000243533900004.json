The major focus of this paper deals with the strategy used in the data selection task as applied to the determination of non-conventional process parameters, such as performance or process-efficiency indexes, which are difficult to acquire by direct measurement. The implementation and validation procedure on a real case study is carried out with the aid of the facilities supplied by commercial neural networks toolboxes, which manage databases, neural network structures and highly efficient training algorithms.", "paper_title": "On fault isolation by neural-networks-based parameter estimation techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000243533900004"}
