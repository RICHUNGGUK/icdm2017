Key issues in applying this approach include capturing of experience, storage and management of experience, and retrieval of experience from experience repository. We demonstrate our approach in a set of initial experiments, in which viewers' movie watching experiences are captured and reused to support smart digital TV services.", "paper_title": "Making Digital TV Smarter: Capturing and Reusing Experience in Digital TV", "paper_id": "WOS:000301118600006"}
