Let T := {T (t) : t >= 0} be a strongly continuous semigroup of asymptotically nonexpansive mappings from K into K with a sequence {L(t)} subset of [1, infinity). Suppose F (T) not equal phi. Then, for a given u is an element of K there exists a sequence {u(n)} subset of K such that u(n) = (1 - alpha(n)) 1/t(n) integral(tn)(0) T(s)u(n)ds + alpha(n)u, for n is an element of N, where t(n) is an element of R(+), {alpha(n)} subset of (0, 1) and {L(t)} satisfy certain conditions. Suppose, in addition, that E is reflexive strictly convex with a G (a) over cap teaux differentiable norm. Then, the sequence {u(n)} converges strongly to a point of F (T). Furthermore, an explicit sequence {x(n)} which converges strongly to a fixed point of T is proved. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
