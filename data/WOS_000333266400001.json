It aims at applying wireless technology to industrial automation control domains in hash industrial environment. A main challenge in these application domains is that wireless communication channels must satisfy strict requirements of real time and reliability. Therefore, first, we propose a new interacting dual model (IDM) adaptive estimation algorithm to identify the unreliable wireless communication channels, and, second, to further enhance the accuracy and fault tolerance of state estimation for controlled plant, a federated multisensor estimation fusion approach is presented. Furthermore, considering that the IWSANs need commonly to be deployed over a vast geographical area, a distributed collaborative control strategy is adopted. Finally, an example of temperature control illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Distributed Estimation Fusion and Control with Packet Losses for Industrial Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333266400001"}
