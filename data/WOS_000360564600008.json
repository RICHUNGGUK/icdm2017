This mismatch between rich contents and the end devices capability presents a challenge in providing seamless and ubiquitous access to electronic documents to interested users. Service-oriented content adaptation has emerged as a potential solution to the content-device mismatch problem. Since an adaptation task can potentially be performed by multiple content adaptation services (CAS), an approach for CAS discovery is a fundamental component of service-oriented content adaptation environment. In this paper, we propose a service discovery approach that considers the client device capability and the service's attributes to discover appropriate CAS while optimizing performance and functionality. The efficiency of the proposed CAS discovery protocol is studied experimentally. The results show that the proposed discovery approach is effective in terms of discovering appropriate content adaptation services.", "paper_title": "Multimedia content adaptation service discovery mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000360564600008"}
