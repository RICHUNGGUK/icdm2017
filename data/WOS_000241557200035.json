We present an approach that allows us to also get event traces from the I/O server environment and to merge them with the client trace. Corresponding events will be matched and visualized. We integrate this functionality into the parallel file system PVFS2 and the MPICH2 tool Jumpshot.", "paper_title": "Tracing the MPI-IO calls' disk accesses", "paper_id": "WOS:000241557200035"}
