In this paper, we propose SOA-based middleware to support quality-of-service (QoS) control of mobile applications and to configure an energy-efficient service composition graph. We categorize services into two layers: functionality-centric services, which are connected to create a complex service to meet the user's intentions, and resource-centric services, which undertake distributed functionality-centric services in a way that increases the success rate of service composition while reducing contention at specific service nodes. We also present a service routing algorithm to balance the resource consumption of service providers on a service-overlay network. Through simulation of power-aware service composition using a realistic model based on ns-2 and traced data, we demonstrate that our approach can help both the mobile devices and the servers in a service-overlay network to reduce energy consumption without an increase in response time.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable service composition and categorization for power-aware mobile computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000259457200010"}
