Connection weights depend on distances and angle differences, while neurons evolve following a spiking dynamics (Izhikevich's model in most of the considered cases). Although the studied synapses depend on discrete three-valued functions, simulations display the emergence of approximate synchrony, making these cognitive tasks possible. Noise effects are examined, and the possibility of achieving similar results with a different neuron model is discussed.", "paper_title": "Approximate Emergent Synchrony in Spatially Coupled Spiking Neurons with Discrete Interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000343186700003"}
