The mobile WiMAX uses orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in its physical layer. The main function of the LA scheme is to select an appropriate burst profile, which includes a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmission mode, modulation technique, and coding scheme. We formulate a discrete optimization problem for the LA scheme by maximizing the throughput. An algorithm to implement the LA scheme is also proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed LA scheme exhibits good performance.
