A set of criteria are proposed for the robust global exponential periodicity of such networks. Our results depend neither on differentiability nor on monotonicity of the activation functions of the neurons. In addition, these criteria are easily checkable.", "paper_title": "Robust global periodicity of interval bidirectional associative memory networks with finite distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000247469300004"}
