Consequently, it mostly imposes multi-hop transmission and thus limits the utilization of radio bandwidth. Emerging radio technologies under the umbrella of 4G, having long transmission range, are capable of enhancing the bandwidth utilization through single-hop transmission at the expense of limiting spatial reuse over the network. Both of these excellences, i.e., the efficient bandwidth utilization and the spatial reuse, are required in case of a concurrent presence of two types of flows-base station oriented and random flows. Therefore, it is necessary to efficiently use both types of radios, i.e., 802.11 and 4G, in next-generation wireless mesh networks, as they are going to experience a mix of the two types of flows. We propose an architecture to guarantee the efficient usage of both the radios through their symbiotic coexistence. Extensive evaluation through analytical modeling, ns-2 simulation, and real testbed experiments reveals that our proposed architecture achieves up to approximately network throughput, 95 % decreased end-to-end delay, and 98 % decreased number of base stations compared to other radio alternatives.", "paper_title": "SymCo: Symbiotic Coexistence of Single-hop and Multi-hop Transmissions in Next-generation Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361822000002"}
