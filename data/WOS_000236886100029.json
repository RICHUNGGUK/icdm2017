The construction of a spanner is distributed and local in the sense that nodes use only information at their vicinity, moreover for a given integer k >= 2 each node needs only consider all the nodes at distance at most k hops from it. The resulting spanner has maximum degree at most 3 + 6/pi r + r+1/r(2), when 0 < r < 1 (and at most five, when r = 1). Furthermore it is shown that the spanner is planar provided that the distance between any two nodes is at least root 1-r(2). If the spanner is planar then for k >= 2 the sum of the Euclidean lengths of the edges of the spanner is at most kr+1/kr-1 times the sum of the Euclidean lengths of the edges of a minimum weight Euclidean spanning tree.", "paper_title": "Local construction of planar spanners in unit disk graphs with irregular transmission ranges", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100029"}
