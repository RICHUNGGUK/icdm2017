Monte Carlo(MCMC) approximation inference for D-LDA is stated in detail Third, some datasets from UCI are chosen for experiments Compared with cluster-based similarity partitioning algorithm (CSPA), hyper-graph partitioning algorithm and meta-cluster algorithm (MCLA), the results show D-LDA does work better, further-more Me outputs of D-LDA, as a soft cluster model, Can not only cluster the, data ponds but also show the structure of data points", "paper_title": "DISTRIBUTED LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION FOR DISTRIBUTED CLUSTER ENSEMBLE", "paper_id": "WOS:000275768200023"}
