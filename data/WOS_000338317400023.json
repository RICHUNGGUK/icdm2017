A term's Discrimination Power(DP) is based on the difference degree of the term's average weights obtained from between relevant and non-relevant retrieved document sets. The difference based DP performs better compared to ratio based DP introduced in the previous research. Our experimental result shows that a term weighting scheme based on the discrimination power method outperforms a TF*IDF based scheme.", "paper_title": "Term weighting for information retrieval based on term's discrimination power", "paper_id": "WOS:000338317400023"}
