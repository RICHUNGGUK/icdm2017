In this paper a new method to calculate the discounting coefficient of evidence based on evidence clustering by the way of fuzzy ART neural network is proposed. The discounted evidence is taken into account in belief function combination. A numerical example is shown to illustrate the use of the proposed method to handle conflicting evidence.", "paper_title": "Determine discounting coefficient in data fusion based on fuzzy ART neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000191"}
