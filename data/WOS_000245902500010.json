It is shown that any toroidal benzenoid whose hexagons number a multiple of four can be tiled with the pyrene and/or anthanthrene graphs and, by a simple bond rearrangement such as Stone-Wales, converted to a toroidal pentaheptite of the same size having an even number of pentagon-heptagon pairs. Furthermore certain toroidal benzenoids that can be tiled with pyrene, may alternatively be tiled with triphenylene. Insertion of the 3-star graph into the central hexagon of a triphenylene tile converts it to a triplet of azulene graphs, thus enabling certain toroidal pentaheptite structures with an odd number of pentagon-heptagon pairs to be realised, although such structures contain abutting pentagon triplets. Using such methods it is always possible to convert a toroidal benzenoid to a toroidal pentaheptite whose size differs by no more than four vertices.", "paper_title": "Even tori can be odd", "paper_id": "WOS:000245902500010"}
