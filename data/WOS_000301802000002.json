What literature does exists (Griffiths & Light, 2008; Lowood, 2005; Postigo, 2008; Stalker, 2005) uses the term primarily to denote gamers' practices beyond the designers' original intentions, for instance, game content modifications. This article frames game appropriation in a different manner; unlike existing appropriation models, game appropriation is conceptualized as a motivational process underpinned by three primary factors: game design characteristics, social interaction, and the psychological characteristics of the gamer. The main contribution of this article is the development of the first model of game appropriation, the game appropriation model (GAM). GAM explains the process of digital games' incorporation into gamers' daily practices as well as the nature of their gameplay. Game appropriation recognizes the online-offline continuity; it contributes to understating gameplay as a long-term, dynamic activity, directly interrelated with a gamers' everyday life rather than a set of defined moments of participation.", "paper_title": "A Motivationally Oriented Approach to Understanding Game Appropriation", "paper_id": "WOS:000301802000002"}
