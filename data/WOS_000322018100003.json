As social networking sites are getting more and more popular, we propose a Facebook aware virtual human. The social networking sites are used to empower virtual humans for interpersonal conversational interaction in this paper. We combine Internet world, physical world and 3D virtual world together to create a new interface for users to interact with an autonomous virtual human which can behave like a real modern human. In order to take advantages of social networking sites, virtual human gathers information of a user from its profile, its likes, dislikes and gauge mood from most recent status update. In two user studies, we investigated whether and how this new interface can enhance human-virtual human interaction. Some positive results concluded from these studies will be guidelines on research and development of future virtual human interfaces.", "paper_title": "Let's keep in touch online: a Facebook aware virtual human interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000322018100003"}
