The paper discusses different solutions for authentication and authorization needs when \"Lab Learning Objects\" are used through the Learning Management System of an institution to run a remote experiment based on physical resources (rigs) provided by an external experiment provider organization. The solutions are based on the use of SCORM as a framework for learning objects, the definition of a third-party rig booking system and the use of Shibboleth as an optional framework for a federated authentication and authorization.", "paper_title": "Access Control for Shared Remote Laboratories", "paper_id": "WOS:000209183200002"}
