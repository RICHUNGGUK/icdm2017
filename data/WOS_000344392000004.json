We show that the category of analytic monads is equivalent to the category of regular-linear theories. The category of polynomial monads is equivalent to the category of rigid theories, that is, regular-linear theories satisfying an additional global condition. This solves a problem posed by A. Carboni and P. T. Johnstone. The Lawvere theories corresponding to these monads are identified via some factorisation systems. We also show that the categories of analytic monads and finitary endofunctors on Set are monadic over the category of analytic functors. The corresponding monad for analytic monads distributes over the monad for finitary endofunctors and hence the category of (finitary) monads on Set is monadic over the category of analytic functors.
