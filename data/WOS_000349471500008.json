But little is known about chronic patients' acceptance of such PHDs. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore how chronic patients accept PHDs and what are the main factors that predict use intention of PHDs. The results will provide suggestions for the design of PHDs and e-health services. Method: A questionnaire survey was conducted to identify the main factors that affect chronic patients' acceptance of PHDs. Three hundred and forty-six valid responses from chronic patients were collected and the data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis method. The questionnaire also included questions about respondents' experience of PHDs and preference of PHD functions. These questions help to understand lived experience of PHD users and to explain the factors that influence their use intention. Result: Five influencing factors that predict use intention of PHDs were identified: attitude toward technology, perceived usefulness, ease of learning and availability, social support, and perceived pressure. An acceptance model of PHDs was proposed based on these factors, and suggestions for PHD designers and e-health service designers were discussed. The exploration of PHD experience indicated that ease of learning and social norm significantly influenced PHD use intention, and many respondents expressed negative opinions on the accuracy, durability and maintenance service of PHDs. Besides, people generally expressed positive attitude toward future functions of a PHD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
