In this paper the regeneration, decay and transport of a generic 'growth factor', which induces the healing of the wound, is taken into account. Further, an equation of motion is derived for radial healing of a circular wound. The expressions for the equation of motion and the distribution of the growth factor are related in such a way that no healing occurs if the growth factor concentration at the wound edge is below a threshold value. In this paper we investigate the influence of the behaviour of the thickness of the active layer, in which the growth factor is produced, on the healing process. Also a correction is made to a result in earlier work. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
