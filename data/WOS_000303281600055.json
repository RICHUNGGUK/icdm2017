The proposed systems has been designed to monitor elders which live alone and want to keep living independently. The process covers all the phases in intelligent system development: requirement analysis, conceptual model specification, architectural design and evaluation. One of the main contributions of the proposed work is an exhaustive evaluation methodology that is integrated in the development process. A relevant characteristic of the evaluation process is that, from initial phases, commercial presentations of the products functionalities is possible. Another important contribution is related with the capability of the system to adapt its behavior to that of the monitored elder. The presented system is called Necesity. It has become a commercial product which is already working and giving service to elders in the South-East of Spain. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
