We establish the relationship between attribute reductions of the object oriented concept lattice generated by a formal context and covering reductions of the covering approximation space induced by the same formal context, and then present the covering method to compute all attribute reductions of this object oriented concept lattices. Moreover, we give an example to compute all attribute or object reductions of the object oriented concept lattice and all reductions of a formal context by using this method, which illustrates that this method is effective and simple.", "paper_title": "The covering method for attribute reductions of concept lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000348559000009"}
