However, realising this distributed cellular network architecture is not a trivial task. In this paper, we first introduce a simple self-organisation rule under which a distributed cellular network is able to converge into an efficient resource allocation pattern, then propose a novel resource allocation model taking realistic resource allocation constraints into account, and finally evaluate the performance of the proposed self-organisation rule and resource allocation model using system-level simulations.", "paper_title": "Minimising Cell Transmit Power: Towards Self-organized Resource Allocation in OFDMA Femtocells", "paper_id": "WOS:000302124800045"}
