The algorithm is based on a representation of alternating- time formulas as automata over concurrent game structures. We show that language emptiness of these automata can be checked in exponential time. The complexity of our construction meets the known lower bounds for deciding the satisfiability of the classic mu-calculus. It follows that the satisfiability problem is EXPTIME-complete for the alternating-time mu-calculus.", "paper_title": "Satisfiability and finite model property for the alternating-time mu-calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000241587300039"}
