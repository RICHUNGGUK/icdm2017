This lifetime distribution is capable of modelling various shapes of failure rates, and hence various shapes of ageing criteria. The model can be considered as another useful two-parameter generalization of the IED. Statistical and reliability properties of the generalized inverted exponential distribution are derived. Maximum likelihood estimation and least square estimation are used to evaluate the parameters and the reliability of the distribution. Properties of the estimates are also studied.", "paper_title": "Reliability estimation of generalized inverted exponential distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000270812900003"}
