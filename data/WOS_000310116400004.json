For fine registration, known variants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm are commonly adopted; however, no attempt seems to be done to tweak such a sorithms to better suit the distinctive multisensor nature of the data. This work investigates an original approach that targets issues which are specific to multisensor coordinate metrology scenarios, such as coexistence of point sets with different densities, different spatial arrangements (e.g. sparse CMM points vs. gridded sets from light scanners), and different noise levels associated to the point sets depending on the metrological performances of the sensors involved. The proposed approach is based on combining known ICP variants with novel point set augmentation techniques, where new points are added to existing sets with the purpose of improving registration performance and robustness to measurement error. In particular, augmentation techniques based on advanced fitting solutions promote a paradigm shift for registration, which is not seen as a geometric problem consisting in moving point sets as close as possible to each other, but as a problem where it is not the original points, but the underlying geometries that must be brought together. In this work, promising combinations of ICP and point augmentation techniques are investigated through the application to virtual scenarios involving synthetic geometries and simulated measurements. Guidelines for approaching registration problems in industrial scenarios involving multisensor data fusion are also provided. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
