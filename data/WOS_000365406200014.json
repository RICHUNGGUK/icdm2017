The proposed scheme is not affected by clock synchronization, the packet generation time, and the transmission speeds of the host under measurement. We show the experimental results of the proposed scheme tested on different hosts and under different transmission speeds, including 1000 Mb/s.", "paper_title": "A Method to Measure Packet Processing Time of Hosts Using High-Speed Transmission Lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000365406200014"}
