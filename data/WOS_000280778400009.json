Under pressure to increase revenues, credit prediction should be a part of customer delinquency management. In this study, a credit prediction model has been developed to manage delinquents holding retail credit cards. The hybrid model combines a Kohonen network and a Cox's proportional hazard model. A Kohonen network is used to cluster credit delinquents into homogeneous groups. A Cox's hazard model is used to analyze repayment patterns of delinquents in each group. The model estimates the expected time of credit recovery from delinquents. This model's prediction accuracy scored above 93%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
