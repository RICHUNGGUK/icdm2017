The states not only in constructing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional but also in designing the integral inequality technique [12] will be discretized. Based on the discretized-state, [9]. [17]'s piecewise analysis method will be applied to confirm the system stability in whole delay bound. Numerical examples show that the results obtained by this criterion improve the allowable delay bounds over the existing results in the literature.", "paper_title": "Delay-Dependent Stability Criteria for Systems with Time-Varying Delays: State Discretization Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701700027"}
