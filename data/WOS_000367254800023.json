While the MPI standard allows multithreaded concurrent communication, such flexibility comes with the cost of maintaining thread safety within the MPI implementation, typically implemented using critical sections. In contrast to previous works that studied the importance of critical-section granularity in MPI implementations, in this paper we investigate the implication of critical-section arbitration on communication performance. We first analyze the MPI runtime when multithreaded concurrent communication takes place on hierarchical memory systems. Our results indicate that the mutex-based approach that most MPI implementations use today can incur performance penalties due to unfair arbitration. We then present methods to mitigate these penalties with a first-come, first-served arbitration and a priority locking scheme that favors threads doing useful work. Through evaluations using several benchmarks and applications, we demonstrate up to 5-fold improvement in performance.", "paper_title": "MPI plus Threads: Runtime Contention and Remedies", "paper_id": "WOS:000367254800023"}
