This method suppresses every complex unwanted region of a B-rep model so as to efficiently generate a simplified version of the original model that preserves its original rough shape. In this method, the new surfaces that are used to cover each suppressed region are constructed based on the boundary loop decomposition of the suppressed region rather than through the time-consuming face extension and intersection operations widely applied in previous studies. An evaluation of experimental results is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
