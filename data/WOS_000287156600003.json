The numerical method is based on the fractional step method, where the resulting set of ODEs is solved by the two-stage Runge-Kutta method and the homogeneous set of PDEs by a finite volume method. The flow does not contain both phases (gas and liquid) in the whole domain, therefore we discuss properties of used finite volume methods in several cases of single-phase transonic flow in a channel and a turbine cascade. We present numerical results of two-phase flow of condensing steam in 2D nozzle achieved by several numerical methods and show the differences in results caused by numerical diffusion.
