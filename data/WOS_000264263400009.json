A toolkit for strategic usability: results from workshops, panels, and surveys. In: Little, R., Nigay, L. (Eds.) In: Proceedings of ACM CHI 2000 Conference, New York, pp. 337-344]. But it suffers from large variability in the evaluation results due to differences among evaluators [Nielsen, 1993. Usability Engineering. Academic Press, Boston, MA]. The evaluation performance of evaluators with two types of cognitive styles-ten field independent (FI) subjects and ten field dependent (FD) subjects were compared. The results indicated that the FI subjects produced evaluation results with significantly higher thoroughness (t(18) = 3.49 p = 0.0026), validity (t(18) = 4.263 p = 0.0005), effectiveness (t(18) = 5.14, p = 0.0001), and sensitivity (t(18) = 3.16 p = 0.005) than the FD subjects. When assessing their own evaluation experiences, the FI subjects felt it was easier to find usability problems than the FD subjects (t(18) = 2.10, p = 0.049), but the FD subjects felt more guided during the evaluation than the FI subjects (t(18) = 2.281 p = 0.035).
