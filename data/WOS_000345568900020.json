The proposed system includes a QR decomposition, lattice reduction (LR) processor, and sorting-reduced (SR) K-best detector for 8 x 8 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The bit error rate of the proposed MIMO detection system only incurs approximately 3 dB of implementation loss compared with optimal maximum likelihood detection with 64-quadratic-amplitude modulation. The proposed processor can also support different throughput requirements by adjusting the stage number of LR. The SR K-best detector can achieve 3.1 Gb/s throughput with 0.24-ns latency. The throughput of the system reaches 585 Mb/s if one channel preprocessing can support 72 symbol detections. The corresponding energy per bit is 63 pJ/bit, which is the smallest value achieved to date. This paper presents the first VLSI implementation of a complete LRA K-best detector with an 8 x 8 dimension.", "paper_title": "A 3.1 Gb/s 8 x 8 Sorting Reduced K-Best Detector With Lattice Reduction and QR Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000345568900020"}
