We consider the connection of transitive codes with propelinear codes and show that there exists a binary code, the Best code of length 10, size 40 and minimum distance 4, which is transitive but not propelinear. We propose several constructions of propelinear codes and introduce a new large class of propelinear perfect binary codes, called normalized propelinear perfect codes. Finally, based on the different values for the rank and the dimension of the kernel, we give a lower bound on the number of nonequivalent propelinear perfect binary codes.", "paper_title": "STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF BINARY PROPELINEAR CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000307876400006"}
