In the control scheme proposed here, the system has to be first represented through a multi-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy-based model approach to make an appropriate prediction of the system behavior. Subsequently, a multi-generalized predictive control (GPC) scheme, which is organized based on a number of GPC schemes, is realized in line with the investigated model outcomes, at chosen operating points of the system. In case of the proposed control strategy realization, the investigated multi-GPC scheme is instantly updated to handle the system by activating the best control scheme through a new GPC identifier, while the system output is suddenly varied with respect to time. To present the applicability of the proposed control scheme, an industrial tubular heat exchanger system and also a drum-type boiler-turbine system have been chosen to drive through the proposed strategy. In such a case, the simulations are carried out and the corresponding results are compared with those obtained using traditional GPC scheme in addition to nonlinear GPC (NLGPC) scheme, as benchmark approaches, where the acquired results of the proposed control scheme are desirably verified.", "paper_title": "On the practice of artificial intelligence based predictive control scheme: a case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000298853200011"}
