An equation for the determination of the invariants for patches of degree (n,n) is derived and solved for the bi-quadratics - for which it is shown that seven independent, invariant functions exist. Explicit forms of the invariants are derived and a number of applications are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
