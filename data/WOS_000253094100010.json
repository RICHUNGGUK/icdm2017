A numerical example taken from the literature is studied in depth to verify the enhanced performance of the algorithm, as well as to scrutinize the role and significance of self-adaptation in ESs for a successfully implemented optimization process. Besides, the utility of the algorithm for practical structural engineering applications is demonstrated using a bridge design example. It is shown that adaptive ESs are reliable and powerful tools, and well-suited for optimum design of complex structural systems, including large-scale structural optimization. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
