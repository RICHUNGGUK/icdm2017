Many existing methods depend on the seed word, and such dependence leads to low robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel method utilizing propagation and optimization model, PRopagation-based Constrained Optimization Model (PR-COM) for SWI. Unlike the previous research, we exploit an iterative algorithm to expand the seed word set from the candidate word set, which brings higher robustness. Experimental results on several data sets show that our PR-COM method is effective and outperforms the state-of-art methods.
