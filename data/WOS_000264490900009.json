ZCS condition is obtained for all transistors for reducing switching loss and electromagnetic interference. With the current clamping technique, current stress of the converter is low. Output voltage of this converter can be controlled with fixed frequency. Electrical isolation is provided. Operation principles are discussed in the paper.
