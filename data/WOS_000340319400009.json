Some sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the synchronization of the memristor-based recurrent neural networks via delay-dependent output feedback controller in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The activation functions are assumed to be of further common descriptions, which take a broad view and recover many of those existing methods. A Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with triple-integral terms is addressed in this paper to condense conservatism in the synchronization of systems with additive time-varying delays. Jensen's inequality is applied in partitioning the double integral terms in the derivation of LMIs and then a new kind of linear combination of positive functions weighted by the inverses of squared convex parameters has emerged. Meanwhile, this paper puts forward a well-organized method to manipulate such a combination by extending the lower bound lemma. The obtained conditions not only have less conservatism but also less decision variables than existing results. Finally, numerical results and its simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed memristor-based synchronization control scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
