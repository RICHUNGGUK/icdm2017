In this way, the collapse buckling load was calculated in two steps: firstly a linear buckling was carried out and secondly, an initial imperfection was added to the geometrical model and the non-linear analysis was performed. Finally the results and conclusions reached in this work are shown. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
