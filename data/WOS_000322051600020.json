VISSIM microsimulation model is used for calibration done at the example of roundabouts in an urban area. The calibration method is based on the prediction of a neural network for one traffic indicator, i.e. for the traveling time between measuring points. Besides the traveling time, the calibration process further/also involves a comparison between the modeled and measured queue parameters at the entrance to the intersection. The process of validation includes an analysis of traveling time and queue parameters on new sets of data gathered both at the modeled and at a new roundabout. A comparison of the traffic indicators measured in the field and those simulated with the calibrated and uncalibrated microsimulation traffic model provides an insight into the performance of the calibration procedure.
