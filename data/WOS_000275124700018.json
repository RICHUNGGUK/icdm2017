The cognitive structure based on the clustering is visualized by the journal cross-citation network and three kinds of representative journals in each cluster among the communication network have been detected and analyzed. As an existing reference system the 15-field subject classification by Glanzel and Schubert (Scientometrics 56:55-73, 2003) has been compared with the clustering structure.", "paper_title": "Journal cross-citation analysis for validation and improvement of journal-based subject classification in bibliometric research", "paper_id": "WOS:000275124700018"}
