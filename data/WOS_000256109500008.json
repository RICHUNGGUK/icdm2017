We define guarded hybrid knowledge bases (or g-hybrid knowledge bases) as knowledge bases that consist of a Description Logic knowledge base and a guarded logic program, similar to the DL+log knowledge bases from Rosati (In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA, 2006, pp. 68 - 78.). g-Hybrid knowledge bases enable an integration of Description Logics and Logic Programming where, unlike in other approaches, variables in the rules of a guarded program do not need to appear in positive non-DL atoms of the body, i.e., DL atoms can act as guards as well. Decidability of satisfiability checking of g-hybrid knowledge bases is shown for the particular DL DLRO(-{<=}) which is close to OWL DL, by a reduction to guarded programs under the open answer set semantics. Moreover, we show 2-EXPTIME-completeness for satisfiability checking of such g-hybrid knowledge bases.", "paper_title": "Guarded hybrid knowledge bases", "paper_id": "WOS:000256109500008"}
