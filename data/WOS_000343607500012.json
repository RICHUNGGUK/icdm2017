Thus, how to obtain a certain Semantically Consistent Patterns (SCP) for cross-view data, which embeds the complementary information from different views, is of great importance for those applications. However, the heterogeneity among cross-view representations brings a significant challenge on mining the SCP. In this paper, we propose a general framework to discover the SCP for cross-view data. Specifically, aiming at building a feature-isomorphic space among different views, a novel Isomorphic Relevant Redundant Transformation (IRRT) is first proposed. The IRRT linearly maps multiple heterogeneous low-level feature spaces to a high-dimensional redundant feature-isomorphic one, which we name as mid-level space. Thus, much more complementary information from different views can be captured. Furthermore, to mine the semantic consistency among the isomorphic representations in the mid-level space, we propose a new Correlation-based Joint Feature Learning (CJFL) model to extract a unique high-level semantic subspace shared across the feature-isomorphic data. Consequently, the SCP for cross-view data can be obtained. Comprehensive experiments on three data sets demonstrate the advantages of our framework in classification and retrieval.", "paper_title": "Mining Semantically Consistent Patterns for Cross-View Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000343607500012"}
