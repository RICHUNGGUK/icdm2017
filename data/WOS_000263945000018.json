The core of the method relies on a similar approach to compare unordered [Kaizhong Zhang, A constrained edit distance between unordered labeled trees, Algorithmica 15 (1996) 205-222] and ordered trees [Kaizhong Zhang, Algorithms for the constrained editing distance between ordered labeled trees and related problems, Pattern Recognition 28 (3) (1995) 463-474]. The method is currently applied to evaluate the similarity between architectures of apple trees [Vincent Segura, Aida Ouangraoua, Pascal Ferraro, Evelyne Costes.
