Any conventional methods are not really suitable for the e-learning data. SNA requires content analysis, which involves human intervention and need to be carried out manually. Some of the previous clustering techniques need some centroid for the cluster initialization. Furthermore, the other researcher tried to apply ontology for the cluster on social network domain. This paper tries to reveal the behavior of students from all activities in Moodie e-learning system by putting ontology on domain social learning network (Moodie) which is not explored in the prior study. The activities such as forum, quiz, assignment, etc. are placed as clustering parameter according to the ontology model. The ontology of Moodie e-learning system is created to capture the activities of the student inside Moodie e-learning. Five meaningful attributes are used as group cluster for classifying the students' behaviour. According to the result, most of the students belong to the intentional group while some of the students belong to the constructive and active group. The constructed cluster is calculated based on the e-learning hits during the learning process inside Moodie e-learning. The result on the classification of students' behaviour using ontology cluster is comparable to their final achievement grade. It is believed that this study can bring immense benefit to the development of e-learning system in the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
