Considering both the success of protocol and the security of information, we first give a reasonable and significant description about the semi-honest model in quantum secure communications. Moreover, based on the feature of four-qubit cluster state which has the great robust against decoherence, we propose a new protocol for the quantum private comparison. Our protocol ingeniously utilizes the special symmetry of the four-qubit cluster state to enhance the efficiency of comparison. This new protocol is secure. The participants only know the result of comparison; cannot know each other's private information. TP cannot learn anything about the private information, even about the comparison result and the length of secret inputs.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT PROTOCOL FOR THE QUANTUM PRIVATE COMPARISON OF EQUALITY WITH A FOUR-QUBIT CLUSTER STATE", "paper_id": "WOS:000306837600009"}
