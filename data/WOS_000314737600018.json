As conventional Photovoltaic (PV) technology, suffers from variability in its production and needs models for determining the exact module performance. There are several problems when analyzing CPV systems performance with traditional techniques due to absence of standardization. In this sense it is remarkable the importance for the emerging CPV technology, of the existence of models which allow the prediction of modules performance from initial atmospheric conditions. In this paper, a CPV module is studied by means of atmospheric conditions obtained using an automatic test and measuring system developed by the authors. The characterization of the CPV module is carried out considering incident normal irradiance, ambient temperature, spectral irradiance distribution and wind speed. (CORBFN)-R-2, a cooperative-competitive algorithm for the design of radial basis neural networks, is adapted and applied to these data obtaining a model with a good level of accuracy on test data, improving the results obtained by other methods considered in the experimental comparison. These results are promising and the obtained model could be used to work out the maximum power at the CPV reporting conditions and to analyze the performance of the module under any conditions and at any moment.
