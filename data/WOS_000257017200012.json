The complex interaction between interface and turbulence is fully resolved. This two-way coupling phenomenon is found to be of great importance for the flow dynamic. An explicit filtering of the simulation has been employed to evaluate the order of magnitude of the specific subgrid contributions in the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) modelling case. Subgrid closure models are proposed and evaluated thanks to a priori tests. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
