Applications usually ask for not only exact matches between these two sets, but also approximate matches. In this paper, we investigate a one-dimensional approximate point set pattern matching problem proposed in [19]. We generalize the measure between approximate matches from L-1-norm to L-p-norm. More specifically, what requested is an optimal match which minimizes the L-p-norm of the difference vector (vertical bar P-2 - P-1 - (t(2)' - t(1)')vertical bar, vertical bar P-3 - P-2 - (t(3)' - t(2)')vertical bar,..., vertical bar P-m - Pm-1 - (t(m)' -t(m-1)')vertical bar), where p(1), P-2,..., P-m is the pattern and t(1)', t(2)',..., t(m)' is a subsequence of the text. For p -> infinity, we propose an O (mn)-time algorithm, where m and n denote the lengths of the pattern and the text, respectively. For arbitrary p < infinity, we propose an algorithm which runs in O (mnT (p)) time, where T(p) is the time of evaluating x(p) for x is an element of R. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
