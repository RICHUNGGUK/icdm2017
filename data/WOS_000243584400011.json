To perform the tomographic inversions, bh_tomo includes an implementation of the classical LSQR algorithm, as well as an implementation of the recent geostatistical inversion scheme developed at the Ecole Polytechnique of Montreal. One important motivation behind the development of bh_tomo was to ease the data processing sequence necessary to perform tomographic inversion of georadar amplitude data, especially when measured between many adjacent boreholes. The software package relies on a mini database and comprises interactive modules to manage, process and interpret the data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
