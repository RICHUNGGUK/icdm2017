The framework is based on 3-D image warping, especially suited to low-resolution screens and involves the transmission of sparse residual images. The use of an oversized reference image, superview, to cope with the visibility gap errors and the acceleration techniques aimed at improving the frame-rates are explored. It is shown that the described framework offers a potential alternative for interactive rendering of remote 3-D environment on low-powered clients where the triangle mesh display is impractical.", "paper_title": "A framework for remote rendering of 3-D scenes on limited mobile devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000236476300017"}
