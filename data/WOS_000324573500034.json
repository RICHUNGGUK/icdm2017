In this paper, a family of p-ary cyclic codes whose duals have three pairwise nonconjugate zeros is proposed. The weight distribution of this family of cyclic codes is determined. It turns out that the proposed cyclic codes have five nonzero weights.", "paper_title": "A Family of Five-Weight Cyclic Codes and Their Weight Enumerators", "paper_id": "WOS:000324573500034"}
