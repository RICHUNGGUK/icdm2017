It supports tests for comparing pairs of samples or samples organized into two or more treatment groups. Effect sizes and confidence intervals are provided to allow critical assessment of the biological relevancy of test results. A user-friendly graphical interface permits easy exploration of statistical results and generation of publication-quality plots.", "paper_title": "STAMP: statistical analysis of taxonomic and functional profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000344644600020"}
