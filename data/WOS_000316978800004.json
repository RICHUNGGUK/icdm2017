Images used as input for mesh generation are recorded with X-ray computed micro-tomography. Quality and contrast of the scanned images is such that fiber directions cannot be detected everywhere. To generate finite elements mesh that follow fiber directions it is suggested to interpolate available fiber slope data using radial basis functions and to create mesh nodes by integrating ordinary differential equations for fiber slopes. Examples demonstrate practical steps of detecting waviness from volume slice images and generation of meshes that model waviness defects with acceptable accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
