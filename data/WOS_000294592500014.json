Let F(n) denote the maximum number of distinct frames in a binary word of length n. We count this number for small values of n and show that F(n) is at most left perpendicularn/2right perpendicular 8 for all n and greater than 7n/30 - epsilon for any positive epsilon and infinitely many n. We also show that Fibonacci words, which are known to contain plenty of distinct squares, have only a few frames. Moreover, by modifying the Thue-Morse word, we prove that the minimum number of occurrences of frames in a word of length n is inverted right perpendicularn/2inverted left perpendicular - 2.
