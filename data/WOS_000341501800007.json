Indeed, unusual wafer measurements may reflect a wafer defect or a change in equipment conditions. Early detection of equipment condition changes assists the engineer with efficient maintenance. This study aims to develop hierarchical indices for equipment monitoring. For efficiency, only the highest level index is used for real-time monitoring. Once the index decreases, the engineers can use the drilled down indices to identify potential root causes. For validation, the proposed approach was tested in a leading semiconductor foundry in Taiwan. The results have shown that the proposed approach and associated indices can detect equipment condition changes after preventive maintenance efficiently and effectively.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical indices to detect equipment condition changes with high dimensional data for semiconductor manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800007"}
