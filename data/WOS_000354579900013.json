In the proposed method, an approximate approach is given to solve the first four statistical moments of the random responses of SBFEM. The probability density functions of the structural responses are calculated using the maximum entropy principle constrained by the calculated moments. The semi-analytical gradients of the responses with respect to the random variables are solved by developing an improved sensitivity analysis method of SBFEM. The proposed method is then applied to the structural reliability analysis and the probabilistic fracture mechanics analysis. Four numerical examples are investigated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
