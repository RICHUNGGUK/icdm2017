Firstly, the unified forms of PSI which the diverse implication operators can be employed are proposed. And the computational formulas for both fuzzy modus ponens (FMP) and fuzzy modus tollens (FMT) are obtained. Secondly, the unified forms of alpha-FSI method are established, and the formulas for a-FSI FMP and a-FSI FMT are obtained respectively. Furthermore, it is proved that FSI method possesses reversibility properties. The analysis of response ability of fuzzy systems constructed by FSI indicates that such fuzzy systems are universal approximators. Finally a simulation experiment shows the effectiveness of FSI method.", "paper_title": "Unified forms of fuzzy similarity inference method for fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000259152300015"}
