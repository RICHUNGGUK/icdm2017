This article introduces two emerging standards likely to shake the wireless world, namely IEEE 802.11ac and IEEE 802.11ad, and identifies the challenges in the path of multi-gigabit WiFi. We study the suitability of these standards for the new usage models enlisted in this article.", "paper_title": "WIFI ON STEROIDS: 802.11AC AND 802.11AD", "paper_id": "WOS:000330229100004"}
