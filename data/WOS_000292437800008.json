Since the sampling of a large ensemble of conformations is a prerequisite for the precise estimation of statistical quantities such as typical indicators for conformational transitions like the peak structure of the specific heat, the advantage of a strong increase in performance of Monte Carlo simulations cannot be overestimated. Employing multithreading and utilizing the massive power of the large number of cores on GPUs, being available in modern but standard graphics cards, we find a rapid increase in efficiency when porting parts of the code from the central processing unit (CPU) to the CPU.
