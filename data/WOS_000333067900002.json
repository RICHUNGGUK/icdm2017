For each measure these inequalities consist of the sharpest possible upper and lower bounds in terms of another measure. Some of these inequalities are already known, but new or more general proofs are given, whereas other inequalities are new. We also supply cases of equality to show that all inequalities are indeed the sharpest possible.", "paper_title": "COMPARISONS BETWEEN QUANTUM STATE DISTINGUISHABILITY MEASURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000333067900002"}
