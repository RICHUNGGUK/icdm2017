In this paper, we have investigated an ensemble of classifiers and tested it oil a real-world dataset. A genetic algorithm is applied to select the most relevant features. The obtained results are very encouraging, our results improve the average predictive accuracy obtained in previously published works. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
