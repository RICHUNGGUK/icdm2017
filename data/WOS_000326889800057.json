To do this, some experimental variables such as sintering conditions and silicon carbide volume fraction were optimized. In this study, several tests were conducted on the nano ceramic samples which prepared in different conditions to achieve the best fracture properties. The main concern is the properties which are important against projectile impacts. Flexural strength, fracture toughness, Vickers hardness, and energy dissipation factor for different samples were measured, and optimum sintering conditions were obtained.", "paper_title": "Optimization of fracture behavior of alumina/silicon carbide nano ceramic", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800057"}
