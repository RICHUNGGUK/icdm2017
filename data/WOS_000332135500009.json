Design/methodology/approach - The split step (SS) scheme is applied to factorize the conventional PITD calculation into two sub-steps procedures and then field components can be updated along one spatial direction only in each sub-step. The perfectly matched layer (PML) absorber is extended to this method for modeling open region problems by using the stretched coordinate approach. Findings - It is shown that this method requires less computation time and storage space in comparison with the conventional PITD method, yet maintains the numerical stability despite using large time steps. Research limitations/implications - The WE-PITD method requires the divergence free region, which may be a limit on its usage. Hence, there is a challenge of using this technique in the 3D problems. Originality/value - Based on the SS scheme, the PITD method is used to solve the scale wave equation rather than Maxwell's equations, leading to a significant reduction in the computation time and memory usage.", "paper_title": "A split-step-scheme-based precise integration time domain method for solving wave equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000332135500009"}
