Moreover, the service implementation, feedback data service procedure and its processing service model are explored. Based on the software with independent intellectual property rights, image city of Taizhou is developed as an example to realize various image data and processing services. Lastly, the bright future prospects of image city are described.", "paper_title": "Image City sharing platform and its typical applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000293188100017"}
