The set of variables of F will be denoted by V(F). Let B (F) denote the bipartite graph with partite sets V(F) and F and with an edge between vaV(F) and caF if vac or . The matching number nu(F) of F is the size of a maximum matching in B (F) . In our main result, we prove that the following parameterization of MaxSat (denoted by (nu(F)+k)-SAT) is fixed-parameter tractable: Given a formula F, decide whether we can satisfy at least nu(F)+k clauses in F, where k is the parameter. A formula F is called variable-matched if nu(F)=|V(F)|. Let delta(F)=|F|-|V(F)| and delta (au)(F)=max (F'aS dagger F) delta(F'). Our main result implies fixed-parameter tractability of MaxSat parameterized by delta(F) for variable-matched formulas F; this complements related results of Kullmann (IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity, pp. 116-124, 2000) and Szeider (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 69(4):656-674, 2004) for MaxSat parameterized by delta (au)(F). To obtain our main result, we reduce (nu(F)+k)-SAT into the following parameterization of the Hitting Set problem (denoted by (m-k)-Hitting Set): given a collection of m subsets of a ground set U of n elements, decide whether there is XaS dagger U such that Ca (c) X not equal a... for each and |X|a parts per thousand currency signm-k, where k is the parameter. Gutin, Jones and Yeo (Theor. Comput. Sci. 412(41):5744-5751, 2011) proved that (m-k)-Hitting Set is fixed-parameter tractable by obtaining an exponential kernel for the problem. We obtain two algorithms for (m-k)-Hitting Set: a deterministic algorithm of runtime and a randomized algorithm of expected runtime . Our deterministic algorithm improves an algorithm that follows from the kernelization result of Gutin, Jones and Yeo (Theor. Comput. Sci. 412(41):5744-5751, 2011).", "paper_title": "Fixed-Parameter Tractability of Satisfying Beyond the Number of Variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000330969900009"}
