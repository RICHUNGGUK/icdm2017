The same procedure calculates the corresponding derivative with respect to the hydrogen ion. The procedure is useful for generalising the pH calculation for any pH-dependent model with reduction of the model stiffness. It is also found to be useful to calculate total alkalinity and to simulate titration experiments for a solution with known buffer composition. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
