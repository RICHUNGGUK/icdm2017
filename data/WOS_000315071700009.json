However, MBRs are subject to fouling, which is the phenomenon whereby foulants absorb or deposit on the membrane. After long-term operation of MBRs under a condition of constant-rate filtration, transmembrane pressure (TMP) increases rapidly. This TMP jump is one factor making the operation of MBRs difficult. We therefore propose the construction of a model that predicts the timing of a TMP jump. First, a nonlinear function for determining whether a TMP jump will happen was derived from physical knowledge. We then analyzed the nonlinear function statistically with measurement data and constructed a model that detects a TMP jump. The performance of the proposed method was confirmed through the analyses of two data sets obtained from the literature and a data set recorded for a real industrial MBR plant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
