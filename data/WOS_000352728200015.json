A mobile social network plays an essential role as the spread of information and influence in the form of \"word-of-mouth\". It is a fundamental issue to find a subset of influential individuals in a mobile social network such that targeting them initially (e.g., to adopt a new product) will maximize the spread of the influence (further adoptions of the new product). The problem of finding the most influential nodes is unfortunately NP-hard. It has been shown that a Greedy algorithm with provable approximation guarantees can give good approximation; However, it is computationally expensive, if not prohibitive, to run the greedy algorithm on a large mobile social network. In this paper, a divide-and-conquer strategy with parallel computing mechanism has been adopted. We first propose an algorithm called Community-based Greedy algorithm for mining top-K influential nodes. It encompasses two components: dividing the large-scale mobile social network into several communities by taking into account information diffusion and selecting communities to find influential nodes by a dynamic programming. Then, to further improve the performance, we parallelize the influence propagation based on communities and consider the influence propagation crossing communities. Also, we give precision analysis to show approximation guarantees of our models. Experiments on real large-scale mobile social networks show that the proposed methods are much faster than previous algorithms, meanwhile, with high accuracy.", "paper_title": "Influence Maximization on Large-Scale Mobile Social Network: A Divide-and-Conquer Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000352728200015"}
