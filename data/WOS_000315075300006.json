The goal of the learner is to minimize his total cumulative loss. We make progress toward the classification of these games based on their minimax expected regret. Namely, we classify almost all games with two outcomes and a finite number of actions: we show that their minimax expected regret is either zero, (Theta) over tilde(root T), Theta(T-2/3), or Theta(T), and we give a simple and efficiently computable classification of these four classes of games. Our hope is that the result can serve as a stepping stone toward classifying all finite partial-monitoring games. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
