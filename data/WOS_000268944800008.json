On the one hand, by reducing the peak-to-average power ratio of multicarrier signals using the well-known clipping technique, it is possible to perform a more efficient PA amplification. On the other hand, nonlinear and linear distortion introduced by the PA operating close to saturation is compensated by the baseband adaptive DPD linearizer. The DPD has to counteract not only the PA nonlinear behavior, but also its dynamics. A test-bench implementing a WiMAX transmitter was deployed to evaluate the possibilities for enhancing power efficiency while fulfilling the demanded linearity requirements. Experimental results showing the power efficiency and linearity enhancement achieved by the proposed strategy are provided. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
