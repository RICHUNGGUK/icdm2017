Because DRAM cells lose stored charge over time due to leakage, they have to be \"refreshed\" in a periodic manner to retain the stored information. This refresh activity is a source of increased energy consumption as the DRAM density grows. It also incurs nontrivial performance loss due to the unavailability of memory arrays during refresh. This paper first presents a comprehensive measurement-based characterization study of the cell-level data retention behavior of modern low-power DRAM chips. About 99.7% of the cells could retain the stored information for longer than 1 s at a high temperature. This average cell retention behavior strongly indicates that we can deeply reduce the energy and performance penalty of DRAM refreshing with proper system support. The second part of this paper, accordingly, develops two practical techniques to reduce the frequency of DRAM refresh operations by excluding a few leaky memory cells from use and by skipping refreshing of unused DRAM regions. We have implemented the proposed techniques completely in the Linux OS for experimentation, and measured performance improvement of up to 17.2% with the refresh operation reduction of 93.8% on smartphone like low-power platforms.", "paper_title": "Refresh Now and Then", "paper_id": "WOS:000344990300018"}
