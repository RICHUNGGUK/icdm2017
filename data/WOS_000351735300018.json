We show that, in pure coherent optical networks, the planning strategy that best supports the dynamic evolution of the network is the design aimed at BER minimization. A closed-form formula for the maximum reach (in terms of number of spans and loss budget) of each interface is analytically derived, which is a useful tool for the evaluation of the overall network cost for a desired traffic capacity.", "paper_title": "Network Planning Strategies for Next-Generation Flexible Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351735300018"}
