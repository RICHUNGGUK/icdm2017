Thus, we analyze the energy consumption of sensor networks as a function of the number of cluster heads considering the above two options, multihop-based communication and the case where a neighbor node is in the transmission range for communicating data. This helps us to elect the number of energy-efficient cluster heads in a more practical manner. Also, we determine the effect of electing the number of cluster heads by restricting the local cluster size.", "paper_title": "Multihop-Based Optimal Cluster Heads Numbers Considering Relay Node in Transmission Range of Sensor Nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319573200001"}
