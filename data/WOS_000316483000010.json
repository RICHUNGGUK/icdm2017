Instead of classifying video data to a specific access category in 802.11e network, our proposed adaptive cross-layer scheme makes use of the hierarchy characteristic of video stream, dynamically maps video data to the appropriate access categories according to both the significance of the different video frames and the network traffic load. The significance passes from the application layer to the media access layer through a cross-layer architecture. In order to prevent the network congestion and keep the high transmission quality, the proposed algorithm adopts bi-directional floating mapping algorithm and congestion awareness mechanism based on the queue length and frame types. The mapping parameters are updated according to the network condition in time. Our simulation results indicate: the proposed method (a) improves the video transmission quality; (b) optimizes the management and utilization of queue resources; and (c) yields superior performance (under different loads) over 802.11e, static mapping and adaptive mapping schemes.", "paper_title": "PABM-EDCF: parameter adaptive bi-directional mapping mechanism for video transmission over WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000316483000010"}
