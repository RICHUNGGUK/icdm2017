How to select an appropriate structure is a key problem in DAG-SVM. In this paper, the classification bias of DAG-SVM was first discussed, and then the concept of misclassification cost was introduced in structure selection for DAG-SVM. Based on the principle of Misclassification Cost Minimization, a structure selection method for DAG-SVM was proposed to minimize the risk of total misclassification cost. The proposed method was tested on several benchmark data sets, and the results indicated that MCM-based selecting method for DAG-SVM obtained satisfactory results.", "paper_title": "STRUCTURE SELECTION FOR DAG-SVM BASED ON MISCLASSIFICATION COST MINIMIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500003"}
