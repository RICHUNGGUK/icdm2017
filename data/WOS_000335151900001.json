Our main contribution is a new achievability scheme which we call Aligned Network Diagonalization. This scheme allows the data streams transmitted by the sources to undergo a diagonal linear transformation from the sources to the destinations, thus being received free of interference by their intended destination. In addition, we extend our scheme to multihop networks with fully connected hops, and multihop networks with MIMO nodes, for which the degrees of freedom are also fully characterized.", "paper_title": "Degrees of Freedom of Two-Hop Wireless Networks: Everyone Gets the Entire Cake", "paper_id": "WOS:000335151900001"}
