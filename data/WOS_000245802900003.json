With this intention docking calculations and MD simulations were performed. Docking results indicated that the (S)-enantiomers establish several electrostatic interactions with SerB1, SerB386 and ArgB263 of PGA. Conversely, the absence of specific polar interactions between the (R)-enantiomers and ArgB263 seems to be the main reason for the different binding affinities observed between the two enantiomers. Results of molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that polar interactions are responsible for both the ligand affinity and PGA enantiospecificity. Modeling calculations provided possible explanations for the observed enantioselectivity of the enzyme that rationalize available experimental data and could be the basis for future protein engineering efforts.
