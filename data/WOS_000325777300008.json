A hierarchy of image partitions is created on the basis of a function that merges spatially connected regions according to primary perceptual criteria. Likewise, a global function that measures the goodness of each defined partition is used to choose the best low-level perceptual grouping in the hierarchy. Contributions also include a comparative study with five unsupervised colour image segmentation techniques. These techniques have been frequently used as a reference in other comparisons. The results obtained by each method have been systematically evaluated using four well-known unsupervised measures for judging the segmentation quality. Our methodology has globally shown the best performance, obtaining better results in three out of four of these segmentation quality measures. Experiments will also show that our proposal finds low-level perceptual solutions that are highly correlated with the ones provided by humans.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised colour image segmentation by low-level perceptual grouping", "paper_id": "WOS:000325777300008"}
