The user sketches directly onto the surface of 3D virtual human from arbitrary viewing directions, and the 3D garment suited to the virtual human can be created automatically. First, a distance field based allocation algorithm is proposed to find the 3D point which has the shortest given distance to the virtual human along the view direction. Then, the 3D style lines are generated by transforming from the 2D strokes on the human model and all the garment pieces are recognized from the 3D style lines. Finally, the 3D garment model is constructed by using the angle and offset based interpolation and Delaunay triangulation. In addition, we propose a body feature based template reusing method to fit the 3D garment to different virtual human models. The method can be adapted to designer habits and improve the usefulness of garment design. Examples show that the method is useful and efficient.", "paper_title": "Sketch based garment modeling on an arbitrary view of a 3D virtual human model", "paper_id": "WOS:000288124000003"}
