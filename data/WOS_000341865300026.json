The nature of the chemical bonding in cerussite is analyzed by means of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and the analysis of the electron localization function (ELF). A long C-C attractive interaction (3.077 angstrom) along the c axis of the cerussite structure is evidenced by the presence of bond critical points between the C atoms of the CO32- molecular groups. It is proposed that the Pb-O interactions, which are mostly ionic in nature, disturb the structure of the CO32- molecular groups and promote their interaction along the c axis. The importance of this long-range interaction in the high-pressure crystal chemistry of carbonate minerals and in the explanation of some crystal growth features observed for orthorhombic carbonates is also discussed in this work.", "paper_title": "Evidence of a long C-C attractive interaction in cerussite mineral: QTAIM and ELF analyses", "paper_id": "WOS:000341865300026"}
