An evolutionary optimization methodology is developed to synthesize decision support systems for providing both crisp-logic and fuzzy-logic production control for the assembly line. The performance of such decision support systems is compared with that of the system originally implemented by the manufacturer. it is thus demonstrated that the proposed evolutionary methodology is effective in synthesizing decision support systems for both crisp-logic and fuzzy-logic control of the semiconductor packaging assembly production. It indicates that the proposed methodology can also synthesize decision support systems for productivity improvement in other complex manufacturing environment. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
