This formula can be utilized to construct an efficient interpolation based erasure-only decoder with time complexity O(n(2)) and space complexity O(n). Specifically, the decoding algorithm requires 3kr + r(2) - 2r field additions, kr + r(2) + r field negations, 2kr + r(2) - r + k field multiplications and kr + r field inversions. Compared to another interpolation based erasure-only decoding algorithm derived by D.J.J. Versfeld et al., our algorithm is much more efficient for high-rate Reed-Solomon codes.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Interpolation Based Erasure-Only Decoder for High-Rate Reed-Solomon Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000304572900016"}
