Many of these models are living material objects; e.g. embryonic stem cells. The rise of systems biology has spurred pioneering efforts to mathematically model stem cell phenomena. This paper examines the emerging interface of these two approaches, and its epistemological significance. I argue that mathematical modelling has a crucial but limited role in stem cell biology today. The argument has three parts. First, I set out the central problem of stem cell biology, and indicate the variety and roles of models involved. Second, I show how mathematical modelling can be integrated into the mainstream of stem cell research, using a simple, non-mathematical model to coordinate the two approaches. Third, I argue that stem cell experiments and mathematical systems models must collaborate to explain cell development. Though the two are complementary, their partnership is not equal. Though mathematical modelling has a crucial role to play, material models remain at the centre of stem cell biology.", "paper_title": "Materia mathematica: models in stem cell biology", "paper_id": "WOS:000308435300004"}
