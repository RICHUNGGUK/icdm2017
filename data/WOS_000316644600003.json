A modified recurrent high order neural network (RHONN) structure is used to identify the plant model and based on this model, a discrete-time control law is derived, which combines block control and sliding mode technique. The neural network learning is performed on-line by Kalman filtering. The local controllers for each joint use only local angular position and velocity measurements. The proposed control scheme is implemented in real-time. The experimental results for trajectory tracking show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "REAL-TIME DECENTRALIZED NEURAL CONTROL FOR A FIVE DOF REDUNDANT ROBOT", "paper_id": "WOS:000316644600003"}
