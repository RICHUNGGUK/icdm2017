The work flow of the system is based on three main steps: An initial foreground detection performs a simple segmentation via Gaussian pixel color modeling and shadows removal. Next, a tracking step uses the foreground segmentation for identifying the objects, and tracks them using a modified mean shift algorithm. At the end, an enhanced foreground segmentation step is formulated into a Bayesian framework. For this aim, foreground and shadow candidates are used to construct probabilistic foreground and shadow models. The Bayesian framework combines a pixel-wise color background model with spatial-color models for the foreground and shadows. The final classification is performed using the graph-cut algorithm. The tracking step allows a correct updating of the probabilistic models, achieving a foreground segmentation that reduces the false negative and false positive detections, and obtaining a robust segmentation and tracking of each object of the scene.
