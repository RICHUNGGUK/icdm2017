This is in contrast to all previously studied covering games, where the price of anarchy grows linearly with the size of the game. Both the game design and the price of anarchy results are based on structural properties of the linear programming relaxations. For linear costs we also exhibit simple best response dynamics that converge to Nash equilibria in linear time.", "paper_title": "LP-Based Covering Games with Low Price of Anarchy", "paper_id": "WOS:000358741300009"}
