We show that the variance of the intervals between receiving wakeup slots affects the expected sleep latency: when the variance of the intervals is low (high), the expected latency is low (high). We therefore propose a novel scheduling scheme that uses the bit-reversal permutation sequence (BRPS) - a finite integer sequence that positions receiving wakeup slots as evenly as possible to reduce the expected sleep latency. At the same time, the sequence serves as a compact representation of wakeup schedules thereby reducing storage and communication overhead. But while low latency wakeup schedule can reduce per-hop delay in ideal conditions, it does not necessarily lead to low latency end-to-end paths because wireless link quality also plays a significant role in the performance of packet forwarding. We therefore formulate expected transmission delay (ETD), a metric that simultaneously considers sleep latency and wireless link quality. We show that the metric is left-monotonic and left-isotonic, proving that its use in distributed algorithms such as the distributed Bellman-Ford yields consistent, loop-free and optimal paths. We perform extensive simulations using real-world energy harvesting traces to evaluate the performance of the scheduling and forwarding scheme. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
