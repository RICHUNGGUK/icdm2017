The students were provided with a toolkit implemented in Matlab. Part of the course requirements was that they should outperform given baseline methods. The results were beyond expectations: the student matched or exceeded the performance of the best challenge entries and achieved very effective feature selection with simple methods. We make available to the community the results of this experiment and the corresponding teaching material [Anon. Feature extraction course, ETH WS 2005/2006. http:// clopinet.com/isabelle/Projects/ETH]. These results also provide a new baseline for researchers in feature selection. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
