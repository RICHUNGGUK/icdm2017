The distributed routing protocol computing model is one of the most difficult challenges on the router control plane. This paper studies the route processing model of BGP, which has been deployed in backbone widely. A tree-based distributed computing model is discovered, based on the inherent parallel features of BGP. The model is described in two structures for two different system configurations. And the related algorithms are given. The performance promotion is analyzed theoretically. Finally, the promotion is proved by experiments.", "paper_title": "A tree-based distributed model for BGP route processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300013"}
