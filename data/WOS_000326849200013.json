Computations were performed for some of the low energy conformations at the HF, B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, M06, M06L, M062x, M06HF and MP2 levels. The computations were also performed using the DFT-D3 method along with the TPSS and PBE functionals. The study predicted a new C-2 conformation as the ground state conformation of 18t6. This new C-2 conformation is more stable than the experimentally known solid state conformation by 4.7 kcal/mol at the MP2/6-311G** level. This conformation has all of the SCCS dihedral angles adopt exodentate structure. However, the experimentally known conformation of the solid phase has two of the SCCS dihedral angles violating this exodentate rule. It was concluded that for 18t6 stability a linear dihedral SCCS angle requirement is more important than a gauche CSCC dihedral angle requirement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
