The analysis shows that the linearized Bregman method has the exact regularization property; namely, it converges to an exact solution of the basis pursuit problem whenever its smooth parameter a is greater than a certain value. The analysis is based on showing that the linearized Bregman algorithm is equivalent to gradient descent applied to a certain dual formulation. This result motivates generalizations of the algorithm enabling the use of gradient-based optimization techniques such as line search, Barzilai-Borwein, limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS), nonlinear conjugate gradient, and Nesterov's methods. In the numerical simulations, the two proposed implementations, one using Barzilai-Borwein steps with nonmonotone line search and the other using L-BFGS, gave more accurate solutions in much shorter times than the basic implementation of the linearized Bregman method with a so-called kicking technique.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Generalizations of the Linearized Bregman Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000285501700007"}
