A detailed theoretical or numerical analysis of the MLPs is difficult due to the non-integrability of the traditional log-sigmoid activation function which leads to difficulties in obtaining the averaged learning equations (ALEs). In this paper, the error function is suggested as the activation function of the MLPs. By solving the explicit expressions of two important expectations, we obtain the averaged learning equations which make it possible for further analysis of the learning dynamics in MLPs. The simulation results also indicate that the ALEs play a significant role in investigating the singular behaviors of MLPs.", "paper_title": "Averaged learning equations of error-function-based multilayer perceptrons", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700029"}
