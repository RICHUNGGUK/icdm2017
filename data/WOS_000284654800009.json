Supply chain management (SCM) is the major weapon for firm's competition. e-SCM implementation is the key to the success in SCM practice. Innovation diffusion theory (IDT) with multi-stage analysis provides insight into the complicated process. Several key external antecedents affect the rate of e-SCM diffusion, in particular, technological and collaborative structures. Little research on IOS has discussed the performance impacts from the diffusion perspective among trading partners. Studies on IT performance have been traditionally focused on financial performance and inconclusive in their results. This study thus considers both financial and non-financial performances in a complementary manner. Grounding on IDT and relevant theories, this study proposes a novel research model for the relationships among external antecedents, stage-based e-SCM diffusion, and firm performance. Empirical findings have concluded the relative effects of external antecedents on diffusion stages and in turn, firm performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
