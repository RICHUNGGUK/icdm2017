Clients can outsource their database to a server with full confidentiality and data access privacy, and, for data retention, the server ensures client access WORM semantics. In general simple confidentiality and WORM assurances are easily achievable, e.g., via an encrypted outsourced data repository with server-enforced read-only access to existing records (albeit encrypted). However, this becomes hard when also access privacy is to be ensured-when client access patterns are necessarily hidden and the server cannot enforce access control directly. WORM-ORAM overcomes this by deploying a set of zero-knowledge proofs to convince the server that all stages of the protocol are WORM-compliant.", "paper_title": "Write-Once Read-Many Oblivious RAM", "paper_id": "WOS:000297344200018"}
