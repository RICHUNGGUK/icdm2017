An isothermal circular particle for a particle to fluid density ratio rho(r) = rho(p)/rho(f) = of 1.00232 where rho(p) and rho(f) denote the particle and the fluid densities, respectively, was considered. Numerical simulations were carried out using the direct forcing/fictitious domain (DF/FD) method to investigate the solid motion in a fluid with a Prandtl number of 0.7 for different Grashof numbers ranging from 0 to 50. Under the conditions of the present problem, the particle motion is mainly governed by the thermal convection between the side walls of the channel and the particle, and by the wall confinement. The results of the present study indicate that three regimes of particle behavior can be identified in the present range of Grashof numbers regardless of the cold and hot thermal boundary conditions of the particle. In the first regime, the particle exhibits steady settling behavior; in the second regime, it undergoes a transient overshoot before the steady settling; in the third regime, the particle motion is submerged in the thermal levitation.
