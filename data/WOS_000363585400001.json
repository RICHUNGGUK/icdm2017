These components hide the heterogeneity of the devices interfaces and provide developers with a simple and homogeneous way to interoperate with these digital peripherals. The use of this approach also allows reducing risks and development efforts.", "paper_title": "A Model-Driven Approach for Wearable Systems Developments", "paper_id": "WOS:000363585400001"}
