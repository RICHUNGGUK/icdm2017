In this paper, we proposed a novel framework that integrates testing and prediction process for unit testing prediction. Because high fault prone metrical data are much scattered and multi-centers can represent the whole dataset better, we used artificial immune network (aiNet) algorithm to extract and simplify data from the modules that have been tested, then generated multi-centers for each network by Hierarchical Clustering. The proposed framework acquires information along with the testing process timely and adjusts the network generated by aiNet algorithm dynamically. Experimental results show that higher accuracy can be obtained by using the proposed framework.", "paper_title": "Software Fault Estimation Framework based on aiNet", "paper_id": "WOS:000342309300010"}
