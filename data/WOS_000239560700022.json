It is based on a dense disparity image obtained by a process of window correlation. To each image in the sequence a geometrical rectification process is applied, which is essential to remove the conical perspective of the images obtained with a photographic camera. This process corrects the errors in coordinates x and y to obtain a better matching for the map information. The mapping method is an application of the geometrical rectification and the 3D reconstruction, whose main purpose is to obtain a realistic appearance of the scene.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional mapping from stereo images with geometrical rectification", "paper_id": "WOS:000239560700022"}
