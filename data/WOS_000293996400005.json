Assuming numerical methods where the global error possesses an asymptotic expansion and a periodic flow with the period depending smoothly on the starting point, some conditions that ensure an asymptotically linear growth of the error with the number of periods are given. A study of the error growth of first integrals is also carried out. The error behaviour of Runge-Kutta methods implemented with fixed or variable step size with a smooth step size function, with a projection technique on the invariants of the problem is considered.
