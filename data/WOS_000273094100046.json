In this paper, we presents a fingerprint classification algorithm that uses Adaboost learning method to model multiple types of singularity features. Firstly, complex filters are used to detect the singularities. For powerful representation, we compute the complex filter responses of the detected singularities at multiple scales and a feature vector is constructed for each scale that consists of the relative position and direction and the certainties of the singularities. Adaboost learning method is then applied on decision trees to design a classifier for fingerprint classification. Finally, fingerprint class is determined by the ensemble of the classification results at multiple scales. The experimental results and comparisons on NIST-4 database have shown the effectiveness and superiority of the fingerprint classification algorithm. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
