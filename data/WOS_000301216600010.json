In addition, it is applicable to the time-window constrained variant of these problems. Using the iterated local search framework, the heuristic combines tabu search with a simple perturbation mechanism to ensure a broad exploration of the search space. We also describe a parallel implementation of the heuristic to take advantage of multiple-core processors. Extensive computational results show that the proposed heuristic outperforms tabu search alone and is competitive with recent heuristics designed for each particular problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
