Researchers may resort to expensive solutions such as cluster hardware for large analysis tasks. Graphics processing units (GPUs) provide an inexpensive and computationally powerful alternative. Using R and the CUDA toolkit from Nvidia, we have implemented several functions commonly used in microarray gene expression analysis for GPU-equipped computers. Results: R users can take advantage of the better performance provided by an Nvidia GPU.", "paper_title": "The gputools package enables GPU computing in R", "paper_id": "WOS:000273116100023"}
