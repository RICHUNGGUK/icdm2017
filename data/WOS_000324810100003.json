Two jute fiber reinforced concretes, called jute fiber reinforced normal strength concrete (JFRNSC) and jute fiber-reinforced high-fluidity concrete (JFRHFC), were tested in compression, flexure and splitting tension. Compressive, flexural and splitting tensile strengths of specimens were investigated to four levels of jute fiber contents by volume fraction. From the test results, Jute fiber can be successfully used for normal strength concrete (NSC) and high-fluidity concrete (HFC). Particularly, HFC with jute fibers shows relatively higher improvement of strength property than that of normal strength concrete.", "paper_title": "Mechanical properties of natural fiber-reinforced normal strength and high-fluidity concretes", "paper_id": "WOS:000324810100003"}
