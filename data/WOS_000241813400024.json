The main novelty of the language we call MOB, is the integration of the service-oriented and mobile agent paradigms. MOB is also encoded onto a process calculus with a well studied semantics. The encoding provides a specification for the front-end of the language compiler and allows us to use, for the back-end and for the run-time system, a compiler and a virtual machine previously developed for the process calculus.", "paper_title": "A mobile agent service-oriented scripting language encoded on a process calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000241813400024"}
