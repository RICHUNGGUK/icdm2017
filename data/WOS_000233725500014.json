In this work, QNNs and FFNNs were trained to classify short segments of epileptic seizures in neonatal EEG. The experiments revealed significant differences between the internal representations created by trained QNNs and FFNNs from sample information provided by the training data. The results of this experimental study also confirmed that the responses of trained QNNs are more reliable indicators of uncertainty in the input data compared with the responses of trained FFNNs.", "paper_title": "An evaluation of quantum neural networks in the detection of epileptic seizures in the neonatal electroencephalogram", "paper_id": "WOS:000233725500014"}
