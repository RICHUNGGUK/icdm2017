The principal characteristics of the scheme are solution of the trajectory equations for advection, explicit first order approximation of physically insignificant adjustment terms and implicit time splitting discretization of the principal physical modes. This approach allows the use of large time steps, keeps practically the second order of accuracy and requires at each time step the amount of calculations proportional to the number of spatial grid points. The performed numerical experiments show computational efficiency of the proposed scheme and accuracy of the predicted atmospheric fields.", "paper_title": "Semi-Lagrangian scale selective two-time-level scheme for hydrostatic atmospheric model", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200034"}
