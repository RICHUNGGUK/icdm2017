Moreover, we combine with the dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and dynamic power management (DPM). We present a static low power sporadic tasks scheduling algorithm (SSTLPSA), assuming that each task presents its worst-case work-load to the processor at every instance. In addition, a more energy efficient approach called a dynamic low power sporadic tasks scheduling algorithm (DSTLPSA) is proposed, based on reclaiming the dynamic slack and adjusting the speed of other tasks on-the-fly in order to reduce energy consumption while still meeting the deadlines. The experimental results show that the SSTLPSA algorithm consumes 26.55-38.67% less energy than that of the RM algorithm and the DSTLPSA algorithm reduces the energy consumption up to 18.38-30.51% over the existing DVS algorithm.
