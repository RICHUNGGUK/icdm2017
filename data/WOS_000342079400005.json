SC pipeline architecture is used followed by an output driver. For GHz frequency operation with output voltage swing suitable for wireless applications (300 mV(pp)) the DAC performance is shown to be limited by the clock feed-through and settling effects in the SC array rather than by the capacitor mismatch or kT/C noise, which appear negligible in this application. While it is possible to design a highly linear output driver with HD3 < -70 dB and HD2 < -90 dB over 0.5-5 GHz band as we show, the maximum SFDR of the SC DAC is 45 dB with 8-bit resolution and Nyquist sampling of 3 GHz. The capacitor array is designed based on the DAC design area defined in terms of the switch size and unit capacitance value. A tradeoff between the DAC bandwidth and resolution accompanied by SFDR is demonstrated. High linearity of the output driver is attained by a combination of two techniques, the derivative superposition (DS) and resistive source degeneration. In simulations the complete DAC achieves SFDR of 45 dB with 8-bit resolution for signal bandwidth 1.36 GHz with Nyquist sampling. With 6-bit and 5.5 GHz bandwidth 33 dB SFDR is attained. The total power consumption of the SC DAC is 90 mW with 1.2 V supply and clock frequency of 3 GHz.", "paper_title": "Design and analysis of high speed capacitive pipeline DACs", "paper_id": "WOS:000342079400005"}
