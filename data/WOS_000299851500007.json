We call such monoids centralizing monoids. In this paper we study the first interesting case of a 3-element set A. In the lattice of inclusion-ordered centralizing monoids we find three maximal centralizing monoids. This knowledge suggests that many large monoids are not centralizing monoids.", "paper_title": "Some Centralizing Monoids on a Three-Element Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000299851500007"}
