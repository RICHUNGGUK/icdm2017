But traditional mobility management schemes have hardly taken this issue into account. Distributed mobility management is considered as a new trend for developing a mobility management scheme to address such an issue. This paper proposes D-PMIPv6, which is to achieve a distributed mobility management scheme supported by data and control plane separation based on PMIPv6. In the architecture of D-PMIPv6, the traditional functional entity Local mobility anchor (LMA) is split into two parts: Control plane LMA and Data plane LMA. We conclude with the three goals of distributed mobility management. With its elaborate design, D-PMIPv6 is proved to achieve these goals. Numerical results show that a single Control plane LMA can hold quite a number of MNs and the handover performance of D-PMIPv6 is acceptable compared to PMIPv6. Meanwhile, D-PMIPv6 can improve the performance in terms of the packet delivery cost compared to other mobility management schemes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
