Assuming the number of fibers in each link is fixed, we study two optimization problems. One is to minimize the number of colors for coloring P. The other is to color as many paths of P as possible with a given number of colors. We show that both the minimization and the maximization problems are NP-hard in star networks with a uniform odd number of fibers. We give polynomial time optimal algorithms for the minimization and maximization problems in star networks with an even number of fibers and in the generalized star networks with a uniform even number of fibers. We also give a 1.58-approximation algorithm for the maximization problem in the generalized star networks with an arbitrary number of fibers. The algorithms for the maximization problem in the generalized stars are based on our newly developed algorithm, which optimally solves the call control problem in the generalized star networks. The call control algorithm is of independent interest. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
