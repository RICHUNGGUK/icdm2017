To process them with binary or multiclass classifiers, methods for transforming multilabel data sets (MLDs) have been proposed, as well as adapted algorithms able to work with this type of data sets. However, until now, few studies have addressed the problem of how to deal with MLDs having a large number of labels. This characteristic can be defined as high dimensionality in the label space (output attributes), in contrast to the traditional high dimensionality problem, which is usually focused on the feature space (by means of feature selection) or sample space (by means of instance selection). The purpose of this paper is to analyze dimensionality in the label space in MLDs, and to present a transformation methodology based on the use of association rules to discover label dependencies. These dependencies are used to reduce the label space, to ease the work of any MLC algorithm, and to infer the deleted labels in a final postprocessing stage. The proposed process is validated in an extensive experimentation with several MLDs and classification algorithms, resulting in a statistically significant improvement of performance in some cases, as will be shown.", "paper_title": "LI-MLC: A Label Inference Methodology for Addressing High Dimensionality in the Label Space for Multilabel Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000343704900009"}
