Based on the symplecticness, symmetry, and exponential fitting properties, three new four-stage RK integrators, either with fixed- or variable-nodes, are constructed. The algebraic order of the new integrators is also studied, showing that they possess eighth-order of accuracy as the classical four-stage RK Gauss method. Numerical experiments with some oscillatory test problems are presented to show that the new methods are more efficient than other symplectic four-stage eighth-order RK Gauss codes proposed in the scientific literature.
