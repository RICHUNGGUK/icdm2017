[A.K. Kapila, R. Menikoff, J.B. Bdzil, S.F. Son, D.S. Stewart, Two-phase modeling of deflagration-to-detonation transition in granular materials: reduced equations, Physics of Fluids 13(10) (2001) 3002-3024] is examined. This model has shown excellent capabilities for the numerical resolution of interfaces separating compressible fluids as well as wave propagation in compressible mixtures [A. Murrone, H. Guillard, A five equation reduced model for compressible two phase flow problems, journal of Computational Physics 202(2) (2005) 664-698; R. Abgrall, V. Perrier, Asymptotic expansion of a multiscale numerical scheme for compressible multiphase flows, SIAM Journal of Multiscale and Modeling and Simulation (5) (2006) 84-115; F. Petitpas, E.

The artificial heat exchange for multiphase shocks, journal of Computational Physics 225(2) (2007) 2214-2248]. However, its numerical approximation poses some serious difficulties. Among them, the non-monotonic behavior of the sound speed causes inaccuracies in wave's transmission across interfaces. Moreover, volume fraction variation across acoustic waves results in difficulties for the Riemann problem resolution, and in particular for the derivation of approximate solvers. Volume fraction positivity in the presence of shocks or strong expansion waves is another issue resulting in lack of robustness. To circumvent these difficulties, the pressure equilibrium assumption is relaxed and a pressure non-equilibrium model is developed. It results in a single velocity, non-conservative hyperbolic model with two energy equations involving relaxation terms. It fulfills the equation of state and energy conservation on both sides of interfaces and guarantees correct transmission of shocks across them. This formulation considerably simplifies numerical resolution. Following a strategy developed previously for another flow model [R. Saurel, R. Abgrall, A multiphase Godunov method for multifluid and multiphase flows, journal of Computational Physics 150 (1999) 425-467], the hyperbolic part is first solved without relaxation terms with a simple, fast and robust algorithm, valid for unstructured meshes. Second, stiff relaxation terms are solved with a Newton method that also guarantees positivity and robustness. The algorithm and model are compared to exact solutions of the Euler equations as well as solutions of the five-equation model under extreme flow conditions, for interface computation and cavitating flows involving dynamics appearance of interfaces. In order to deal with correct dynamic of shock waves propagating through multiphase mixtures, the artificial heat exchange method of Petitpas et al. [F. Petitpas, E. Franquet, R. Saurel, O. Le Metayer, A relaxation-projection method for compressible flows. Part II. The artificial heat exchange for multiphase shocks, journal of Computational Physics 225(2) (2007) 2214-2248] is adapted to the present formulation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
