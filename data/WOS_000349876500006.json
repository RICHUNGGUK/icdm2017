It accesses publicly available traffic and meteorological datasets, and is optimized for use on community-sized areas (100-1000 km(2)). The user is not required to provide input data, but can provide their own if desired. C-LINE is a modeling and visualization system that access inputs, performs calculations, visualizes results, provides options to manipulate input variables, and performs basic data analysis. C-LINE was applied to an area in Detroit, Michigan to demonstrate its use in an urban environment. It was developed in ArcGIS, but a prototype web version is in development for wide-scale use. C-LINE is not intended for regulatory applications. Its local-scale focus and ability to quickly (run time <5 min) compare different roadway pollution scenarios supports community-based applications and help to identify areas for further research.
