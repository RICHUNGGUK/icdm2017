Current available sample size software, such as PROS POWER in SAS, survival Analysis module in PASS, powerSurvEpi package in R are all based on the standard proportional hazards (PH) model which is not appropriate to design a clinical trial with cure fractions. Instead of the standard PH model, the PH mixture cure model is an important tool in handling the survival data with possible cure fractions. However, there are no tools available that can help design a trial with cure fractions. Therefore, we develop an R package NPHMC to determine the sample size needed for such study design.
