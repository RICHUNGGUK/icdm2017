The geometrical and process parameters (i.e., offset position, pin diameter, offset angle, and solder temperature) were optimized by using response surface methodology via central composite design for the wave soldering process. Thermal fluid-structure interaction aspects were considered in the optimization. A mesh-based parallel code-coupling interface was employed to connect both fluid and structural solvers. The interactive relationship between independent variables (i.e., offset position, pin diameter, offset angle, and solder temperature) and the responses (i.e., filling time at 75% volume, von Mises stress, and maximum displacement) were investigated. The generated empirical models were examined and well substantiated by the simulation results. The optimum geometrical and process parameters of the wave soldering process for the PCB and PTH connector were as follows: 0.12 mm of PTH offset position, 0.17 mm of PTH diameter, 0 degrees of offset angle, and 473 K of molten solder temperature.
