With the help of an XML-Schema-Definition (XSD) a specification description language called Analog Specification Description in XML (ASDeX) is introduced. An ASDeX-file contains not only specification parameters but also measurement definitions and testbenches to enable specification validation based on simulation. The intention is to generate executable modules (tasks) for running simulations and extracting and checking the actual property values of analog circuits. The task generation is based on a generic template approach using a Meta-Simulator to achieve vendor independent analog IP representation including IP verification.", "paper_title": "ASDeX: a formal specification for analog circuit enabling a full automated design validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000353217000006"}
