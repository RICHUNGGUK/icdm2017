This parameter is usually determined through a laboratory UCS test. Since the preparation of high-quality samples is difficult, expensive and time consuming for laboratory tests, development of predictive models for determining the mechanical properties of rocks seems to be essential in rock engineering. In this study, an attempt was made to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) and multivariable regression analysis (MVRA) models in order to predict UCS of rock surrounding a roadway. For this, a database of laboratory tests was prepared, which includes rock type, Schmidt hardness, density and porosity as input parameters and UCS as output parameter. To make a database (including 93 datasets), different rock samples, ranging from weak to very strong types, are used. To compare the performance of developed models, determination coefficient (R (2)), variance account for (VAF), mean absolute error (E (a)) and mean relative error (E (r)) indices between predicted and measured values were calculated. Based on this comparison, it was concluded that performance of the ANN model is considerably better than the MVRA model. Further, a sensitivity analysis shows that rock density and Schmidt hardness were recognized as the most effective parameters, whereas porosity was considered as the least effective input parameter on the ANN model output (UCS) in this study.", "paper_title": "Prediction of unconfined compressive strength of rock surrounding a roadway using artificial neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000322139500015"}
