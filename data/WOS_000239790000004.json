An exception differs from the rest of data and thus is interesting and can be a clue for further discoveries. We classify methods into exception instance discovery, exception rule discovery, and exception structured-rules discovery and give a condensed and comprehensive introduction.", "paper_title": "Data mining methods for discovering interesting exceptions from an unsupervised table", "paper_id": "WOS:000239790000004"}
