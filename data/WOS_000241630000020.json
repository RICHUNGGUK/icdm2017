In the first phase of the E-CARES reengineering project, we regarded the architecture modeling and the reverse engineering of telecommunication systems. Current work concerns the restructuring of such systems including their re-design and re-implementation. The aim is to provide concepts, languages, methods, and tools to improve the architecture and the real-time performance of the software system. Our reengineering prototype is based on a graph rewriting system by which the underlying application logic is generated.", "paper_title": "E-CARES project: Reengineering of telecommunication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630000020"}
