A mixed strategy, integrating several mutation operators into a single algorithm, can overcome this problem. Inspired by evolutionary game theory, this paper presents a mixed strategy evolutionary programming algorithm that employs the Gaussian, Cauchy, Levy, and single-point mutation operators. The novel algorithm is tested on a set of 22 benchmark problems. The results show that the mixed strategy performs equally well or better than the best of the four pure strategies does, for all of the benchmark problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
