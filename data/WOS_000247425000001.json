The steady, 3-dimensional flow is examined at different aspect (height-to-radius) ratios and Reynolds numbers. The LBE simulations are carried out using the multiple-relaxation-time method. The LBE simulation results are compared with the results of a finite volume solution of Navier-Stokes equations and with published experimental data. Numerical results are presented for cylindrical cavities with two aspect ratios of 1.5 and 2.5, and three Reynolds numbers of 990, 1010 and 1290. Effects of the aspect ratio and Reynolds number on the size, position and breakdown of the central recirculation bubble, together with the flow pattern in the cavity, are determined. Detailed topological features of the flow, such as, (1) structure and breakdown of the vortex along the axis, (2) azimuthal component of vorticity, and (3) circulation strength of flow about the axis are investigated and compared with previous findings from experiments and theory. The predicted results from LBE simulations are consistent with experiments and theory. Steady results reveal the occurrence of a breakdown bubble in agreement with the regime diagram due to Escudier. The vortex breakdown around a region may be characterized by a change in sign of the azimuthal vorticity near such locations. Investigations are carried out on the characteristics of angular momentum when the vortex breakdown occurs. The theoretical criterion for vortex breakdown to occur, as proposed by Brown and Lopez is verified using the numerical data obtained from the simulations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
