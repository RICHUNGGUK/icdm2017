We assume that for each (1, k) is an element of {1, 2}, Y-lk is an observation of the source X-0, having the form Y-lk = XO Nlk, where N-lk is a Gaussian random variable independent of X0. We further assume that N-lk, (1, k) E {1,2}2 are independent. In this system two correlated Gaussian observations are separately compressed by two encoders and sent to the information processing center. We study the remote source coding problem where the decoder at the center attempts to reconstruct the remote source Xo. The determination problem of the rate distortion region for this communication system can be regarded as an extension of the Gaussian CEO problem to the case of vector observations. For each vector observation we can obtain an estimation on X-0 from this observation. Those estimations are sufficient statistics on X-0. Using those sufficient statistics, we determine the rate distortion region by showing that it coincides with the rate distortion region of the CEO problem where the scalar observations of X-0 are equal to the estimations computed from the vector observations. We further extend the result to the case of L terminal and general vector observations.", "paper_title": "Gaussian CEO Problem in the Case of Scalar Source and Vector Observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000367096000002"}
