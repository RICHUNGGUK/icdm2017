The proposed routing approach can extend the system lifetime of the network. A new routing decision index is also proposed for the route selection mechanism, which takes both the shortest-path and the maximum system lifetime into consideration and dynamically adjusts its weight between them according to the energy usage of the network. Experiment results show that, the proposed routing protocol provides a higher performance than other well-known power-aware routing protocols in terms of the energy-efficiency.", "paper_title": "A power-aware routing protocol using multi-route transmission for mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000055"}
