The facets of low-dimensional (n <= 3) edge-concave aggregations dominating the termwise relaxation of MIQCQP are introduced at every node of a branch-and-bound tree. Concave multivariable terms and sparsely distributed bilinear terms that do not participate in connected edge-concave aggregations are addressed through piecewise-linear relaxations. Extensive computational studies are presented for point packing problems, standard and generalized pooling problems, and examples from GLOBALLib (Meeraus, Globallib. http://www.gamsworld.org/global/globallib.htm).", "paper_title": "Global optimization of mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic programs (MIQCQP) through piecewise-linear and edge-concave relaxations", "paper_id": "WOS:000311675300008"}
