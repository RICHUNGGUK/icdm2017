We assume that K nearest neighbors satisfy the color line model that RGB distribution of the neighbors is roughly linear and combine this assumption with the local color line model that RGB distribution of local neighbors is roughly linear. Our assumptions are appropriate for various regions such as those that are smooth, contain holes or have complex color. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms previous propagation-based matting methods. Further, it is competitive with sampling-based matting methods that require complex sampling or learning methods.", "paper_title": "Local and Nonlocal Color Line Models for Image Matting", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738800021"}
