We used Simulated Annealing ( SA) and Tabu Search ( TS) with Neighborhood Search ( NS) based on the structure of the problem. We also used a modified SA algorithm, which gives better results than the traditional SA and developed an effective heuristic for the problem: Squeaky Wheel Optimization ( SWO) hybrid with TS. Experimental results average 2.52% from the lower bound and are within acceptable timescales improving current best results for the problem.", "paper_title": "Minimizing the makespan for unrelated parallel machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000251008500001"}
