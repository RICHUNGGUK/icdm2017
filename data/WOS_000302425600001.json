Given a positive integer n and oracle access to a distance metric on {1, 2,..., n}, we study the problem of finding a 1-median. In particular, we show the nonexistence of (1) deterministic O(1)-approximation o(n)-query algorithms, (2) deterministic (2 - Omega(1))-approximation o(n(2))-query algorithms for graph metrics, (3) deterministic (3 - Omega(1))-approximation o(n(2))-query algorithms and (4) Monte-Carlo (2 - Omega(1))-approximation o(n)-query algorithms with an Omega(1) probability of success. We also show a Monte-Carlo (2 + epsilon)-approximation O((log(2)(1/epsilon))/epsilon(3))-query algorithm with a 1 - O(epsilon) probability of success, where epsilon is an element of (0. 1).
