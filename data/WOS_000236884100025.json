Pie framework allows that services specify their functionality, as well as their QoS requirements in the form of real-time characteristics. The framework supports static composition; all services required to create an application have to be discovered before launching the whole application. To show the validity and feasibility of this framework, it has been implemented using Java technology.", "paper_title": "CoSeRT: A framework for composing service-based real-time applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100025"}
