No similarity measure performs the best for all tasks, genres, or music formats. It is not even easy to formalize human perception of music similarity. A number of papers in the literature deal with the development of appropriate similarity measures. In this paper, we pose the problem under a different perspective, showing that a careful combination of different measures through an ensemble of classifiers performs in a more robust way than any of the particular measures involved, when they are applied as stand-alone measures. The task posed here is the retrieval of a music work from a repository, given a polyphonic score as a query. For the experiments, five state-of-the-art polyphonic similarity measures and three different corpora of polyphonic music scores have been tested.", "paper_title": "Polyphonic Music Retrieval with Classifier Ensembles", "paper_id": "WOS:000299783600003"}
