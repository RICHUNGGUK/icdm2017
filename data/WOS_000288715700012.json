H. Li, F. G. Deng and H. Y. Zhou, Phys. Rev. A 78 (2008) 022321], we proposed two efficient fault-tolerant quantum secret sharing schemes over two collective-noise channels, in which the sharers can establish a key with the sender only if all the sharers collaborate together. Noiseless subspaces are composed of two Bell states based on the hypothesis of collective noise and the spatial degree of freedom is introduced to insure the security. Although entangled states are used to encode the key bits, the sharers are only required to perform single-particle product operations or single-particle product measurement, making the schemes convenient with current technique. As there is no basis mismatch during the measurement, almost all of the samples can be used to share the key.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT FAULT-TOLERANT QUANTUM SECRET SHARING OVER TWO COLLECTIVE-NOISE CHANNELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288715700012"}
