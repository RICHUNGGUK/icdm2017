The alternative expression for M-1 (G) is Sigma(u is an element of v(G)) (d(G)(u)) + d(G)(v)). Very recently, Eliasi, Iranmanesh and Gutman [7] introduced a new graphical invariant variant Pi(1)* (G) = Pi(uv is an element of E(G)) (d(G)(u)) + d(G)(v)) as the multiplicative version of M-1. Here we call this new index the multiplicative sum Zagreb index. We characterize the trees, unicylcic, and bicyclic graphs extremal (maximal and minimal) with respect to the multiplicative sum Zagreb index. Moreover, we use a method different but shorter than that in [7] for determining the minimal multiplicative sum Zagreb index of trees.", "paper_title": "Trees, Unicyclic, and Bicyclic Graphs Extremal with Respect to Multiplicative Sum Zagreb Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000307149200018"}
