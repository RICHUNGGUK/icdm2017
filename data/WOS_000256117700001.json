Decentralized databases are, however, not new. Whereas a definition for a P2P databasesystem can be readily provided, a comparison with the more established decentralized models, commonly referred to as distributed, federated and multi-databases, is more likely to provide a better insight to this new P2P data management technology. Thus, in the paper, by distinguishing between db-centric and P2P-centric features, we examine features common to these database systems as well as other ad-hoc features that solely characterize P2P databases. We also provide a non-exhaustive taxonomy of the most prominent research efforts toward the realization of full-fledged P2P databases.", "paper_title": "Distributed databases and peer-to-peer databases: Past and present", "paper_id": "WOS:000256117700001"}
