We propose a physically-based approach to model the explosion event and the process of terrain fragmentation resulting in the formation of craters. Since blast waves are the destructive components of explosions, and propagate into materials as stress waves, geology has been introduced into the terrain model. Our methodology is based on voxel modeling and introduces a new method that uses connected fragments to model terrain with the geology. We have used mathematical and visual data from a real explosion experiment in a layered terrain to validate our model. Using our model, explosions can be placed anywhere in the simulation and will result in a realistic output in real time.", "paper_title": "Real time physically-based Modeling and simulation of cratering and fragmentation of terrain", "paper_id": "WOS:000254817700004"}
