The rapid evolution of sequencing technology, coupled with its broad adoption across biology and medicine, necessitates fast, collaborative interdisciplinary discussion. SEQanswers provides a real-time knowledge-sharing resource to address this need, covering experimental and computational aspects of sequencing and sequence analysis. Developers of popular analysis tools are among the >4000 active members, and similar to 40 peer-reviewed publications have referenced SEQanswers.", "paper_title": "SEQanswers: an open access community for collaboratively decoding genomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000303338200012"}
