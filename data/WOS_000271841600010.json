This work introduces a rigorous and practical approach for automatic N-RoSy field design on arbitrary surfaces with user-defined field topologies. The user has full control of the number, positions, and indexes of the singularities (as long as they are compatible with necessary global constraints), the turning numbers of the loops, and is able to edit the field interactively. We formulate N-RoSy field construction as designing a Riemannian metric such that the holonomy along any loop is compatible with the local symmetry of N-RoSy fields. We prove the compatibility condition using discrete parallel transport. The complexity of N-RoSy field design is caused by curvatures. In our work, we propose to simplify the Riemannian metric to make it flat almost everywhere. This approach greatly simplifies the process and improves the flexibility such that it can design N-RoSy fields with single singularity and mixed-RoSy fields. This approach can also be generalized to construct regular remeshing on surfaces. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply our design system to pen-and-ink sketching and geometry remeshing. Furthermore, based on our remeshing results with high global symmetry, we generate Celtic knots on surfaces directly.", "paper_title": "Metric-Driven RoSy Field Design and Remeshing", "paper_id": "WOS:000271841600010"}
