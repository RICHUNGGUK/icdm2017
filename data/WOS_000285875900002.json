We show that weighted tree automata and a syntactically restricted weighted MSO-logic have the same expressive power in case the semiring is commutative or in case we deal only with ranked trees, but, surprisingly, not in general. This demonstrates a crucial difference between the theories of ranked trees and unranked trees in the weighted case.", "paper_title": "Weighted Logics for Unranked Tree Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000285875900002"}
