It is the equivalent of Hotelling's T-2 distribution for the empirical likelihood and is used to calibrate the empirical log-likelihood ratio for finite sample situations. We discuss various aspects of the E distribution, in particular, the estimation of critical values of the E distribution using quantiles of large random samples. We also present tables of estimated critical values for E distributions with 1 to 3 first degrees of freedom.", "paper_title": "E distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000242208900003"}
