A robust unsupervised spectral mapping method is extended to a semi-supervised situation. Our proposed algorithm is derived by linearization of this nonlinear semi-supervised mapping method. Experiments using the proposed method for some public benchmark data reveal that our method outperforms a supervised algorithm using the linear discriminant analysis for the iris and wine data and is also more accurate than a semi-supervised algorithm of the logistic GRF for the ionosphere dataset.", "paper_title": "Semi-supervised classification with spectral subspace projection of data", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703600045"}
