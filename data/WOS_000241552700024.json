Typically, the effectiveness of a new algorithm is demonstrated only by the presentation of a few segmented images that axe evaluated by some method, or it is otherwise left to subjective evaluation by the reader. We propose a new approach for evaluation of segmentation that takes into account not only the accuracy of the boundary localization of the created segments but also the under-segmentation and over-segmentation effects, regardless to the number of regions in each partition. In addition, it takes into account the way humans perceive visual information. This new metric can be applied both to automatically provide a ranking among different segmentation algorithms and to find an optimal set of input parameters of a given algorithm.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700024"}
