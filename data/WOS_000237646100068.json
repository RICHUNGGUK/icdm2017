In this paper we propose a new QoS-aware fair queueing model for ad hoc networks. Our proposed algorithm ensures a distributed coordination of fair channel access while maximize the throughput using spatial reuse of bandwidth. We consider the presence of both guaranteed and best effort flows. The goal is to satisfy the minimum bandwidth requirement of guaranteed flows and provide a fair share of residual bandwidth to all flows. We propose a flow weight calculation scheme to both guaranteed and best-effort flows and a distributed, localized mechanism to implement the time-stamp based ad hoc fair queueing model.", "paper_title": "Distributed coordination and QoS-aware fair queueing in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100068"}
