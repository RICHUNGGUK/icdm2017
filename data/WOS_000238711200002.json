Our LIFFDFS can overcome the common static mapping drawback of conventional fuzzy systems. We also give a detailed description of its underlying principle and general structure. Next, based on the gradient descent method, an adaptive learning algorithm for the feedforward parameters is derived. The proposed LIFFDFS is further employed in the prediction of time series. The well-known Box-Jenkins gas furnace data are used here as an evaluation example. Simulation results demonstrate that this new dynamical fuzzy system has the advantage of inherent dynamics and is, therefore, well suited for handling temporal problems, such as process modeling and control.", "paper_title": "Linguistic information feedforward-based dynamical fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238711200002"}
