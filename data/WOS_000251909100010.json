Therefore, for the optimization of the MPSoC interconnect, the designer must develop traffic models that realistically capture the application behavior as executing on the IP core. In this paper, we introduce a Reactive IP Emulator (RIPE) that. enables an effective emulation of the IP-core behavior in multiple environments, including bit-and cycle-true simulation. The RIPE is built as a multithreaded abstract instruction-set processor, and it can generate reactive traffic patterns. We compare the RIPE models with cycle-true functional simulation of complex application behavior (task-synchronization, multitasking, and input/output operations). Our results demonstrate high-accuracy and significant speedups. Furthermore, via a case study, we show the potential use of the RIPE in a design-space-exploration context.", "paper_title": "A reactive and cycle-true IP emulator for MPSoC exploration", "paper_id": "WOS:000251909100010"}
