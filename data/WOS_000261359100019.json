The proposed technique is organized in a two-step manner. At both steps, histograms are fully utilized for high computational efficiency. At the first step, a histogram of pixel feature values is utilized to detect pairs of pixels with the same rare feature values as candidates of corresponding pixel pairs. At the second step, a histogram of transformation parameter values is utilized to determine the most reliable transformation parameter value. Experimental results showed that the proposed technique can provide reasonable mosaicing results in most cases with very feasible computations.", "paper_title": "Fast Image Mosaicing Based on Histograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000261359100019"}
