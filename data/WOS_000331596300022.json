Such images are very popular, and we first recover an approximate geometric model with the prior knowledge of the latent cuboid. While this approximated cuboid structure does not provide an accurate scene reconstruction, we demonstrate that it is sufficient to re-render the images realistically under new viewpoints in a nearly geometrically accurate manner. The new image with high visual quality is generated by making the rest image region deform in accordance with the re-projected cuboid structure, via a triangular mesh deformation scheme. The energy function has been carefully designed to be a quadratic function so that it can be efficiently minimized via solving a sparse linear system. We verify the effectiveness of our technique through testing images with standard and non-standard cuboid structures, and demonstrate an application of upright adjustment of photographs and a user interface which enables the user to watch the scene under new viewpoints on a viewing sphere interactively.
