The model takes into account the main concerns in load management, considering three objective functions: minimization of the peak demand as perceived by the distribution network dispatch center, maximization of the utility profit associated with the energy services delivered by the controlled loads and minimization of the discomfort caused to consumers. The problem was analyzed using an interactive reference point method for multiobjective integer (and mixed-integer) linear programming. This approach exploits the use of the branch-and-bound algorithm for solving the reference point scalarizing programs through which efficient solutions are computed. Post-optimality techniques enable a stability analysis of the efficient solutions by means of computing and displaying graphically sets of reference points that correspond to the same solution.
