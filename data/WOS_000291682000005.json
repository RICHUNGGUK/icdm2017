BRICK exploits statistical multiplexing by randomly bundling counters into small fixed-size buckets and supports dynamic sizing of counters by employing an innovative indexing scheme called rank indexing. Experiments with Internet traces show that our solution can indeed maintain large arrays of exact active statistics counters with moderate amounts of SRAM.", "paper_title": "BRICK: A Novel Exact Active Statistics Counter Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000291682000005"}
