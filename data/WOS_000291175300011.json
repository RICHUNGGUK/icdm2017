However, new dynamic spectrum capabilities allow the recapture of this wastage. This work describes the creation of a virtual wireless network (VWN). Taking an approach based on cognitive radio techniques, the VWN allows new network services to be deployed utilizing only residual resources, while preserving the service to primary users. A Markov chain-based analysis is performed, and is used along with discrete event simulations to demonstrate the VWN as a management tool for supporting new services within the existing system.
