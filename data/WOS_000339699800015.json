We parameterized these three models with identical data from different regions of the world; one region undergoing extensive agricultural expansion (East Africa), another region where forests are re-growing (Muskegon River Watershed in the United States), and a third region where urbanization is prominent (South-Eastern Wisconsin in the United States). Independent training data and testing data were used to train and calibrate each model, respectively. Comparisons of simulated maps from the three kinds of land use change patterns were made using conventional goodness-of-fit metrics in land use change science. The results of temporal and spatial comparison of the data mining models show that the artificial neural network outperformed all other models in a short-time interval (East Africa; 5 years) and for coarse resolution data (East Africa; 1 km); however, the three data mining models obtained similar accuracies in a long-time interval (Muskegon River Watershed; 20 years) and for fine resolution data with large numbers of cells (Muskegon River Watershed; 30 m). Furthermore, the results showed that the probability of agriculture gain was more likely in locations closer to towns and large cities in East Africa, urbanization was more likely in locations closer to roads and urban areas in South-Eastern Wisconsin and the probability of forest gain was more likely in locations closer to the forest and shrub land cover and farther away from roads in Muskegon River Watershed.
