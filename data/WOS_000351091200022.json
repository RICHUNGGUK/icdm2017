This paper proposes a dual-channel phonoangiography (PCG) with fractional-order features to estimate the residual of stenosis estimation of arteriovenous shunt. The auscultation technique provides a noninvasive tool to monitor the degrees of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs). Then, support methods, such as the Burg autoregressive (AR) method and self-synchronization error formulation (SSEF), are used to extract fractional-order features between the loop site (L-site) and venous anastomosis site (V-site). Using 2-D patterns (nonlinear mapping), a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) is designed as a nonlinear estimate model to indicate the outcome of surgical revision or AVG stenosis upon routine monthly examinations. For 42 long-term follow-up patients, the results of examination show the proposed GRNN-based screening model efficiently estimates residual stenosis.", "paper_title": "Residual Stenosis Estimation of Arteriovenous Grafts Using a Dual-Channel Phonoangiography With Fractional-Order Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000351091200022"}
