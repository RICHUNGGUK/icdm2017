The reactivity and regioselectivity of these reactions were predicted by analysis of the energies, geometries, and electronic nature of the transition state structures. The theoretical results revealed that the reaction features a tandem process: an ionic 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to produce the cycloadducts 3 H-pyrazolium salts 3 followed by a [1,2]-shift affording the thermodynamically more stable adducts 4 or 5. The mechanism of the cycloaddition reactions can be described as an asynchronous concerted pathway with reverse electron demand. The model reaction has also been investigated at the QCISD/6-31++G(d,p) and CCSD(T)/6-31++G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) levels as well as by the DFT. The polarizable continuum model, at the B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory, was used to study solvent effects on all the studied reactions. In solvent dichloromethane, all the initial cycloadducts 3 were obtained via direct ionic process as the result of the solvent effect. The consecutive [1,2]-shift reaction, in which intermediates 3 are rearranged to the five-membered heterocycles 4/5, is proved to be a kinetically controlled reaction, and the regioselectivity can be modulated by varying the migrant. The LOL function and RDG function based on localized electron analysis were used to analysis the covalent bond and noncovalent interactions in order to unravel the mechanism of the title reactions.", "paper_title": "A DFT study on the mechanisms for the cycloaddition reactions between 1-aza-2-azoniaallene cations and acetylenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000313077100007"}
