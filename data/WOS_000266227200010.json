The poroelastic half-plane is based on Biot's dynamic theory, and the governing equations are solved by reduction to three Helmholtz equations. The lining structure can be treated as an elastic material and decoupled into two Helmholtz equations. Here, the large circle assumption is applied to simulate the half-plane boundary. By using appropriate boundary conditions and continuity conditions, the unknown coefficients in the potentials can be determined. Selected numerical results are presented in this paper.
