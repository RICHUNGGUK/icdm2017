For this problem, we consider two variants, connectivity preserving minimum node cut (CPMNC) and connectivity preserving minimum edge cut (CPMEC). For CPMNC, we show that it cannot be approximated within a logn for some constant a unless P = NP. and cannot be approximated within any poly(logn) unless NP has quasi-polynomial time algorithms. The hardness results hold even for graphs with unit weight and bipartite graphs. For CPMEC, we show that it is in P for planar graphs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
