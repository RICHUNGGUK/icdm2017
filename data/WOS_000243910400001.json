The generating method and design patterns were evaluated during a project to integrate the product models collected from three different precast concrete companies in the United States, testing the new method of product model generation. The application results indicate that the 12 design patterns are effective and sufficient for resolving most known schema conflicts and for integrating and normalizing multiple product models into a single well-formed product model.", "paper_title": "Twelve design patterns for integrating and normalizing product model schemas", "paper_id": "WOS:000243910400001"}
