Quality-of-Service (QoS), the fundamental aspect of web service has thus attracted numerous attention in industry and academia. The study on sufficient QoS data keeps advancing the state in Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) area. To collect a large amount of resource in practice, QoS prediction applications are designed and built. Nevertheless, how to generate accurate results in high productivity is still a main challenge to existing frameworks. In this paper, we propose LoNMF, a Local Neighborhood Matrix Factorization application that incorporates domain knowledge in modern Artificial Intelligence (Al) technique to tackle this challenge. LoNMF first proposes a two-level selection mechanism that can identify a set of highly relevant local neighbors for target user. And then, it integrates the geographical information to build up an extended Matrix Factorization (MF) approach for personalized QoS prediction. Finally, it iteratively generates results by utilizing hints from previous round computations, a gradient boosting strategy that directly accelerates solving process. Experimental evidence on large-scale real-world QoS data shows that LoNMF is scalable, and consistently outperforming other state-of-the-art applications in prediction accuracy and efficiency.
