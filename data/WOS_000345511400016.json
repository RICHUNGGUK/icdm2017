For finite blocklength codes, the backoff from the channel capacity is inversely proportional to the square root of the blocklength. In this paper, it is shown that the codes achieving this tradeoff must necessarily have peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) proportional to logarithm of the blocklength. This is extended to codes approaching capacity slower, and to PAPR measured at the output of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulator. As a by-product, the convergence of (Smith's) amplitude-constrained AWGN capacity to Shannon's classical formula is characterized in the regime of large amplitudes. This converse-type result builds upon recent contributions in the study of empirical output distributions of good channel codes.", "paper_title": "Peak-to-Average Power Ratio of Good Codes for Gaussian Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000345511400016"}
