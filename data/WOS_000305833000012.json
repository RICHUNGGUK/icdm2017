This paper analyses design and performance considerations and factors that affect the performance of the SAPV such as PV sizing, the effect of shadowing, temperature, and dust, and shows how these can lead to reduction in power output of the SAPV and cause a permanent progressive degradation of the PV cells and the entire PV generator. The need for standardized maintenance procedures and remote monitoring and inspection is highlighted, and a careful design phase is promoted for SAPV systems to remain a preferred power alternative for telecommunication applications.", "paper_title": "Design and performance considerations in stand alone PV powered Telecommunication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000305833000012"}
