Reliability and deployment cost are important and are largely determined by network topology. In fact, adding redundant network components increases the reliability of a network, but also increases the cost substantially. Usually, network performance and reliability are considered separately. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on ear decomposition for constructing reliable WMN infrastructure that resists the failure of a single mesh node and ensures full coverage to all Mesh Clients (MCs). Via a case study, we show the tight relationship between network deployment cost, performance and reliability in a simultaneous optimization in terms of cost and traffic load balancing over network channels. The proposed multi-objective optimization model is solved using meta-heuristics which provides the network operator with a set of reliable tradeoff solutions.
