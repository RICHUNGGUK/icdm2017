The system segments continuous motion sequences into gestures, which it then documents in a personalized annotation with an intuitive hierarchical representation. Initial testing suggests that software based on this technique could be an effective teaching aid for dance and sports.", "paper_title": "Documenting motion sequences with a personalized annotation system", "paper_id": "WOS:000234490000009"}
