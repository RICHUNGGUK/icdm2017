However, manufacturing firms are reluctant to modify the layout as it leads to operation disruption and excess rearrangement cost. In this paper, we present an alternative approach for designing a multi-period layout (i.e., distributed layout) that maintains a tradeoff between re-layout cost and cost of excess material handling. Obtaining an optimal solution to distributed layout problem is generally a difficult task, owing to larger size of quadratic assignment problem. In order to overcome the aforementioned drawback, a meta-heuristic, named 'CSO-DLP' (Clonal Symbiotic Operated-Distributed Layout Planning) is developed for designing a distributed layout that jointly determines the arrangement of department and flow allocation among them. It inherits its trait from Symbiotic algorithm and Clonal algorithm. In addition to these; the concept of 'forecast window' is used, which evaluates the layout for varying number of periods at a given time. The proposed meta-heuristic is applied on a benchmark dataset and the effect of system parameters, such as rearrangement cost, department disintegration, and duplication are investigated and benchmarked in this paper.
