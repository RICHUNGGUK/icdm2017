In our context best and worst equilibria are those with minimum respectively maximum makespan. On series-parallel graphs a worst Nash equilibrium Call be found by a Greedy approach while finding a best equilibrium is NP-hard. For a fixed number of users we give a pseudo-polynomial algorithm to find the best equilibrium in series-parallel networks. For general network topologies also finding a worst equilibrium is NP-hard.
