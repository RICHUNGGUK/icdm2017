First, via system transformation, the optimal tracking problem is converted into designing an optimal regulator for the tracking error dynamics. And then, with convergence analysis in terms of value function and control policy, the iterative adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is introduced to obtain the infinite-horizon optimal tracking controller which makes the value function close to its optimal value function. Next, two neural networks are used as parametric structures to implement the ADP algorithm, which aim at approximating the value function and the control policy, respectively. Finally, a simulation example is included to complement the theoretical discussions.", "paper_title": "Optimal tracking control of a class of nonlinear discrete-time switched systems using adaptive dynamic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000331638400005"}
