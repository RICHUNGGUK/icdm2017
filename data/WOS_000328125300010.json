But what about their updating? How to deal with non-perfect synchrony? Novel definitions of asynchronism are proposed that respect the specific hypotheses of lattice-gas models. These definitions are then applied to a swarming rule in order to explore the robustness of the global emergent behaviour. In particular, we compare the synchronous and asynchronous case, and remark that a paradoxical phenomenon, the anti-alignment of particles, is no longer observed when a small but not infinitesimal amount of asynchronism is added.", "paper_title": "First steps on asynchronous lattice-gas models with an application to a swarming rule", "paper_id": "WOS:000328125300010"}
