The combinations of input alphabet, input distribution, and binary labeling that achieve the Shannon limit are completely characterized. The main conclusion is that a BICM system with probabilistic shaping achieves the Shannon limit at low SNR if and only if it can be represented as a zero-mean linear projection of a hypercube. Hence, probabilistic shaping offers no extra degrees of freedom to optimize the low-SNR BICM-GMI, in addition to what is provided by geometrical shaping. The analytical conclusions are confirmed by numerical results, which also show that for a fixed input alphabet, probabilistic shaping can improve the BICM-GMI in the low and medium SNR range.", "paper_title": "Signal Shaping for BICM at Low SNR", "paper_id": "WOS:000316407900030"}
