We point out that the roles of controllers in two recent works(16,17) can be excluded due to their design. We also give a revised CQSDC protocol such that their original advantages are retained and the complete CQSDC can be realized. We then analyze the roles of the controllers in different CQSDC protocols with different purposes and these protocols' applicabilities.", "paper_title": "Perfect controlled quantum secure direct communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000257540500005"}
