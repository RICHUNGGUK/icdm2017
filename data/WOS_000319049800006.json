It has been shown that some of the previous known difference schemes can be derived from our schemes if we suitably choose the spline parameters. By Fourier method, we prove that one class of difference scheme is unconditionally stable and convergent, the other is conditionally stable and convergent. Finally, some numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed difference schemes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
