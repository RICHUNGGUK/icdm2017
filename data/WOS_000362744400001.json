In particular, dynamic access control is a central problem where context always changes because of volatile ubiquitous sensors. The use of context is important in USN. In this paper, we focus on the context-driven privacy protection model. In context-based access control research, the access permission technique that uses context is being intensely investigated because of the ease with which various dynamic access permissions can be assigned in accordance with the various changes in context. A key feature of this approach is dynamic access control. Therefore, we propose a model for privacy preservation that is context-based dynamic access control that uses intuitive 5W1H for USN. According to this model, the access control strategy can be determined dynamically based on context elements and subject attributes, in addition to objects and operations, using access control entities; therefore, it is relatively easy to infer the dynamic access control of context expressivity both accurately and efficiently.", "paper_title": "CBDAC: Context-Based Dynamic Access Control Model Using Intuitive 5W1H for Ubiquitous Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000362744400001"}
