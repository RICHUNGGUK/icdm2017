It is well known that many non-rigid image registration techniques may lead to unsteady deformation (e.g. not one to one) if the dissimilarity between the reference and template images is too large. We present a novel variational framework of the total fractional-order variation to derive the underlying fractional Euler-Lagrange equations and a numerical implementation combining the semi-implicit update and conjugate gradients (CG) solution to solve the nonlinear systems. Numerical experiments show that the new registration not only produces accurate and smooth solutions but also allows for a large rigid alignment, the evaluations of the new model demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over the conventional image registration approaches.
