Numerical studies, on the other hand, have all dealt with shorter pipes and smaller end-masses, mainly because the numerical convergence of the theoretical results for long pipes with large end-masses is problematic. In this paper, numerical results are presented for Copeland and Moon's system parameters, reproducing some of the rich dynamics they obtained, including coupled planar and pendular oscillations, planar oscillations rotating through a finite angle, and planar motions rotating clockwise or counter-clockwise.
