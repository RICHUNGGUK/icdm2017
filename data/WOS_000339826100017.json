A publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) scheme is a verifiable secret sharing scheme that allows a third party to verify correctness of the distributed shares. We propose an efficient non-interactive PVSS scheme using Paillier additively homomorphic encryption system, and analyze its security in a model that we define in line with the classic semantic-security definition and offering stronger security compared to the previous models. We reduce security of our PVSS scheme to the well studied decisional composite residuosity assumption in this model.", "paper_title": "Paillier-based publicly verifiable (non-interactive) secret sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000339826100017"}
