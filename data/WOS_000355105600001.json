Recently, cognitive radio based sensor networks (CRSNs) have been envisioned as a promising type of implementation that provides quality-of-service (QoS) features for data transmissions. However, key challenges remain in designing energy-efficient medium access control techniques that can achieve QoS. In this paper, we have developed a multiconstrained QoS aware MAC protocol, MQ-MAC, for a cluster based CRSN. In MQ-MAC, a data channel and a backup channel are assigned to a secondary user by the respective cluster head by using dynamic channel priorities. The user device can switch to the backup channel when a primary user appears to be operating over the data channel. Member nodes of a cluster are also prioritized with respect to the urgency of their generated data packets. Performance evaluations, carried out in NS-3 simulator, show that the proposed MQ-MAC protocol offers better performance than existing MAC protocols for CRSN.", "paper_title": "A Multiconstrained QoS Aware MAC Protocol for Cluster-Based Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355105600001"}
