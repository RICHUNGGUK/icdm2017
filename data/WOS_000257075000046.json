Fiber clustering groups the DTI fibers into spatially and anatomically related tracts. As an increasing number of fiber clustering methods have been recently developed, it is important to display, compare, and explore the clustering results efficiently and effectively. In this paper we present an anatomical visualization technique that reduces the geometric complexity, of the fiber tracts and emphasizes the high-level structures. Beginning with a volumetric diffusion tensor image, we first construct a hierarchical clustering representation of the fiber bundles. These bundles are then reformulated into a 3D multi-valued volume data. We then build a set of geometric hulls and principal fibers to approximate the shape and orientation of each fiber bundle. By simultaneously visualizing the geometric hulls, individual fibers, and other data sets such as fractional anisotropy, the overall shape of the fiber tracts are highlighted, while preserving the fibrous details. A rater with expert knowledge of white matter structure has evaluated the resulting interactive illustration and confirmed the improvement over straightforward DTI fiber tract visualization.", "paper_title": "Abstractive representation and exploration of hierarchically clustered diffusion tensor fiber tracts", "paper_id": "WOS:000257075000046"}
