In this note, we focus in the absence of the conservative assumption upon developing a robust decentralized direct adaptive output feedback fuzzy controller. By combination of a state observer, a fuzzy inference system and robust control technique, the previous controller design is modified and no a priori knowledge of bounds on lumped uncertainties is required. All the signals of the closed-loop large-scale system are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded. The effectiveness of the developed scheme is demonstrated through the simulation results of interconnected inverted pendulums. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
