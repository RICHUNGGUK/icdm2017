New variables selection criteria incorporating with classical stepwise procedure are also developed to select significant explanatory variables. Our approach is not only simple in computation for massive data but also confirmed by the simulation study that our approach is more accurate in the sense of achieving the nominal significance level for huge data sets. A real example with moderate sample size verifies that the proposed procedure is accurate compared with the classical method, and a huge real data set is also demonstrated to select appropriate regressors.
