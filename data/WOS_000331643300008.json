Since these chips are highly vulnerable to m-spotty byte errors, this goal can be achieved using m-spotty byte error-control codes. This paper introduces the m-spotty Lee weight enumerator, the split m-spotty Lee weight enumerator and the joint m-spotty Lee weight enumerator for byte error-control codes over the ring of integers modulo a\"\" (a\"\" a parts per thousand yen 2 is an integer) and over arbitrary finite fields, and also discusses some of their applications. In addition, MacWilliams type identities are also derived for these enumerators.", "paper_title": "On some new m-spotty Lee weight enumerators", "paper_id": "WOS:000331643300008"}
