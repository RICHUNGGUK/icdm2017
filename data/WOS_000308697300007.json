Subshifts of Cantor-Bendixson rank two contain only eventually periodic elements. Any rank two subshift in 2(Z) is decidable. Subshifts of rank three may contain members of arbitrary Turing degree. In contrast, effectively closed (Pi(0)(1)) subshifts of rank three contain only computable elements, but Pi(0)(1) subshifts of rank four may contain members of arbitrary Delta(0)(2) degree. There is no subshift of rank omega + 1.", "paper_title": "Computability of Countable Subshifts in One Dimension", "paper_id": "WOS:000308697300007"}
