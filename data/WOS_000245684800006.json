An on-line scheme is formulated for modeling a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) recurrent neuro-fuzzy structure from input-output samples of a multivariable nonlinear dynamic system in a noisy environment. The adaptive weighted instrumental variable (WIV) algorithm by QR factorization based on the numerically robust orthogonal Householder transformation is developed to modify the consequent parameters of the TS multivariable neuro-fuzzy network.", "paper_title": "An IV-QR algorithm for neuro-fuzzy multivariable online identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000245684800006"}
