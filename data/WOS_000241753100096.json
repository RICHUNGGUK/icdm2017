A Multi-Agent System (MAS) based model for the predictive maintenance system of hydropower plant within the framework of Intelligent Control-Maintenance-Management System (ICMMS) is proposed. All maintenance activities, form data collection through the recommendation of specific maintenance actions, are integrated into the system. In this model, the predictive maintenance system composed of four layers: Signal Collection, Data Processing, Diagnosis and Prognosis, and Maintenance Decision-Making. Using this model a prototype of predictive maintenance for hydropower plant is established. Artificial Neural-Network (NN) is successfully applied to monitor, identify and diagnosis the dynamic performance of the prototype system online.", "paper_title": "Research on a novel method diagnosis and maintenance for key produce plant based on MAS and NN", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100096"}
