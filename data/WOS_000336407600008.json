Harju proved that there exists an infinite k-stem word for k = 1, 2, 3, 9 and 13 <= k <= 19, but not for 4 <= k <= 8 and 10 <= k <= 12. He asked whether k-stem words exist for each k >= 20. We give a positive answer to this question. Currie has found another construction that answers Harju's question.", "paper_title": "More on Square-free Words Obtained from Prefixes by Permutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000336407600008"}
