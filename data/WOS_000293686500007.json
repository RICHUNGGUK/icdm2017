In this paper, we discuss the design and evaluation of the Colorado Care Tablet, a Personal Health Application (PHA) that helps older adults and their lay caregivers manage their medication regimes during care transitions. We created a PHA that older adults with limited computing experience could easily use by designing an application based on their real world artifacts and workflows. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
