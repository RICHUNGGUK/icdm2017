A simple incremental algorithm for this problem is proposed which produces optimum solution in O(n(3)) time and O(n(2)) space. This is an improvement in the running time by a factor of n over the best known existing algorithm for the same problem.", "paper_title": "Improved algorithm for minimum cost range assignment problem for linear radio networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000251155900011"}
