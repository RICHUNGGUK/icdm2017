In this paper, we propose a lightweight on-chip structure that measures timing uncertainty induced by noise during functional and test operations. The proposed on-chip structure, facilitates speed characterization under various workloads and test conditions. The basic structure is highly scalable and can be tailored for various applications such as silicon validation, monitoring operation condition, and validating logic built-in-self-test conditions. Simulation results show that it offers very high measurement resolution in a highly efficient manner.", "paper_title": "Light-Weight On-Chip Structure for Measuring Timing Uncertainty Induced by Noise in Integrated Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000337159500007"}
