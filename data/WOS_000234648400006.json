The algorithm can be used, for example, to compile Shor's algorithm, which uses rotations of pi/2(k), into an efficient fault-tolerant form using only Hadamard, controlled-NOT, and pi/8 gates. The algorithm runs in O(log(2.71)(1/epsilon)) time, and produces as output a sequence of O(log(3.97)(1/epsilon)) quantum gates which is guaranteed to approximate the desired quantum gate to an accuracy within epsilon > 0. We also explain how the algorithm can be generalized to apply to multi-qubit gates and to gates from SU(d).", "paper_title": "The Solovay-Kitaev algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000234648400006"}
