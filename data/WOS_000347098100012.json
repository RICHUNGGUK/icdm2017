In this paper, we first report our field studies with GMI, as well as experiment results aiming to explain our unsatisfactory GMI experience. Then motivated by the obtained insights, we propose GROPING as a self-contained indoor navigation system independent of any infrastructural support. GROPING relies on geomagnetic fingerprints that are far more stable than WiFi fingerprints, and it exploits crowdsensing to construct floor maps rather than expecting individual venues to supply digitized maps. Based on our experiments with 20 participants in various floors of a big shopping mall, GROPING is able to deliver a sufficient accuracy for localization and thus provides smooth navigation experience.", "paper_title": "GROPING: Geomagnetism and cROwdsensing Powered Indoor NaviGation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347098100012"}
