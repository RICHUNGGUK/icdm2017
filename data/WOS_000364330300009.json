Apart from this contribution to submodular optimization, our results extend the toolkit available in deterministic machine scheduling with controllable processing times. We demonstrate how this method can be applied to developing fast algorithms for minimizing total compression cost for preemptive schedules on parallel machines with respect to given release dates and a common deadline. Obtained scheduling algorithms are faster and easier to justify than those previously known in the scheduling literature.", "paper_title": "Decomposition algorithms for submodular optimization with applications to parallel machine scheduling with controllable processing times", "paper_id": "WOS:000364330300009"}
