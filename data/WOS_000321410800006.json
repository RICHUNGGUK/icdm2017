To this end, it is desirable for a robot to understand the environment at both geometric and semantic levels. Therefore in recent years, research towards place classification has been gaining in popularity. After the era of heuristic and rule-based approaches, supervised learning algorithms have been extensively used for this purpose, showing satisfactory performance levels. However, most of those approaches have only been trained and tested in the same environments and thus impede a generalized solution. In this paper, we have proposed a semi-supervised place classification over a generalized Voronoi graph (SPCoGVG) which is a semi-supervised learning framework comprised of three techniques: support vector machine (SVM), conditional random field (CRF) and generalized Voronoi graph (GVG), in order to improve the generalizability. The inherent problem of training CRF with partially labeled data has been solved using a novel parameter estimation algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through extensive analysis of data collected in international university environments. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
