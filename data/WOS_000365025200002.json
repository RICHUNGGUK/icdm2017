We claim that a fundamental new approach based on social concepts is needed to build agents functioning in these socially interconnected systems. In this paper, we explore how the concepts of social practices and social identities can be used to structure deliberations about interactions. We then show the consequences for the architecture and reasoning capabilities of these systems.", "paper_title": "A conceptual architecture for social deliberation in multi-agent organizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000365025200002"}
