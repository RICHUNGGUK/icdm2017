This phenomenon challenges the development of recommender systems based on users' online opinions by presenting additional sources of uncertainty. In the context of predicting the \"helpfulness\" of a review document based on users' online votes on other reviews (where a user's vote on a review is either HELPFUL or UNHELPFUL), the \"words of few mouths\" phenomenon corresponds to the case where a large fraction of the reviews are each voted only by very few users. Focusing on the \"review helpfulness prediction\" problem, we illustrate the challenges associated with the \"words of few mouths\" phenomenon in the training of a review helpfulness predictor. We advocate probabilistic approaches for recommender system development in the presence of \"words of few mouths\". More concretely, we propose a probabilistic metric as the training target for conventional machine learning based predictors. Our empirical study using Support Vector Regression (SVR) augmented with the proposed probability metric demonstrates advantages of incorporating probabilistic methods in the training of the predictors. In addition to this \"partially probabilistic\" approach, we also develop a logistic regression based probabilistic model and correspondingly a learning algorithm for review helpfulness prediction. We demonstrate experimentally the superior performance of the logistic regression method over SVR, the prior art in review helpfulness prediction.", "paper_title": "Opinion helpfulness prediction in the presence of \"words of few mouths\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000299891800002"}
