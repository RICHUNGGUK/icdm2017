In this paper, we analyze the differences between the Social Network (SN) and the Wireless Social Network (W-SN) in terms of the clustering coefficient. characteristic path length, Community size, and membership number. We observe that the clustering coefficient, Community Size and Membership number in the W-SN are bigger than those in the SN, while the character path length in W-SN becomes smaller. And then we propose a new Wireless Social Model (WSM) based Oil Community character. Node in WSM is driven by the alpha-Model and has an equal probability to move to one of his adjacent vertices. We evaluate our model via real traces supplied by Dartmouth College, which shows that our wireless social mobile model offers a good approximation of real movements. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
