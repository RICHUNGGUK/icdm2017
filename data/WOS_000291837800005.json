In the proposed algorithm the weights are updated incrementally using a higher-order difference equation, which implements a low-pass digital filter. It is shown that by suitably choosing the filter the learning process can adaptively follow a specific dynamic. Numerical results, for time-varying and static distributions, show the potential of the proposed method for unsupervised learning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
