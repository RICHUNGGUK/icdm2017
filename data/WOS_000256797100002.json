Special emphasis is put on second-order systems. Selecting the monotonic and oscillatoric stability border, the admissible uncertainty is derived in explicit detail. Closed derivation for the uncertainties is feasible for linear and bilinear ones. The matrix-based results are also given for arbitrary order of the dynamic system. Minimum degree of stability and nice stability are also addressed.", "paper_title": "The admissible spherical uncertainty for dynamic systems in state space", "paper_id": "WOS:000256797100002"}
