This system is meant for undergraduate students in the engineering laboratory. A computer-based system installed with motion control hardware are utilized to assist in the study of mapping of equipotential field lines using water as a medium in a water tray system with two electrodes apart. The equipotential line profiles are obtained by automatic sampling, locating the spatial positions/points of equivalent potential values and joining these points. Equipotential line profiles for different electrodes configurations can be investigated with this system. This advanced-automated system is to complement and assists students in understanding fundamental concepts of static electric fields and mapping of equipotential lines profiles for different electrodes configurations. An additional value of such an activity is to provide introduction to remote access capability or teleoperation of equipment to the students. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
