The resulting zero-order TSK fuzzy systems have the two following features: A) the product t-norm is used to add IF-part fuzzy propositions of the obtained rules and B) their inputs are the same as the initial NN ones. This fact makes us gain an understanding of the ANN-embedded knowledge. Besides, it allows us to simplify the architecture of a network through the reduction of fuzzy propositions in its equivalent zero-order TSK system. These advantages are the result of applying fuzzy system area properties on the NN area. They are illustrated with several examples.", "paper_title": "Artificial neural networks are zero-order TSK fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256670200006"}
