We assume that the integrands f belong to a weighted quasi-reproducing kernel Hilbert space, where the weights have product form and satisfy gamma j = circle dot(j(-beta)) for beta > 1. The cost of computing f (x) depends on the number Act(x) of active coordinates in x and is equal to $(Act(x)), where $ is a given cost function. We prove, in particular, that if the corresponding univariate problem admits algorithms with errors circle dot(n(-kappa/2)), where n is the number of function evaluations, then the infinity-variate problem is polynomially tractable with the tractability exponent bounded from above by max(2/kappa. 2/(beta - 1)) for all cost functions satisfying $(d) = circle dot(e(k.d)), for any k >= 0. This bound is sharp in the worst case setting if beta and kappa are chosen as large as possible and $(d) is at least linear in d. The problem is weakly tractable even for a larger class of cost functions including $(d) = circle dot(e(ek.d)). Moreover, our proofs are constructive. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
