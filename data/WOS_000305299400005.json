The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology for determining the optimal parameters of a sensor system for more accurate reconstruction of the crack shape. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, an objective function is formulated using the shape sensitivity information computed from the ECT data. The design of a non-destructive testing (NDT) sensor is carried out through optimizing the sensor parameters under such a criterion. Findings - The methodology proposed results in modifications to the original sensor geometry which makes it more sensitive to the depth changes in a crack. A square wave form of excitation is used in order to provide more information on the size of the crack at different depths, essentially through the superposition of a range of excitation frequencies, each of which has a different depth of penetration. The newly designed ECT sensor system is suitable for dealing with the natural crack problem. Research limitations/implications - While the methodology is general and has been shown to work in a simulated environment, the result is not verified by the experiments because the newly designed device has not actually been fabricated. Originality/value - This paper has demonstrated the possibility of designing a sensor probe using computer aided design tools without extensive physical testing. The design process is novel and based on a sensitivity approach. This is shown to be very efficient and effective and the solution of the inverse problem demonstrates a very fast convergence.", "paper_title": "NDT sensor design optimization for accurate crack reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000305299400005"}
