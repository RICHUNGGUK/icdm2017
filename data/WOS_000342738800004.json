It reduces possible layout patterns in the interconnect layers, and increases VIA and metal figure numbers in the EB shots while suppressing the CP character number explosion. In this paper, we discuss details of the SRA design methodology, and demonstrate the CF performance by SRA in comparison with other EBDW techniques. Our experimental results show viable CF performance for practical use, and prove SRA's feasibility in 14 nm mass fabrication.", "paper_title": "A Structured Routing Architecture for Practical Application of Character Projection Method in Electron-Beam Direct Writing", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738800004"}
