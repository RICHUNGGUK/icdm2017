However, existing methods face a common challenge: the generated MAC t belongs to a small finite field IFq, which means that an adversary could attack by randomly guessing the value of t, and succeed with probability 1/q. Since q is a predetermined system parameter which is typically set as 28, the resulted security 1/256 could be unsatisfactory in practice. In this paper, we propose an efficient homomorphic MAC for authentication in network coding. The proposed method achieves a reliable security parameter 1/q(l) using only one key, where l could be chosen according to different security requirements. Compared with previous approaches that using multiple tags, the proposed homomorphic MAC has both low computation and communication overheads.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Homomorphic MAC with Small Key Size for Authentication in Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000323718600015"}
