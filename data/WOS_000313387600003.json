The purpose of this research is to propose a concept-based retrieval mechanism to catch the user's query intentions in a grid environment. This research re-ranks documents over distributed data sources and evaluates performance based on the user judgment and processing time. Design/methodology/approach - This research uses the ontology lookup service to build the concept set in the ontology and captures the user's query intentions as a means of query expansion for searching. The Globus toolkit is used to implement the grid service. The modification of the collection retrieval inference (CORI) algorithm is used for re-ranking documents over distributed data sources. Findings - The experiments demonstrate that this proposed approach successfully describes the user's query intentions evaluated by user judgment. For processing time, building a grid information retrieval model is a suitable strategy for the ontology-based retrieval model. Originality/value - Most current semantic grid models focus on construction of the semantic grid, and do not consider re-ranking search results from distributed data sources. The significance of evaluation from the user's viewpoint is also ignored. This research proposes a method that captures the user's query intentions and re-ranks documents in a grid based on the CORI algorithm. This proposed ontology-based retrieval mechanism calculates the global relevance score of all documents in a grid and displays those documents with higher relevance to users.", "paper_title": "OGIR: an ontology-based grid information retrieval framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000313387600003"}
