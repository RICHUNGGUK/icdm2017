The effect of permeability on the flow in the PPcFC was analysed using the commercial software - Fluent. Results showed that the permeability was directly proportional to the thickness, the porosity and the pore size of the membrane, and inversely proportional to the surface shape factor. To ensure the best flow pattern, the inlet velocity range was limited by the membrane permeability and fluid viscosity, and then restricted the available magnitudes of shear rate on the permeable membrane. Our findings are helpful in designing and preparing the biomaterials that have adequate mechanical properties for the functional vascular grafts production, and in using of the flow chamber in various investigations.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of the effect of permeability on the hydrodynamics in a parallel-plate coculture flow chamber", "paper_id": "WOS:000334075400007"}
