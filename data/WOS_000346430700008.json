The method relies on the knowledge of the reconstructed interface in each interfacial cell. The time integration is implicit in order to circumvent severe time step restrictions. It includes heat conduction and the release of latent heat during phase change as well as mass flux across the interface. The method is described in detail including the specific treatment related to the piecewise linear interface reconstruction. The morphology of ice crystals proves to converge on fine grids. Furthermore, the growth velocity of dendrites is independent of the orientation with respect to the used Cartesian grid. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
