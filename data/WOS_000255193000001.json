We show that the performance of a KPS can be improved by carefully choosing a certain class of set systems as \"key ring spaces\". Especially, we analyze KPSs based on a type of combinatorial design known as a transversal design. We employ two types of transversal designs, which are represented by the set of all linear polynomials and the set of quadratic polynomials ( over some finite field), respectively. These KPSs turn out to have significant efficiency in a shared- key discovery phase without degrading connectivity and resiliency.", "paper_title": "On the construction of practical key predistribution schemes for distributed sensor networks using combinatorial designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000255193000001"}
