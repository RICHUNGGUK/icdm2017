A quantitative study was carried out and data were obtained through a mall-intercept systematic sampling distribution of questionnaires. The results indicate that IA and EWOM have a positive effect on consumers' PV and PR of using OGB sites, which in turn have a significant influence on their intentions to shop at OGB sites. A significant relationship also emerges between IA and EWOM. The article concludes with implications of the findings and future research directions.", "paper_title": "THE INFLUENCE OF INTERNET ADVERTISING AND ELECTRONIC WORD OF MOUTH ON CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS AND INTENTION: SOME EVIDENCE FROM ONLINE GROUP BUYING", "paper_id": "WOS:000358338700010"}
