This transportation planning problem belongs to the class of difficult combinatorial optimization problem, whose optimal solution is difficult to discover. The paper develops a Swarm Intelligence (SI) based model for the transit network design problem. When designing the transit network, we try to maximize the number of satisfied passengers, to minimize the total number of transfers, and to minimize the total travel time of all served passengers. Our approach to the transit network design problem is based on the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) metaheuristics. The BCO algorithm is a stochastic, random-search technique that belongs to the class of population-based algorithms. This technique uses a similarity among the way in which bees in nature look for food, and the way in which optimization algorithms search for an optimum of a combinatorial optimization problem. The numerical experiments are performed on known benchmark problems. We clearly show that our approach, based on the BCO algorithm, is competitive with other approaches in the literature, and it can generate high-quality solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
