For each problem, inversion formulas previously derived by Pestov and Uhlmann [Internat. Math. Res. Notices, 80 (2004), pp. 4331-4347] then extended by Krishnan [J. Inv. Ill-Posed Probl., 18 (2010), pp. 401-408] are implemented in the case of simple and some nonsimple metrics. These numerical tools are also used to better understand and gain intuition about nonsimple manifolds, for which injectivity and stability of the corresponding integral geometric problems are still under active study.", "paper_title": "Numerical Implementation of Geodesic X-Ray Transforms and Their Inversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000338782900026"}
