Although structured approaches are particularly useful for data gathering applications, they incur high maintenance overhead in dynamic scenarios for event-based applications. Moreover, a WSN should be capable of timely fulfilling its mission without losing important information in event-critical applications. In this paper, we focus on designing a structure-free Real-time data AGgregation protocol, RAG, using two mechanisms for temporal and spatial convergence of packets - Judiciously Waiting policy and Real-time Data-aware Anycasting policy. Using extensive simulations in NS-2, we investigate the performance of RAG in terms of aggregation gain, miss ratio, energy consumption, and end-to-end delay for WSNs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
