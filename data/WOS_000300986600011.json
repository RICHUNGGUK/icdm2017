However, these signatures have limitations, such as dependency on the training set, and worse, lack of generalization. Results: We propose a novel algorithm called ITI (interactome-transcriptome integration), to extract a genomic signature predicting distant metastasis in breast cancer by superimposition of large-scale protein-protein interaction data over a compendium of several gene expression datasets. Training on two different compendia showed that the estrogen receptor-specific signatures obtained are more stable (11-35% stability), can be generalized on independent data and performs better than previously published methods (53-74% accuracy). Availability: The ITI algorithm source code from analysis are available under CeCILL from the ITI companion website: http://bioinformatique.marseille.inserm.fr/iti.", "paper_title": "Interactome-transcriptome integration for predicting distant metastasis in breast cancer", "paper_id": "WOS:000300986600011"}
