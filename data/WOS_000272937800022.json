To explore similarities of these sites from the viewpoint of a ligand, a sequence and fold-independent method was created to rapidly and accurately compare binding sites of proteins represented by property-mapped triangulated Gauss-Connolly Surfaces. Within this paradigm, signatures for each binding Site Surface are produced by calculating their property-encoded shape distributions (PESD), a Measure of the probability that a particular property will be at a specific distance to another on the Molecular surface. Similarity between the signatures call then be treated as a measure of similarity between binding sites. As postulated, the PESD method rapidly detected high levels of similarity in binding site surface characteristics even in cases where there was very low similarity Lit the sequence level. In a screening experiment involving each member of the PDBBind 2005 data set as a query against the rest of the set, PESD was able to retrieve a binding site with identical E.C. (Enzyme Commission) numbers as the top match in 79.5% of cases. The ability of the method in detecting similarity in binding sites with low sequence conservations was compared to state-of-the-art binding site comparison methods.", "paper_title": "Rapid Comparison of Protein Binding Site Surfaces with Property Encoded Shape Distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000272937800022"}
