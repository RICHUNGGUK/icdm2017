Combining computational and mathematical approaches, we establish a number of properties of EEr. In particular, any tree has smaller BED-value than any unicyclic graph of the same order, and any unicyclic graph has smaller EEr-value than any tricyclic graph of the same order. The trees, unicyclic, bicyclic, and tricyclic graphs with smallest and greatest EEr are determined.", "paper_title": "Resolvent Estrada Index - Computational and Mathematical Studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000361847100017"}
