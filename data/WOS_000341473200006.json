The access network design problem seeks to find an optimal location of switch and allocation of demands such that the total cost of switch and fiber cable is minimized, while satisfying switch port constraint, switch capacity constraint, and no-split routing constraint. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model and alternative formulations are developed by the reformulation-linearization technique (RLT) for improving computational effectiveness. By exploiting the tree structure of the problem, we develop some valid inequalities that have complementary strength and devise separation problems for finding effective valid inequalities that cut off fractional LP solutions. Also, we develop an effective MIP-based tree partitioning heuristic for finding good quality solutions for large size problems. Computational results demonstrate the efficacy of the valid inequalities and the proposed heuristic. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
