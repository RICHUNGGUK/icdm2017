We classify all the frames in intra-frames and predictive frames by adopting a similarity measure based on the Lukasiewicz t-norm and a pre-processing phase which determines the best similarity threshold value. The compression is made on particular frames, called Delta-frames, obtained from a suitable difference defined on the values of the pixels of an intra-frame and a predictive frame. Under high compression rates, we see that the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio of the frames obtained with the fuzzy transforms is averagely close to the PSNR obtained with the JPEG method.
