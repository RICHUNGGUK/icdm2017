These schemes have rational symbols. The symbols are explicitly presented in the paper. This is accompanied by a detailed description of the design of the refinement masks and by algorithms that verify the convergence of these schemes. In addition, the smoothness of the limit functions is investigated. The ternary subdivision schemes, whose construction is based on continuous splines, become tools for fast computation of interpolatory splines of arbitrary order at triadic rational points.", "paper_title": "TERNARY INTERPOLATORY SUBDIVISION SCHEMES ORIGINATED FROM SPLINES", "paper_id": "WOS:000292842200005"}
