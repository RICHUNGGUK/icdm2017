As the main contribution, we present a constraint based approach to capture both streaming application execution semantics and the varying design concerns during reconfigurations. With our event models constructed as cumulative functions on data streams, we exploit a novel compile-time analysis framework based on iterative timing phases. Finally, we implement our framework on a public domain constraint solver, and illustrate its capabilities in the analysis of design trade-offs due to reconfigurations with experiments.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Reconfigurations in Adaptive Real-Time Streaming Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000307050900002"}
