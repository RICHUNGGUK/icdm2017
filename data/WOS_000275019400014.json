Secondly, we embed the performance evaluation in a multi-objective optimization setting. This multi-objective optimization approach results in the Pareto efficient curves showing the trade-off between the total number of servers used and the throughput. Experiments for a large number of settings and different network topologies are presented in detail. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
