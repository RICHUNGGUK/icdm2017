We show that when the activity lambda is sufficiently large, there is no fully polynomial randomised approximation scheme for evaluating the partition function unless NP = RP. The result extends to a nearby region of the parameter space in a more general two-state spin system with three parameters. We also give a polynomial-time randomised approximation scheme for the logarithm of the partition function. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
