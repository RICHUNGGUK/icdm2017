The need exists for defining flexible and robust similarity measures between association rules. This paper introduces a new class of similarity functions, SF's, that can be used to discover properties in the feature space X and to perform their grouping with standard clustering techniques. Properties of the proposed SF's are investigated and experiments on simulated data-sets are also shown to evaluate the grouping performance.", "paper_title": "New similarity rules for mining data", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451800026"}
