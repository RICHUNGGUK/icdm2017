This observation has been a source of many lower bounds on quantum algorithms. It has been an open problem whether this lower bound is tight. We exhibit a function with polynomial degree M and quantum query complexity Omega(M-1.321...). This is the first superlinear separation between polynomial degree and quantum query complexity. The lower bound is shown by a generalized version of the quantum adversary method. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
