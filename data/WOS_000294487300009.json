These advances have enabled new approaches to search multidimensional trade spaces through interactive data visualization and exploration. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of interactive trade space exploration strategies by conducting human subject experiments with novice and expert users. A single objective, constrained design optimization problem involving the sizing of an engine combustion chamber is used for this study. Effectiveness is measured by comparing the best feasible design obtained by each user, and efficiency is assessed based on the percentage of feasible designs generated by each user. Results indicate that novices who watch a 5-min training video before the experiment obtain results that are not significantly different from those obtained by expert users, and both groups are statistically better than the novices without the training video in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Frequency and ordering of the visualization and exploration tools are also compared to understand the differences in each group's search strategy. The implications of the results are discussed along with future work.
