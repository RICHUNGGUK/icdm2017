However, it is generally known that WSNs are energy limited, which makes WSNs vulnerable to malicious attacks. Among these malicious attacks, a sinkhole attack is the most destructive one, since only one sinkhole node can attract surrounding nodes with unfaithful routing information, and it executes severe malicious attacks, e.g. the selective forwarding attack. In addition, a sinkhole node can cause a large amount of energy wastes of surrounding nodes, which results in abnormal energy hole in WSNs. Thus, it is necessary to design an effective mechanism to detect the sinkhole attack. In this paper, we propose a novel Intrusion Detection Algorithm based on neighbor information against Sinkhole Attack (IDASA). Different from traditional intrusion detection algorithms, IDASA takes full advantage of neighbor information of sensor nodes to detect sinkhole nodes. In addition, we evaluate IDASA in terms of malicious node detection accuracy, packet loss rate, energy consumption and network throughput in MATLAB. Simulation results show that the performance of IDASA is better than that of other related algorithms.", "paper_title": "Intrusion Detection Algorithm Based on Neighbor Information Against Sinkhole Attack in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000359139700006"}
