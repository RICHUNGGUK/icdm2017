The aim of the work reported in this article is to contribute towards CNO formal modeling and performance analysis from an economic perspective. A recently developed, combined three-dimensional approach for CNO performance assessment, based on the key metrics of cost, payoff and agility is presented, with emphasis on the Join/Leave/Remain (JLR) problem which has been defined in this project.
