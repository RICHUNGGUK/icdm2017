A Decision Support System (DSS) can help to optimize effective use of the scarce human resources available. In this paper we present a DSS that merges predictive policing capabilities with a patrolling districting model, for the design of predictive patrolling areas. The proposed DSS, developed in close collaboration with the Spanish National Police Corps (SNPC), defines partitions of the territory under the jurisdiction of a district that are efficient and balanced at the same time, according to the preferences of a decision maker. To analyze the crime records provided by the SNPC, a methodology for the description of spatially and temporally indeterminate crime events has been developed. The DSS has been tested with a case study in the Central District of Madrid. The results of the experiments show that the proposed DSS clearly outperforms the patrolling area definitions currently in use by the SNPC. To compare the solutions in terms of efficiency loss, we discuss how to build an operational envelope for the problem considered, which can be used to identify the range of performances associated with different patrolling strategies.
