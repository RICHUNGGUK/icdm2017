Secure IP multicast can be used to implement IPTV services, but it still has problems to be addressed. Current solutions require high computational power in video channel zapping situations, lack support for groups sourced at the users, and present a weak support for admission control in IP multicast for both sources and receivers in dynamically configured environments. This work proposes a new, secure and efficient IPTV solution that, cumulatively: (a) enforces individual access control to groups of real-time IPTV video channels; (b) enforces IP multicast admission control for both multicast senders and receivers; (c) supports user generated videos; (d) generates low signaling overheads; (e) does not introduce perceivable delays, particularly in video channel zapping situations. Moreover, this solution can be easily integrated in the IPTV architectures being developed by ETSI and ITU-T. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
