In this paper the mathematical model and processes determination are shortly reviewed. New results are outlined for the determination of time periods of periodic motions for simple (two part types) problems and for complex (multi-part types. multi-machine groups) cases, too. Having the time periods, all the significant planning parameters can be easily determined. As a consequence of the above, the idea of periodic and transient schedules is introduced. A planning procedure is developed. Based on the new prospects obtained, an important development of the mathematical model is proposed. This is to expand the mathematical model with buffer capacities constraints. These new constraints determine the final results of planning. Using a manipulation of set-up times (regularizibility) a future improvement of the processes can be realized. All this leads to a very simple, real-time scheduling of FMS. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
