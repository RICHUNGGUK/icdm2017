The number of counted rising edges being less than expected generally implies that the state is corrupted resulting in faulty output, so the faulty frequency divider is reset to a proper state to correct errors. The number of counted rising edges being greater than expected generally implies that the output is corrupted by a single event transient (SET) without changing the state, hence SET tolerance does not require a reset. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve high operational clock frequency and good SEU hardening capability.", "paper_title": "Single event transient tolerant frequency divider", "paper_id": "WOS:000337941800004"}
