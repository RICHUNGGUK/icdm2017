The objective is to design a switched static output feedback controller guaranteeing the exponential stability of the resulting closed-loop system with a minimized exponential H-infinity performance under average dwell-time switching scheme. Based on a parameter-dependent discontinuous switched Lyapunov function combined with Finsler's lemma and Dualization lemma, some novel conditions for exponential H infinity performance analysis are first proposed and in turn the static output feedback controller designs are developed. It is shown that the controller gains can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are numerically efficient with commercially available software. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity static output feedback control of discrete-time switched polytopic linear systems with average dwell-time", "paper_id": "WOS:000272033000008"}
