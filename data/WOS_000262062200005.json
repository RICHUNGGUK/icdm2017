When choosing between multiple equally-good BGP routes, a router selects the one with the closest egress point, based on the intradomain path cost. Under such hot-potato routing, an intradomain event can trigger BGP routing changes. To characterize the influence of hot-potato routing, we propose a technique for associating BGP routing changes with events visible in the intradomain protocol, and apply our algorithm to a tier-1 ISP backbone network. We show that (i) BGP updates can lag 60 seconds or more behind the intradomain event; (ii) the number of BGP path changes triggered by hot-potato routing has a nearly uniform distribution across destination prefixes; and (iii) the fraction of BGP messages triggered by intradomain changes varies significantly across time and router locations. We show that hot-potato routing changes lead to longer delays in forwarding-plane convergence, shifts in the flow of traffic to neighboring domains, extra externally-visible BGP update messages, and inaccuracies in Internet performance measurements.", "paper_title": "Impact of Hot-Potato Routing Changes in IP Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262062200005"}
