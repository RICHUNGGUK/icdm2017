Operational physical procedures for discerning observable events assume their existence and validity locally, by coordinatising the informational content of those observable events in terms of real-valued local observables. The localisation process is effectuated in terms of topological covering systems on the events 'continuum', that do not presuppose an underlying structure of points on the real line and, moreover, respect only the fundamental relation of extension between events. In this sense, the physical 'continuum' is represented by means of a fibred topos-theoretic structure, modelled as a sheaf of algebras of continuous real-valued functions. Finally, the dynamics of information propagation, formulated in terms of continuous real-valued observables, is described in the context of an appropriate sheaf-cohomological framework corresponding to the localisation process.", "paper_title": "A sheaf-theoretic topos model of the physical 'Continuum' and its cohomological observable dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000260610000001"}
