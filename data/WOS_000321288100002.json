In this paper we first study proportional contact representations that use rectilinear polygons without wasted areas (white space). In this setting, the best known algorithm for proportional contact representation of a maximal planar graph uses 12-sided rectilinear polygons and takes O(nlogn) time. We describe a new algorithm that guarantees 10-sided rectilinear polygons and runs in O(n) time. We also describe a linear-time algorithm for proportional contact representation of planar 3-trees with 8-sided rectilinear polygons and show that this is optimal, as there exist planar 3-trees that require 8-sided polygons. We then show that a maximal outer-planar graph admits a proportional contact representation using rectilinear polygons with 6 sides when the outer-boundary is a rectangle and with 4 sides otherwise. Finally we study maximal series-parallel graphs. Here we show that O(1)-sided rectilinear polygons are not possible unless we allow holes, but 6-sided polygons can be achieved with arbitrarily small holes.", "paper_title": "Linear-Time Algorithms for Hole-free Rectilinear Proportional Contact Graph Representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000321288100002"}
