Then, we deepen some probabilistic aspects in nonmonotonic reasoning, by generalizing OR, CM, and Cut rules. We also illustrate the degradation of these inference rules when the number of premises increases. Finally, we show that the lower bounds obtained when applying OR and Quasi-Conjunction inference rules coincide, respectively, with Hamacher and Lukasiewicz t-norms; the upper bounds in both rules coincide with Hamacher t-conorm.
