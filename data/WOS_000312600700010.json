Our main results are as follows: (i) To represent n ternary values t is an element of {0, 1, 2}(n) in terms of u bits b is an element of {0, 1}(u) while accessing a single value t(i) is an element of {0, 1, 2} by probing q bits of b, one needs u >= (log(2)(3))n + n/2(O(q)). This matches an exciting representation by Patrascu (FOCS 2008), later refined with Dodis and Thorup (STOC 2010), where u <= (log(2)(3))n + n/2(Omega(q)). We also note that results on logarithmic forms imply the lower bound u >= (log(2)(3))n + n/log(O(1)) n if we access t(i) by probing one cell of log n bits. (ii) To represent sets of size n/3 from a universe of n elements in terms of u bits b is an element of {0, 1}(u) while answering membership queries by probing q bits of b, one needs u >= log(2) ((n)(n/3)) + n/2(O(q)) - logn. Both results hold even if the probe locations are determined adaptively. Ours are the first lower bounds for these fundamental problems; we obtain them by drawing on ideas used in a lower bound for locally decodable codes by Shaltiel and the author [SIAM J.
