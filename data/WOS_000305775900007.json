One important aspect of surveillance is target localization. A location can be estimated by collecting and analyzing sensing data on signal strength, time of arrival, time difference of arrival, or angle of arrival. However, this data is subject to measurement noise and is sensitive to environmental conditions, so its location estimates can be inaccurate. In this paper, we add a novel process to further improve the localization accuracy after the initial location estimates are obtained from some existing algorithm. Our idea is to exploit the consistency of the spatial-temporal relationships of the targets we track. Spatial relationships are the relative target locations in a group and temporal relationships are the locations of a target at different times. We first develop algorithms that improve location estimates using spatial and temporal relationships of targets separately, and then together. We prove mathematically that our methods improve the localization accuracy. Furthermore, we relax the condition that targets should strictly keep their relative positions in the group and also show that perfect time synchronization is not required. Simulations were also conducted to test the algorithms. They used initial target location estimates from existing signal-strength and time-of-arrival algorithms and implemented our own algorithms. The results confirmed improved localization accuracy, especially in the combined algorithms. Since our algorithms use the features of targets and not the underlying WSNs, they can be built on any localization algorithm whose results are not satisfactory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
