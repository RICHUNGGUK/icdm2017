The order conditions will be stated and analyzed using a B-series approach. However, imposing the G-symplectic structure modifies the nature of the order conditions considerably. For Runge-Kutta methods, rooted trees belonging to the same tree have equivalent order conditions; if the trees are superfluous, they are automatically satisfied and can be ignored. For G-symplectic methods, similar results apply but with a more general interpretation. In the multivalue case, starting conditions are a natural aspect of the meaning of order; unlike the Runge-Kutta case for which \"effective order\" or \"processing\" or \"conjugacy\" has to be seen as having an artificial meaning. It is shown that G-symplectic methods with order 4 can be constructed with relatively few stages, , and with only inputs to a step.", "paper_title": "Order conditions for G-symplectic methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000366634300003"}
