When we know the features of training samples precisely and we are uncertain about their class labels, the fuzzy SVDD can be used to obtain the data description. But if the features of training samples are fuzzy numbers, the fuzzy SVDD cannot be utilized. In this paper, we extend the fuzzy SVDD for the description of such training samples and then apply our proposed method, called FSVDD*, to real data. The experimental results show the ability of the proposed method in Taiwanese tea evaluation.", "paper_title": "An extension to fuzzy support vector data description (FSVDD*)", "paper_id": "WOS:000306121400002"}
