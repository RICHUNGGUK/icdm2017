The conventional bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) model with inverted index is verified efficient at retrieving near-duplicate images, but it is less capable of discovering fine-grained concepts in the query and returning semantically matched search results. In this paper, we suggest that instance search should return not only near-duplicate images, but also fine-grained results, which is usually the actual intention of a user. We propose a new and interesting problem named fine-grained image search, which means that we prefer those images containing the same fine-grained concept with the query. We formulate the problem by constructing a hierarchical database and defining an evaluation method. We thereafter introduce a baseline system using fine-grained classification scores to represent and co-index images so that the semantic attributes are better incorporated in the online querying stage. Large-scale experiments reveal that promising search results are achieved with reasonable time and memory consumption. We hope this paper will be the foundation for future work on image search. We also expect more follow-up efforts along this research topic and look forward to commercial fine-grained image search engines.", "paper_title": "Fine-Grained Image Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000353148300006"}
