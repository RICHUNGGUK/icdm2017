Two methods are proposed using distinct runtime structures. It was proved that the new methods are exact and efficient when the domain structure is sparse. Both improve space and time complexity more. than. the existing method, which allows multiagent probabilistic reasoning to be performed in much larger domains given the computational resource. The relative performances of the three methods are compared analytically and experimentally.", "paper_title": "Inference in multiply sectioned Bayesian networks: Methods and performance comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000238069200006"}
