The proposed structure is presented with an implementation in GlobalFoundries' 0.18-mu m 1.8-V industry compatible CMOS technology. The whole TIA circuit consumes only 31.5 mW of dc power. Measured results show a -3 dB bandwidth of about 4 GHz with a 0.25 pF photodiode capacitance. The single-ended transimpedance gain for positive output port is 46 dB Omega. The measured single-ended input-referred noise current spectral density is kept below 18 pA/root Hz within the TIA frequency band. The optical sensitivity for a bit-errorrate of 10(-12) is -15 dBm with 4.25 Gb/s 2(31) - 1 proactive Reed-Solomon bypass data pattern. This cross-coupled structure also facilitates building an input-insensitive differential TIA. The simulation result shows a stable frequency response over a wide range of input capacitance from 0.05 to 0.5 pF.", "paper_title": "Cross-Coupled Current Conveyor Based CMOS Transimpedance Amplifier for Broadband Data Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000322380600013"}
