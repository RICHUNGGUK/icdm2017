This curve, however, does not consider object velocities, and as a result, query processing with a B-x-tree retrieves a large number of false hits, which seriously compromises its efficiency. It is natural to wonder \"can we obtain better performance by capturing also the velocity information, using a Hilbert curve of a higher dimensionality?\". This paper provides a positive answer by developing the B-dual-tree, a novel spatiotemporal access method leveraging pure relational methodology. We show, with theoretical evidence, that the B-dual-tree indeed outperforms the B-x-tree in most circumstances. Furthermore, our technique can effectively answer progressive spatiotemporal queries, which are poorly supported by B-x-trees.", "paper_title": "The B-dual-tree: indexing moving objects by space filling curves in the dual space", "paper_id": "WOS:000254406300002"}
