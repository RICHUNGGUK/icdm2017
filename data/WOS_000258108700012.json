It is based on the quadtree data structure and exploits the expected similarities between the neighboring slices. The proposed approach has better compression ratio than the octree method. A small amount of memory is required since only two slices need to be located in the memory at a time, which makes it suitable for hardware implementation. A built-in compression in volumetric scanners could considerably reduce the transfer and storage requirements for volumetric medical data.", "paper_title": "A quadtree-based progressive lossless compression technique for volumetric data sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000258108700012"}
