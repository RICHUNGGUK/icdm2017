Based on functional decomposition, the dynamics can be decomposed into the altitude subsystem and the velocity subsystem. Furthermore, the discrete model could be derived using the Euler expansion. For the velocity subsystem, the controller is proposed by estimating the system uncertainty and unknown control gain separately with neural networks. The auxiliary error signal is designed to compensate the effect of throttle setting constraint. For the altitude subsystem, the desired control input is approximated by neural network while the error feedback is synthesized for the design. The singularity problem is avoided. Stability analysis proves that the errors of all the signals in the system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Neural Control of a Hypersonic Vehicle in Discrete Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400016"}
