The approach includes a fuzzy model of multi-objective problem in robust design by taking into account principles of robust design and fuzzy factors in mechanical design, and provides Pareto optimal set to multi-objective robust design using genetic algorithm. Computational results showed that the proposed approach is efficient to multi-objective optimization problem in robust design.", "paper_title": "GA Based Fuzzy Multi-objective Robust Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000266447000003"}
