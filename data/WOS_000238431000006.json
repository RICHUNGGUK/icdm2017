API are characterized by invariant segments obtained on a set of low-level features. We propose an algorithm to detect production invariants throughout a collection of audiovisual documents. The algorithm runs on low-level features, considered as time series, and extracts invariant segments using a one-dimensional morphological envelop comparison. Then, based on the extracted results, we define a style similarity measure between two video documents. A derivative pseudo distance is also proposed.
