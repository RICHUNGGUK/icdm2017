First, several measurement formulae are discussed and their properties are studied. Then, two approaches, which are based on the developed intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy cross-entropy, are proposed for solving multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems within an intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy environment. For both methods, an optimisation model is established in order to determine the weight vector for MCDM problems with incomplete information on criteria weights. Finally, an example is provided in order to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "The fuzzy cross-entropy for intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy sets and their application in multi-criteria decision-making", "paper_id": "WOS:000357935900004"}
