Since there is no reported CDK1 crystal structural data, the three dimensional structure of CDK1 was constructed based on homology modeling. An extensive dynamic simulation was also performed on a Flavopiridol-CDK1 complex for probing the binding pattern of Flavopiridol in the active site of CDK1. The binding modes of other inhibitors to CDK1 were also proposed by molecular docking. The structural requirement for developing more potent CDK1 inhibitors was obtained by the above-mentioned molecular simulations and pharmacophore modeling.", "paper_title": "Homology modeling, molecular dynamic simulation and docking studies of cyclin dependent kinase 1", "paper_id": "WOS:000286667800002"}
