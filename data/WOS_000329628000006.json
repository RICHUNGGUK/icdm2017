However, the formal definitions of plaintext awareness are complex. This paper analyses these formal security definitions and presents the only known viable strategy for proving a scheme is PA2 plaintext aware. At the heart of this strategy is a new notion called PA1+ plaintext awareness. This security notion conceptually sits between PA1 and PA2 plaintext awareness (although it is formally distinct from either of these notions). We show exactly how this new security notion relates to the existing notions and how it can be used to prove PA2 plaintext awareness.", "paper_title": "Security Models and Proof Strategies for Plaintext-Aware Encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000329628000006"}
