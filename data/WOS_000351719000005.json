In this paper, a new resource denotation method is proposed in the WLAN and LTE heterogeneous networks based on a concept of spectral bandwidth mapping. This method simplifies the denotation of system resources and makes it possible to calculate system residual capacity, upon which an economic model-based network selection algorithm is designed in both under-loaded and over-loaded scenarios in the heterogeneous networks. The simulation results show that this algorithm achieves better performance than the utility function-based access selection (UFAS) method proposed in [12] in increasing system capacity and system revenue, achieving load balancing and reducing the new call blocking probability in the heterogeneous networks.", "paper_title": "Network Selection Algorithm Based on Spectral Bandwidth Mapping and an Economic Model in WLAN&LTE heterogeneous networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351719000005"}
