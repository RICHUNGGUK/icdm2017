By the aim of combining structural and operational semantics agilely, a Semantic Resource Service Model (SRSM) is proposed. Firstly, SRSM describes Entity-Oriented and Transition-Oriented Resource by semantic meta-model which contains data structures and operation semantics. Secondly, by describing structural semantics for Entity-Oriented Resource, heterogonous inputs/outputs of a service can be automatically matched. Thirdly, by describing operational semantics for Transition-Oriented Resource, the service composition sequence can be inferred after ontology reasoning. Then, both Entity-Oriented and Transition-Oriented Resources are encapsulated into composited RESTful service. At last, a case study and several comparisons are applied in a prototype system. The result shows that the proposed approach provides a flexible way for resource-oriented service composition.", "paper_title": "Ontology Combined Structural and Operational Semantics for Resource-Oriented Service Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000328541700006"}
