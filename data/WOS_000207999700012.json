This work proposes an adaptive QoS aware roadside base station assisted routing mechanisms to establish a routing path in IVC with assistance of roadside base station. A link failure prevention mechanism is employed to effectively construct alternative routing path required by the volatile network topology in vehicular ad hoc networks. Besides, a bandwidth consumption predictor is presented to avoid dropping data packets owing to inadequate bandwidth during handoffs. A PSO-tuned fuzzy logic system is proposed to compute the link break and congestion indicator in the route construction process. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed work.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive QoS-Aware Inter-Vehicle Routing in Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000207999700012"}
