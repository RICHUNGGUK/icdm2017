Provenance records the processing history of a data product. It provides an information context to help users determine the reliability of data products. Conventional provenance applications in GIS focus on provenance capture, representation, and usage in a stand-alone environment such as a desktop-based GIS software system. They cannot support wide sharing and open access of provenance in a distributed environment. The growth of service-oriented sharing and processing of geospatial data brings some new challenges in provenance-aware applications. One is how to share geospatial provenance in an interoperable way. This paper describes the development of provenance service for geospatial data products using the ebXML Registry Information Model (ebRIM) of a geospatial catalog service, which follows the interface specifications of the OGC Catalogue Services for the Web (CSW). This approach fits well the current service stack of the GIS domain and facilitates the management of geospatial data provenance in an open and distributed environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
