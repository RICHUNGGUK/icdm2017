The new approach in comparison with the other existing methods (such as numerical methods and the methods that are based on neural networks) has more advantages such as simple implementation, fast convergence, and also little error. In this paper, we use the ability of KLMS in prediction by applying an optimization method to predict the solution of ODE. The basic idea is that first a trial solution of the ODE is written by using the KLMS structure, and then by defining an error function and minimizing it via an optimization algorithm (in this paper, we used the quasi-Newton BFGS method), the parameters of KLMS are adjusted such that the trial solution satisfies the DE. After the optimization step, the achieved optimal parameters of the KLMS model are replaced in the trial solution. The accuracy of the method is illustrated by solving several problems.", "paper_title": "Ordinary differential equations solution in kernel space", "paper_id": "WOS:000308476800008"}
