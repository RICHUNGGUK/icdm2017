However, in many data stream applications, streaming data contains inherent uncertainty, and labeled samples are difficult to be collected, while abundant data are unlabeled. In this paper, we focus on classifying uncertain data streams with only positive and unlabeled samples available. Based on concept-adapting very fast decision tree (CVFDT) algorithm, we propose an algorithm namely puuCVFDT (CVFDT for positive and unlabeled uncertain data). Experimental results on both synthetic and real-life datasets demonstrate the strong ability and efficiency of puuCVFDT to handle concept drift with uncertainty under positive and unlabeled learning scenario. Even when 90% of the samples in the stream are unlabeled, the classification performance of the proposed algorithm is still compared to that of CVFDT, which is learned from fully labeled data without uncertainty.
