A contrast-detail phantom is generally used to study the quality of image and the amount of radiation dose for digital X-ray imaging systems. For evaluating the quality of a phantom image, the radiologists are required to indicate the location of the holes in each square in the phantom image. Then, the image quality figure (IQF) of the image can be calculated. However, evaluation by the human eye is subjective as well as time-consuming, and it differentiates from person to person. In this paper, an image processing method based IQF evaluator is proposed to automatically evaluate the quality of a phantom image. The experimental results tell us that the proposed IQF evaluator is more sensitive than the observation of radiologists. Moreover, a genetic algorithm is provided to compute the most suitable values of the parameters used in the IQF evaluator.", "paper_title": "AN AUTOMATIC CONTRAST-DETAIL PHANTOM IMAGE QUALITY FIGURE EVALUATOR IN DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY", "paper_id": "WOS:000301026100004"}
