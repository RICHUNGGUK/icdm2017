However, they all suffered from different types of insider (participants) colluding attacks. In this paper, we present a new IDAGKE protocol from bilinear pairings. In the random oracle model and under some security assumptions, we demonstrate that the proposed protocol is a provably secure IDAGKE protocol providing forward secrecy. Meanwhile, it is secure against insider attacks.", "paper_title": "A Secure ID-Based Authenticated Group Key Exchange Protocol Resistant to Insider Attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291237900007"}
