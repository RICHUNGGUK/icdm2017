Although various automatic segmentation schemes have been proposed, to precisely obtain the user-needed meaningful part of a mesh is a challenging issue. In this paper, we introduce a novel mesh cutout system to efficiently extract meaningful object from a triangular mesh. The algorithm in the current study extends previous min-cut based image segmentation techniques to the domain of 3D mesh. We provide a novel screen-space user interface that allows the user to indicate the meaningful object easily. The results show that our proposed method is relatively simple and effective as a powerful tool for mesh cutout.", "paper_title": "Mesh cutout", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961900029"}
