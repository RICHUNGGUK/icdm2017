This property, called impassivity, is formalised in the framework of a generic value-passing process algebra, called Security Protocol Process Algebra, extended with local function calls, cryptographic primitives and special semantics features in order to cope with cryptographic protocols. Impassivity is defined its ail information flow property founded oil bisimulation-based non-deterministic admissible interference. A sound and complete proof method, based on equivalence-checking, for impassivity is also derived. The method extends results presented in a previous paper on admissible interference and its application to the analysis of cryptographic protocols. Our equivalence-checking method is illustrated throughout the paper oil the TCP/IP connection protocol and oil the 1KP secure electronic payment protocol. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
