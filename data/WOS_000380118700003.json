One can build an important class of coherence measures which cover the relative entropy measure for pure states, the l(1)-norm measure for pure states and the alpha-entropy measure. The optimal conversion of coherent states under incoherent operations is presented which sheds some light on the coherence of a single copy of a pure state.", "paper_title": "COHERENCE MEASURES AND OPTIMAL CONVERSION FOR COHERENT STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000380118700003"}
