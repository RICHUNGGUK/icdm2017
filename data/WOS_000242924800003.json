The embedding dimension (i.e., the number of attributes of the dataset) usually overestimates the actual contribution of the attributes to the main characteristics of the data, as the typical assumption of uniform distribution and independence between attributes usually does not hold. In fact, due to dependencies and attribute correlations, real data are typically skewed and exhibit intrinsic dimensionality much lower than the embedding dimension. Similarly, the intrinsic dimension can also be applied to improve data stream processing and analysis. Data streams are generated as sequences of events represented by a predetermined number of numerical attributes. Thus, without loss of generality, we can consider events as elements from a dimensional domain. This paper presents a fast, linear algorithm to measure the intrinsic dimension of a data stream on the fly, following its continuously changing behavior. Experimental studies show that the intrinsic dimension can be used to analyze attribute correlations. The results on well-understood datasets closely follow what is expected from the known behavior of the data.", "paper_title": "Measuring evolving data streams' behavior through their intrinsic dimension", "paper_id": "WOS:000242924800003"}
