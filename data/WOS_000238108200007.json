This paper presents an interface modelling technique for explicit FE codes. The formulation is based on damage mechanics and uses only two constants for each delamination mode; firstly, a stress threshold for damage to commence, and secondly, the critical energy release rate for the particular delamination mode. The model has been implemented into the LLNL DYNA3D Finite Element (FE) code and the LS-DYNA3D commercial FE code. The interface element modelling technique is applied to a series of common fracture toughness based delamination problems, namely the DCB, ENF and MMB tests. The tests are modelled using a simple dynamic relaxation technique, and serves to validate the methodology before application to more complex problems. Explicit Finite Elements codes, such as DYNA3D, are commonly used to solve impact type problems. A modified BOEING impact test at two energy levels is used to illustrate the application of the interface element technique, and it's coupling to existing in-plane failure models. Simulations are also performed without interface elements to demonstrate the need to include the interface when modelling impact on composite components. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
