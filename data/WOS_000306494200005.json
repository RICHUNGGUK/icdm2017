I argue that we would not be able to locate boundaries even if vague predicates had sharp boundaries. I do so by developing an idealized cognitive model of a categorization faculty which has mobile and dynamic sortals ('classes', 'concepts' or 'categories') and formally prove that the degree of precision with which boundaries of such sortals can be located is inversely constrained by their flexibility. Given the literature, it is plausible that we are appropriately like the model. Hence, an inability to locate sharp boundaries is not necessarily because there are none; boundaries could be sharp and it is plausible that we would nevertheless be unable to locate them.", "paper_title": "Vagueness Intuitions and the Mobility of Cognitive Sortals", "paper_id": "WOS:000306494200005"}
