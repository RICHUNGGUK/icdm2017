It leads to make emerging the E-maintenance philosophy to move from \"fail and fix\" maintenance practices to \"predict and prevent\" strategies. Within these new strategies, the anticipation action is fully supported by prognosis business process. Indeed it analyses the degradation impact on the component itself but also on the global performances of the production system in order to predict future failures of the system and investigate (future maintenance) actions. However, only few research works focuses on generic and scalable prognostic approach. Existing methods are generally restricted on component view and for solving the failure prediction issue. Consequently, the contribution presented in this paper aims at developing a global formalization of the generic prognosis business process. This generic process can be used after, from an instantiation procedure, to develop specific prognosis processes related to particular application such as shown in this paper with the case of E-maintenance platform developed within DYNAMITE Project.", "paper_title": "Generic prognosis model for proactive maintenance decision support: application to pre-industrial e-maintenance test bed", "paper_id": "WOS:000276239300002"}
