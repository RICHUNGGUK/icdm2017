In order to integrate IoT into Chinese daily use, this study also investigated how Chinese users interact with things and IoT technologies. A four-phase study among users living in Beijing was conducted with a lifecycle of user-centered design. Results revealed that SWoT could activate users' intuitive understanding of social network services, and make the interaction with SWoT natural in their own ways. Users living in Beijing tended to be utility-oriented and highly emphasized efficiency; they were distinctive in uncertainty avoidance and preference of hierarchical way of managing things. Our results suggested implications for the design of user-centered IoT systems in China, and shed light on improvements for the performance of IoT systems and balance of requirements between users and system design.
