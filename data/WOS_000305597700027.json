Feature selection and extraction, which are based on a limited training set, are likely to display poor generalization performance on new datasets. To address this challenge, a novel voxel selection method based on association rule (AR) mining is proposed for designing a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system. The proposed method is tested as a tool for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Discriminant brain areas are selected from a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) databases by means of an AR mining process. Simultaneously activated brain regions in control subjects that consist of the set of voxels defining the antecedents and consequents of the ARs are selected as input voxels for posterior dimensionality reduction. Feature extraction is defined by a subsequent reduction of the selected voxels using principal component analysis (PCA) or partial least squares (PLS) techniques while classification is performed by a support vector machine (SVM). The proposed method yields an accuracy up to 91.75% (with 89.29% sensitivity and 95.12% specificity) for SPECT and 90% (with 89.33% sensitivity and 90.67% specificity) for PET, thus improving recently developed methods for early diagnosis of AD.
