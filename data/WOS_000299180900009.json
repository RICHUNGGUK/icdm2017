A column generation algorithm for MSSC was given by du Merle et al. in SIAM Journal Scientific Computing 21:1485-1505. The bottleneck of that algorithm is the resolution of the auxiliary problem of finding a column with negative reduced cost. We propose a new way to solve this auxiliary problem based on geometric arguments. This greatly improves the efficiency of the whole algorithm and leads to exact solution of instances with over 2,300 entities, i.e., more than 10 times as much as previously done.", "paper_title": "An improved column generation algorithm for minimum sum-of-squares clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000299180900009"}
