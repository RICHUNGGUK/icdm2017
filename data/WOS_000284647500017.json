Then, a perfect distributed NSC allocation with the NSC distance larger than coherent bandwidth is devised to fully exploit frequency diversity of wireless channels and achieve a full ERG. Simulations confirmed that the propsoed FFT-based ML method of using this NSC placement has a smaller bandwidth overhead, achieves a fuller ERG and provides a better performance than the existing methods of using the consecutive NSC allocation at middle and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).", "paper_title": "ML integer frequency offset estimation for OFDM systems with null subcarriers: Estimation range and pilot design", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647500017"}
