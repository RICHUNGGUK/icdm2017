However, the steering law can not work when the Jacobian matrix is singular and its pseudo-inverse is indefinite. To avoid the conditions stated above, a new steering law is designed using radial basis function(RBF) neural networks. This algorithm can output the desired gimbal angles directly according to the momentum command. And also, this algorithm can deal with the singular conditions since the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian matrix is not needed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the steering law.", "paper_title": "Steering law design for Single Gimbal Control Moment Gyroscopes based on RBF neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500158"}
