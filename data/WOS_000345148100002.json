Sentiment analysis is undertaken in revealing current customers' satisfaction level towards low-cost airlines. Design/methodology/approach - About 10,895 tweets (data collected for two and a half months) are analysed. Text mining techniques are used during data pre-processing and a mixture of statistical techniques are used to segment the customers' opinion. Findings - The results with two different sentiment algorithms show that there is more positive than negative polarity across the different algorithms. Clustering results show that both K-Means and spherical K-Means algorithms delivered similar results and the four main topics that are discussed by the consumers on Twitter are customer service, LCCs tickets promotions, flight cancellations and delays and post-booking management. Practical implications - Gaining knowledge of customer sentiments as well as improvements on the four main topics discussed in this study, i.e. customer service, LCCs tickets promotions, flight cancellations or delays and post-booking management will help LCCs to attract more customers and generate more profits. Originality/value - This paper provides useful insights on customers' sentiments and opinions towards LCCs by utilizing social media information.", "paper_title": "Gaining customer knowledge in low cost airlines through text mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000345148100002"}
