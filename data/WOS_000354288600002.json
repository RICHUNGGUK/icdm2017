Some of the desirable properties and some special cases are investigated in detail. It is worth pointing out that most of the existing Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy geometric aggregation operators are special cases of this proposed aggregation operator. Furthermore, a decision procedure based on the proposed aggregation operator is developed for solving the multicriteria decision making problem in which all decision information is represented by Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy values. An illustrative example is given for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed decision procedure.", "paper_title": "Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy Quasi-Choquet geometric operators and their applications to multicriteria decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000354288600002"}
