Still, such damage can be assessed indirectly through the analysis of changes in wrist pose and motion pattern. For this purpose we built a statistical reference model that describes healthy motion patterns. We show that such a model can also be used to detect and quantify pathologies. A model that only describes the global translations and rotations of the carpal bones is insufficiently accurate due to size and shape variations of the bones. We present a local statistical motion model that minimizes the influence of size and shape differences by analyzing the coordinate differences of pairs of points on adjacent bone surfaces. These differences are determined in a set of 14 healthy example wrists imaged in a range of poses by means of 4D-RX imaging. The distribution of the differences as a function of the pose form the local statistical-motion model (LSMM). Translations of 2 mm and rotations of 20 degrees with respect to the healthy example wrists are detected as outliers in the point pair distributions. An evaluation involving wrists with a damaged ligament between scaphoid and lunate shows that not only joint space widenings can be detected, but also shifts of congruent bone surfaces. The LSMM is also used to perform a virtual reconstruction of the most likely healthy wrist after a simulated perturbation of bones. The reconstruction precision is shown to be about 1 mm. Therefore, the presented 4D statistical model of wrist bone movement may become a valuable clinical tool for diagnosis and surgical planning.", "paper_title": "A 4D Statistical Model of Wrist Bone Motion Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000301198000009"}
