By using the matrix of synchronous linear correlation coefficients and the appropriate metric distance between pairs of countries, we were able to construct a hierarchical tree of countries. This economic taxonomy provides relevant information regarding liaisons between countries and a meaningful insight about the contagion phenomenon.", "paper_title": "Cross-country hierarchical structure and currency crises", "paper_id": "WOS:000237819800003"}
