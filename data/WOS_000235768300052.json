In multibiometric approaches, finding reasonably disjoint features and effective combining methods are crucial. The proposed method considers the directional characteristics of iris patterns as critical features, and first decomposes an iris image into several directional subbands using a directional filter bank (DFB), then generates two kinds of feature vectors from the directional subbands. One is the binarized output features of the directional subbands on multiple scales and the other is the blockwise directional energy features. The former is relatively robust to changes in illumination or image contrast because it uses the directional zero crossing information of the directional subbands, whereas the latter provides another form of rich directional information though it is a bit sensitive to contrast change. Matching is performed separately between the same kind of feature vectors and the final decision is made by combining the matching scores based on the accuracy of each method. Experimental results show that the two kinds of feature vectors used in this paper are reasonably complementary and the combining method is effective.", "paper_title": "Extracting and combining multimodal directional iris features", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300052"}
