The support of such a series consists of all those words which are not mapped to zero. It is long known that there are recognizable series whose support is not a recognizable, but a context-free language. However, the problem of deciding whether the support of a given recognizable series is recognizable was never considered. Here we show that this problem is undecidable. The proof relies on an encoding of an instance of Post's correspondence problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
