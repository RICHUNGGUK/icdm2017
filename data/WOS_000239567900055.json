In this paper, a new time-varying 3D geometry compression method based on 4D lifted wavelet transform is presented. In this hybrid approach, geometric information and animation are compressed based volume grid values. Isosurfaces are reconstructed from decompressed grid values. With rescaling and integer-to-integer lifting, compression ratio is significantly increased without compromising quality of surfaces.", "paper_title": "Time-varying volume geometry compression with 4D lifting wavelet transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900055"}
