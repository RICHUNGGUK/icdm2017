We have developed a distance-based howling canceller that uses only distance information by noticing the property that howling occurs according to the distance between a loudspeaker and a microphone. This method estimates the distance by transmitting a pilot signal from the loudspeaker to the microphone. Multiple frequency candidates for each howling are computed from the estimated distance and eliminated by cascading notch filters that have nulls at them. However degradation of speech quality occurs at the howling canceller output. The first cause is a shot noise occurrence at the beginning and end of the pilot signal transmission due to the discontinuous change of the amplitude. We thus develop a new pilot signal that is robust against ambient noises. We can then reduce the shot noise effect by taking the amplitude small. The second one is a speech degradation caused from overlapped stopbands of the notch filters. We thus derive a condition on the bandwidths so that stopbands do not overlap, and propose an adaptive bandwidth scheme which changes the bandwidth according to the distance.", "paper_title": "Improvement of Speech Quality in Distance-Based Howling Canceller", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701700015"}
