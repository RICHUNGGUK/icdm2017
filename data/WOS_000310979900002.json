Instead of improving the throughput performance, the utility is adopted as the metric for resource allocation, which provides reasonable methods to build up the relationship between user experience and various quality-of-service (QoS) metrics. After formulating the optimization problem by using a weighted bipartite graph, a modified bipartite matching method is proposed to find a suboptimal solution for the resource allocation problem in OFDMA-based wireless systems with feasible computational complexity. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Utility-based Resource Allocation with Bipartite Matching in OFDMA-based Wireless Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000310979900002"}
