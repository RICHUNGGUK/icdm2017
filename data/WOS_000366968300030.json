In this paper, aiming at reducing the false positive rate of network traffic classification, an effective network traffic classification method --- CMM method. CMM method contains three steps, including dividing the training set into clusters, forming sub-classifiers, and classifier integration in accordance with the principle of minimization and maximization. In this paper, we firstly demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in reducing the false positive rate. Secondly, we conduct experiments in large-scale national backbone network, such as the SSL protocol classification and experimental results verify the effectiveness of this method in large-scale the actual network traffic classification.", "paper_title": "A New Network Traffic Classification Method Based on Classifier Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968300030"}
