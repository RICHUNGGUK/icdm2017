Moreover, due to possible faults, we would like to have at least k vertex-disjoint paths from any node to any other node, where k is some fixed integer, depending on the reliability of the nodes. The goal is to achieve this directed k-connectivity with minimal overall power consumption. The problem is NP-Hard for any k >= 1, already for planar networks. Here we develop an O(k)-approximation algorithm for the planar case. Next, we address the problem of constructing a k-connected backbone, for which we present an O(k(3)) -approximation algorithm.", "paper_title": "Fault-Tolerant Power Assignment and Backbone in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000205770200003"}
