This method combines a quadrature free discontinuous Galerkin method for the level set equation with a pressure stabilized finite element method for the Navier Stokes equations. The main challenge in the computation of such flows is the accurate evaluation Of Surface tension forces. This involves the computation of the curvature of the fluid interface. In the context of the discontinuous Galerkin method, we show that the use of a curvature computed by means of a direct derivation of the level set function leads to inaccurate and oscillatory results. A more robust, second-order, least squares computation of the curvature that filters out the high frequencies and produces converged results is presented. This whole numerical technology allows to simulate a wide range of flow regimes with large density ratios, to accurately capture the shape of the deforming interface of the bubble and to maintain good mass conservation.
