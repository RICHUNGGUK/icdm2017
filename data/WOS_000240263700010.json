The proposed model provides the statistics for the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of multipath components. These statistics are required to test adaptive array algorithms for cellular applications. The proposed model assumes that (1) a line-of-sight (LOS) path exists between the transmitter and the receiver, (2) the scatterers lie within a circle of radius R around the mobile station, and (3) the base station lies within this circle. The distances between the scatterers and the mobile station are subject statistically to a hyperbolic distribution. The model also provides the multipath power delay profiles (PDP), which are used to evaluate the bit error rate (BER) and the signal to interference ratio (SIR) for the direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA). We derive and simulate the joint probability density functions (pdfs) of the power-DOA and the power-Doppler shift. Further we determine expressions for the BER performance and for the SIR of a DS-CDMA system over the proposed channel model. A simplified expression based on the improved Gaussian approximation (SEIGA) is used to evaluate the BER and the SIR in a wideband multipath channel. Although the proposed model is applicable for downlink as well, in this paper we will analyze the uplink environment only.", "paper_title": "A geometrical-based microcell mobile radio channel model", "paper_id": "WOS:000240263700010"}
