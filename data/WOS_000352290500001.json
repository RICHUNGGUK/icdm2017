In this paper we investigate planar monotone drawings in the fixed embedding setting, i.e., a planar embedding of the graph is given as part of the input that must be preserved by the drawing algorithm. In this setting we prove that every planar graph on n vertices admits a planar monotone drawing with at most two bends per edge and with at most 4n-10 bends in total; such a drawing can be computed in linear time and requires polynomial area. We also show that two bends per edge are sometimes necessary on a linear number of edges of the graph. Furthermore, we investigate subclasses of planar graphs that can be realized as embedding-preserving monotone drawings with straight-line edges. In fact, we prove that biconnected embedded planar graphs and outerplane graphs always admit such drawings, and describe linear-time drawing algorithms for these two graph classes.", "paper_title": "Monotone Drawings of Graphs with Fixed Embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000352290500001"}
