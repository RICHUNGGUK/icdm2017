These non-abutting edges in loose tessellations are also called inconsistent boundaries or slivers; polygons containing at least one inconsistent boundary are called inconsistent polygons or sliver polygons. The existing algorithms to solve topological inconsistencies in sliver polygons suffer from one or more of three major issues, namely determination of tolerances, excessive CPU processing time for large data sets and loss of vertex history. In this article, we introduce a new algorithm that mitigates these three issues. Our algorithm efficiently searches the features with inconsistent polygons in a given spatial data set and logically partitions them among adjacent features. The proposed algorithm employs the constrained Delaunay triangulation technique to generate labelled triangles from which inconsistent polygons with gaps and overlaps are identified using label counts. These inconsistent polygons are then partitioned using the straight skeleton method. Moreover, each of these partitioned gaps or overlaps is distributed among the adjacent features to improve the topological consistency of the spatial data sets. We experimentally verified our algorithm using the real land cadastre data set. The comparison results show that the proposed algorithm is four times faster than the existing algorithm for data sets with 200,000 edges.", "paper_title": "Tagging-the-triangle algorithm for partitioning features with inconsistent boundaries", "paper_id": "WOS:000346067100009"}
