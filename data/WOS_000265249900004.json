The solution process involves solving a conservative transport equation for the vorticity fields and a Poisson equation for the stream function fields. The discontinuous Galerkin method is employed for solving the transport equation and a spectral element method (continuous Galerkin) is used for the Poisson equation. A third-order strong stability preserving explicit Runge-Kutta scheme is used for time integration. A series of tests have been performed to validate the model, which include the evolution of an idealized tropical cyclone and interaction of dual vortices in close proximity. The numerical convergence study is performed by solving the BVE on the sphere where the analytic solution is known. The test results are consistent with physical observations, and the model exhibits exponential convergence.
