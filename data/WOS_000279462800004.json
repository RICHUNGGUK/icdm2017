In this paper we consider the case of block sizes 3 and 4. The cases r (3) = 1 and r (4) = 1 correspond to Resolvable Group Divisible Designs (RGDD). We prove that if a 4-RGDD of type h (u) exists then all admissible {3, 4}-URDs with 12hu points exist. In particular, this gives existence for URD with v a parts per thousand 0 (mod 48) points. We also investigate the case of URDs with a fixed number of k -pc. In particular, we show that URDs with r (3) = 4 exist, and that those with r (3) = 7, 10 exist, with 11 and 12 possible exceptions respectively, this covers all cases with 1 < r (3) a parts per thousand currency sign 10. Furthermore, we prove that URDs with r (4) = 7 exist and that those with r (4) = 9 exist, except when v = 12, 24 and possibly when v = 276. In addition, we prove that there exist 4-RGDDs of types 2 (142), 2 (346) and 6 (54). Finally, we provide four {3,5}-URDs with 105 points.", "paper_title": "On uniformly resolvable designs with block sizes 3 and 4", "paper_id": "WOS:000279462800004"}
