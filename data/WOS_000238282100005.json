They are facing some serious problems in the heterogeneous, autonon-c, dynamic and distributed decision support environment. As an advanced technology representing \"the third Internet revolution\", Grid brings about a lot of innovative ideas and technologies for the development of DSS. As an application of Grid in the field of DSS, this paper puts forward an improved model of Agent Grid Based DSS. A set of design methods of the system is discussed. With the National Economic Mobilization DSS as a practical case, we illustrate how the model works in practice.", "paper_title": "Modeling and design of agent grid based open decision support system", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100005"}
