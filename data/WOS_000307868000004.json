The proposed algorithm predicts the tag ID by using the number of collided bits and the number of 1's in tag response signal. Even if tag collision occurs in the identification process, the reader identifies the RFID tag through prediction based on information provided by the extra bits. If the number of 1's to be included in collided bits is 1 or collided bits -1, the reader identifies tags as many as the number of collided bits.", "paper_title": "A Tag Prediction Anti-Collision Algorithm using extra bits for RFID tag identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000307868000004"}
