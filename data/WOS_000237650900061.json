This paper is intended to help the design lifecycle and progress management in ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria). There are many defects that cause the security requirement problems during the software development. This paper explores the areas of the lifecycle and progress management that remove the security requirements and also manage the schedule and quality problems. For projects in similar domains, it is possible to remove security risk items and to manage progress by using security lifecycle and progress milestone, which can greatly improve the software process.", "paper_title": "Design progress management for security requirements in ubiquitous computing using COQUALMO", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900061"}
