We show that a specific local image patch with degradation characteristic can be utilized for restoring the whole image. In the training process, a clear counterpart of the local image patch is constructed based on the ideal edge assumption so that identification of the Point Spread Function is no longer needed. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on remote sensing images.", "paper_title": "Learning from Ideal Edge for Image Restoration", "paper_id": "WOS:000327168600022"}
