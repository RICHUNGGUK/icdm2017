Published strategies for CVA vaguely and unhelpfully tell the reader to 'guess'. Artificial intelligence algorithms for CVA can fill in the details that replace 'guessing' by 'computing'; these details can then be converted to a curriculum that can be taught to students to improve their reading comprehension. Such algorithms also suggest a way out of the Chinese Room and show how holistic semantics can withstand certain objections.", "paper_title": "Contextual vocabulary acquisition as computational philosophy and as philosophical computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000245056200001"}
