However, clustering of widely cited articles is not robust to small variations in citation patterns. We propose an alternative algorithm, dense network sub-grouping, which identifies dense groups of co-cited references. We demonstrate the algorithm using a data set from the field of family business research and compare it to two alternative methods, multidimensional scaling and clustering. We also introduce a free software tool, Sitkis. that implements the algorithm and other common bibliometric methods. The software identifies journal-, country- and university-specific citation patterns and co-citation groups, enabling the identification of \"invisible colleges.\".", "paper_title": "A dense network sub-grouping algorithm for co-citation analysis and its implementation in the software tool Sitkis", "paper_id": "WOS:000235904000009"}
