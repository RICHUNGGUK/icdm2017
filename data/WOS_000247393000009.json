In a BLN, a multicast service is defined as the periodical delivering of messages from a Service Server to a set of mobile devices which are the multicast members predefined by the Service Server. Several multicast protocols have been proposed for the Ad-Hoc networks, but they create an inefficient multicast tree for the BLN due to the existing differences in the radio characteristics between Ad-Hoc and Bluetooth radio networks. The present paper analyzes these differences and proposes a novel multicasting protocol for constructing an efficient multicast tree in a BLN. The proposed protocol constructs a multicast tree with good features which include the shortest path, a higher degree of path sharing, and fewer forwarding nodes. Simulation results reveal that the proposed multicast protocol outperforms the existing multicast protocols in the BLN. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
