For this reason, methods tor analyzing the diagnosability of a system and determining which sensors are needed to achieve the desired degree of diagnosability are highly valued. This paper clarifies the different diagnosability properties of a system and proposes a model-based method for: 1) assessing the level of discriminability of a system, i.e., given a set of sensors, the number of faults that can be discriminated, and its degree of diagnosability, i.e., the discriminability level related to the total number of anticipated faults; and 2) characterizing and determining the minimal additional sensors that guarantee a specified degree of diagnosability. The method takes advantage of the concept of componentsupported analytical redundancy relation, which considers recent results crossing over the fault detection and isolation and diagnosis communities. It uses a model of the system to analyze in an exhaustive manner the analytical redundancies associated with the availability of sensors and performs from that a full diagnosability assessment. The method is applied to an industrial smart actuator that was used as a benchmark in the Development and Application of Methods for Actuator Diagnosis in Industrial Control Systems European project.", "paper_title": "Diagnosability analysis based on component-supported analytical redundancy relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000241438600011"}
