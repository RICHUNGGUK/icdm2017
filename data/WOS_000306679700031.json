The methodology uses social networks whose nodes are organizational units and whose arcs are transfers of work between two organizational units in terms of business processes. Social networks are analyzed using various SNA techniques. Redesigning guidelines are given using the analysis results. This methodology can be used to design an optimal organizational structure in terms of business processes and vice versa. A case study is presented to illustrate the validity and applicability of the methodology. This is also expected to contribute to enhancing the organizational performance.", "paper_title": "A METHODOLOGY FOR REDESIGNING AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE BASED ON BUSINESS PROCESS MODELS USING SNA TECHNIQUES", "paper_id": "WOS:000306679700031"}
