The SPST switch with an active chip area of only 96 mu m x 140 mu m achieves the measured 11-dB return loss, 1.6-dB insertion loss, and 27.9-dB isolation at 60 GHz. The SPST switch also shows the simulated power-handling capability of 11.4 dBm and switching speed of 1 ns at 60 GHz. These results clearly demonstrate that the SPST switch in CMOS rivals the performance of SPST switches in GaAs and therefore has potential to be used in highly-integrated 60-GHz CMOS radios.
