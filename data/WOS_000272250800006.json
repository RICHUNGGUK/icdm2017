These algorithms try to minimize the blocking probability of new calls subject to the constraint on the dropping probability of the handoff calls. To evaluate the proposed algorithms, computer simulations are conducted. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms are close to the performance of the limited fractional guard channel algorithm for which prior knowledge about traffic parameters are needed. The simulation results also show that the proposed algorithms outperforms the recently introduced dynamic guard channel algorithms.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE LIMITED FRACTIONAL GUARD CHANNEL ALGORITHMS: A LEARNING AUTOMATA APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000272250800006"}
