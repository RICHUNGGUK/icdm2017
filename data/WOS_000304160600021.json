The larger-the-better quality characteristics of flattening strength and T-slot fracture strength as well as the smaller-the-better quality characteristic of extrusion load is considered in the MPCI. Through MPCI inference model, a manufacture method with less extrusion load and better mechanical properties under hot extrusion can be obtained. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios of the three quality characteristics-flattening strength, T-slot fracture strength and extrusion load-are calculated for the products based on experimental results. And the S/N ratio serves as the input variable to fuzzy control unit, and MPCI is a single output variable. The obtained MPCI is used to analyze optimal process parameters. This study finds combination of process parameters that optimizes MPCI, and conducts confirmatory experiments to prove the accuracy of optimal combination of process parameters thus selected. Finally, mechanical properties of AZ31, AZ61 magnesium alloy and A6061 aluminum alloy bicycle carriers are tested to identify differences among these three materials.", "paper_title": "Application of fuzzy-based Taguchi method to the optimization of extrusion of magnesium alloy bicycle carriers", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160600021"}
