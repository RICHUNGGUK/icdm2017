By using our technique to prove n instances simultaneously, we can bring down the proof size per instance to O(|x|+n) bits for the same error probability while using no computational assumptions. Examples where our technique applies include proofs for quadratic residuosity, proofs of subgroup membership and knowledge of discrete logarithms in groups of unknown order, interval proofs of the latter, and proofs of plaintext knowledge for various types of homomorphic encryption schemes. We first propose our protocols as I -protocols pound and extend them later to zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge.", "paper_title": "On the Amortized Complexity of Zero-Knowledge Protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000332791100004"}
