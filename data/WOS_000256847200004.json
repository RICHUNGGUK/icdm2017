This paper describes a 3D finite element dynamic analysis of single shot impacting on a metallic component. The model is first validated against a published numerical study. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the effect of shot diameter, impact velocity, incident angle and component material properties on the resulting residual stress profile. Several meaningful conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of shot diameter, impact velocity, incident angle and initial yield stress. The effect of strain-hardening parameter is more complex as it depends on the relative magnitude of the strain-hardening yield stress to the initial yield stress and the impact energy.
