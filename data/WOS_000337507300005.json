In our system, propositions take truth values in a set of multiple fuzzy linguistic terms, which people use in everyday life. And we use a uninorm operator to aggregate the linguistic truth values of the same proposition but drawn from two different rules because uninorms can reflect well that the aggregated result of two somehow negative truth values of the same proposition should be more negative, the aggregated result of two somehow positive ones should be more positive, and the result of a negative one and a positive one is a compromise. In this system, the belief on a proposition is the linguistic truth of the proposition in the most possible world according to the current preference over all possible worlds. In the light of new information, the preference degrees of possible worlds will be updated. Accordingly, the most possible world will be changed to another and thus an old belief on a propositional formula will be changed to the linguistic truth of the proposition in the new most possible world. Moreover, we prove the soundness and completeness of our fuzzy dynamic belief revision system. In addition, we also prove that our belief revision method in fuzzy environment satisfies some relevant ones of standard AGM postulates (named after the names of their proponents, Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson).
