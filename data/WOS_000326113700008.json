Many works can be found in the literature addressing formal modeling and control techniques for switched-mode systems, but they commonly deal with control design and simulation. The focus of this paper is to automate the design of supervisors for industrial switched-mode processes composed by multirate loops, in order to automatically generate the code of the supervisor. Its function is to detect changes in the process operation mode and to switch to the control algorithm accordingly. The target control equipment is the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and, thus, the software architecture generated follows the IEC 61131-3 standard. The tool developed captures information related to the overall control system(inputs and outputs and control algorithms), as well as to the discrete dynamic of the switched-mode process from the simulation model and automatically generates the supervisor code as well as a time-driven schedule for every supervisor's mode. The improvement of the overall system performance using the switched-mode supervisor is analyzed experimentally through a performance index.", "paper_title": "Automatic Generation of the Supervisor Code for Industrial Switched-Mode Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700008"}
