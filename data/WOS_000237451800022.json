The idea is to use statistical methods to identify a confidence region for the line and exploit the structure of the sample data falling in this region for identifying the most fitting line. The fitness function is related to the fuzziness of the sampled points as a natural extension of the statistical criterion ruling the identification of the confidence region within the Algorithmic Inference approach. We tested the method on three well known benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Granular regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451800022"}
