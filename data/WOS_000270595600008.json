We first design a simple and practical TCP-based multipath streaming scheme, named Dynamic MPath-streaming (DMP-streaming), which dynamically distributes packets over multiple paths by implicitly inferring the available bandwidths on these paths. To allow systematic performance study, we develop an analytical model for DMP-streaming and validate the model using extensive ns simulation and Internet experiments. We explore the parameter space of this model and find that DMP-streaming generally provides satisfactory performance when the aggregate achievable TCP throughput is 1.6 times the video bitrate, when allowing a few seconds of startup delay. Last, we comment on the benefits of using multipath versus single path for TCP-based streaming.", "paper_title": "Multipath Live Streaming via TCP: Scheme, Performance and Benefits", "paper_id": "WOS:000270595600008"}
