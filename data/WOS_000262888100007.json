In many cases, however, some aspects of a graph-theoretic problem may be uncertain. For example, the vehicle travel time or vehicle capacity on a road network may not be known exactly. In such cases, it is natural to make use of fuzzy set theory to deal with the uncertainty. Here, we are concerned with finding shortest chains in a graph with fuzzy distance for every edge. We propose a dynamic programming approach to solve the fuzzy shortest chain problem using a suitable ranking method. By using MATLAB, two illustrative examples are worked out to demonstrate the proposed algorithm. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
