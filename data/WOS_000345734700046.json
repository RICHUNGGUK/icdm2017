The choices of control parameters and mutation strategies would directly affect the performance of differential evolution (DE) algorithm in satisfying the evolution requirement of each optimized variable and balancing its exploitation and exploration capabilities. Therefore, a self-adaptive DE algorithm with discrete mutation control parameters (DMPSADE) is proposed. In DMPSADE, each variable of each individual has its own mutation control parameter, and each individual has its own crossover control parameter and mutation strategy. DMPSADE was compared with 8 state-of-the-art DE variants and 3 non-DE algorithms by using 25 benchmark functions. The statistical results indicate that the average performance of DMPSADE is better than those of all other competitors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
