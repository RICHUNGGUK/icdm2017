In order to count the decomposables, one wants to know, under a suitable normalization, the number of equal-degree collisions of the form f = g circle h = g* circle h* with (g, h) not equal (g*, h*) and deg g = deg g*. Such collisions only occur in the wild case, where the field characteristic p divides deg f. Reasonable bounds on the number of decomposables over a finite field are known, but they are less sharp in the wild case, in particular for degree p(2). We provide a classification of all polynomials of degree p(2) with a collision. It yields the exact number of decomposable polynomials of degree p(2) over a finite field of characteristic p. We also present an efficient algorithm that determines whether a given polynomial of degree p(2) has a collision or not. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
