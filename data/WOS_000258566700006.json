Data transformation is thus avoided by using the methodology proposed. Model fitting is implemented by proposing the asymmetric deviance information criterion, ADIC, a modification of the ordinary DIC. We also report an application of the model studied by using a real data set, related to the relationship between the resistance and the elasticity of a sample of concrete beams.
