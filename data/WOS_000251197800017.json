It first predicts the CDSs supported by consensus alignments. The alignments are derived from multiple genome-to-proteome comparisons with other prokaryotes using the FASTX program. Then, it fills the empty genomic regions with the CDSs supported by consensus ab initio predictions. From those consensus results, CONSORF provides prediction reliability scores, predicted frame-shifts, alternative start sites and best pair-wise match information against other prokaryotes. These results are easily accessed from a website.
