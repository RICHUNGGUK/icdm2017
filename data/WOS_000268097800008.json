The key differentiator among manufacturers today is the number of cores that they pack onto a single chip. The clock frequency of commodity processors has reached its limit, however, and is likely to stay below 4 GHz for years to come. As a result, adding cores is not synonymous with increasing computational power. To take full advantage of the performance enhancements offered by the new multi-core hardware, a corresponding shift must take place in the software infrastructure - a shift to parallel computing.", "paper_title": "PARALLEL PROGRAMMING IN MATLAB", "paper_id": "WOS:000268097800008"}
