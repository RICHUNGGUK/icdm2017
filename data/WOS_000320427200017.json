The code uses a hybrid front-tracking/front-capturing technique to solve for two immiscible fluids simultaneously on a regular 3D Cartesian grid. The pressure solver uses a multigrid method to solve a Poisson-like equations with variable coefficients. A Schwarz-Aitken acceleration technique is applied to the solver, and the results analysed.
