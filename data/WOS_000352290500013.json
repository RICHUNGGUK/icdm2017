In this theoretical work, we propose, motivate, and analyze a combinatorial model where, given a matrix over a finite alphabet whose rows correspond to individuals and columns correspond to attributes of individuals, the user specifies lower and upper bounds on team sizes as well as combinations of attributes that have to be homogeneous (that is, identical) for all members of the corresponding teams. Furthermore, the user can define a cost for assigning any individual to a certain team. We show that some special cases of our new model lead to NP-hard problems while others allow for (fixed-parameter) tractability results. For example, the problem is already NP-hard even if (i) there are no lower and upper bounds on the team sizes, (ii) all costs are zero, and (iii) the matrix has only two columns. In contrast, the problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable for the combined parameter \"number of possible teams\" and \"number of different individuals\", the latter being upper-bounded by the number of rows.", "paper_title": "Using Patterns to Form Homogeneous Teams", "paper_id": "WOS:000352290500013"}
