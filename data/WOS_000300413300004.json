First, a novel time-delay switched descriptor state observer is proposed to estimate both the state and sensor fault. The proposed observer technique is also extended to systems with nonlinearities. Then, based on the estimation of the sensor fault, an efficient fault-tolerant operation can be realised via sensor fault compensation. Finally, an example is given to show the efficiency of the developed techniques.", "paper_title": "Sensor fault estimation and compensation for time-delay switched systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300413300004"}
