So the camera parameters and their variety have close relationship with semantic information of soccer video, and much interest has been caught in camera calibration for soccer video. The previous calibration methods either deal with goal scene, or have strict calibration conditions and high complexity. So, it does not properly handle the non-goal scene such as midfield or center-forward scene. In this paper, based on a new soccer field model, a field symbol extraction algorithm is proposed to extract the calibration information. Then a two-stage calibration approach is developed which can calibrate camera not only for goal scene but also for non-goal scene. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate its robustness and accuracy. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
