The classical versions of these theorems play important roles in various problems of mathematical analysis, including boundary value problems of elliptic equations. We demonstrate how their computable versions yield computable solutions of the Neumann and Dirichlet boundary value problems for a simple non-symmetric elliptic differential equation in the one-dimensional case. For the discussion of these elementary boundary value problems, we also provide a computable version of the Theorem of Schauder, which shows that the adjoint of a computably compact operator on Hilbert spaces is computably compact again.
