These queries usually include the semantic information that is represented by text, as well as the visual information that is represented by a high-dimensional feature vector. Among the available techniques for processing such queries, the incremental nearest neighbor algorithm proposed by Hjaltason and Samet is known as the best choice. However, the R-tree used in their algorithm has no facility capable of partially pruning the candidate tuples that will turn out not to satisfy the semantic predicate. Also, the R-tree does not perform sufficiently well on high-dimensional data even though it provides good results on low or middle-dimensional data. These drawbacks may lead to a poor performance when processing the query. In this paper, we propose an integrated index structure, so-called SPY-TEC+, that provides an efficient method for indexing the visual and semantic feature at the same time using the SPY-TEC that was proposed for indexing high-dimensional data, and the signature file. We also propose an efficient incremental nearest neighbor algorithm for processing k-nearest neighbor queries with visual and semantic predicates on the SPY-TEC+. Finally, we show that the SPY-TEC+ enhances the performance of the SPY-TEC for processing k-nearest neighbor queries with visual and semantic predicates through various experiments.", "paper_title": "SPY-TEC+: AN INTEGRATED INDEX STRUCTURE FOR k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR QUERIES WITH SEMANTIC PREDICATES IN MULTIMEDIA DATABASE", "paper_id": "WOS:000299173500004"}
