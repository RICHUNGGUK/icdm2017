The controlled finite Markov chain (CFMC) approach enables to deal with a large variety of signals and systems with multivariable, nonlinear, and stochastic nature. In this article, adaptive control based on multiple models is considered. For a set of candidate plant models, CFMC models (and controllers) are constructed off-line. The outcomes of the CFMC models are compared with frequentist information obtained from on-line data. The best model (and controller) is chosen based on the Kullback-Leibler information. This approach to adaptive control emphasizes the use of physical models as the basis of reliable plant identification. Three series of simulations are conducted: to examine the performace of the developed Matlab-tools; to illustrate the approach in the control of a nonlinear nonminimum phase van der Vusse CSTR plant; and to examine the suggested model selection method for the adaptive control.", "paper_title": "Multiple Model-Based Control Using Finite Controlled Markov Chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000207987200003"}
