The module will also function as a component to measure discourse engagement in natural conversational speech. This paper presents the results of an analysis into the sounds of human laughter in a very large corpus of naturally occurring conversational speech and our classification of the laughter types according to social function. Various types of laughter were categorized into either polite or genuinely mirthful categories and the analysis of these laughs forms the core of this report. Statistical analysis of the acoustic features of each laugh was performed and a Principal Component Analysis and Classification Tree analysis were performed to determine the main contributing factors in each case. A statistical model was then trained using a Support Vector Machine to predict the most likely category for each laugh in both speaker-specific and speaker-independent manner. Better than 70% accuracy was obtained in automatic classification tests. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
