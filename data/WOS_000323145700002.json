One drawback of pairwise likelihood inference is that, for a multidimensional parameter of interest, the pairwise likelihood analogue of the likelihood ratio statistic does not have the standard chi-square asymptotic distribution. Invoking the theory of unbiased estimating functions, this paper proposes and discusses a computationally and theoretically attractive approach based on the derivation of empirical likelihood functions from the pairwise scores. This approach produces alternatives to the pairwise likelihood ratio statistic, which allow reference to the usual asymptotic chi-square distribution and which are useful when the elements of the Godambe information are troublesome to evaluate or in the presence of large data sets with relative small sample sizes. Two Monte Carlo studies are performed in order to assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed empirical pairwise likelihoods.", "paper_title": "A note on empirical likelihoods derived from pairwise score functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000323145700002"}
