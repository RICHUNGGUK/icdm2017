Alternate forms of the choices of dependent variables in the governing differential equations (GDEs) are considered and is concluded that u, v, p, tau choice yielding strong form of the GDEs is meritorious over others. It is shown that: (a) since, the differential operator in the GDEs is non-linear, Galerkin method and Galerkin method with weak form are variationally inconsistent (VIC). The coefficient matrices in these processes are non-symmetric and hence may have partial or completely complex basis and thus the resulting computational processes may be spurious. (b) Since the VC of the VIC integral forms cannot be restored through any mathematically justifiable means, the computational processes in these approaches always have possibility of spurious solutions. (c) Least squares process utilizing GDEs in u, v, P, T (strong form of the GDEs) variables (as well as others) is variationally consistent. The coefficient matrices are always symmetric and positive definite and hence always have a real basis and thus naturally yield computational processes that are free of spurious solutions. (d) The theoretical solution of the GDEs are generally of higher order global differentiability. Numerical simulations of such solutions in which higher order global differentiability characteristics of the theoretical solution are preserved, undoubtedly requires local approximations in higher order scalar product spaces H-k,H-p((Omega) over bar (e)). (e) LSP with local approximations in H-k,H-p((Omega) over bar (e)) spaces provide an incomparable mathematical and computational framework in which it is possible to preserve desired characteristics of the theoretical solution in the computational process. Numerical studies are presented for fully developed flow between parallel plates and a lid driven square cavity. M1 fluid is used in all numerical studies. The range of applicability of the Oldroyd-B model or lack of it is examined for both model problems for increasing De. A mathematical idealization of the corners where stationary wall meets the lid is presented and is shown to simulate the real physics when the local approximations are in higher order spaces and when h(d) -> 0. For both model problems shear rate gamma is examined in the flow domain to establish validity of the Oldroyd-B constitutive model.
