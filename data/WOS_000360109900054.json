How to obtain the correlation between software metrics and module's fault-proneness has been the focus of much research. This paper presents the application of hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) and Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) in software fault-proneness prediction. ANN is used for classifying software modules into fault-proneness or non fault-proneness categories, and QPSO is applied for reducing dimensionality. The experiment results show that the proposed prediction approach can establish the correlation between software metrics and modules' fault-proneness, and is very simple because its implementation requires neither extra cost nor expert's knowledge. Proposed prediction approach can provide the potential software modules with fault-proneness to software developers, so developers only need to focus on these software modules, which may minimize effort and cost of software maintenance.
