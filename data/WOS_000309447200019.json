These include the temporal logics CTL and EF, and first-order logic over the ancestor relation. While the characterizations are in general non-effective, we are able to use them to formulate necessary conditions for definability and provide new proofs that a number of languages are not definable in these logics.", "paper_title": "WREATH PRODUCTS OF FOREST ALGEBRAS, WITH APPLICATIONS TO TREE LOGICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309447200019"}
