Previous studies rely on constant transmission duration, which would fail to leverage more opportunities in time and frequency domain. In this paper, we consider opportunistic channel accessing/releasing scheme in multichannel system with Rayleigh fading channels. Our main goal is to derive a throughput-optimal strategy for determining when and which channel to access and when to release it. We formulate this real-time decision-making process as a two-dimensional optimal stopping problem. We prove that the two-dimensional optimal stopping rule can be reduced to a simple threshold-based policy. Leveraging the absorbing Markov chain theory, we obtain the optimal threshold as well as the maximum achievable throughput with computational efficiency. Numerical and simulation results show that our proposed channel utilization scheme achieves up to 140 percent throughput gain over opportunistic transmission with a single channel and up to 60 percent throughput gain over opportunistic channel access with constant transmission duration.", "paper_title": "Optimal Frequency-Temporal Opportunity Exploitation for Multichannel Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310382800010"}
