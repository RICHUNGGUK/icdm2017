The CYPED currently integrates sequence and structure data of 3911 and 25 proteins, respectively. Proteins are grouped into homologous families and superfamilies according to Nelson's classification. Nonclassified CYP sequences are assigned by similarity. Functionally relevant residues are annotated. The web accessible version contains multisequence alignments, phylogenetic trees and HMM profiles. The CYPED is regularly updated and supplies all data for download. Thus, it provides a valuable data source for phylogenetic analysis, investigation of sequence-function relationships and the design of CYPs with improved biochemical properties.", "paper_title": "The Cytochrome P450 Engineering Database: a navigation and prediction tool for the cytochrome P450 protein family", "paper_id": "WOS:000249248400019"}
