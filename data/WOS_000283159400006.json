In this paper, we present a novel approach to enhance temporal coherence in video painting. Instead of painting on video frame, our approach first partitions the video into multiple motion layers, and then places the brush strokes on the layers to generate the painted imagery. The extracted motion layers consist of one background layer and several object layers in each frame. Then, background layers from all the frames are aligned into a panoramic image, on which brush strokes are placed to paint the background in one-shot. The strokes used to paint object layers are propagated frame by frame using smooth transformations defined by thin plate splines. Once the background and object layers are painted, they are projected back to each frame and blent to form the final painting results. Thanks to painting a single image, our approach can completely eliminate the flickering in background, and temporal coherence on object layers is also significantly enhanced due to the smooth transformation over frames. Additionally, by controlling the painting strokes on different layers, our approach is easy to generate painted video with multi-style. Experimental results show that our approach is both robust and efficient to generate plausible video painting.", "paper_title": "Video Painting via Motion Layer Manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000283159400006"}
