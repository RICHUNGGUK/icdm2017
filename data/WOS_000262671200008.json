This yields a new lower bound on the second largest size of complete caps. A variant of our construction also produces one of the two previously known complete 20-caps in PG(3, 5). The associated code weight distribution and other combinatorial properties of the new (q (2) + q + 8)/2-caps and the 20-cap in PG(3, 5) are investigated. The updated table of the known sizes of the complete caps in PG(3, q) is given. As a byproduct, we have found that the unique complete 14-arc in PG(2, 17) contains 10 points on a conic. Actually, this shows that an earlier general result dating back to the Seventies fails for q = 17.", "paper_title": "Complete (q (2) + q+8)/2-caps in the spaces PG(3, q), q equivalent to 2 (mod 3) an odd prime, and a complete 20-cap in PG(3,5)", "paper_id": "WOS:000262671200008"}
