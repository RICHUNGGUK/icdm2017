In particular, two encoders, connected by two communication links with finite capacities, wish to send secret messages to the common intended decoder in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. The inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity are derived for the discrete memoryless channel. The derived inner bound rate region is achievable by combining Willems's coding for the MAC with partially cooperating encoders and Wyner's random binning for the wiretap channel. Then, both the inner and outer bounds are extended to the Gaussian case and the corresponding rate regions are established. Several simple achievable transmission schemes are proposed for the Gaussian channel and the numerical results show that the partial encoder cooperation can increase the achievable rate regions.", "paper_title": "Rate Regions for Multiple Access Channel With Conference and Secrecy Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000327345700006"}
