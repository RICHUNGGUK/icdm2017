In this paper, we provide a group theoretic method for constructing a robust class of such partitions. It is known that a mixed partition of PG( 2n - 1, q2) can be used to construct a ( 2n - 1)- spread of PG(4n - 1, q) and, hence, a translation plane of order q(2n). Here we show that our partitions can be used to construct generalized Andre planes, thereby providing a geometric representation of an infinite family of generalized Andre planes. The results are then extended to produce mixed partitions of PG(rn - 1, qr) for r = 3, which lift to (rn - 1)- spreads of PG(r(2)n - 1, q) and hence produce 2-(q(r2n), q(rn), 1) ( translation) designs with parallelism. These designs are not isomorphic to the designs obtained from the points and lines of AG(r, q(rn)).", "paper_title": "Mixed partitions and related designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000249298700004"}
