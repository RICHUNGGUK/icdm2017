Thus, ranking e-commerce websites in e-alliance is of importance, which is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This paper proposes an evaluation model based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy sets and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), to tackle the issue in fuzzy environment. The AHP is applied to analyze the structure of ranking problem and to determine weights of the criteria, fuzzy sets is utilized to present ambiguity and subjectivity with linguistic values parameterized by triangular fuzzy numbers, and TOPSIS method is used to obtain final ranking. Case analysis is conducted to illustrate the utilization of the model for the problem. It demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model.
