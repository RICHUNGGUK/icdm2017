More precisely, the BAM model is considered with mixed delays which includes a constant delay in the leakage term, time-varying discrete delay and constant distributed delay. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) together with free-weighting matrix technique, a new delay dependent sufficient condition is derived to estimate the neuron states through available output measurements such that, for all admissible delay bounds, the resulting estimation error system is globally asymptotically stable. Also it is assumed that the derivative of time delay is not necessarily zero or less than one. Further the derived conditions are formulated in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily solved by using some standard numerical packages. Finally a numerical example with simulation result is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed theory. The result reveals that the leakage delays have a destabilizing influence on the system and they cannot be ignored. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
