Our approach utilizes a new multiobjective evolutionary algorithm called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution algorithm (NSJADE) to optimize the weights of neural networks (NNs) for the short-term replenishment forecasting problem, acquiring the forecasting accuracy while alleviating the overfitting effect at the same time. The presented NSJADE also selects the appropriate number of hidden nodes for the NN according to different short-term replenishment forecasting problems. Extensive experiments based on real fashion industry data are performed to validate the effectiveness of the developed model. Experimental results reveal that the performance of the proposed model is superior than several popular models for the short-term replenishment forecasting problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
