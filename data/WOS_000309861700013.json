One possibility involves quantization domain and the majority of the work devoted to bit rate reduction focuses on this aspect only. The other possibility is to modify a video in time or space domain i.e. change the frames per second FPS rate or frame resolution FR. In this paper we present two no reference metrics mapping FPS rate and FR into MOS (Mean Opinion Scale). The performance of both models is significantly improved by incorporating content characteristics such as spatial information SI and temporal information TI. The impact on Quality of Experience (QoE) of both content characteristics is discussed with relation to the FPS rate and FR changes and general conclusions are drawn. The models were estimated and verified upon results of subjective experiments performed using video sequences of diverse spatial and temporal variability. The considered FPS rate was changed from 5 to 30 and the considered FR was changed from SQCIF to SD.", "paper_title": "Content driven QoE assessment for video frame rate and frame resolution reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000309861700013"}
