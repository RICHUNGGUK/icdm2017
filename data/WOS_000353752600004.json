The algorithms developed so far support structured and Cartesian meshes as well as octree-based and block-structured local mesh refinement in the vicinity of the fluid interface. Using unstructured meshes for domain discretization represents a standard way to deal with flow domains of arbitrary geometrical complexity. Local dynamic Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) enables efficient simulations of two-phase flows by providing accuracy where it is most needed: near the fluid interface. In this work we present a first to our knowledge hybrid Level Set/Front Tracking DNS method of two-phase that supports both accurate and very efficient computations on unstructured meshes. Additionally, calculations in both two-and-three dimensions are supported. The implementation has been developed within the OpenFOAM framework and is to be released as Open Source.
