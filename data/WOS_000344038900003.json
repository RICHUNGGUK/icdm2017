A monograph may be made even rarer and more valuable by virtue of hand written marginalia. Using technology to enhance scans of unique books and make previously unreadable marginalia readable increases the value of a digital object to researchers. This article describes a case study of enhancing the marginalia in a rare book by Copernicus.", "paper_title": "Adding Value to the University of Oklahoma Libraries History of Science Collection through Digital Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000344038900003"}
