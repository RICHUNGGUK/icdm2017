The optimal scheduling of computing resources (OSCR) over the network is a core part for a cloud service center. With the coming of virtualization, the OSCR problem has become more complex than ever. Previous work, either on model building or scheduling algorithms, can no longer offer us a satisfactory resolution. In this paper, a more comprehensive and accurate model for OSCR is formulated. In this model, the cloud computing environment is considered to be highly heterogeneous with processors of uncertain loading information. Along with makespan, the energy consumption is considered as one of the optimization objectives from both economic and ecological perspectives. To provide more attentive services, the model seeks to find Pareto solutions for this bi-objective optimization problem. On the basis of classic multi-objective genetic algorithm, a case library and Pareto solution based hybrid Genetic Algorithm (CLPS-GA) is proposed to solve the model. The major components of CLPS-GA include a multi-parent crossover operator (MPCO), a two-stage algorithm structure, and a case library. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of CLPS-GA in terms of convergence, stability, and solution diversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
