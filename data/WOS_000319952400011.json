A new WFW (WiMAX for WiFi) module which enables WiMAX fulfill the procedure of bandwidth request-confirm-grant for WiFi was described with a modified MAC layer of which MSH-DSCH (Mesh Distributed control message) renewed, and thus overhead of interacting of WiFi control message was eliminated. The schedule is then evaluated through simulations in two typical transmission scenarios. Numerical results show that more effective WiFi/WiMAX heterogonous networks which offer QoS guarantees are obtained with the utilization of the scheme. The efficiency of WiFi Mesh networks increase sharply without obvious decrease of WiMAX performance.", "paper_title": "A Tight Coupling Cooperation Scheme in WiFi/WiMAX Heterogeneous Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319952400011"}
