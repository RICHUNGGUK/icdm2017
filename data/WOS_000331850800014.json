Also, Iranmanesh et al. in [7], introduced the edge-Wiener index of a graph. It obtains in term of the distances between all pairs of edges set of a graph. We define a new index called the multiplicative edge-Wiener index that is equal to product of distance between all pairs of edges set of a graph G. Moreover, we compute this index for some well-known graphs and we consider its relation to the edge-Wiener index in alkanes, as well.", "paper_title": "The Multiplicative Version of the Edge Wiener Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000331850800014"}
