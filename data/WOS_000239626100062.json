Being the two main arguments, threat and reward can even make the negotiators reduce their behavior space to find a well compromise quickly in the end, which can make them accomplish their cooperation on the base of getting the most profit of each of them. This paper presents a type of formal models of threat and reward first, and then present a new way of how to calculate the negotiation strengths of them through simulated calculations based on the models to make the negotiators threatened or rewarded make a right choice and accomplish their cooperation well.", "paper_title": "Using two main arguments in agent negotiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100062"}
