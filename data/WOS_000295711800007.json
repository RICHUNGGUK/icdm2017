Design/methodology/approach - Based on the valid responses collected from a questionnaire survey, the structural equation modelling technique was employed to examine the research model. Findings - The results indicate that system quality is the main factor affecting perceived ease of use, whereas information quality is the main factor affecting perceived usefulness. Service quality has significant effects on trust and perceived ease of use. Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and trust determine user satisfaction. Practical implications - Mobile service providers need to improve the system quality, information quality and service quality of mobile web sites to enhance user satisfaction. Originality/value - Previous research has mainly focused on e-commerce web site success and seldom examined the factors affecting mobile web site success. This research fills the gap. The research draws on information systems success theory, the technology acceptance model and trust theory as the theoretical bases.", "paper_title": "Examining the critical success factors of mobile website adoption", "paper_id": "WOS:000295711800007"}
