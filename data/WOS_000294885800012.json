One of the fundamental problems of localisation is to determine whether or not a network is uniquely localisable. To address this problem, existing approaches often adopt the rigidity theory, which assumes accurate inter-node distance measurements. Considering the measurement errors, we introduce the concept of strong localisability and propose an algorithm, called LAS, to identify and locate a kind of strongly localisable networks. Besides, we further conduct extensive simulations to show the performance of LAS design.", "paper_title": "Beyond rigidity: obtain localisability with noisy ranging measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000294885800012"}
