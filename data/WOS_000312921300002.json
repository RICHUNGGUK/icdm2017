Under some conditions, it shows that the DCNNs can exhibit 3(n) equilibrium points. Then, we track the dynamics of u(t)(t > 0) in two cases with respect to different types of subset regions in which u(0) is located. It concludes that every solution trajectory u(t) would converge to one of the equilibrium points despite the time-varying delays, that is, the delayed cellular neural networks are completely stable. The method is novel and the results obtained extend the existing ones. In addition, two illustrative examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of our results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
