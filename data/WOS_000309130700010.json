The basic idea consists of designing an equivalent inductor, using only capacitors and CCVSs. The signal-flow graph technique is used for this purpose. The CCVSs are emulated by means of nullator/norator pairs. These elements are then realized using second generation current conveyors (CCIIs), and a combination of CCIIs and operational transconductance amplifiers. In addition, a novel design of simulated inductors using operational transresistance amplifiers is presented. The proposed inductors were used to design filters. SPICE simulations are given to highlight viability and to show good reached results.", "paper_title": "On the design of active inductors with current-controlled voltage sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000309130700010"}
