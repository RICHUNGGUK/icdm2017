We call a point x is an element of P a strong centerpoint of P w.r.t..F if x is contained in all F is an element of F that contains more than cn points of P, where c is a fixed constant. A strong centerpoint does not exist even when F is the family of halfspaces in the plane. We prove the existence of strong centerpoints with exact constants for convex polytopes defined by a fixed set of orientations. We also prove the existence of strong centerpoints for abstract set systems with bounded intersection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
