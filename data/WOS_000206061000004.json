The method monitors the physical layer transmission mode on layer two and exploits the gained knowledge at layer three. The mechanism bases on link adaptation, which is used in IEEE 802.11 a WLAN to select the transmission mode according to the link quality. The process of link adaptation contains information that is useful to predict link stability and link lifetime. After introducing the IEEE 802.11a Medium Access Control (MAC) and PHY layer, we present insight to the IEEE 802.1 la link adaptation behaviour in multi-hop ad hoc networks. The link adaptation algorithm presented here is derived from Auto Rate Fallback (ARF) algorithm. We survey the performance gain of two newly developed route adaptation approaches exploding the prediction results. One approah is Early Route ReArrangement (ERRA) that starts a route reconstruction procedure before link breakage. Hence, an alternative route is available before connectivity is lost. Early Route Update (ERU) is a complementing approach that enhances this process, by communications among routing nodes surrounding the breaking link. The delay caused by route reconstruction can be significantly reduced if prediction and either of our new route discovery processes is used. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
