Many aspects, such as technical equipment, furniture, and usage patterns in these surroundings differ. Thus, personalization of applications that operate in such environments is required. The challenge for tools and programming paradigms is to provide a powerful but yet easy-to-use platform. In this paper we illustrate how our visual scripting language puts these requirements for programming ubiquitous computing environments into action.", "paper_title": "Scripting your home", "paper_id": "WOS:000237667100018"}
