Major cellular components were incorporated in the model: the membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, microtubules, actin filaments, intermediate filaments, nuclear lamina and chromatin. The model used multiple sets of tensegrity structures. Viscoelastic properties were assigned to the continuum components. To corroborate the model, a simulation of atomic force microscopy indentation was performed and results showed a force/indentation simulation with the range of experimental results. A parametric analysis of both increasing membrane stiffness (thereby modelling membrane peroxidation with age) and decreasing density of cytoskeletal elements (thereby modelling reduced actin density with age) was performed. Comparing normal and aged cells under indentation predicts that aged cells have a lower membrane area subjected to high strain as compared with young cells, but the difference, surprisingly, is very small and may not be measurable experimentally. Ageing is predicted to have a more significant effect on strain deep in the nucleus. These results show that computation of biophysical stimuli within cells are achievable with single-cell computational models; correspondence between computed and measured force/displacement behaviours provides a high-level validation of the model. Regarding the effect of ageing, the models suggest only small, although possibly physiologically significant, differences in internal biophysical stimuli between normal and aged cells.", "paper_title": "Effect of membrane stiffness and cytoskeletal element density on mechanical stimuli within cells: an analysis of the consequences of ageing in cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000345142700002"}
