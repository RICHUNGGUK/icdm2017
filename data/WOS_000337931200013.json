The basic task is to classify network activities (in the network log as connection records) as normal or abnormal while minimizing misclassification. Although different classification models have been developed for network intrusion detection, each of them has its strengths and weaknesses, including the most commonly applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) method and the Clustering based on Self-Organized Ant Colony Network (CSOACN). Our new approach combines the SVM method with CSOACNs to take the advantages of both while avoiding their weaknesses. Our algorithm is implemented and evaluated using a standard benchmark KDD99 data set. Experiments show that CSVAC (Combining Support Vectors with Ant Colony) outperforms SVM alone or CSOACN alone in terms of both classification rate and run-time efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
