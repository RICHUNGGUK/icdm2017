This places an upper bound on the lifetime of quantum information stored in them. We address this issue for a topological subsystem code introduced in [Bravyi S. et al., Quant. Inf. Comp. 13(11):0963]. By frequently measuring the gauge operators of the code, a technique known as Operator Quantum Zeno Effect [Li Y. et al., preprint arXiv:1305.2464], the dynamics responsible for quasiparticle motion is suppressed, and can eventually be \"frozen\" in the large frequency limit. A feature of this method is that the density operator of the code does not commute with the measurement operators, so the density matrix will be randomised after a few measurements. However the logical operators commute with the measurement operators and are thus protected.", "paper_title": "QUASIPARTICLE LOCALISATION VIA FREQUENT MEASUREMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579900006"}
