So the first model is called bidirectional X4-flyer and the second one is called conventional X4-flyer. The impact of the planning of the trajectory for the control of the engines, consequently economy in energy, is shown. The stabilizing (tracking) feedback control used with and without motion planning is based on receding horizon point to point steering. The developed control algorithm of the X4-flyer is based on the Lyapunov method and is obtained using the backstepping techniques. This enabled to stabilize the engine in hovering and to generate its trajectory. All the forces developed by the two models are studied and simulated. Finally, results of simulations are given for the two models.", "paper_title": "Two inertial models of X4-flyers dynamics, motion planning and control", "paper_id": "WOS:000246043800001"}
