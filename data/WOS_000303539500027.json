Here, we report an in silico study on a group of 220 reported Aurora-A inhibitors with six different substructures. Three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) studies were carried out using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) techniques on this series of molecules. The resultant optimum 3D-QSAR models exhibited an r(cv)(2) value of 0.404-0.582 and their predictive ability was validated using an independent test set, ending in r(pred)(2) 0.512-0.985. In addition, docking studies were employed to explore these protein-inhibitor interactions at the molecular level. The results of 3D-QSAR and docking analyses validated each other, and the key structural requirements affecting Aurora-A inhibitory activities, and the influential amino acids involved were identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on 3D-QSAR modeling of Aurora-A inhibitors, and the results can be used to accurately predict the binding affinity of related analogues and also facilitate the rational design of novel inhibitors with more potent biological activities.", "paper_title": "Probing the structural requirements of A-type Aurora kinase inhibitors using 3D-QSAR and molecular docking analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000303539500027"}
