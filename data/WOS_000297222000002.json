Our approach is based on the rational Newton-Puiseux algorithm introduced by D. Duval. In particular, we prove that coefficients of F may be significantly truncated and that certain complexity upper bounds may be expressed in terms of the output size. These preliminary results lead to a more efficient version of the algorithm with a complexity upper bound that improves previously published results. We also deduce consequences for the complexity of the computation of the genus of an algebraic curve defined over a finite field or an algebraic number field. Our results are practical since they are based on well established subalgorithms, such as fast multiplication of univariate polynomials with coefficients in a finite field.", "paper_title": "Complexity bounds for the rational Newton-Puiseux algorithm over finite fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000297222000002"}
