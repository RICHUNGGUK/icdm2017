For solving the hybrid QoS-aware semantic web service composition problem, this paper presents an Uncertain Multi-attribute decision making based Composition algorithm (UMC). The UMC includes two parts. First, UMC-Core can be used to synthetically evaluate the hybrid service quality information. Second, UMC-DH (Distributed and Heuristic framework for UMC) aims at enhancing the run-time performance of UMC when the problem space increases. The simulation results show that the UMC has lower execution cost, higher approximation ratio and success ratio than other similar approaches.", "paper_title": "Hybrid QoS-aware semantic web service composition strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000260122000013"}
