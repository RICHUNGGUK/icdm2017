The primary tools used here are Hopf bifurcation theory and perturbation theory. Explicit results are obtained for the post-bifurcation periodic orbits and their stability. Generalized and degenerate Hopf bifurcations are also briefly considered to track the emergence of global structure such as homoclinic orbits. (c) 2006 IMACS.
