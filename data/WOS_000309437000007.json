A simplified type-2 fuzzy sliding controller is designed for suppressing wing rock phenomena and tracking the desired trajectories. To reduce the computational complexity of a type-reducer, the end points of a type-reduced set are approximated by the outputs of two standard fuzzy sliding mechanisms in the proposed simplified type-2 fuzzy sliding controller. Furthermore. the sliding modes of the fuzzy sliding control system are guaranteed. Simulation results are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed simplified type-2 fuzzy sliding controller. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
