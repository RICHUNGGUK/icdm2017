Common approaches for analyzing these systems include Markov processes, renewal theory, and random walks. This article presents optimization models for sample paths of closed tandem queues. These mathematical models provide a new tool for analyzing these queueing systems using the techniques and algorithms from mathematical programming, and from graph theory in particular. We then apply operators from computer graphics (electronic picture manipulation) to graph theoretic representations of discrete-event system dynamics to establish some fundamental mathematical properties for these queueing systems.", "paper_title": "Mathematical Programming Models of Closed Tandem Queueing Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262497400003"}
