However, it remains difficult to deal with the uncertainty and complexity generated by the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). This paper launches the challenge by introducing cognitive modeling for specifying decision-maker behaviors more naturally and intuitively. It consists in introducing cognitive modeling for dynamic situations involving visual KDD-based dynamic DSS. This research work presents an adaptation of a well-known cognitive model under the KDD specificities. We provide cognitive modeling application in visual KDD-based dynamic DSS for the fight against nosocomial infections in an intensive care unit Finally, we built a series of evaluations verifying the system's utility and usability.
