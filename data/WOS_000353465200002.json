For this distribution, some recurrence relations are established for the single and product moments of order statistics. These recurrence relations enable the computation of the means, variances and covariances of all order statistics for all sample sizes in a simple and efficient recursive manner. By using these relations, we have tabulated the means, variances and covariances of order statistics from samples of sizes up to 10 for various values of the shape parameter theta. These values are in turn used to determine the best linear unbiased estimator of the scale parameter beta based on complete and Type-II right-censored samples.", "paper_title": "Recursive computation of the single and product moments of order statistics from the complementary exponential-geometric distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000353465200002"}
