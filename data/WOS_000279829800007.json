FRIT searches control parameters so that the plant output follows the reference model output, which specifies an ideal response for the reference signal. However, if an inappropriate reference model is selected, FRIT might possibly derive improper control parameters. In particular, the reference model which requires too fast a response from a controlled plant often makes the closed loop system unstable. This paper, therefore, proposes a modified FRIT method, which, while optimizing the plant's control parameters, simultaneously tunes the delay parameter of the reference model. Since the proposed method adjusts the rise time of the reference model output by tuning the delay parameter, it can avoid the problem of selecting an inappropriate reference model. The paper also extends the analytical pre-filter for the one-shot experimental input-output data in the conventional FRIT, to the case for the proposed FRIT with simultaneous delay parameter tuning of the reference model. Finally, a numerical example is shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A FICTITIOUS REFERENCE ITERATIVE TUNING METHOD WITH SIMULTANEOUS DELAY PARAMETER TUNING OF THE REFERENCE MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800007"}
