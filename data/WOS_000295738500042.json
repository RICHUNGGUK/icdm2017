In its standard formulation, the lemma refers to a notion of randomness that is (usually implicitly) defined with respect to classical side information. Here, a strictly more general version of the Leftover Hash Lemma that is valid even if side information is represented by the state of a quantum system is shown. Our result applies to almost two-universal families of hash functions. The generalized Leftover Hash Lemma has applications in cryptography, e. g., for key agreement in the presence of an adversary who is not restricted to classical information processing.", "paper_title": "Leftover Hashing Against Quantum Side Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738500042"}
