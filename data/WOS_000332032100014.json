One of the obstacles to their wider use is the computational complexity of algorithms for their discovery and counting. Results: We propose a new combinatorial method for counting graphlets and orbit signatures of network nodes. The algorithm builds a system of equations that connect counts of orbits from graphlets with up to five nodes, which allows to compute all orbit counts by enumerating just a single one. This reduces its practical time complexity in sparse graphs by an order of magnitude as compared with the existing pure enumeration-based algorithms.", "paper_title": "A combinatorial approach to graphlet counting", "paper_id": "WOS:000332032100014"}
