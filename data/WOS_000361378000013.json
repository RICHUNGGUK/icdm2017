However, the high computation complexity of the round encryption of AES makes AES hard to be performed on many embedded systems with constrained resource. This paper proposes a novel round encryption method based on a 512-Byte lookup table. The experiments results show that, the AES implementation utilizing the round encryption method proposed reaches an encryption performance comparable to that of the widely used implementation with 4 1-KB lookup tables, while consumes much less storage overhead.", "paper_title": "Low-Cost Round Encryption Method for Embedded System", "paper_id": "WOS:000361378000013"}
