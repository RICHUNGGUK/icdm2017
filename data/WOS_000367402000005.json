The basic idea is to use keyevolving schemes (KES), where the long-term keys of the system get updated regularly and irreversibly. Protocols conforming to our model can be highly efficient, since they do not require the resource-intensive modular exponentiations of the Diffie Hellman protocol. We also introduce a protocol, called FORSAKES, and prove rigorously that it is a forward-secure AKE protocol in our model. FORSAKES is a very efficient protocol, and can be implemented by merely using hash functions.", "paper_title": "FORSAKES: A FORWARD-SECURE AUTHENTICATED KEY EXCHANGE PROTOCOL BASED ON SYMMETRIC KEY-EVOLVING SCHEMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000367402000005"}
