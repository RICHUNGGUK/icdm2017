What is the furthest graph on n vertices from P and what is the largest possible edit distance from P? Denote this maximal distance by ed(n, P). This question is motivated by algorithmic edge-modification problems, in which one wishes to find or approximate the value of E-p (G) given an input graph G. A monotone graph property is closed under removal of edges and vertices. Trivially, for any monotone property, the largest edit distance is attained by a complete graph. We show that this is a simple instance of a much broader phenomenon. A hereditary graph property is closed under removal of vertices. We prove that for any hereditary graph property P, a random graph with an edge density that depends on P essentially achieves the maximal distance from P, that is: ed (n, P) = E-p(G(n,p(P)))+ o(n(2)) with high probability. The proofs combine several tools, including strengthened versions of the Szemeredi regularity lemma, properties of random graphs and probabilistic arguments.
