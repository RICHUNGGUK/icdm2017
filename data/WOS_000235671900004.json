It is developed especially for analog circuit designers who can bring their special knowledge and experience into the synthesis process to create high quality layouts. The layout generation is based on relatively complex sub-circuits rather than non-optimal single devices. A flexible module generator environment is developed for designers to write and maintain technology and application independent module generators of sub-circuits. Based on the thorough study of simulated annealing and genetic algorithm applications in the analog module placement, a genetic placement approach with simulated annealing and a very fast simulated re-annealing placement approach have been developed. A two-stage placement technique is proposed. Analog module routing consists of two phases including global routing and detailed routing. The minimum-Steiner-tree based global routing can be integrated into the placement procedure to improve the routability of placement solutions. The compaction based constructive detailed routing finally realizes the layout of the whole circuit. This tool is integrated into commercial software with convenient interfaces provided. The benefit of ALADIN providing layouts comparable to expert manual ones is demonstrated with several circuits showing its competition compared to other existing tools.", "paper_title": "Aladin: A layout synthesys tool for analog integrated circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000235671900004"}
