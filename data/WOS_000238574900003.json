Primarily, the idea is to enable Web communities to establish and reuse ontology mappings in order to achieve, within those communities, an adequate and timely domain representation, facilitated knowledge exchange, etc. Secondarily, the matching community is provided with the new practice, which is a public alignment reuse. Specifically, we present an approach to construction of a community-driven ontology matching system and discuss its implementation. An analysis of the system usage indicates that our strategy is promising. In particular, the results obtained justify feasibility and usefulness of the community-driven ontology mappings' acquisition and sharing.", "paper_title": "Community-driven ontology matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000238574900003"}
