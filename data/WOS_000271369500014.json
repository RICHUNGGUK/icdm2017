The safety measure of a structure is quantified by a reliability index defined by a nested minimization problem. An iterative procedure is developed for seeking the worst-case point and the most probable failure point in the standard uncertainty space. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the applicability of the probability and convex set mixed model representation in the structural reliability assessment, as well as to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed numerical method.
