This leads to the study of a novel elliptic-hyperbolic system. The hyperbolic nature of the system arises because we replace the infinite speed of propagation from classical, thermal elasticity by a finite propagation velocity. We present a formal derivation of the elliptic-hyperbolic system starting from conservations of mass, momentum, and energy in a three-dimensional domain, where the removal of the infinite propagation speed is achieved using Cattaneo's law for heat conduction. The existence of weak solutions to certain elliptic-hyperbolic problems associated with the resulting equations is proved. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
