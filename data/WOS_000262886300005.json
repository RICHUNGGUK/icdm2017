However, any communication system raises two major challenging issues: (1) how to determine whether actors are whom they claim to be; and (2) how to protect data against unauthorized disclosure. Although the secret-key cryptosystem (SKC) and the public-key cryptosystem (PKC) have been developed to provide well-defined security services to address these issues each has serous drawbacks while SKC-based authentication schemes have the common demerit that the server which maintains the secret-key table becomes an attractive target for numerous intrusions, PKC-based schemes suffer from the expensive complexity of the public-key infrastructure (PKI) and a high computation overhead. Therefore, in this paper, a self-verification authentication mechanism with lower computation and key management cost is introduced.
