This protocol aims to cluster a set of co-regulated genes in subsets of genes showing similar configurations of transcription factor binding sites. All the steps of this protocol have been developed as web services that are compliant with BioMoby specifications.", "paper_title": "BioMoby web services to support clustering of co-regulated genes based on similarity of promoter configurations", "paper_id": "WOS:000249248300017"}
