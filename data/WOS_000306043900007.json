Hence, a quick estimation of concentration of these compounds can significantly contribute to the evaluation process for the quality of finished tea in an objective manner. In this paper, a scheme for rapid measurement of concentration of TF and TR is described using a voltammetric electronic tongue with five working electrodes made of noble metals. The results indicate good correlation of electronic tongue predictions with the actual concentrations obtained using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
