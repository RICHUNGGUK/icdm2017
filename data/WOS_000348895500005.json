In the semantics of P systems, there exists a global clock, which marks the time for the system, and the execution time of each rule takes exactly one time unit. However, in living cells, the execution time of different biochemical reactions is dependent on many uncontrollable factors, and it is hard to know precisely the specific execution time of a reaction. In this work, with this biological inspiration, we consider the class of P systems with active membranes that are \"robust\" against the execution time of rules. Specifically, we give a time-free uniform solution to the SAT problem using P systems with active membranes, where the constructed P system can solve a family of instances with an arbitrarily given size, and the execution time of the involved rules has no influence on the correctness of the solution. We also prove that any Turing computable set of numbers can be generated by a time-free P system with active membranes in the sense that the set of numbers generated by the given P system with active membranes does not depend on the execution time of rules.
