However, its restriction to the convex hull of the data sites is a limitation that has not yet been satisfyingly overcome. We use this setting to discuss some aspects of scattered data extrapolation in general, compare existing methods, and propose a framework for the extrapolation of natural neighbor interpolants on the basis of dynamic ghost points.
