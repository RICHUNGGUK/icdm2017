The synthesis of the controllers is based on a linearired model of the flow using a new set of interpolating polynomials in the wall-normal direction. which automatically satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions at the walls and eliminate spurious eigenvalues. The controllers are implemented into a non-linear Navier-Stokes solver. which is modified to compute the evolution of the flow perturbations. Two cases are examined. one with small initial disturbances that do not violate the linearity assumptions and the other with much larger disturbances that trigger the non-linear convection terms. For the smallest disturbances, the solver accurately reproduced the results of the linear simulations of open- and closed-loop systems. The simulations for the larger disturbances without control showed a rapid initial growth but the flow soon reached a saturated state in agreement with previous findings in the literature. The large initial growth is a consequence of the non-normal nature of the system dynamics. The state feedback and output feedback controllers were able to reduce significantly the perturbation energy. For the larger disturbances, the enemy calculated from the state variables is well below the energy evaluated by direct integration of the velocity field. This is probably due to the non-linear terms transferring energy to harmonics of the considered wavenumber, which are not sensed by the linear controller. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons.
