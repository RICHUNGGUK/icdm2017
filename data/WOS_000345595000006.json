There, this concept was applied to facility location problems. In the current work we apply a similar framework to the maximum independent set problem (MIS). We say that an approximation algorithm has recoverable factor , if for every graph it recovers an independent set of size at least where d(v) is the degree of vertex v, and I ranges over all independent sets in G. Hence, in a sense, from every vertex v in the maximum independent set the algorithm recovers a value of at least /(d(v)+1) toward the solution. This quality measure is most effective in graphs in which the maximum independent set is composed of low degree vertices. A simple greedy algorithm achieves 1. We design a new randomized algorithm for MIS that ensures an expected recoverable factor of at least 7/3. In passing, we prove that approximating MIS in graphs with a given k-coloring within a ratio larger than 2/ k is unique-games hard. This rules out an alternative approach for obtaining 2.
