In this paper, we prove that vertical bar k boolean AND A vertical bar >= vertical bar A vertical bar for all k is an element of {2,..., vertical bar A vertical bar -2}, unless k is an element of {2, vertical bar A vertical bar -2} and A is a coset of an elementary 2-subgroup of G. Furthermore, we characterize those finite sets A subset of G for which vertical bar k boolean AND A vertical bar = vertical bar A vertical bar for some k is an element of {2,..., vertical bar A vertical bar -2}. This result answers a question of Diderrich. Our proof relies on an elementary property of proper edge-colourings of the complete graph.", "paper_title": "k-Sums in Abelian Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000304915900007"}
