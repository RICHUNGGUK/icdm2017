In this article, we describe electropermeabilization of endocytotic vesicles in B16 F1 mouse melanoma cells. The cells were exposed to short, high-voltage electric pulses (from 1 to 20 pulses, 60 ns, 50 kV/cm, repetition frequency 1 kHz). We observed that 10 and 20 such pulses induced permeabilization of membranes of endocytotic vesicles, detected by release of lucifer yellow from the vesicles into the cytosol. Simultaneously, we detected uptake of propidium iodide through plasma membrane in the same cells. With higher number of pulses permeabilization of the membranes of endocytotic vesicles by pulses of given parameters is accompanied by permeabilization of plasma membrane. However, with lower number of pulses only permeabilization of the plasma membrane was detected.", "paper_title": "Electropermeabilization of endocytotic vesicles in B16 F1 mouse melanoma cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000276771800001"}
