Finding optimal order release dates of components is our aim which optimizes problem's performance metrics. There is a determined due date that if demands are not prepared for delivery in that day, backlogging cost would happen. The other noticeable cost that should be taken in to consideration is holding cost, which may occur if components arrive before their time of assembling. In contrast to most of studies in this field that consider sum of these cost, this paper attempts to make a tradeoff between these objectives' affects using multi-objective approach. This approach hybridizes an evolutionary optimizer, genetic algorithm, with an electromagnetism-like mechanism (EM). The algorithm's effectiveness is compared against an adapted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) which has been presented for this problem.
