Thus, countermeasure device is Currently required in many fields for sleepiness related accident prevention. This paper intends to perform the drowsiness prediction by employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) with eyelid related parameters extracted from EOG data collected in a driving simulator provided by EU Project SENSATION. The dataset is firstly divided into three incremental drowsiness levels, and then a paired t-test is done to identify how the parameters are associated with drivers' sleepy condition. With all the features, a SVM drowsiness detection model is constructed. The validation results show that the drowsiness detection accuracy is quite high especially when the subjects are very sleepy.
