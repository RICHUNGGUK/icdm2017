However, performance of manifold learning heavily depends on the manual selection of parameters, resulting in bad adaptability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new dimensionality reduction method called discriminative sparsity preserving projections (DSPP). Different from the existing sparse subspace algorithms, which manually construct a penalty adjacency graph, DSPP employs sparse representation model to adaptively build both intrinsic adjacency graph and penalty graph with weight matrix, and then integrates global within-class structure into the discriminant manifold learning objective function for dimensionality reduction. Extensive experimental results on four image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
