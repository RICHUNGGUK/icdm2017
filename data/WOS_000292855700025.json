In terms of classifications of the four bases, (0, 1)-characteristic sequences of a DNA sequence can be obtained, which can reveal its different functions. The conditional LZ complexity (CLZ) measure proposed in this paper is an alignment free method, which takes three (0, 1)-characteristic sequences of a DNA primary sequence as its side information. This method enables biologists to extract information from biological sequences according to their purpose. Further, based on CLZ complexity we present a new method to construct a phylogeny trees using complete unaligned mtDNA sequences. The proposed method relies on LZ complexity, which takes the (0, 1)-characteristic sequences as its side information. The method does not require sequence alignment and is totally automatic. Reasonable phylogeny trees are constructed by the method, which are largely in agreement with previously published trees based on the analysis of identical data sets.", "paper_title": "Conditional LZ Complexity and Its Application in mtDNA Sequence Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000292855700025"}
