Although collaborative relay beamforming schemes for single user have been widely investigated for cellular systems in previous literatures, there are few studies on the relay beamforming for multiusers. In this paper, we study the collaborative downlink signal transmission with multiple amplify-and-forward relay nodes for multiusers in cellular systems. We propose two new algorithms to determine the beamforming weights with the same objective of minimizing power consumption of the relay nodes. In the first algorithm, we aim to guarantee the received signal-to-noise ratio at multiusers for the relay beamforming with orthogonal channels. We prove that the solution obtained by a semidefinite relaxation technology is optimal. In the second algorithm, we propose an iterative algorithm that jointly selects the base station antennas and optimizes the relay beamforming weights to reach the target signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio at multiusers with nonorthogonal channels. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed optimal schemes can effectively reduce the relay power consumption compared with several other beamforming approaches.
