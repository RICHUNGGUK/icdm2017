The formulation is associated to symmetry and pattern repetition constraints, including material gradation effects at both global and local levels. For instance, constraints associated with pattern repetition are applied by considering material gradation either on the global structure or locally over the specific pattern. By means of pattern repetition, we recover previous results in the literature which were obtained using homogenization and optimization of cellular materials.", "paper_title": "Layout and material gradation in topology optimization of functionally graded structures: a global-local approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000283362500004"}
