In this paper, we present a new color image segmentation algorithm based on PDTDFB domain hidden Markov tree (HMT) model. Firstly, the joint statistics and mutual information of the PDTDFB coefficients are studied. Then, the PDTDFB coefficients are modeled using a HMT model with Gaussian mixtures, which can effectively capture the intra-scale, inter-scale, and inter-direction dependencies. Finally, a color image segmentation using PDTDFB domain HMT model is developed, in which expectation-maximization (EM) parameter estimation, Bayesian multiscale raw segmentation, context based multiscale fusion, and majority-vote based color component fusion are used. Experimental evidence shows that the proposed color image segmentation algorithm has very effective segmentation results in comparison with the state-of-the-art segmentation methods recently proposed in the literature.
