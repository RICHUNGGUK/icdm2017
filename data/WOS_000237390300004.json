When tracing the haptic tool interacting with objects, the body-based force evaluation model based on Hertz's contact theory including both frictional and frictionless contacts is developed in our system. Physical properties of different object materials expressed by Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus are involved to simulate the realistic touch perception between the haptic tool and objects. The neighborhood of transmitted force is dynamically determined in relation to the contact load, and a discrete solution method is applied to accelerate the computation rate of realistic haptic interaction. Our experimental results have shown satisfactory performance of the body-based haptic model we have developed while interacting in touch-enabled virtual environments.", "paper_title": "Body-based haptic interaction model for touch-enabled virtual environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000237390300004"}
