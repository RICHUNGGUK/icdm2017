We propose a framework of scene recognition, based on bag of visual words and topic model. We achieve the task using the topicmodel by belief propagation (TMBP), which belongs to the family of the latent Dirichlet allocation model. We also extend the TMBP model, called as the knowledge TMBP model, by introducing the prior information of visual words and scenes. Experimental results on the static and dynamic scenes demonstrated that our proposed framework is effective and efficient. The scene semantics can be obtained from two levels of visual words and topics in our framework. Our result significantly outperforms the others using low-level visual features, such as spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal features.", "paper_title": "Learning topic of dynamic scene using belief propagation and weighted visual words approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000347407500008"}
