We propose a method to find a solution to the non-convex optimization problem using an exact expression of the outage probability. However, the complexity of this method is high. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach in which we use an asymptotically equivalent expression for the outage probability and reformulate it as a geometric programming problem (GPP), which can be efficiently solved using convex optimization algorithms.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Power Allocation for HARQ with Chase Combining in Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681200013"}
