Every omega-regular objective can be decomposed into a safety part and a liveness part. The liveness part ensures that something good happens \"eventually.\" Two main strengths of the classical, infinite-limit formulation of liveness are robustness (independence from the granularity of transitions) and simplicity (abstraction of complicated time bounds). However, the classical liveness formulation suffers from the drawback that the time until something good happens may be unbounded. A stronger formulation of liveness, so-called finitary liveness, overcomes this drawback, while still retaining robustness and simplicity. Finitary liveness requires that there exists an unknown, fixed bound b such that something good happens within b transitions. While for one-shot liveness (reachability) objectives, classical and finitary liveness coincide, for repeated liveness (Buchi) objectives, the finitary formulation is strictly stronger. In this work we study games with finitary parity and Streett objectives. We prove the determinacy of these games, present algorithms for solving these games, and characterize the memory requirements of winning strategies. We show that finitary parity games can be solved in polynomial time, which is not known for infinitary parity games. For finitary Streett games, we give an EXPTIME algorithm and show that the problem is NP-hard. Our algorithms can be used, for example, for synthesizing controllers that do not let the response time of a system increase without bound.", "paper_title": "Finitary Winning in omega-Regular Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000272039900001"}
