For a healthy individual, the HRV shows a nonlinear behavior, thus requiring a nonlinear approach to provide additional information about HRV dynamics. In this work, the nonlinear techniques, central tendency measure (CTM) and second-order difference plot, are applied to HRV analysis using the successive difference of RR intervals in a time series. In total are analyzed 170 tachograms collected by Polar monitor and then classified into three groups according to a cardiologist: healthy young adults, adults in preoperative evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting for severe coronary disease and premature newborns. This approach identified the tachograms with high and low variability, which demonstrates the ability of CTM to classify and quantitatively characterize cardiac RR intervals.", "paper_title": "Assessment of heart rate variability by application of central tendency measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000365752800012"}
