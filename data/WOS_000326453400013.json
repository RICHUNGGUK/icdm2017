The advantage of the MP-TIA that is explored in this work is in its third-order transfer function, which provides additional degrees of freedom in tailoring the performance. Pole and zero locations of the MP-TIA transfer function are examined and verified with behavioural simulations. The theoretical transimpedance limit for MP-TIAs based on two SF-sTIAs is derived. The possibility of further increasing the transimpedance limit vs bandwidth trade-off by combining three and four sub-TIAs is investigated with simulations. A transistor-level design example of an MP-TIA is presented. The 0.13-mu m CMOS MP-TIA achieves the largest figure-of-merit among published TIAs.", "paper_title": "On the use of multi-path inductorless TIAs for larger transimpedance limit", "paper_id": "WOS:000326453400013"}
