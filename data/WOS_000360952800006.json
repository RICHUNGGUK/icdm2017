In our formulation, the tracking task is decomposed into several local tasks by dividing the whole target into several fragments, and the final tracking result is obtained by combining the local tasks. Specifically, we propose a global regularization term and inject it into the objective function of the multi-local-task learning formulation, and derive a closed-form solution. In our method, both the local and the global properties are embedded into a unified framework, which can not only retain the integral structure of the target by the global regularization, but also address the occlusions effectively by the local tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is robust and achieves comparable performance to many state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
