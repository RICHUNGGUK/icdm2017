In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient self-stabilizing topology control protocol for WSN. We reduce the transmission power of each node so as to maintain network connectivity while saving maximum energy. Besides, we propose an approximation algorithm for minimum weighted connected dominating set that builds a virtual backbone formed by sensors with maximum energy. This backbone is used for efficient routing purpose. We pr.oved the algorithm correctness and through our simulation results, we showed the efficiency of our proposed solution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
