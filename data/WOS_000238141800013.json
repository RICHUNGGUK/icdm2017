This paper presents an iterative technique for transient and passage time analysis of large structurally unrestricted semi-Markov processes. Our method is based on the calculation and subsequent numerical inversion of Laplace transforms and is amenable to a highly scalable distributed implementation. Results for a distributed voting system model with up to 1.1 million states are presented and validated against simulation. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
