Therefore, it is necessary to design a fault-tolerant network. A feasible method is to construct a k-connected (k-vertex connected) topology. In this paper, we consider k-connectivity of wireless network and propose a simple global algorithm (GAFT(k)) which preserves the network k-connectivity and reduces the maximal transmission power (TP). The average degree expectation of the topology generated by GAFT(k) is O ((k + 3)(2)) and the expected weight is O ((k+3)(2)/12 root pi nn(e)) Based on GAFT(k), we further propose an efficient localised algorithm (LAFT(k)) which preserves k-vertex connectivity while maintaining bi-directionality of the network. In addition, both algorithms achieve significant reductions in energy consumption. Our simulation results show that GAFT/LAFT have better performance than some other current fault-tolerant protocols.", "paper_title": "Construction of low weighted and fault-tolerant topology for wireless ad hoc and sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000330612200001"}
