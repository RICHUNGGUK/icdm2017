In particular, we have proposed the following algorithms for the weighted cactus networks of size n: an O(n log n) time algorithm to solve the 1-center problem, and an 0 (n log(3) n) time algorithm to solve the weighted continuous 2-center problem. We have also provided improved solutions to the general p-center problems in cactus networks. The developed ideas are then applied to solve the obnoxious 1-center problem in weighted cactus networks.
