The identification of meters for Arabic verses or poems is a complicated task. This task requires a certain level of expertise to identify the meter to which a verse belongs. In this paper, we present BASRAH (1) , a system that automatically identifies the meter of Arabic poetry by using the numerical prosody method. The numerical prosody method depends on verse coding, which is derived from the general concept of Al-Khalil's feet by using two primary units (cord = 2) and (peg = 3). On testing both old and modern Arabic verses and poems, BASRAH has proved to be an efficient tool to help inexperienced users to determine the meter of Arabic verses and poems.", "paper_title": "BASRAH: an automatic system to identify the meter of Arabic poetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000332383400005"}
