It assumes that hypothetical water flows, front both left and right sides of the image frame, face obstruction from characters of text lines. The stripes of areas left unwetted on the image frame are finally labelled for extraction of text lines. The success rate of the technique, as observed experimentally, are 90.34% and 91.44% for handwritten Bengali and English document images, respectively. The work may contribute significantly for the development of applications related to optical character recognition of Bengali/English text. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
