L. and Liang, K.-Y., 1986, Longitudinal data analysis for discrete and continuous outcomes. Biometrics, 42, 121-130.] to analyse discrete and continuous longitudinal data. Our proposal generalises well-known measures ( projection matrix, Cook's distance and standardised residuals) developed for independent responses. Moreover, half-normal probability plots with simulated envelopes were developed for assessing the adequacy of the fitted model when the marginal distributions belong to the exponential family. To obtain such a plot, correlated outcomes were generated by simulation using algorithms described in the literature. Finally, two applications were presented to illustrate the techniques.", "paper_title": "Diagnostic techniques in generalized estimating equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000250228900005"}
