It is largely grouped into the following 5 categories: (1) fuzzy number based risk assessment; (2) fuzzy rule-based risk assessment; (3) fuzzy extension of typical probabilistic risk assessment; (4) ordinal linguistic approach for risk assessment; and (5) miscellaneous applications. In addition, the role of CWW within the broad area of risk assessment is briefly characterized.", "paper_title": "Computing with Words in Risk Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000282754200003"}
