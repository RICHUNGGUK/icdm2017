Using the layered representation introduced by Gouveia [Gouveia, L. 1998. Using variable redefinition for computing lower bounds for minimum spanning and Steiner trees with hop constraints. INFORMS J. Comput. 10(2) 180-188], we present a formulation for the problem valid for any K, L >= 1. We use a Benders decomposition method to efficiently handle the large number of variables and constraints. We show that our Benders cuts contain constraints used in previous studies to formulate the problem for L = 2, 3, 4, as well as new inequalities when L >= 5. Whereas some recent works on Benders decomposition study the impact of the normalization constraint in the dual subproblem, we focus here on when to generate the Benders cuts. We present a thorough computational study of various branch-and-cut algorithms on a large set of instances including the real-based instances from SNDlib. Our best branch-and-cut algorithm combined with an efficient heuristic is able to solve the instances significantly faster than CPLEX 12 on the extended formulation.", "paper_title": "Benders Decomposition for the Hop-Constrained Survivable Network Design Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000315322400003"}
