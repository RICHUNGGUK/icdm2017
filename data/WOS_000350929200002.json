This generates an uncertainty about the events received from the sensors, which is translated into a confidence given to these events. This confidence is used in the context-aware reasoning through a fusion of sensor data to make more accurate decisions. In this paper, we focus on handling uncertainty in sensor-based context aware applications and we propose a method for the measurement of uncertainty based on both physical and operational behaviors of the sensors. We describe how the level of uncertainty is incorporated into different layers of a semantically driven context aware system and how it is transferred to a decision engine in order to perform more accurate decisions in ambiguous observations.
