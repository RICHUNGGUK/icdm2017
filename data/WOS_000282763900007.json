A new construct for remote objects, called No-heap Remote object (NhRo), is introduced. The use of a NhRo guarantees that memory required to perform a remote invocation (at the server side) does not use heap memory. Thus, the aim is to avoid garbage collection in the remote invocation process, improving predictability and memory isolation of distributed Java-based real-time applications. The article presents the bare model and the main programming patterns that are associated with the NhRo model. Sun RMI implementation has been modified to integrate the NhRo model in both static and dynamic environments.", "paper_title": "NO-Heap Remote Objects for Distributed Real-Time Java", "paper_id": "WOS:000282763900007"}
