In this paper, the existence and global exponential stability of periodic solution are discussed for the Cohen-Grossberg-type bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with time-varying delays. By applying the analysis method and inequality technique, some novel sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the existence, uniqueness, global attractivity and exponential stability of the periodic solution to the considered system. Moreover, two examples are also given to demonstrate the feasibility of the obtained results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
