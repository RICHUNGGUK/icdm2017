Specifically, the qualitative shape description scheme defined is a pragmatic scheme since it has been defined in order to be applied in the automatic and intelligent assembling of trencadis mosaics.", "paper_title": "A Pragmatic Qualitative Approach for Juxtaposing Shapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000282703500003"}
