Personalizing information has long been the motivation behind developing e-learning systems. Adaptive educational systems attempt to maintain a learning style profile for each student and use this profile to adapt the presentation and navigation of instructional content to each student. This kind of system adapts the learning process on the basis of the student's learning preferences, knowledge, and availability. One such Web-based tool is built at the Business School of Professional Studies in Blace (the system of intelligent evaluation using tests), which infers student knowledge using adaptive testing. The knowledge is not evaluated according to fixed standards, but it depends on individual characteristics of each student, therefore, the learning style which is the most suitable. This system is part of the integrated assessment system inside of integrated curriculum. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
