We first provide an outer bound on the capacity region of this channel. We then show that, when the channel of the transmitter-receiver pair that does not experience interference is deterministic and invertible, our proposed outer bound matches the best known inner bound. The obtained results imply that in the considered channel, superposition encoding at the noncognitive transmitter as well as Gel'fand-Pinsker encoding at the cognitive transmitter is needed in order to minimize the impact of interference. As a byproduct of the obtained capacity region, we obtain the capacity under the generalized Gel'fand-Pinsker setting where a transmitter-receiver pair communicates in the presence of interference noncausally known at the encoder.", "paper_title": "Capacity Bounds and Exact Results for the Cognitive Z-Interference Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000313728800011"}
