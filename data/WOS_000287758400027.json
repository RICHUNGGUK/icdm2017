PUGSVM provides a simple yet more accurate strategy to identify statistically reproducible mechanistic marker genes for characterization of heterogeneous diseases.", "paper_title": "PUGSVM: a caBIG (TM) analytical tool for multiclass gene selection and predictive classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000287758400027"}
