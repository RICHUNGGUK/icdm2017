In this note, we give a brute-force strategy for playing Hangman perfectly, and discuss a practical implementation with amny optimizations. We then show two simpler algorithms, which are vastly more computationally efficient and, in parctice, have almost optimal behaviour. Finally, we discuss (1) some directions in which the speed of the optimal algorithm could be improved heuristically, and (2) further results which might be gathered.", "paper_title": "PLAYING PERFECT HANGMAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000275838600004"}
