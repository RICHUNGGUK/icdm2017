The orientation codes obtained by the filters correspond to different parts of an image (foreground or background) and thus different orientations offer different levels of discrimination performance. We have conducted an orientation component analysis on both FVs and FDT. Based on the analysis, an OS scheme is devised which combines' the discriminative orientation features of both modalities. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Feature-Level Fusion of Finger Veins and Finger Dorsal Texture for Personal Authentication Based on Orientation Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784200041"}
