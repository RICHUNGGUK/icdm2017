Many critical infrastructure applications of our daily life are built on gird systems. Then, survivability becomes a necessary property of and computing. In dynamic and complex network environment, grid systems face different binds of attacks. failures and accidents that appear frequently. And At the same time new challenges for survivability arise with characteristics of grid system. To resolve them, We focus Oil Continuous providing of critical mission, which determines survivability of the whole grid system. We utilize PVA, methods of conservation biology. for viability analysis of critical mission and some parameters. which are helpful for predicating viability. Hence, we can achieve survivability of grid system using results Of viability.", "paper_title": "Viability of critical mission of grid computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800026"}
