For the sake of achieving real-time and reducing the computational time costs, the fuzzy Kohonen clustering network (FKCN) is used for modeling and visualization. However, determining the physical parameters of differential equation is very difficult and sometimes different equation should be solved to produce animations, which become ill-conditioned. The finite element model is normally very time-consuming, since an appropriate structure must be defined. The proposed method can be more easily implemented than the finite element method. The simulation results show that the neural network method produced plausible animation results.", "paper_title": "Real-time approach for cloth simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000208118700005"}
