This study considers the mutations related to this approach from the manufacturing system level to the industrial enterprise as a whole. The eXtended Manufacturing Integrated System concept is introduced to fill in the gap of the current manufacturing data exchange bottleneck. It is composed of eXtended Computer Aided Design (CAD) and eXtended CNC systems to link the CAD model to the real machined part through the Manufacturing Information Pipeline. The contributions associated with these concepts are demonstrated through a validation platform implemented on industrial CNC manufacturing equipments.", "paper_title": "An eXtended Manufacturing Integrated System for feature-based manufacturing with STEP-NC", "paper_id": "WOS:000296272100001"}
