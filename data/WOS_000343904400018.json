Traditional CRN routing algorithms, which typically ignore the intermittent connectivity of network topology, and traditional mobility-assisted routing algorithms, which generally overlook the spectrum availability, are obviously unsuitable. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Mobility-Assisted Routing algorithm with Spectrum Awareness (MARSA) to select relays based on not only the probability that a node meets the destination but also the chance at which there exists at least one available channel when they meet. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to bring the idea of mobility-assisted routing to deal with the intermittently connected attribute of mobile ad-hoc CRNs, and the first to enhance the mobility-assisted routing by considering the temporal, spatial, and spectrum domains at the same time. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of MARSA over traditional algorithms in intermittently connected mobile CRNs.", "paper_title": "Mobility-Assisted Routing in Intermittently Connected Mobile Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343904400018"}
