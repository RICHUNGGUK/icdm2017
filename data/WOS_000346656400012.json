The framework embraces a variety of dissipative and conservative PDEs with variational structure. An advantageous feature is that implementation of the resulting scheme requires only P1 elements. The schemes and their underlying -weak forms are derived from the concept of formal weak form and an -projection technique.", "paper_title": "A general framework for finding energy dissipative/conservative -Galerkin schemes and their underlying -weak forms for nonlinear evolution equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000346656400012"}
