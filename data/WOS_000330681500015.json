Based on the parametric sparse representation model, several sparsity-driven algorithms are proposed to retrieve both the target rotation rate and the ISAR image. In this paper, four parametric sparse recovery algorithms are compared mainly in three aspects: the accuracy of the rotation rate estimation, the ISAR image quality and the computational load. Numerical examples are presented to show the advantages and disadvantages for each method.", "paper_title": "Comparison of parametric sparse recovery methods for ISAR image formation", "paper_id": "WOS:000330681500015"}
