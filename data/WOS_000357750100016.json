Computer: Any computer with a Fortran 90 compiler. Operating system: Linux, Mac OS. RAM: Less than 1 GB Classification: 4.4, 11.1, 11.2. External routines: LHAPDF (https://www.hepforge.org/downloads/lhapdf). Nature of problem: Precision calculation of cross sections and differential distributions for Higgs-boson production in vector-boson fusion and Higgs strahlung at the LHC as described in Refs. [1-3]. Solution method: Multi-channel Monte Carlo integration of perturbative matrix elements including higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections which are based on a Feynman-diagrammatic calculation. Restrictions: For vector-boson fusion, only the Higgs-boson decay into a pair of massless singlets is supported. For Higgs strahlung, decay products are not supported, while the Higgs boson can be off shell. Running time: Meaningful results can be obtained within a few hours on a single core. The statistical uncertainty of the results typically improves with the square root of the run time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
