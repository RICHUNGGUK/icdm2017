Its security is dependent upon the length of pseudorandom numbers generated by two communication parties. As the S-box is being built, we demonstrate that Boolean functions play an important role in the design of both block and stream ciphers. To satisfy a variety of cryptographic test methods, such as strict avalanche criterion (SAC), bit independence criterion (BIC), and nonlinearity, we apply polymorphic cipher (PMC) theory to the permutation function construction. Correlations among the test criteria in a real network environment are also evaluated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
