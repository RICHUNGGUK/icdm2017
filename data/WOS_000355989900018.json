We propose an optimal checkpoint selection with task duplication hardening to tolerate transient faults. A target application is specified in a task graph, and the schedule/checkpoint placements are determined at design time. The proposed optimal algorithm minimizes the checkpoint overhead with a latency constraint. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the minimum end-to-end latency to perform a fault-tolerant schedule. In addition, the proposed algorithm dramatically decreases the checkpointing overhead on uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems compared with a greedy approach and an equidistant algorithm.", "paper_title": "Optimal Checkpoint Selection with Dual-Modular Redundancy Hardening", "paper_id": "WOS:000355989900018"}
