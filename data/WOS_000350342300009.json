While every sector can run its own scheduling algorithm, bandwidth utilization can be significantly increased if a joint scheduler makes these decisions for all the sectors. This gives rise to a new problem, referred to as \"joint scheduling,\" addressed in this paper for the first time. The problem is proven to be NP-hard, but we propose efficient algorithms with a worst-case performance guarantee for solving it. We then show that the proposed algorithms indeed substantially increase the network throughput.", "paper_title": "Joint Scheduling and Fast Cell Selection in OFDMA Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000350342300009"}
