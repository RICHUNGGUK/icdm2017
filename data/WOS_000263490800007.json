[2007]. It is a generalization of the data stream model that is suited to handling probabilistic data, where each item of the stream represents a probability distribution over a set of possible events. Therefore, a probabilistic stream determines a distribution over a potentially exponential number of classical deterministic streams, where each item is deterministically one of the domain values. We present algorithms for computing commonly used aggregates on a probabilistic stream. We present the first one pass streaming algorithms for estimating the expected mean of a probabilistic stream. Next, we consider the problem of estimating frequency moments for probabilistic data. We propose a general approach to obtain unbiased estimators working over probabilistic data by utilizing unbiased estimators designed for standard streams. Applying this approach, we extend a classical data stream algorithm to obtain a one-pass algorithm for estimating F(2), the second frequency moment. We present the first known streaming algorithms for estimating F(0), the number of distinct items on probabilistic streams. Our work also gives an efficient one-pass algorithm for estimating the median, and a two-pass algorithm for estimating the range.", "paper_title": "Estimating Statistical Aggregates on Probabilistic Data Streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000263490800007"}
