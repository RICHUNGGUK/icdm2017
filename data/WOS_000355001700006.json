GridWay enables large-scale, reliable, and efficient sharing of computing resources over grid middleware. To favor interoperability, it shows a modular architecture based on drivers, which access middleware services for resource discovery and monitoring, job execution and management, and file transfer. This paper presents two new execution drivers for Basic Execution Service (BES) and Computing Resource Execution and Management (CREAM) services and introduces a remote BES interface for GridWay. This interface allows users to access GridWay's job metascheduling capabilities, using the BES implementation of GridSAM. Thus, GridWay now provides to end users more possibilities of interoperability and interoperation.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Interoperating grid infrastructures with the GridWay metascheduler", "paper_id": "WOS:000355001700006"}
