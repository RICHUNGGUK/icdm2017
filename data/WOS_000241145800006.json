An M/G/l/K queuing model is incorporated in both models. In the first model results are based on arbitrary contention conditions, namely, collision probabilities, transmission probabilities and contention window sizes vary arbitrarily among nodes contending for channel access. In the second model, however, the contention condition is limited by the assumption that collision probabilities remain constant among contending nodes. Results are presented for the fully-connected case. Two models are compared and validated via simulation with statistical analysis. The main contributions are the analysis of DCF and the foundation for the sensitivity analysis. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
