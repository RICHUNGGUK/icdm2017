When modeling a phenomenon where for instance the nucleotide distribution does not change for various length of DNA, there are two popular approaches to achieve a desired length distribution: explicit or implicit modeling. The implicit modeling requires an elaborately designed model structure. So far there is no general procedure available for designing such a model structure from the training data automatically. Results: We present an iterative algorithm to design standard HMMs structure with length distribution from the training data. The basic idea behind this algorithm is to use multiple shifted negative binomial distributions to model empirical length distribution. The negative binomial distribution is obtained by an array of n states, each with the same transition probability to itself. We shift this negative binomial distribution by using a serial of states linearly connected before the binomial model.", "paper_title": "A method to design standard HMMs with desired length distribution for biological sequence analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125600003"}
