Weakly Connected Dominating Set (WCDS) is used for solving this problem. Therefore, computing a minimum WCDS becomes an important topic of this research. In this paper, we compare the size of Maximal Independent Set (MIS) and minimum WCDS in unit disk graph. Our analysis shows that five is the least upper bound for this ratio. We also present a distributed algorithm to produce a weakly connected MIS within a factor 5 from the minimum WCDS.", "paper_title": "Constructing weakly connected dominating set for secure clustering in distributed sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000300079100010"}
