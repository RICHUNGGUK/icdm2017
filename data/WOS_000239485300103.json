In our study, we first propose extracting high frequency information of different orientations using Steerable filters. Next, we employ a multi-layer neural network using the back-propagation algorithm to replace K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier which has been implemented in the Cellular Image Quantitator (CELLIQ) system [3]. Experimental results provide a comparison between the proposed steerable filter features and existing regular features which have been used in published papers [3, 5]. From the comparison, it can be concluded that Steerable filter features can effectively represent the cells in different phases and improve the classification accuracy. Neural network also has a better performance than KNN currently deployed in CELLIQ system [3].", "paper_title": "Identification of cell-cycle phases using neural network and steerable filter features", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300103"}
