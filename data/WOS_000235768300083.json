The quality of the user's patterns is as important as the quality of the classifier. But, the issue has been ignored in the literature since the popular biometrics are mostly trait based such as finger prints and iris so that its pattern quality depends on the quality of the input device involved. However, the quality of the user's patterns of behavior based biometric such as keystroke dynamics can be improved artificially by increasing the peculiarity of the typing style. In this paper, we propose several ways to improve the quality. But, first we define the quality of patterns in terms of two factors: uniqueness and consistency. Finally, the results of a preliminary experiment are presented that support the utility of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Artificial rhythms and cues for keystroke dynamics based authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300083"}
