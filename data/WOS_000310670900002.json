In this study, a computational method was proposed to identify FMN binding sites based on amino acid sequences of proteins only. A modified Position Specific Score Matrix was used to characterize the local environmental sequence information, and a visible improvement of performance was obtained. Also, the ensemble SVM was applied to solve the imbalanced data problem. Additionally, an independent dataset was built to evaluate the practical performance of the method, and a satisfactory accuracy of 87.87% was achieved. It demonstrates that the method is effective in predicting FMN-binding sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
