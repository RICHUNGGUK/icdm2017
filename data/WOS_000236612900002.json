For this purpose, we propose a novel method called CGHmix. It is based on a spatially structured mixture model with three states corresponding to genomic sequences that are either unmodified, deleted or amplified. Inference is performed in a Bayesian framework. From the output, posterior probabilities of belonging to each of the three states are estimated for each genomic sequence and used to classify them. Results: Using simulated data, CGHmix is validated and compared with both a conventional unstructured mixture model and with a recently proposed data mining method. We demonstrate the good performance of CGHmix for classifying copy number changes. In Addition, the method provides a good estimate of the false discovery rate. We also present the analysis of a cancer related dataset.", "paper_title": "Detection of gene copy number changes in CGH microarrays using a spatially correlated mixture model", "paper_id": "WOS:000236612900002"}
