On the other hand the commercial applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) require the integration of these vehicles in the ATM. From this perspective, the unavoidable modernization of the ATM is seen as an opportunity to integrate the UAVs with the rest of the air traffic. This paper is devoted to study the feasibility and impact of the aggregation of UAVs on the future ATM supported by a SWIM inspired architecture. Departing from the existing technical documents that describe the fundamentals of SWIM we have explored the compatibility with a potential UAVs integration and also explored how the UAVs could help to improve the future ATM system. We will use the weather application as an example in both cases.", "paper_title": "UAVs Integration in the SWIM Based Architecture for ATM", "paper_id": "WOS:000264484900004"}
