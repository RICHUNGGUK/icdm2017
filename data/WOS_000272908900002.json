Verification and testing of web software requires effective modelling techniques that address the specific challenges of web applications. In this study we survey 24 different modelling methods used in web site verification and testing. Based on a short catalogue of desirable properties of web applications that require analysis, two different views of the methods are presented: a general categorization by modelling level, and a detailed comparison based on property coverage.
