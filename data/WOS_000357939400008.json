In this paper, we consider the constructions of self-dual codes by higher power residues, especially fourth power residues. New infinite families of self-dual codes over GF(2), GF(3), GF(4), GF(8), and GF(9) are introduced. Some of them have better minimum weight than previously known codes. We also give general results related to the automorphism group of some of these codes.", "paper_title": "Fourth Power Residue Double Circulant Self-Dual Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000357939400008"}
