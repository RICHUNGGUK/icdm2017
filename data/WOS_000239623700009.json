Several experiments with different feature selection methods and content-based filtering techniques are carried out and discussed. Information Gain, chi(2)-text, Mutual Information and Document Frequency feature selection methods have been analysed in conjunction with Naive Bayes, boosting trees, Support Vector Machines and ECUE models in different scenarios. From the experiments carried out the underlying ideas behind feature selection methods are identified and applied for improving the feature selection process of SpamHunting, a novel anti-spam filtering software able to accurate classify suspicious e-mails.", "paper_title": "A comparative performance study of feature selection methods for the anti-spam filtering domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623700009"}
