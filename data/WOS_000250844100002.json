First, more information is acquired utilizing the reconstructed embedding phase space, and the multiwavelets transform provides a sensible decomposition of the data so that the underlying temporal structures of the original time series become more tractable. Second, based on the Recurrent Least Squares Support Vector Machines (RLS-SVM), modeling of the chaotic system is realized. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we use the power spectrum and dynamic invariants involving the Lyapunov exponents and the correlation dimension as criterions, and then apply our method to Chua's circuit time series. The similarity of dynamic invariants between the original and generated time series shows that the proposed method can capture the dynamics of the chaotic time series more effectively.", "paper_title": "Modeling of chaotic systems with multiwavelet transform combined with recurrent least squares support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000250844100002"}
