We have created a new classification scheme and used it as the basis for constructing a software pattern catalog. It is a uniform approach for creating, maintaining, and expanding the catalog. We present a brief overview of the classification scheme, describe the resulting catalog and the principles underlying its construction, show how to use the catalog, and demonstrate some of its benefits for software designers.
