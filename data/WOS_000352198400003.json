The parameter is used to relate the approximation ratios of different optimisation problems; in other words, we can convert approximability (and non-approximability) result for one problem into (non)-approximability results for other problems. Our main application is the problem (weighted) maximum H-colourable subgraph (MAX H-COL), which is a restriction of the general maximum constraint satisfaction problem (MAX CSP) to a single, binary, and symmetric relation. Using known approximation ratios for MAX k-CUT, we obtain general asymptotic approximability results for MAX H-COL for an arbitrary graph H. For several classes of graphs, we provide near-optimal results under the unique games conjecture. We also investigate separation as a graph parameter. In this vein, we study its properties on circular complete graphs. Furthermore, we establish a close connection to work by Samal on cubical colourings of graphs. This connection shows that our parameter is closely related to a special type of chromatic number. We believe that this insight may turn out to be crucial for understanding the behaviour of the parameter, and in the longer term, for understanding the approximability of optimisation problems such as MAX H-COL.", "paper_title": "An Approximability-related Parameter on Graphs - Properties and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000352198400003"}
