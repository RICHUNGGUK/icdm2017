Then, we have performed the numerical simulation on the modified model. The simulation result shows that the variable coupling mechanism can induce the transition between different cluster states of the neuronal oscillator population, without the external stimulation. Another result from the numerical simulation is that, in the transient process between two different synchronization states caused by the variable coupling mechanism, it is allowed to have a full desynchronization state for a period. However, after the period of desynchronization state, the neuronal oscillator population can still reenter a new synchronization state under the action of the coupling term with the order different from initial condition.
