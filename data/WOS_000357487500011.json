In our work, we take the information asymmetry into consideration, which is used to model the different behaviors presented by pedestrians because of their different knowledge about the environment. We categorize the factors influencing the preferred velocity into two groups, the intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which are unified into a single space called influence space. At the same time, a finite state machine is employed to control the individual behavior. Different strategies are used to compute the preferred velocity in different states, so that our framework can produce the phenomena of decision change. Our experimental results prove that our framework can be employed to analyze the factors influencing the escape time, such as the number and location of exits, the density distribution of the crowd and so on. Thus it can be used to design and evaluate the evacuation plans.", "paper_title": "A novel simulation framework based on information asymmetry to evaluate evacuation plan", "paper_id": "WOS:000357487500011"}
