The package allows the use of complex-spinor algebra along with the multipurpose features of Mathematica. The package defines the spinor objects with their basic properties along with functions to manipulate them. It also offers the possibility of evaluating the spinorial objects numerically at every computational step. The package is therefore well suited to be used in the context of on-shell technology, in particular for the evaluation of scattering amplitudes at tree- and loop-level.
