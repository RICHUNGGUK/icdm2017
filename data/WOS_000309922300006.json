The field of DIA regard to Indo-Persian documents is still at its infancy compared to Latin script-based documents; as such standard datasets are not still available in literature. This paper is an effort towards alleviating this gap. In this paper, an unconstrained handwritten dataset containing documents of Persian, Bangla, Oriya and Kannada (PBOK) is introduced. The PBOK contains 707 text-pages written in four different languages (Persian, Bangla, Oriya and Kannada) by 436 individuals. Total number of text-lines, words/subwords and characters are 12,565, 104,541 and 423,980, respectively. In most documents of PBOK dataset contain either an overlapping or a touching text-lines. The average number of text-lines in text-pages of the PBOK dataset is 18. Two types of ground truths, based on pixels information and content information, are generated for the dataset. Because of such ground truths, the PBOK dataset can be utilized in many areas of document image processing e. g. text-line segmentation, word segmentation and word recognition. To provide an insight for other researches, recent text-line segmentation results on this dataset are also reported.", "paper_title": "DATASET AND GROUND TRUTH FOR HANDWRITTEN TEXT IN FOUR DIFFERENT SCRIPTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309922300006"}
