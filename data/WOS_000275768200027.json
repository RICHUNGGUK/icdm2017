The intonation evaluation system calculates scores between a learner's utterance and corresponding utterances by the teachers We first compared the reliability of intonation evaluation using native and synthesized utterances, and found that the reliability of evaluation using synthesized utterances could be improved by suing the weighted. Mahalanobis distance for calculating the evaluation score Next, we investigated a method of combining multiple scores of different teachers In addition we incorporated a feature for evaluating rhythm into intonation evaluation As a result, the correlation between scores by human evaluators and the system was improved Furthermore, we analyzed the tendency of intonation evaluations made by the system through limiting the valuation utterances to find out for degradation of the system's performance", "paper_title": "INTONATION EVALUATION OF ENGLISH UTTERANCES USING SYNTHESIZED SPEECH FOR COMPUTER-ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING", "paper_id": "WOS:000275768200027"}
