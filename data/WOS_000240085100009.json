In particular, the beacon enabled mode with slotted CSMA-CA contention resolution mechanism appears suitable for deployment in simple hierarchical sensor clusters. However, a detailed analysis of the operation of the MAC layer according to the 802.15.4 standard reveals a number of issues which may potentially become performance bottlenecks and thus lead to serious performance degradation. we analyze those issues and their impact, and suggest modifications of the coordinator function that allow the network to handle higher traffic loads and thus offer much improved performance to its clients.
