This objective is primarily achieved through the prevention of operation traceability while raising the role of communication parties to be a central element of the network. Thus, we propose an identity-based architecture that provides these capabilities in an integrated way with the underlay network architecture, which here is CCN. Also, the architecture we propose adds to CCN the possibility of performing secure end-to-end communications with transparent authentication capabilities. To reinforce the proposed architecture we discuss a successful security verification of its protocol and finally, we discuss a proof-of-concept implementation of the architecture working on top of CCN that we then use to perform the necessary tests to demonstrate its feasibility and scalability.
