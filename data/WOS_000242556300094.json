CumICA is based in the computation of the cross-cumulants of the mixtures and needs the aid of a digital high-pass filter to achieve the same SNR (up to -40 dB) as Fast-ICA. Acoustic Emission (AE) sequences were acquired by a wide frequency range transducer (100-800 kHz) and digitalized by a 2.5 MHz, 8-bit ADC. Four common sources in AE testing are linearly mixed, involving real AE sequences, impulses and parasitic signals modelling human activity.", "paper_title": "Comparison of two ICA algorithms in BSS applied to non-destructive vibratory tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300094"}
