Design/methodology/approach - Figurative analysis combined with calculus-based methods is applied in this research, in order to achieve the goal that whatever is obtained theoretically, here can be practically used in various applications. Findings - The paper introduces the concepts of gravitation, potential energy, and yoyo potentials for general spinning yoyos and look at the structure of yoyo fields with relevant quantitative representations developed for practical computation purposes. The paper shows how the spin field of a yoyo can be decomposed into eddy and meridian fields and why spinning yoyos have the tendency to line up in such a way that their axes of spin are parallel to each other and their like polarities face the same direction. When looking at yoyo flows and resistances, the Kirchhoff Junction and Loop Laws are generalized to the most general case of systemic yoyos. By considering the concept of yoyo fluxes, it is possible to rewrite the Gauss's law in the relevant most general language. Originality/value - This work is the first of its kind to develop quantitative methods for studying various properties of systems on a unified footing: the general systemic yoyo model. As shown in this special issue, the results of this work have been and will continue to be applied to address many difficult problems that have been encountering scholars in the areas of modern science and humanities.", "paper_title": "Quantitative properties of the general systemic yoyo model", "paper_id": "WOS:000277539100015"}
