Notions like completion, paramodulation, saturation, redundancy elimination, and rewrite-system reduction are connected to proof orderings. Fairness of deductive mechanisms is defined in terms of proof orderings, distinguishing between (ordinary) \"fairness,\" which yields completeness, and \"uniform fairness,\" which yields saturation.", "paper_title": "Abstract canonical inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000244402200006"}
