Bones are segmented semi-automatically using a hybrid approach while muscles attachments are retrieved automatically by atlas-based non-rigid registration followed by optional interactive correction using a user-friendly interface. Compared to previously proposed methods for MR based musculoskeletal modeling, integration of automated image processing procedures and problem-tailored visualization techniques result in a considerable reduction of the processing time, thus making MR-based musculoskeletal modeling practically feasible and more attractive.", "paper_title": "Image based musculoskeletal modeling allows personalized biomechanical analysis of gait", "paper_id": "WOS:000239565100007"}
