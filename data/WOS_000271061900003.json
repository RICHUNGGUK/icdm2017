Sakakibara, Learning context-free grammars using tabular representations, Pattern Recognition 38( 2005) 1372-1383; Y. Sakakibara, M. Kondo, GA-based learning of context-free grammars using tabular representations, in: Proceedings of 16th International Conference in Machine Learning (ICML-99), Morgan-Kaufmann, Los Altos, CA, 1999] for inference of context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form. The TBL algorithm is a novel approach to overcome the hardness of learning context-free grammars from examples without structural information available. The algorithm represents the grammars by parsing tables and thanks to this tabular representation the problem of grammar learning is reduced to the problem of partitioning the set of nonterminals. Genetic algorithm is used to solve NP-hard partitioning problem. In the improved version modified fitness function and new delete specialized operator is applied. Computer simulations have been performed to determine improved a tabular representation efficiency. The set of experiments has been divided into 2 groups: in the first one learning the unknown context-free grammar proceeds without any extra information about grammatical structure, in the second one learning is supported by a partial knowledge of the structure. In each of the performed experiments the influence of partition block size in an initial population and the size of population at grammar induction has been tested. The new version of TBL algorithm has been experimentally proved to be not so much vulnerable to block size and population size, and is able to find the solutions faster than standard one.
