Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, heuristics are more promising approaches to find a near optimal solution in a reasonable time. This paper proposes a decentralized learning automata-based heuristic called LACT for approximating the DCMST problem. LACT is an iterative algorithm, and at each iteration a degree-constrained spanning tree is randomly constructed. Each vertex selects one of its incident edges and rewards it if its weight is not greater than the minimum weight seen so far and penalizes it otherwise. Therefore, the vertices learn how to locally connect them to the degree-constrained spanning tree through the minimum weight edge subject to the degree constraint. Based on the martingale theorem, the convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal solution is proved. Several simulation experiments are performed to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm on well-known Euclidean and non-Euclidean hard-to-solve problem instances. The obtained results are compared with those of best-known algorithms in terms of the solution quality and running time. From the results, it is observed that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing method.", "paper_title": "Degree constrained minimum spanning tree problem: a learning automata approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000316408500020"}
