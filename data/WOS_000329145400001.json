In this paper, Clustering Pairing Consensus (CPC) algorithm is proposed to estimate the fundamental matrix. The CPC algorithm first produces the Matched Regions Clusters (MRCs) using topological clustering (TC) algorithm given a scale parameter. An estimation is produced from each valid pair of MRCs and is then provided to M-estimation to compute a fundamental matrix. Finally, the best one is chosen as the final model from all the estimation. The proposed CPC algorithm has been demonstrated to be able to effectively estimate fundamental matrix and avoid the degeneracy of the traditional method for some difficult image pairs.
