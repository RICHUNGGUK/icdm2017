However, the computational complexity of EC techniques makes IW unfeasible for large scale applications involving heterogeneous images. In this paper, we propose a dynamic particle swarm optimization (DPSO) technique which relies on a memory of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) of solutions in the optimization space. This technique is employed in the optimization of embedding parameters of a multi-level (robust/fragile) bi-tonal watermarking system in high data rate applications. A compact density representation of previously-found DPSO solutions is created through GMM in the optimization space, and stored in memory. Solutions are re-sampled from this memory, re-evaluated for new images and have their distribution of fitness values compared with that stored in the memory. When the distributions are similar, memory solutions are employed in a straightforward manner, avoiding costly re-optimization operations. A specialized memory management mechanism allows to maintain and adapt GMM distributions over time, as the image stream changes. This memory of GMMs allows an accurate representation of the topology of a stream of optimization problems. Consequently, new cases of optimization can be matched against previous cases more precisely (when compared with a memory of static solutions), leading to considerable decrease in computational burden. Simulation results on heterogeneous streams of images indicate that compared to full re-optimization for each document image, the proposed approach allows to decrease the computational requirement linked to EC by up to 97.7% with little impact on the accuracy for detecting watermarks. Comparable results were obtained for homogeneous streams of document images. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
