Rather than building a complex mechanical model directly related to the structure of the hair strands, we take advantage of a volume free- form deformation scheme. We detail the construction of an efficient lattice mechanical deformation model which represents the volume behavior of the hair strands. The lattice is deformed as a particle system using state- of- the- art numerical methods, and animates the hairs using quadratic B- Spline interpolation. The hairstyle reacts to the body skin through collisions with a metaball- based approximation. The model is highly scalable and allows hairstyles of any complexity to be simulated in any rendering context with the appropriate trade off between accuracy and computation speed, fitting the need of Level- of- Detail optimization schemes.", "paper_title": "Real-time animation of complex hairstyles", "paper_id": "WOS:000234430200002"}
