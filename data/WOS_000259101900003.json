Yet no comprehensive comparative study has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of Silhouette width, Calinski & Harbasz index (pseudo F-statistics) and Baker & Hubert index (gamma index) algorithms for exact and approximate duplicates. In this paper, a comparative study and effectiveness of these three cluster validation techniques which involve measuring the stability of a partition in a data set in the presence of noise, in particular, approximate and exact duplicates are presented. Silhouette width, Calinski & Harbasz index and Baker & Hubert index are calculated before and after inserting the exact and approximate duplicates (deliberately) in the data set. Comprehensive experiments on glass, wine, iris and ruspini database confirms that the Baker & Hubert index is not stable in the presence of approximate duplicates. Moreover, Silhouette width, Calinski and Harbasz index and Baker & Hubert indice do not exceed the original data indice in the presence of approximate duplicates.", "paper_title": "Innovation in the cluster validating techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000259101900003"}
