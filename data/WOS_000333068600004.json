On one hand, the security of a recent protocol [Adhikari et al. Quantum Inform. 8z Comput. 12 (2012) 0253-0261] is re-examined. We find that it violates the requirement of information theoretic security in the secret sharing and suffers from the information leakage. The cryptanalysis including several specific attack strategies are given, which shows that a dishonest participant can steal half or all of the secrets without being detected. On the other hand, we design a new quantum secret sharing protocol. The security of protocol is rigorously proved. It meets the fundamental requirement of information theoretic security. Furthermore, the security analysis including both the outside attacks and participant attacks is given in details. It is shown that our proposed protocol can achieve perfect secret sharing.", "paper_title": "ROBUST VARIATIONS OF SECRET SHARING THROUGH NOISY QUANTUM CHANNEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000333068600004"}
