To characterize the extent to which a contingency affecting an infrastructure is going to weaken, and possibly disrupt, the safe operation of an interconnected system, it is necessary to model the relations established through the connections linking the multiple components of the involved infrastructures. In this work, the modeling of interdependencies among network systems and of their effects on failure propagation is carried out within the simulation framework of a failure cascade process. The sensitivity of the critical loading value (the lower bound of the cascading failure region) and of the average cascade size with respect to the coupling parameters defining the interdependency strength is investigated as a means to arrive at the definition and prescription of cascade-safe operating margins.", "paper_title": "Modeling Interdependent Network Systems for Identifying Cascade-Safe Operating Margins", "paper_id": "WOS:000287861400013"}
