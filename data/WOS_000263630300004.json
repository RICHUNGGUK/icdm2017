We consider a single-machine scheduling problem where the processing time of each activity is characterized by a normally distributed random variable, with flowtime as the main solution criterion. The objective is to find the beta-robust schedule-the schedule that minimizes the risk of the flowtime exceeding a threshold. We show how to represent this problem as a constraint model, explicitly representing the uncertainty and robustness as input parameters and objectives, and enabling the uncertainty to propagate using constraint propagation. Specifically, we develop three models (primal, dual and hybrid), and we show the effect of dominance rules on the search space.
