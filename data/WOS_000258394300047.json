This scheme needs no additional hardware support and can be implemented in a distributed way. The proposed method can improve location accuracy without increasing communication traffic and computing complexity. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to that of the DV-Hop algorithm.", "paper_title": "An improved DV-Hop localization algorithm with reduced node location error for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300047"}
