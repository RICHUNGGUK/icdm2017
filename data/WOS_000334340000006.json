This feature is key in areas like Finance and Economics, where the opposite is rather the exception than the rule. For this reason, there is a growing interest in applications of the mentioned toolkit in the domain. This special track intends to address that demand introducing a diverse set of papers that cover a wide range of novel techniques and interesting solutions in core areas of application. All of them represent substantial contributions to the literature.", "paper_title": "Soft computing in finance and economics", "paper_id": "WOS:000334340000006"}
