Therefore, we present a novel method for rendering realistic bokeh effects, especially chromatic effects, which are absent for existing methods. This new method refers to two key techniques: an accurate dispersive lens model and an efficient spectral rendering scheme. This lens model is implemented based on optical data of real lenses and considers wavelength dependency of physical lenses by introducing a sequential dispersive ray tracing algorithm inside this model. This spectral rendering scheme is proposed to support rendering of lens dispersion and integration between this new model and bidirectional ray tracing. The rendering experiments demonstrate that our method is able to simulate realistic spectral bokeh effects caused by lens stops and aberrations, especially chromatic aberration, and feature high rendering efficiency.", "paper_title": "Rendering realistic spectral bokeh due to lens stops and aberrations", "paper_id": "WOS:000313063400004"}
