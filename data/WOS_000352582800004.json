The BTEX were extracted from soil sample into acetonitrile by dispersive solid phase extraction method, and the extract was then used as dispersive solvent in dispersive liquid-liquid extraction procedure. Ant colony optimization-artificial neural network (ACO-ANN) has been employed to develop the model for simulation and optimization of this method. The volume of dispersive solvent, volume of extraction solvent, extraction time, and ultrasonic time were the input variables, while the multiple response function (R-m) of analytes was the output. The optimum operating condition was then determined by ant colony optimization method. At the optimum conditions, the limit of detections of 0.12-0.75ngg(-1) was obtained for the BTEX. The developed procedure was then applied to the extraction and determination of BTEX in the soil samples and one certified soil.
