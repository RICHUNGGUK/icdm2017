Tests must be allocated to suitable prototypes and ordered to satisfy temporal constraints and various kinds of test dependencies. The manufacturer aims to minimize the number of prototypes required. We present improvements of constraint programming (CP) and hybrid approaches to effectively solve random instances from an existing benchmark. CP mostly achieves better solutions than the previous heuristic technique and genetic algorithm. We also provide customized search schemes to enhance the performance of general search algorithms. The hybrid approach applies mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to solve the planning part and CP to find the complete schedule. We consider several logical principles such that the MILP model can accurately estimate the prototype demand, while its size particularly for large instances does not exceed memory capacity. Moreover, the robustness is alleviated when we allow CP to partially change the allocation obtained from the MILP model. The hybrid method can contribute to optimal solutions in some instances.", "paper_title": "Improvements of constraint programming and hybrid methods for scheduling of tests on vehicle prototypes", "paper_id": "WOS:000302063800004"}
