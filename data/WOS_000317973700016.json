A hamiltonian walk of a digraph D is a closed spanning directed walk with minimum length in D. The length of a hamiltonian walk of a digraph D is called the hamiltonian number of D, denoted h(D). We prove that if a digraph D of order n is strongly connected, then , and hence characterize the strongly connected digraphs of order n with hamiltonian number . In addition, we show that for each k with , there exists a digraph with order n and hamiltonian number k. Furthermore, we also study the hamiltonian spectra of graphs.", "paper_title": "The hamiltonian numbers in digraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000317973700016"}
