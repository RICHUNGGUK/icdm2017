We compare SSOR/Jacobi and FSAI(1)/Jacobi preconditioners for the parallel MINRES accelerator implemented using C++/OpenMP. Results are presented for SGI Altix 3700 and IBM Power4 machines. As an example a simulation of the compression test of the rigid-viscoplastic material is shown.", "paper_title": "A parallel preconditioning for the nonlinear stokes problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100064"}
