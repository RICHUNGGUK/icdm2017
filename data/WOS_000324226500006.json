Optical packet switching networks promise to provide data rates that are sufficiently high to satisfy the needs of the future Internet core network. However, a key technological problem with optical packet switching is the very small size of packet buffers that can be implemented in the optical domain. Existing protocols, for example the widely used Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), do not perform well in such small-buffer networks. To address this problem, we have proposed techniques for actively pacing traffic at edge networks to ensure that traffic bursts are reduced or eliminated and thus do not cause packet losses in routers with small buffers. We have also shown that this traffic pacing can improve the performance of conventional networks that use small buffers (e.g., to reduce the cost of buffer memory on routers). A key challenge in this context is to develop systems that can perform such packet pacing efficiently and at high data rates. In this paper, we present the design and prototype of a hardware implementation of our packet pacing technique. We discuss and evaluate design trade-offs and present performance results from an prototype implementation based on a NetFPGA fieldprogrammable gate array system. Our results show that traffic pacing can be implemented with few hardware resources and without reducing system throughput. Therefore, we believe that traffic pacing can be deployed widely to improve the operation of current and future networks. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
