The proposed antenna consists of one circular patch placed on one side of a substrate and one circular slot placed on the other side. The antenna is fed with a microstrip line connected to the circular patch. The radii of the circular patch and slot and the separation between their edges represent the three design parameters which are optimized such that the antenna satisfies the design specifications. The proposed antenna has been fabricated using printed circuit board (PCB) technology. It has been characterized both theoretically and experimentally. The measured and calculated results are presented, compared, and discussed. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.
