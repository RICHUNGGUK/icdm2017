In this paper, we propose a novel methodology called Policy-Driven Process Mapping (PDPM) for extracting process models from business policy documents. Our research objective is to make process discovery from policy documents more systematic with fewer structural and semantic errors. To the best of our knowledge, PDPM is the first formal approach to discovering process models from business policies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
