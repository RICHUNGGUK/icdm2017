In traditional supervisory adaptive fuzzy control approaches, the use of fuzzy estimators for approximating system functions and a robust supervisory control law are necessary to deal with any possible uncertainties caused in the system. This kind of supervisory controller depends on the robust bounds of system functions so that it can ensure the Lyapunov stability of controlled systems. However, in those approaches, the output may not be able to follow the reference trajectory well if the robust bounds are predicted improperly. In our implementation, CMAC (Cerebellar Model Articulation Controllers) is used as the learning mechanism because of its quick learning capability. Under the Lyapunov stable criterion, the proposed CMAC learning mechanism can improve the output performance and can relax the robust bound limitation so that practical systems can easily be realized. In summary, the proposed approach not only can relax bounds for previous step supervisory controllers in adaptive fuzzy control, but also can significantly improve the control performance of the system.
