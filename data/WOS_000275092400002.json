We define two generalized cyclotomic sequences of length 2p (m) , one sequence (called the classical one) is defined using the classical method, the other one (called the modified one) is defined in a slightly modified manner. The linear complexity of the two proposed sequences of length 2p (m) is determined with two different approaches. The results show that the two proposed sequences have high linear complexity.", "paper_title": "Linear complexity of generalized cyclotomic binary sequences of length 2p (m)", "paper_id": "WOS:000275092400002"}
