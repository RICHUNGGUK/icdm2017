In the EDCA, differentiated channel access is provided for different traffic classes. In this paper, we propose a two-level protection and guarantee mechanism for voice and video traffic in the EDCA-based distributed wireless LANs. In the first-level protection, the existing voice and video flows are protected from the new and other existing voice and video flows via a distributed admission control with tried-and-known and early-protection enhancements. In the second-level protection, the voice and video flows are protected from the best-effort data traffic by adopting frame-based and limit-based data control mechanisms. Performance evaluations are conducted in terms of throughput, delay, transmission limit, number of collisions, and throughput square relative difference. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-level protection and guarantee mechanism is very effective in terms of the protection and guarantee of existing voice and video flows as well as the utilization of the channel capacity.", "paper_title": "Two-level protection and guarantee for multimedia traffic in IEEE 802.11e distributed WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000262832400001"}
