A fuzzy observer is designed to estimate the system's state vector and to derive a diagnostic signal-residual. The residual is generated by the comparison of the measured and the estimated outputs. The proposed scheme has been satisfactorily tested in simulation and in a real-time benchmark given by a Two-Tank Hydraulic System.", "paper_title": "On the fault diagnosis problem for non-linear systems: A fuzzy sliding-mode observer approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000270940200005"}
