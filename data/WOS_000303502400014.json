Yet, the current optoacoustic image reconstruction methods are usually based on inaccurate forward modelling approaches or otherwise demand a high computational cost, which imposes certain practical limitations and hinders image quantification. Herein, we introduce a new method for accelerating optoacoustic reconstructions, based on angular image discretization of the forward model solution. The method is particularly suitable for accurate image reconstruction with arbitrary meshes and space-dependent resolution, while it can also readily account for small speed of sound variations without compromising the calculation speed. It is further anticipated that the new approach will greatly facilitate development of high performance 3-D optoacoustic reconstruction methods.", "paper_title": "Acceleration of Optoacoustic Model-Based Reconstruction Using Angular Image Discretization", "paper_id": "WOS:000303502400014"}
