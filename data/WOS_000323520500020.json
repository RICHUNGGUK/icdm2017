It not only overcomes drawbacks of centralized systems, for example single point of failure and bottleneck issues, but more importantly harnesses power of peers' collaboration. In this research, we propose a pure mobile P2P query processing scheme which primarily focuses on the search and validation algorithm for kNN queries. The proposed scheme is designed for pure mobile P2P environments with the absence of the base station support. Compared with centralized and hybrid systems, our system can reduce energy consumption more than six times by making use of data sharing from peers in a reasonable mean latency of processing time for networks with high density of moving objects as can be seen in the simulation results.", "paper_title": "A pure peer-to-peer approach for kNN query processing in mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000323520500020"}
