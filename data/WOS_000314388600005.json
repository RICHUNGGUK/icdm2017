The former case is based on a modification of the Hebbian prescription, which induces a coupling between consecutive patterns and this effect is tuned by a parameter a. In the latter case, dilution is introduced in pattern entries, in such a way that a fraction d of them is blank. Then, we merge these two extensions to obtain a system able to retrieve several patterns in parallel and the quality of retrieval, encoded by the set of Mattis magnetizations {m(mu)}, is reminiscent of the correlation among patterns. By tuning the parameters d and a, qualitatively different outputs emerge, ranging from highly hierarchical to symmetric. The investigations are accomplished by means of both numerical simulations and statistical mechanics analysis, properly adapting a novel technique originally developed for spin glasses, i.e. the Hamilton-Jacobi interpolation, with excellent agreement. Finally, we show the thermodynamical equivalence of this associative network with a (restricted) Boltzmann machine and study its stochastic dynamics to obtain even a dynamical picture, perfectly consistent with the static scenario earlier discussed.
