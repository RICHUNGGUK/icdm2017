The handling of megadata is one of key issues in the field of e-science. In this paper, an efficient intelligent technique, DFNN (Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network), has been implemented for humanoid robot modeling. By this implementation, it is well demonstrated that the intelligent technique can be used derive some control disciplines from large data volumes. The inputs of the DFNN are two key parameters which represent a specific walking gait, while the output is an evaluation value of humanoid walking performance. Based on the evaluation information, the middle level control can select optimal walking gaits to realize a global path commanded from the high level. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the intelligent control method.", "paper_title": "Dynamic fuzzy neural network for the intelligent control of a humanoid robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000293548300005"}
