But the power consumption of FPGAs used in portable devices is one of critical issues. Top-down hierarchical design method is commonly used in both ASIC and FPGA design. But, in the case where plural modules are integrated in an FPGA and some of them might be in sleep-mode, current FPGA architecture cannot be fully effective. In this paper, coarse-grained power gating FPGA architecture is proposed where a whole area of an FPGA is partitioned into several regions and power supply is controlled for each region, so that modules in sleep mode can be effectively power-off. We also propose a region oriented FPGA placement algorithm fitted to this user's hierarchical design based on VPR [1]. Simulation results show that this proposed method could reduce power consumption of FPGA by 38% on average by setting unused modules or regions in sleep mode.", "paper_title": "Region-Oriented Placement Algorithm for Coarse-Grained Power-Gating FPGA Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900004"}
