To enhance the performances of classification or clustering on these data, their dimensionalities should be reduced beforehand. Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) is a widely used linear dimensionality reduction method. It seeks a subspace in which the neighborhood graph structure of samples is preserved. However, like most dimensionality reduction methods based on graph embedding, LPP is sensitive to noise and outliers, and its effectiveness depends on choosing suitable parameters for constructing the neighborhood graph. Unfortunately, it is difficult to choose effective parameters for LPP. To address these problems, we propose an Enhanced LPP (ELPP) using a similarity metric based on robust path and a Semi-supervised ELPP (SELPP) with pairwise constraints. In comparison with original LPP, our methods are not only robust to noise and outliers, but also less sensitive to parameters selection. Besides, SELPP makes use of pairwise constraints more efficiently than other comparing methods. Experimental results on real world face databases confirm their effectiveness. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
