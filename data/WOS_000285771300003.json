The goal of a dynamic rule-based business process is to change the implementation of a process instance at runtime. We are proposing a way for representing a Dynamic Business Process in terms of rules based on pattern identification. In this paper, we also discuss characteristics related to business process execution time and effective business process modification support. In particular, we analyse YAWL and Bonita Workflow in order to compare them with our approach and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.", "paper_title": "Towards a dynamic rule-based business process", "paper_id": "WOS:000285771300003"}
