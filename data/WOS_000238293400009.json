Supporting differentiated services in EPONs is an important issue for service providers to design an EPON system. A consequent interesting topic is how to achieve fairness among different users in EPONs. In this paper, we propose an Urgency Fair Queuing (UFQ) scheme to support Differentiated Services (DiffServ) among multiple users in EPONs. It can achieve fairness by allocating as much as possible bandwidth to best-effort traffic while guaranteeing the services for the Quality of Service (QoS) traffic streams simultaneously. The simulation results show that UFQ can effectively provide differentiated services for different types of traffic with fairness.", "paper_title": "Supporting differentiated services with fairness by an urgency fair queuing scheduling scheme in EPONs", "paper_id": "WOS:000238293400009"}
