Circuit performances tend to depend heavily on global interconnects, and power and delay of global interconnects are increased due to the miniaturization of process technology. On-chip transmission line has been proposed, which can improve such the large delay and large power consumption of the long RC interconnects. The improvement has been evaluated only for a single interconnect. In this paper, the total power reduction of the entire circuit is evaluated for 45nm technology, which is based on the measurement results at 180nm technology. As an example, the power consumption of global interconnects is improved by 6.6% on a circuit designed for 45nm process.", "paper_title": "Estimation of power reduction by on-chip transmission line for 45nm technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000241464600018"}
