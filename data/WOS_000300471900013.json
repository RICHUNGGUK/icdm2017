The novel decoder can be configured to decode in either TPMP or TDMP decoding mode according to different Block-WPC codes, essentially combining the advantages of two decoding algorithms. With a regular and scalable data-path, a Reconfigurable Serial Processing Engine (RSPE) is proposed to achieve area efficiency. To verify our proposed architecture, a flexible LDPC decoder fully compliant to IEEE 802.16e applications is implemented on a 130 nm 1P8M CMOS technology with a total area of 6.3 mm(2) and maximum operating frequency of 250 MHz. The chip dissipates 592 mW when operates at 250 MHz frequency and 1.2 V supply.", "paper_title": "A Flexible LDPC Decoder Architecture Supporting TPMP and TDMP Decoding Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900013"}
