This paper explains the existing ISMSs and presents a comparative analysis. The discussion deals with different types of ISMSs. We addressed issues within the existing ISMSs via analysis. Based on these analyses, then we proposes the development of an information security management evaluation system (ISMES). The method can be applied by a self-evaluation of the organization and an evaluation of the organization by the evaluation committee. The contribution of this study enables an organization to refer to and improve its information security levels. The case study can also provide a business organization with an easy method to build ISMS and the reduce cost of information security evaluation.", "paper_title": "Advanced Information Security Management Evaluation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000296086800006"}
