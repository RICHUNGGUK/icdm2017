A cost-effective alternative technique used to evaluate VR called digital thermal monitoring (DTM) is based on the response of finger temperature to vessel occlusion and reperfusion. In this work, a simulation has been developed to investigate hand temperature in response to vessel occlusion and perfusion. The simulation consists of image-based mesh generation and finite element analysis of blood flow and heat transfer in tissues. In order to reconstruct a real geometric model of human hand, a computer programme including automatic image processing for sequential MR data and mesh generation based on the transfinite interpolation method is developed. In the finite element analysis part, blood flow perfused in solid tissues is considered as fluid phase through porous media. Heat transfer in tissues is described by Pennes bioheat equation and blood perfusion rate is obtained from Darcy velocities. Capillary pressure, blood perfusion and temperature distribution of hand are obtained. The results reveal that fingertip temperature is strongly dependent on larger arterial pressure. This simulation is of potential to quantify the indices used for evaluating the VR in DTM test if it is integrated with the haemodynamic model of blood circulation in upper limb.", "paper_title": "Numerical analysis of dynamic temperature in response to different levels of reactive hyperaemia in a three-dimensional image-based hand model", "paper_id": "WOS:000334075400006"}
