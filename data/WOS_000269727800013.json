The main goal is to investigate incremental learning algorithms that can provide as good performances as traditional batch learning techniques, but incorporating the advantages of incremental learning for designing complex pattern recognition systems. Experiments on handwritten characters have shown that a proposed variant of the ensemble training algorithm, employing ensembles of HMMs, can lead to very promising performances. Furthermore, the use of a validation dataset demonstrated that it is possible to reach better performances than the ones presented by batch learning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
