To address this issue, in this contribution, an advanced model, multiplicative effects model (MEM), has been derived to explicitly model the effects of scatterers on Raman measurements. Preliminary experimental results for a proof of concept system with varying turbidity levels demonstrated that MEM could effectively account for the detrimental multiplicative effects of scatterers and ultimately achieved accurate quantitative analysis of analyte of interest in turbid media with a relative prediction error of about 43%. The enhanced levels of accuracy obtained with MEM open up an avenue for prospective prediction studies in turbid media such as biological tissues by Raman spectrometry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
