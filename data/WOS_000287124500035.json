However, the main drawbacks of the compact e-cash scheme are that anonymity control is insufficient, and the method does not address the issue of preventing crime. This paper presents an efficient and practical e-cash scheme that provides anonymity control and a valid date based on an offline trusted third party (TTP). By constructing a corn tag and two tracing tags, the new scheme allows for protecting the anonymity of honest users and can revoke anonymity protocols when dishonest users attempt to cheat the system. The wallet's withdrawal date is incorporated into the e-cash so that it captures the valid date, which makes it easier to control the size of the bank's database. In fact, compared with previous schemes, the complexity of the withdrawal and spend protocols remains O(lambda + log(k)), and 2(l) coins can be stored in O(lambda+ log(k)) bits. The security of our scheme is illustrated in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "COMPACT k-SPENDABLE E-CASH WITH ANONYMITY CONTROL BASED OFFLINE TTP", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500035"}
