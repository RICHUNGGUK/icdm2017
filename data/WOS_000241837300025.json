The main idea is to first map the original data into another high-dimensional space, and then to perform clustering-based discriminant analysis in the feature space. Kernel fuzzy c-means algorithm is used to do clustering for each class. A group of tests on two UCI standard benchmarks have been carried out that prove our proposed method is very promising.
