This paper proposes a variation of the distributed optimisation multi-agent system (MAS) approach of probability collectives (PC) in collective intelligence domain referred to as multi-criteria probability collective (MCPC). In this approach, the constraints are efficiently handled by giving equal importance as the objective function. It is validated by solving a variety of constrained test problems including tension/compression spring design problem and pressure vessel design problem. The solution to these problems proves that the MCPC approach can be applied to a variety of complex practical/real world problems.", "paper_title": "Multi-criteria probability collectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000348569600001"}
