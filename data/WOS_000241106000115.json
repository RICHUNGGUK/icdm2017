Associating with fuzzy set, classic scheduling rules, multi-closed loop control and user cooperating, hybrid system problems are hierarchically decomposed into the planning level problems, the scheduling level problems and material tracking feedback level problems.", "paper_title": "An improved fuzzy approach to planning and scheduling problems in hybrid distributed MES", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000115"}
