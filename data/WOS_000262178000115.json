In fact, all event in the real-world call be affected by many factors. The more the facts we consider, the higher the forecasting accuracy rate. Moreover the length of each interval ill the universe of discourse also affects the forecasting results. In this paper, we present a new method to predict the temperature and the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX), based oil automatic clustering techniques and two-factors high-order fuzzy time series. The proposed method gets higher average forecasting accuracy rates than the existing methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
