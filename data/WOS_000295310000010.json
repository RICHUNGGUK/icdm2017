In infrared spectroscopy, spectral pre-treatment techniques have been assumed to be equally applicable and effective in the analysis of biological samples with complex chemical composition and structure. In this research, the most commonly used pre-treatment techniques were investigated based on the identification of species from whole leaf samples of pharmaceutically important Epilobium and Hypericum genera. Two spectral collection modes were used; whole leaf transmission and KBr-tablet transmission mode. The results of this study do not support the current standard in pre-treatment methods. After the frequency decomposition of a spectral signal by Fourier transform and wavelet decomposition, it was revealed that the important information of whole plant leaf as an example of biological samples was contained in the spectral details. Therefore, smoothing techniques were not appropriate because high frequency information is lost. A vast majority of published work used a Savitzky-Golay smoothing method on infrared spectra of complex biological samples. This method was shown to be less effective. In contrast, taking the derivative of the spectra showed significantly better results; with this pre-treatment method, the overlapping bands become more evident. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
