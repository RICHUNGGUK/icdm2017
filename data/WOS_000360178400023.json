However, the evolution of the Internet ecosystem, which is driven by underlying economic incentives and ever emerging technologies, posts great challenges to the existing commercial CDNs (CCDNs). Thoroughly understanding the CDN industry from different aspects including market choice, technology, performance, tendency and infrastructure is indispensable to future Internet. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study of China's CDNs using continuous, at-scale, content-driven measurements. Based on the massive amount of measurement data with multidimensional properties, we demystify the CCDNs in China and answer two important questions: (1) what is the development trend of CCDNs in China and (2) what are their unique characteristics. The answers to these questions have significant implications on CDN providers and users.
