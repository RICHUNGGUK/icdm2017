In this paper some notes on a widely used distance of evidence, i.e., betting commitment distance, are provided, including the arguments on the rationality of its definition, some misuses and some counter-intuitive behaviors of betting commitment distance. Several numerical examples are also provided to support and verify our arguments.", "paper_title": "Some notes on betting commitment distance in evidence theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000300774900007"}
