However, this model only covers the special case where all outlier-free hypotheses are equally good, e.g. generated from noise-free data. In this paper, we explore a more general model which obviates the noise-free data assumption: we consider RANSAC a random process returning the best hypothesis, , among a number of hypotheses drawn from a finite set (). We employ the rank of within for the statistical characterisation of the output, present a closed-form expression for its exact probability mass function, and demonstrate that -distribution is a good approximation thereof. This characterisation leads to two novel termination criteria, which indicate the number of iterations to come arbitrarily close to the global minimum in with a specified probability. We also establish the conditions defining when a RANSAC process is statistically equivalent to a cascade of shorter RANSAC processes. These conditions justify a RANSAC scheme with dedicated stages to handle the outliers and the noise separately. We demonstrate the validity of the developed theory via Monte-Carlo simulations and real data experiments on a number of common geometry estimation problems. We conclude that a two-stage RANSAC process offers similar performance guarantees at a much lower cost than the equivalent one-stage process, and that a cascaded set-up has a better performance than LO-RANSAC, without the added complexity of a nested RANSAC implementation.", "paper_title": "Order Statistics of RANSAC and Their Practical Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000349987400002"}
