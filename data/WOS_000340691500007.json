Branching cells consist of subAES of the surrounding AES. Their maximal configurations are shown to tile any maximal configuration of the surrounding AES in a dynamic way. Branching cells for AES are developed in order to allow the analysis of an optimization procedure in the context of QoS management of web services, presented in a companion paper. Other applications of branching cells include the ability to add a probabilistic layer to AES in a natural fashion where concurrency meets probabilistic independence of choices in distinct and parallel branching cells.
