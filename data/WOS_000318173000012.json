It is known that , where V is a finite-dimensional vector space over a finite field and G (0) is an irreducible subgroup of GL (V), and I\" is a Cayley graph on V. In particular, we consider the case where for some prime p and G (0) is maximal in GL (d, p), with G (0) belonging to the Aschbacher classes , and .
