Current optical networks tend to use the same type of FEC for all the lightpaths even though lightpaths with higher OSNRs can be established by FECs with lower overhead. This paper proposes an adaptive approach to choose the most efficient FECs for different lightpaths based on their individual OSNRs. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and a simple waveplane-based heuristic algorithm considering shuffled lightpath demand sequences are developed to tackle the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem. The simulation results indicate that compared to the non-adaptive case, using the proposed adaptive FEC selection scheme can significantly reduce the required FEC overhead. Apart from being far more tractable, the proposed heuristic approach performs almost as well as the ILP model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
