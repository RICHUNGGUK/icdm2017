In this work, by using Gaussian factor modeling, its dedicated expectation maximization (EM) inference, and a statistical filter selection and algorithm stopping rule, we develop SURE (Stein's unbiased risk estimator) guided piecewise linear estimation (S-PLE), a patch-based prior learning algorithm capable of delivering state-of-the-art performance at image denoising. In light of this algorithm's features and its results, we also seek to address the number of components to be included when setting up a Gaussian mixture for image patch modeling. By juxtaposing both options, we show that a simple learned prior can perform as well as, if not better than, a much richer yet fixed prior.", "paper_title": "SURE Guided Gaussian Mixture Image Denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000326033500010"}
