This article address the problem of designing a control architecture for solar furnaces. It is motivated by the use of a solar furnace as an instrument in material science research to perform two types of experimental tests. In the first type, samples are tested in high-temperature stress cycles. In these experiments it is important to control the temperature profile. The second test type is characterised by imposing a solar radiation flux profile. On both experiment types there are strong nonlinear effects, a significant degree of parametric uncertainty and disturbances, such as solar radiation fluctuation due to clouds and to sun's apparent movement. Although the actuator (shutter) is much faster than the thermic system, it may destabilise the overall controlled system. The contribution of this article consists in the design of a control architecture for solar furnaces and the application of singular perturbation methods in order to derive conditions in the form of bounds for the speed of actuator dynamics so that the closed-loop system is stable.", "paper_title": "Temperature control of a solar furnace for material testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000292642900003"}
