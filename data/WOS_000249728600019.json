The DFAD methodology concept is based on the hypothesis that product life ends because a product is unable to adapt to change. A product may be retired for myriad reasons including that it is broken, out of style, or has become inefficient due to technology obsolescence. In these cases, the product was not able to adapt to change-it was unable to self-heal, it could not modify or reconfigure to meet changing fashion needs, or it could not be upgraded, for physical or economic reasons, to utilize new technology. To address these and similar issues, we are developing the DFAD methodology. DFAD is based on classical control theory and products are conceptualized and modeled as dynamic systems with feedback control strategies to respond, or adapt, effectively to changes in product performance criteria. The DFAD concept takes into account that changing performance requirements may be based on physical, cultural, environmental, and/or economic considerations, among others. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
