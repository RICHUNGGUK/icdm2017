The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are penalized with linear and non-linear drags and the computations are carried out with a high-order numerical scheme combined with a selective spatial filtering technique. To assess the validity of the present penalization method, the aerodynamic performance of a porous plate is investigated for different porosities and pore structures, in particular the predicted relationships between pressure drop and transpiration velocity are compared with those of direct flow simulation. Then, the effect of passive porous surfaces on the pressure field is investigated by considering the flow over a flat plate with perforated surfaces at Re-h, = 1000. The computed result shows that a passive form of time-dependent blowing and suction along the perforated surface breaks the spatially coherent pressure field, and as a consequence, reduces drag and lift forces, including alteration of Karman vortex shedding frequency. The importance of a non-linear drag term on determination of permeability is also demonstrated with discussion of Darcy and non-Darcy regimes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
