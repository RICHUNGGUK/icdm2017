With the explosive growth of web documents, sentiment analysis is becoming a hot topic in both academic research and system design. Fine-grained sentiment analysis is traditionally solved as a 2-step strategy, which results in cascade errors. Although joint models, such as joint sentiment/topic and maximum entropy (MaxEnt)/latent Dirichlet allocation, are proposed to tackle this problem of sentiment analysis, they focus on the joint learning of both aspects and sentiments. Thus, they are not appropriate to solve the cascade errors for sentiment analysis at the sentence or subsentence level. In this article, we present a novel jointly fine-grained sentiment analysis framework at the subsentence level with Markov logic. First, we divide the task into 2 separate stages (subjectivity classification and polarity classification). Then, the 2 separate stages are processed, respectively, with different feature sets, which are implemented by local formulas in Markov logic. Finally, global formulas in Markov logic are adopted to realize the interactions of the 2 separate stages. The joint inference of subjectivity and polarity helps prevent cascade errors. Experiments on a Chinese sentiment data set manifest that our joint model brings significant improvements.", "paper_title": "Joint Model for Subsentence-Level Sentiment Analysis with Markov Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000359021200012"}
