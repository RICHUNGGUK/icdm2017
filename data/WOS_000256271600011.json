Their rotational potential energy surface (PES) was calculated at the RHF/6-31G(d,p), 133LYP/6-31G(d,p), B3LYP/cc-pVDZ and AM1 levels. Solvent effects were evaluated using the polarizable continuum model. The NMR and theoretical studies showed that, in the free base, the N-methyl group and the ring are preferentially trans. This preference is stronger in the salts and corresponds to the X-ray structure of the hydrochloride. However, the energy barriers separating these forms are very low. The X-ray diffraction crystal structures of the anhydrous salt and its monohydrate differed mainly in the trans or cis relationship of the N-methyl group to the a-methyl, although these two forms interconvert freely in solution.
