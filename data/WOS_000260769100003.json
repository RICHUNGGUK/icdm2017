However, most of the earlier algorithms proposed for fuzzy association rules mining either assume that fuzzy sets are given or employ a clustering algorithm, like CURE, to decide on fuzzy sets; for both cases the number of fuzzy sets is pre-specified. In this paper, we propose an automated method to decide on the number of fuzzy sets and for the autonomous mining of both fuzzy sets and fuzzy association rules. We achieve this by developing an automated clustering method based on multi-objective Genetic Algorithms (GA); the aim of the proposed approach is to automatically cluster values of a quantitative attribute in order to obtain large number of large itemsets in less time. We compare the proposed multi-objective GA based approach with two other approaches, namely: 1) CURE-based approach, which is known as one of the most efficient clustering algorithms; 2) Chien et al. clustering approach, which is an automatic interval partition method based on variation of density. Experimental results on 100 K transactions extracted from the adult data of USA census in year 2000 showed that the proposed automated clustering method exhibits good performance over both CURE-based approach and Chien et al.'s work in terms of runtime, number of large itemsets and number of association rules.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective genetic algorithms based automated clustering for fuzzy association rules mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000260769100003"}
