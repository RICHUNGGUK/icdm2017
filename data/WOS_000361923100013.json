The model has the vehicle's acceleration and jerk, and the road inclination as input variables, and the output of the FLmRB is the regeneration factor, i.e. the ratio of regenerative braking force to the total braking force. The regeneration factor expresses the percentage of energy recovered to the battery from braking. The purpose of the FLmRB development is to create realistic EV models using as least as possible manufacturers intellectual property data, and avoiding the use of EV on-board sensors. To tune the model, real data was gathered from short and long-distance field tests with a Nissan LEAF and compared with two types of simulations, one using the proposed FLmRB, and the other considering that all the braking force/energy is converted to electric current and returned back to charge the battery (100% regeneration). The results show that the FLmRB can successfully infer the regenerative braking factor from the measured EV acceleration and jerk, and road inclination, without anylnowledge about the EV brake control strategy.
