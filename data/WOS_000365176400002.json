When multiple agents are involved in the events, characterizing events naturally suggests encoding interactions as relations. Learning event models from this kind of relational spatio-temporal data using relational learning techniques such as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) hold promise, but have not been successfully applied to very large datasets which result from video data. In this paper, we present a novel framework REMIND (Relational Event Model INDuction) for supervised relational learning of event models from large video datasets using ILP. Efficiency is achieved through the learning from interpretations setting and using a typing system that exploits the type hierarchy of objects in a domain. The use of types also helps prevent over generalization. Furthermore, we also present a type-refining operator and prove that it is optimal. The learned models can be used for recognizing events from previously unseen videos. We also present an extension to the framework by integrating an abduction step that improves the learning performance when there is noise in the input data. The experimental results on several hours of video data from two challenging real world domains (an airport domain and a physical action verbs domain) suggest that the techniques are suitable to real world scenarios.", "paper_title": "Learning Relational Event Models from Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000365176400002"}
