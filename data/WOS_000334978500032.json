Traditional reputation schemes are common approaches to address security, but they are not suitable for direct application to hybrid wireless mesh networks because the node cooperation and hierarchical construction are not considered. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic hierarchical reputation evaluation scheme (DHRES) to provide security for hybrid wireless mesh networks. In this scheme, the virtual cluster structure is built to introduce the reputation relation, including the related nodes' roles and functions. Moreover, the reputation evaluation mechanism is based on the correlation between nodes such that the reputation information of the nodes is updated according to their different roles. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional reputation models, the proposed scheme can more accurately reflect the security status of nodes, particularly in cases where the malicious nodes are mesh clients.
