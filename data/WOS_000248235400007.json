These bounds are used to obtain upper bounds on the size of codes whose maximum distance is close to their minimum distance. It is then demonstrated how such bounds can be applied to bound from below the smallest attainable ratio between the maximum distance and the minimum distance of codes. Finally, counterparts of the bounds are derived for the special case of constant-weight codes.", "paper_title": "Bounds for binary codes with narrow distance distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000248235400007"}
