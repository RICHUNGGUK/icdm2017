We empirically demonstrate that VarClust is at least as accurate as, and requires less node-to-node communication (and hence consumes less energy) than, a state-of-the-art aggregation approach, affinity propagation. This superiority holds for both the clustering and aggregation phases of inference, and is demonstrated over a range of noise levels and for a range of random and small-world graph topologies.", "paper_title": "An efficient decentralized clustering algorithm for aggregation of noisy multi-mean data", "paper_id": "WOS:000351523100007"}
