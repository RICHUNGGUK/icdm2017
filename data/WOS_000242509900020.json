NI-MVCCI technique is used for post-processing the results of finite element analysis (FEA) for computation of strain energy release rate (SERR) components and the corresponding stress intensity factor (SIF) for cracked plates. NI-MVCCI technique has been demonstrated for 4-noded, 8-noded (regular and quarter-point) and 9-noded (regular and quarter-point) isoparametric plate finite elements. These elements are based on Mindlin's plate theory that considers shear deformation. For all the elements, reduced integration/selective reduced integration techniques have been employed in the studies. In addition, for 9-noded element assumed shear interpolation functions have been used to overcome the shear locking problem. Numerical studies on fracture analysis of plates subjected to tension-moment and tension-shear loads have been conducted employing these elements. It is observed that among these elements, the 9-noded Lagrangian plate element with assumed shear interpolation functions exhibits better performance for fracture analysis of cracked plates.
