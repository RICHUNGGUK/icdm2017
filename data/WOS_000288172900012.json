The control objective is to provide velocity and altitude tracking in the presence of the uncertainties and unknown nonlinearities in the model caused by variations in flight conditions. By approximating the multi-time-scale model with FSPM, ill-posed matrix calculations are circumvented. Under this framework, a fuzzy multi-objective robust controller is developed, and the linear matrix inequalities (LMI) condition is derived. Numerical simulation using the longitudinal model of a hypersonic aircraft is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective robust control based on fuzzy singularly perturbed models for hypersonic vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000288172900012"}
