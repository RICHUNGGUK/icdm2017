Optimization criteria included maximum energy efficiency and overall uniformity. The relations thus derived are a simple and elegant method for designing any type of public lighting installation without the need to use complex, expensive and/or unavailable software. It would therefore be desirable that manufacturers include such parameters in the product datasheet in order to make the calculation easier. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
