However, evidence concerning the effectiveness of the technology is limited hindering the wide adoption of a HIE. The objective of this study was to assess impacts of a HIE on healthcare utilization and costs of patient episodes at a tertiary care hospital following referrals by clinic physicians. Material/methods: We studied 1265 HIE and 2702 non-HIE episodes after physicians referred patients from 35 HIE and 59 non-HIE clinics to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) during a 17-month period from June 2009. We examined 9 measures of healthcare utilization and the magnitude of clinical information exchanged in 4 categories. We estimated the savings resulting from HIE use through linear regression models with dummy variables for HIE participation and patient classification codes controlling the case-mix differences between HIE and non-HIE cases. Results: The total charges incurred by the HIE group during episodes at SNUBH were approximately 13% lower (P < 0.001), and the charges for clinical laboratory tests, pathological diagnosis, function tests, and diagnostic imaging were 54% (P < 0.001), 76% (P < 0.001), 73% (P < 0.001), and 80% (P < 0.001) lower for the HIE group than for the non-HIE group. SNUBH physicians had access to more clinical information for HIE than for non-HIE patients. Conclusions: HIE technology improved physicians' access to past clinical information, which appeared to reduce diagnostic test utilization and healthcare costs. The payer was the major beneficiary of HIE cost savings where as providers paid for the technology. Fair allocation of benefits and costs among stakeholders is needed for wide HIE adoption.
