Balanced biasing for the n-channel and p-channel diode-connected MOS-FETs realized by the symmetric PV cells effectively compensates Vths and prevents useless leakage current, resulting in the improved efficiency of the rectifier under low input power conditions. In addition, by extending the balanced biasing concept, output-voltage-boosted PV cell structure was proposed and found to be effective for further improving the efficiency of the rectifier. As a result, under a typical indoor lighting condition of 300 lx, power conversion efficiency of 25.4% was achieved at -20 dBm of 920MHz RF input and 47 k Omega output loading conditions, being 3.6 times larger than a conventional rectifier without PV assistance.", "paper_title": "Efficiency Improvement in Photovoltaic-Assisted CMOS Rectifier with Symmetric and Voltage-Boost PV-Cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400007"}
