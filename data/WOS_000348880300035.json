A new step is introduced to the affinity propagation process to iteratively update the attribute weights based on the current partition of the data. The relative magnitude of the attribute weights can be used to identify the subspaces in which clusters are embedded. Experiments on both synthetic data and real data show that the new algorithm outperforms the affinity propagation algorithm in recovering clusters from data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
