To achieve this aim, we propose a new version of the standard mean-variance framework. For our purpose, a particular class of utility functions G has been introduced. The induced transformation of G is considered and the definition of semi-copula D hinges on the family of the indifference curves of G. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
