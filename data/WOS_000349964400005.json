Orthogonal dipole elements etched on the substrate are designed to operate at 10 and 13.5 GHz, respectively. By introduction of element rotation technique, the proposed reflectarray has a good isolation between the two operating bands and obtains excellent performance of circular polarization compared with the conventional design. All the simulated and measured results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed reflectarray.
