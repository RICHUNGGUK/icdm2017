While there are significant individual and collective benefits from being more connected, there are also concerns associated with 'always on' work practices. This paper reports on a two-phase case study of smartphone users in a global financial services firm comparing the use of smartphones and their impact on work over time. We found that mobile communication technology practices have evolved within a relatively short (5-year) period of time as users seek to manage connectivity across work and non-work spaces. Disconnecting from work is no longer possible, nor desirable, for many users, who exercise choice (agency), switching between work and non-work interactions to regulate the connective flow across multiple connective media.", "paper_title": "Working with connective flow: how smartphone use is evolving in practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000341070600005"}
