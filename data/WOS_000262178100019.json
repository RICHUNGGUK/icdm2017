Sometimes there are some candidates and companies have to select the best one. In general, many factors affect this problem which adheres to uncertain and imprecise data, and usually several people from different functional areas of the company are involved in this process. This study aims to improve the quality of decision in this area. In this paper a systematic decision process for selecting external consultant is proposed. The proposed method is based on TOPSIS method in fuzzy environment. Decision criteria are obtained from the nominal group technique (NGT). Additionally, a real case study is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
