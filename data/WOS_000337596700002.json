Within the techniques for dealing with front displacements and moving boundaries between different density and/or viscosity fluids, phase fields are a class of models in which a diffusive transition region is taken into account instead of a steep interface. Although these models have a physical motivation, they require the definition of extra parameters. In order to make it less parameter dependent, the classic Allen-Cahn phase field model is modified, exploring its similarities with residual-based discontinuity-capturing schemes, making the phase field equation dependent on its own residual. We solve the coupling between incompressible viscous fluid flow and the phase field advective-diffusive-reactive transport to simulate the main processes in interface tension and/or buoyancy driven problems. For the solution of the Navier-Stokes and transport equations, we use a stabilized finite element formulation. The implementation has been performed using the libMesh finite element library, written in C++ , which provides support for adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. A chemical convection benchmark problem is used to validate the proposed model, and then we solve two bubble interaction problems.
