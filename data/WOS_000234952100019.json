Though they were originally designed as a communication too] or for personal use, and due to the rapid availability of wireless network technologies, people have begun to use mobile devices for supporting collaborative work and learning. There is, however, a serious problem in mobile devices related to their user interfaces. In this paper, we try to alleviate the problem and propose intuitive techniques for information transfer, which is one of the typical usages of mutually-connected computers. Our system, Toss-it, enables a user to send information from the user's PDA to other electronic devices with a \"toss\" or \"swing\" action, like a user would toss a ball or deal cards to others. The implementation of Toss-It consists of three principle parts - gesture recognition, location recognition, and file transfer. We especially describe the details of gesture recognition and location recognition. We then evaluate the practicability and usability of Toss-It through the experiments. We also discuss user scenarios describing how Toss-It can support users' collaborative activities.", "paper_title": "Toss-it: Intuitive information transfer techniques for mobile devices using toss and swing actions", "paper_id": "WOS:000234952100019"}
