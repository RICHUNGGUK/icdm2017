By gathering data at unprecedented temporal and spatial granularity, sensor networks are revolutionizing these applications. Given the scale and complexity of these systems, they face a critical challenge in software Operations and Management, that is, installing, configuring, and updating thousands of software components in a heterogeneous sensor network. In this paper, we discuss automating and simplifying the process of defining the software environment on a sensor node running the Android platform. Android has significant share in the mobile phone market and runs on a broad range of devices including embedded platforms. This paper outlines the use of a new method for configuring embedded devices and sensor networks by drawing from techniques used for defining the software environment in data centers. We have also developed a software prototype to allow for a simple, reproducible, and flexible configuration of the Android software stack on a sensor node. Our exploratory research provides an insight into the use of modular configuration techniques in embedded devices and how they can be applied to the Android ecosystem.
