This load-balancing problem can lead to overloading and network congestion. This survey examines the problem, along with state-of-the-art network- and wireless-station-based solutions. It also presents experimental results using off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11 devices. As the results show, effectively balancing AP traffic loads can increase overall system throughputs.", "paper_title": "Load Balancing in IEEE 802.11 Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262501000010"}
