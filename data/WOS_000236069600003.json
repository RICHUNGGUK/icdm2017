It is therefore important to know the amount of noise at a certain point on the substrate. Existing transistor-level simulation approaches based on a substrate model extracted from layout information are not feasible for digital circuits of practical size. This paper presents a complete high-level methodology, which simulates a large digital standard cell-based design using a network of substrate macromodels, with one macromodel for each standard cell. Such macromodels can be constructed for both EPI-type and bulk-type substrates. Comparison of our substrate waveform analysis (SWAN) to several measurements and to several full SPICE simulations indicates that the substrate noise is simulated with our methodology within 10%-20% error in the time domain and within 2 dB relative error at the major resonance in the frequency domain. However, it is several orders of magnitude faster in CPU time than a full SPICE simulation.", "paper_title": "SWAN: High-level simulation methodology for digital substrate noise generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236069600003"}
