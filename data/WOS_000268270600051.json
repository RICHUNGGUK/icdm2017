We propose a handwritten numeral recognition methodology based on simplified structural classification, by using a much smaller set of primitive types. and fuzzy memberships. More specifically, based on three kinds of feature points, we first extract five kinds of primitive segments for each image. A fuzzy membership function is then used to estimate the likelihood of these primitives being close to the two vertical boundaries of the image. Finally, a tree-like classifier based on the extracted feature points, primitives and fuzzy memberships is applied to classify the numerals. With our system, handwritten numerals in NIST Special Database 19 are recognized with correct rate between 87.33% and 88.72%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
