In this study, we propose a novel algorithm to perform iterative updates of a given BPPM, satisfying marginal probability constraints that are (approximately) given by recently developed biochemical experiments, such as SHAPE, PAR, and FragSeq. The method is easily implemented and is applicable to common models for RNA secondary structures, such as energy-based or machine-learning-based models. In this article, we focus mainly on the details of the algorithms, although preliminary computational experiments will also be presented.", "paper_title": "Direct Updating of an RNA Base-Pairing Probability Matrix with Marginal Probability Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000311955700001"}
