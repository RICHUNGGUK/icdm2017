Attractive features offered by the novel topologies are the realization of the five standard filter functions, the capability of electronic tuning of both the resonance frequency and Q factor without disturbing each other, their wide range of frequency tuning, and their potential for low-voltage operation. The performance of the proposed topologies has been evaluated through simulation results, using the Analog Design Environment of Cadence software.", "paper_title": "Log-domain SIMO and MISO low-voltage universal biquads", "paper_id": "WOS:000289103200010"}
