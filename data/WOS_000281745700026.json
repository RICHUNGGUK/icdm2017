Before setting up house, determining meeting place and opening business shop, it is natural that we consider the geographical advantage depending on the purpose. In this paper we propose an extended spatial interaction model permitting consideration of several path selection for each origin-destination pair. The spatial interaction model is known as a general model because it has been developed by entropy maximization principle for a long history. From observed data about traffic flow, our model can estimate traffic volume from origin to destination by using observed traffic flow data. It can be regarded as a merged concept between the geographical advantage and accessibility of the spatial interaction model in unified way. The parameter estimation procedure for the proposed model is developed. The availability of our model which can consider not only a network structure but also a traffic flow is shown in a numerical experimentation.", "paper_title": "GEOGRAPHICAL ADVANTAGE FROM ACCESSIBILITY BASED ON SPATIAL INTERACTION MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000281745700026"}
