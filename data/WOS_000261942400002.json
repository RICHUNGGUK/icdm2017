Based on sliding mode controller design, a fault tolerant control method is proposed. By means of the feasibility of some linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), delay dependent sufficient condition is derived for the existence of a linear sliding surface which guarantees quadratic stability of the reduced-order equivalent system restricted to the sliding surface. A reaching motion controller, which can be seen as a fault tolerant controller, can retain the stability of the closed loop system in the present of uncertainties, disturbances and actuator fault is designed. A numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "FAULT TOLERANT CONTROL FOR UNCERTAIN TIME-DELAY SYSTEMS BASED ON SLIDING MODE CONTROL", "paper_id": "WOS:000261942400002"}
