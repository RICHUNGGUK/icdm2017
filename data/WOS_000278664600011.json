Very few contemporary studies have addressed the issue of understanding the actual beliefs and attitudes toward such initiatives. In this study, we investigate the beliefs and attitudes surrounding the ill-fated Australian Government's Health and Social Services Smart Card. We apply a proven electronic business theory model to address the research question: what are the general beliefs and attitudes of the Australian community and industry toward the introduction and use of the smart card? The study uses a composite concept mapping and content analysis technique to reveal that information security, personal privacy and the spectre of a national identification card engender serious community concerns over the proposed introduction of the smart card. The article brings further empirical understanding of the use of public smart cards, while highlighting the importance of political transparency, broad ranging community consultations, and sound technical design in electronic government projects.", "paper_title": "Building better government IT: understanding community beliefs and attitudes toward smart card technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000278664600011"}
