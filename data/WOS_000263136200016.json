Actual data generally yield a linear growth or S-shaped growth. We study the h-index's growth in computer simulations of the publication-citation process. In most simulations the h-index grows linearly in time. Only occasionally does an S-shape occur, while in our simulations a concave increase is very rare. The latter is often signalled by the occurrence of plateaus-periods of h-index stagnation. Several parameters and their influence on the h-index's growth are determined and discussed.", "paper_title": "Simulating Growth of the h-Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000263136200016"}
