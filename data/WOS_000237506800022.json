Using ant-style pheromone trails as the basis for a pseudo-random walk procedure, they explore the world uniformly and negotiate to allocate collection and delivery tasks. Global information is disseminated via a publish/subscribe mechanism. The system is implemented using the concurrent logic programming language Qu-Prolog.", "paper_title": "Implementing pheromone-based, negotiating forager agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000237506800022"}
