The model introduces a c-evolute to approximate the edge curve in the gray-level image. The c-evolute concept has three major novelties: (1) The locus of Particle Motion in a Vector Image Field (PMVIF) is a c-evolute of image edge curve; (2) A geometrical interpretation is given to the setting of the parameters for the method based on the PMVIF; (3) The gap between the image edge's critical property and the particle motion equations appeared in PMVIF is padded. Our experimental simulation based on the image gradient field is simple in computing and robust, and can perform well even in situations where high curvature exists.", "paper_title": "Geometric analysis of particle motion in a vector image field", "paper_id": "WOS:000242704500005"}
