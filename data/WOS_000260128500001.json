A GA is applied in order to enhance the performance of some known techniques for OFDM PAPR reduction and the potential benefits are analyzed. Using the proposed techniques, the system designer can take advantage of the GA versatility, robustness, and adaptability to specific system requirements, in order to achieve a convenient trade-off between effectiveness and computational burden.", "paper_title": "Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction of OFDM Signals Using Evolutionary Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000260128500001"}
