However, with their flourishing, many deficiencies have also appeared. These have led to a low acceptance rate of WDSS. Thus, knowing what these deficiencies or influencing factors has become very important to those firms intending to implement their own WDSS. This study constructed an empirical study to investigate a famous portal Web site in Taiwan. One hundred and seventy effective responses were collected. The results indicate that all hypotheses, except perceived risk and response time, are supported. Attitude, the subjective norm and perceived behavioral control are determinants to explain a user's intention to use WDSS. Furthermore, compatibility, trust, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness have a significant effect on attitude, interpersonal and external influence have a notable impact on the subjective norm; and self efficacy and facilitating conditions also have a significant consequence on perceived behavioral control.", "paper_title": "FACTORS INFLUENCING USER ACCEPTANCE OF WEB-BASED DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000208868900008"}
