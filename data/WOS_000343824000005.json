Based on the Lyapunov functional method, switching analysis techniques, the comparison principle and a new impulsive delay differential inequality, we derive some sufficient conditions which depend on delay and impulses to guarantee the exponential synchronization of the coupling delay switching recurrent neural networks with stochastic perturbation. Simulation results finally demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Global exponential synchronization for coupled switched delayed recurrent neural networks with stochastic perturbation and impulsive effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000343824000005"}
