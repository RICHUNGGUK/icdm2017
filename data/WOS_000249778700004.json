Most existing visual SLAM has been limited to the feature-based method and only a few researchers have proposed visual SLAM methods for building a grid map using a stereo vision system which has not been popular in practical application. In this paper, we estimate the planar depth by applying a simple visual sonar ranging technique to the single camera image and then associating sequential scans through our own pseudo dense adaptive scan matching algorithm reducing the processing time compared to the standard point-to-point correspondence based algorithm and finally produce a grid map. To this end, we construct a Pseudo Dense Scan (PDS) which is an odometry based temporal accumulation of the visual sonar readings emulating omni-directional sensing in order to overcome the sparseness of the visual sonar. Moreover, in order to obtain a much more refined map, we further correct the slight trajectory error incurred in the PDS construction step using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) which is a well-known optimization scheme. Experimental results show that our method can obtain an accurate grid map using a single camera without the need for a high price range sensors or stereo camera.", "paper_title": "Map building through pseudo dense scan matching using visual sonar data", "paper_id": "WOS:000249778700004"}
