The computing adopts 128 bits to store one float and works well for C-70, while the largest fullerene computed before is C-60, which can be easily obtained now. Some properties of the coefficients and zeroes of the permanental polynomials of IPR fullerenes C-60 and C-70 are also investigated. Computational results show the quadruple precision method can handle permanental polynomial of C-70 and even larger fullerenes, which are of interest in applications.", "paper_title": "Computing the Permanental Polynomial of the High Level Fullerene C-70 with High Precision", "paper_id": "WOS:000353424200003"}
