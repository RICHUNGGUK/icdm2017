A definition of a total disaggregated uncertainty measure on credal sets is proposed in this paper motivated by recent outcomes. This definition is based on the upper and lower values of Shannon's entropy for a credal Set. We justify the use of the proposed total uncertainty measure and the parts into which it is divided: the maximum difference of entropies, which can be used as a non-specificity measure (imprecision), and the minimum of entropy, which represents a measure of conflict (contradiction).", "paper_title": "Disaggregated total uncertainty measure for credal sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000236605900003"}
