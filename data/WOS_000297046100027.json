In this paper, by means of sequence polynomials of the underlying sequences, the properties of roots of the corresponding sequence polynomials of the interleaved sequences with period 4N and optimal autocorrelation value/magnitude are discussed in the splitting field of x(N) - 1. As a consequence, both the minimal polynomials and linear complexities of these three classes of sequences are completely determined except for the case of the sequences obtained from the generalized GMW sequences. For the latter, the minimal polynomial and linear complexity can be specially obtained if the sequence is constructed based on m-sequences instead of generalized GMW sequences.", "paper_title": "On the Linear Complexity of Binary Sequences of Period 4N With Optimal Autocorrelation Value/Magnitude", "paper_id": "WOS:000297046100027"}
