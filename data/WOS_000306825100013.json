In this paper, the improved SS (ISS) modulation is extended to cancel the host interference in this context. Then a robust and high-fidelity audio watermarking scheme based on the extended ISS with a psychoacoustic model is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is robust against most of the common attacks while preserving high audio quality.", "paper_title": "Robust Audio Watermarking Based on Extended Improved Spread Spectrum with Perceptual Masking", "paper_id": "WOS:000306825100013"}
