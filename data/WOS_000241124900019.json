These signals present a very clear periodicity that can be exploited by the use of a 2-D time/frequency transform to decorrelate it as much as possible. A brief theoretical approach is given to justify the use of this technique, and a comparison is made between a 2-D and a one-dimensional (1-D) uniform quantization scenarios. The influence of the error as well as the frame size on the estimation of the fundamental period is studied.", "paper_title": "On the use of 2-D coding techniques for ECG signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000241124900019"}
