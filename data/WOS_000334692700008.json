By introducing the following boost circuit, the output voltage in the application circuit varies with the input root mean square (RMS) voltage to reduce the demand for the large size of the inductor and the efficiency of the system keeps high under the low input voltage. A novel CRM PFC control system with smaller size inductor and higher efficiency is achieved by applied the following boost method to the core control circuits. Experiment results show that the inductance value of the boost inductor is 430 mu H using the presented PFC control system and 700 mu H using the traditional PFC control system when the input voltage varies from 85V to 265 V. The novel control method decreases the inductor's value at 38.2%, and the efficiency of the system improves at 1.62% under the input voltage of 85 V.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL CRM PFC CONTROL METHOD FOR REDUCING INDUCTOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000334692700008"}
