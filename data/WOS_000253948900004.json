A rhythm is represented by a sequence of \"Quick\" (Q) and \"Slow\" (S) symbols, which correspond to the (relative) duration of notes, such that S = 2Q. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for locating the maximum-length substring of a music text t that can be covered by a given rhythm r.", "paper_title": "Identifying rhythms in musical texts", "paper_id": "WOS:000253948900004"}
