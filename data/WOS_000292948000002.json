The purpose of the ECN bit is to notify TCP sources of an imminent congestion in order to react before losses occur. However, ECN is a binary indicator which does not reflect the congestion level (i.e. the percentage of queued packets) of the bottleneck, thus preventing any adapted reaction. In this study, we use a counter in place of the traditional ECN marking scheme to assess the number of times a packet has crossed a congested router. Thanks to this simple counter, we drive a statistical analysis to accurately estimate the congestion level of each router on a network path. We detail in this paper an analytical method validated by simulations which demonstrate the feasibility and the accuracy of the concept proposed and illustrate its use in a realistic scenario. We conclude this paper with possible applications and expected future work. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
