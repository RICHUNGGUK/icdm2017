It is assumed that the data transmission between the plant and the controller are subject to randomly occurred packet dropouts satisfying Bernoulli distribution and the dropout rate is uncertain. Based on a fuzzy-basis-dependent and mode-dependent Lyapunov function, the existence conditions of the desired H-infinity state-feedback controllers are derived by employing the scaled small gain theorem such that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable and achieves a guaranteed H infinity performance. The gains of the controllers are constructed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a practical example of robot arm is provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Input-Output Approach to Control for Fuzzy Markov Jump Systems With Time-Varying Delays and Uncertain Packet Dropout Rate", "paper_id": "WOS:000363233000007"}
