The advantage of a numerical representation of the band structure over an analytical approximation is the accurate representation of the energy bands in the high energy regime. This allows accurate treatment of hot carrier effects in semiconductors. In this work we outline an efficient full-band Monte Carlo (FBMC) simulator and investigate the accuracy of simulation results for different meshing approaches for the Brillouin zone. (C) 2008 IMACS.
