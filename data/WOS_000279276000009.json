In this paper, we present a practical network resource management framework, control-theoretic packet scheduler (CPS) system. Using our framework, an operating system can schedule both input and output streams accurately and efficiently. Our framework adopts very portable feedback control theory for efficiency and accuracy. The CPS system is able to operate independent of the internal network protocol state, and it is designed to schedule packet streams in fine-grained time intervals to meet the resource requirement. This approach simplifies the design of the CPS system, and leads us to obtain the intended output bandwidth. We implemented our prototype system in Linux, and measured the performance of the network resource management system under various network QoS constraints. The distinctive features of our principles are as follows: It is robust and accurate, and its operation is independent of internal network protocols.", "paper_title": "CPS: Operating System Architecture for Efficient Network Resource Management with Control-Theoretic Packet Scheduler", "paper_id": "WOS:000279276000009"}
