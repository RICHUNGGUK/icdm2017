These discrete distributions can be parameterized in terms of their range, mean, variance, and shape parameters. These models are fitted to an example involving mortality rates for children in a survey of families in Brazil. The methods illustrate that mortality rates in this survey increase with family size and that the correlation of within-family mortality status also depends on the family size. These methods are also applied to a laboratory study of birth defects in mice. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
