Selected receptor models from the trajectories demonstrated superior virtual screening performance compared to the initial models. The ensemble of the best models was able to retrieve a diverse set of known H4 ligands. Prospective virtual screening against these models and subsequent in vitro experimental validation identified novel H4 ligands. Compound 3 showing highest affinity and ligand efficiency represents an interesting scaffold for further medicinal chemistry exploration.", "paper_title": "Identification of Novel Histamine H4 Ligands by Virtual Screening on Molecular Dynamics Ensembles", "paper_id": "WOS:000334950000002"}
