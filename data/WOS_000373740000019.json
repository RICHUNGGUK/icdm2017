In this scheme, either the direct link or the relaying link is preselected before each transmission, based on a distributed mechanism. We begin by showing that an exact analysis is rather intricate, yielding a multifold integral-form solution. Motivated by this, we then derive a simple closed-form lower bound, which, importantly, proves to be a very tight approximation to the exact outage probability. We also assess the system diversity order via asymptotic analysis.", "paper_title": "Impact of Outdated Channel Estimates on a Distributed Link-Selection Scheme for AF Relaying Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000373740000019"}
