The temperature distribution is fully coupled with the fluid velocity through relaxation time. The present calculated results are in good agreement with available published data. It is found that the porosity of porous media near the walls has significant influence on the heat transfer, and the porosity of middle porous medium has little influence on the natural convection. It is of particular interest for thermal management in electronic packages, since it can reduce the space of air.", "paper_title": "Lattice Boltzmann simulation on natural convection heat transfer in a two-dimensional cavity filled with heterogeneously porous medium", "paper_id": "WOS:000238706700001"}
