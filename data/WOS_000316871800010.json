In this paper, we derive a novel implementation of a very computationally demanding matched filter-bank based a spectral estimator, namely the multi-dimensional Capon spectral estimator. To avoid the direct computation of the inverse covariance matrix used to estimate the Capon spectrum which can be computationally very expensive, particularly when the dimension of the matrix is large, we propose to use the discrete Zhang neural network for the online covariance matrix inversion. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm for one-dimensional (1-D), as well as for two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) data sequences is lower when a parallel implementation is used.", "paper_title": "Multi-dimensional Capon spectral estimation using discrete Zhang neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316871800010"}
