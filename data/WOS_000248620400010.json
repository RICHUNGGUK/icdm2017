We report a method for correcting HTS data prior to the hit selection process (i.e. selection of active compounds). The proposed correction minimizes the impact of systematic errors which may affect the hit selection in HTS. The introduced method, called a well correction, proceeds by correcting the distribution of measurements within wells of a given HTS assay. We use simulated and experimental data to illustrate the advantages of the new method compared to other widely-used methods of data correction and hit selection in HTS.", "paper_title": "An efficient method for the detection and elimination of systematic error in high-throughput screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000248620400010"}
