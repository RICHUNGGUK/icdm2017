The idea is to evaluate the effect of the conjugation of the original matrices and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of each other. Then, we exemplify its utility for computing similarity between square images from a classified bank of pictures. The performance of the method is evaluated with diverse experiments.", "paper_title": "Eigenconjugation: An approach for computing image similarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400024"}
