This paper presents a novel, adaptive LiDAR data-filtering algorithm that effectively filters out ground objects and generates a digital elevation model (DEM). Filtering and performance evaluation results indicate that the proposed algorithm not only filters out ground objects in urban, forest, and mixed land-cover areas, but also solves the difficulties that are typically encountered when dealing with complex features using surface-based LiDAR data-filtering algorithms.", "paper_title": "An adaptive filtering and terrain recovery approach for airborne LiDAR data", "paper_id": "WOS:000257693500023"}
