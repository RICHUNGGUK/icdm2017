We prove that the two-machine flowshop problem to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan) is NP-hard if job processing times are described by non-decreasing position dependent functions (aging effect) on at least one machine and strongly NP-hard if job processing times are varying on both machines. Furthermore, we construct fast NEH, tabu search with a fast neighborhood search and simulated annealing algorithms that solve the problem with processing times described by arbitrary position dependent functions that model both learning and aging effects. The efficiency of the proposed methods is numerically analyzed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
