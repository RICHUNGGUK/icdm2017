The approach addresses the optimal material/stacking sequence in laminate construction and material distribution topology in composite structures as a multimodal optimization problem. The proposed evolutionary process is based on a sequential hierarchical relation between subpopulations evolving in separated isolation stages followed by migration. Improvements based on the species conservation paradigm are performed to avoid genetic tendencies due to elitist strategies used in the hierarchical subpopulations. The concept of species is associated with material distribution topology in composite structures, and an enlarged master population with age structure is considered concurrently with the hierarchical topology. Rules based on species concept are imposed on either isolation or migration stages to overcome the predominance of a species and to guarantee the diversity. A mutation process controlled by the stress field is implemented, improving the local genetic search. The proposed model allows multiple solutions for the optimal design problem.", "paper_title": "A hierarchical genetic algorithm with age structure for multimodal optimal design of hybrid composites", "paper_id": "WOS:000236002400004"}
