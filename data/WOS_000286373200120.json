Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) are well suited for solving multiobjective task scheduling problem. In this paper, the two conflicting objectives namely, makespan and reliability are considered. The performance of MOEA scan be improved by hybridization with local search. Hybridization of MOEAs improves the convergence speed to Pareto front. Simple neighborhood search (SNS) algorithm is used as the local search algorithm. The weighted-sum based approach for solving the MOP with its hybrid version is compared. Then the two MOEAs: SPEA2 and NSGA-II are compared with each other in the pure and hybrid version for random task graphs and also for a real-time numerical application graph. The simulations confirm that Hybrid NSGA-II is best suited for solving the task scheduling problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
