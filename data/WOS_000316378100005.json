However, recent studies indicated that students, learning in the collaborative project, may not actively contribute to the collaborative work and are involved only in a limited level of positive interdependence due to the ambiguous ownership on the collaborative work. To this end, this study proposes an approach to support collaborative learning based on the notion of Creative Commons (CC). CC may be helpful to enhance positive interdependency because it provides a mechanism which protects individual creations while encouraging remixing and deriving new creations from them. This study conducted an empirical evaluation to examine how students react to the collaborative learning with CC notions. The results showed that CC can significantly improve participants' attitude to the derivative works, the satisfaction level of remix outcomes, perception to the peer interaction and the sense of work ownership. Such results suggest that CC may be a potential avenue for increasing individuals' responsibilities and motivating them to participate in the collaborative learning activity.", "paper_title": "The effects of a Creative Commons approach on collaborative learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000316378100005"}
