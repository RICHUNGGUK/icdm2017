These relations correspond to join preserving mappings on the lattice of sub-hypergraphs. This paper introduces a generalization of a relation algebra in which the Boolean algebra part is replaced by a Heyting algebra that supports an order-reversing involution. A general construction for these symmetric Heyting relation algebras is given which includes as a special case the algebra of relations on a hypergraph. A particular feature of symmetric Heyting relation algebras is that instead of an involutory converse operation they possess both a left converse and a right converse which form an adjoint pair of operations. Properties of the converses are established and used to derive a generalization of the well-known connection between converse, complement, erosion and dilation in mathematical morphology. This provides part of the foundation necessary to develop mathematical morphology on hypergraphs based on relations on hypergraphs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
