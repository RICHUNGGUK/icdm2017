It uses the discriminant information of training samples by supervised mechanism, enhances within-class local information by an objective function. The objective function is used to construct adjacency graph's weight matrix. In order to avoid the drawback of Laplacianfaces' PCA step, ANLBM uses kernel mapping. ANLBM changes the problem from minimum eigenvalue solution to maximum eigenvalue solution, reduces the redundancy of the computing and increases the precision of the result. The experiments are performed on ORL and Yale databases. Experimental results show that ANLBM has a better performance.", "paper_title": "A new subspace analysis approach based on Laplacianfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100028"}
