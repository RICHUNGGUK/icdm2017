The rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) in living peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), derived from healthy subjects and breast cancer (BC) patients, was assessed by measuring the fluorescence intensity (FI) in individual cells under incubation with either the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or with tumor tissue, as compared to control. The suggested model diagnoses three conditions: (1) the subject is diseased, (2) the diagnosis is uncertain, and (3) the subject is not diseased. Out of 50 subjects tested, 44 were diagnosed correctly, in 5 cases the diagnosis was not certain, and 1 subject was diagnosed incorrectly. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
