We study this problem in the polynomial-time complexity theory of real functions based on the oracle Turing machine model. We show that a bounded domain S with a polynomial-time computable Jordan curve Gamma as the boundary may not have a computable minimum-area circumscribed rectangle. We also show that the problem of finding the minimum area of a circumscribed rectangle of a polynomial-time computable Jordan curve Gamma is equivalent to a discrete Sigma(P)(2)-complete problem. The related problem of finding the circumscribed squares of a Jordan Curve Gamma is also studied. We show that for any polynomial-time computable Jordan curve Gamma, there must exist at least one computable circumscribed square (not necessarily of the minimum area), but this square may have arbitrarily high complexity.
