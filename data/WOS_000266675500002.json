The raw degraded word images Contain undesirable shapes called critical shadows oil the background that cause noise in binary images. This noise Constitutes Obstacles to posterior segmentation of characters. Direct application of a thresholding method produces inadequate binary versions of these degraded word images. Our preprocessing method called Shadow Location and Lightening (SL*L) adaptively, accurately and without manual fine-tuning of parameters locates these critical shadows on grayscale degraded images using morphological operations, and lightens them before applying eventual thresholding process. In this way, enhanced binary images without unpredictable and inappropriate noise call be provided to subsequent segmentation of characters. Then, adequate binary characters can be segmented and extracted as input data to optical character recognition (OCR) applications saving computational effort and increasing recognition rate. The proposed method is experimentally tested with a set of several raw degraded images extracted from real photos acquired by unsophisticated imaging systems. A qualitative analysis of experimental results led to conclusions that the thresholding result quality was significantly improved with the proposed preprocessing method. Also, a quantitative evaluation Using a testing data of 1194 degraded word images showed the essentiality and effectiveness of the proposed preprocessing method to increase segmentation and recognition rates of their characters. Furthermore, an advantage of the proposed method is that Otsu's method as a simple and easily implementable global thresholding technique call be sufficient to reducing computational load.
