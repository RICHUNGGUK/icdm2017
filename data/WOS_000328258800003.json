Passive systems reviewed include tuned mass damper (TMD), tuned liquid column damper (TLCD), tuned liquid column ball damper (TLCBD), circular TLCD (CTLCD), and pendulum TLCD (PTLCD). Active control systems include active tuned mass dampers (ATMD) and piezoelectric actuators. Semi-active systems include magneto-rheological (MR) damper, negative stiffness devices (NSD), magneto-rheological damper TMD (MR-TMD), variable stiffness semi-active TMD (VS-STMD), variable damper STMD (VD-STMD), and recentering variable friction device (RVFD). Hybrid systems include active base isolation system and semi-active MR dampers with nonlinear base isolators. The current frontier of research is semi-active control of structures as well hybridization of various control systems. The problem is complex requiring integration of several different hardware and software technologies with structural design such as smart materials, adaptive dampers, actuators, sensors, and control and signal processing algorithms. This complexity also makes it an exciting area of research and development.", "paper_title": "Recent Advances on Vibration Control of Structures Under Dynamic Loading", "paper_id": "WOS:000328258800003"}
