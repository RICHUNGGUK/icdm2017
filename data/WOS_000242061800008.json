Within these models, fast algorithms investigating deadlocks and unreachable regions have been devised previously on a background of easily understandable \"directed\" geometric ideas. In this article, we modify notions and methods from homotopy theory to define and investigate \"essentially different\" schedules in a HDA and to detect whether two given runs are essentially different using an algorithm again based on \"directed geometry\".
