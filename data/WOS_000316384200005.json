However, little is known about the effects of potency on group maintenance outcomes, especially in virtual teams. The present study examines the moderating role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the relationships between potency and group maintenance outcomes in a longitudinal study. The study involved 44 groups of four members each, working in two communication media: face-to-face (F-t-F) and computer-mediated communication (CMC). The groups developed a project during four weekly sessions over a 1-month period. The results showed that ICTs moderated the relationship between potency and maintenance outcomes (process satisfaction and identification). The positive relationship between potency and maintenance outcomes was stronger in CMC groups than in F-t-F groups. The study has provided useful information that contributes to understanding in which contexts group potency produces the best results. Specifically, ICT appears to be a key moderating variable in the relationships between group potency and group maintenance outcomes.", "paper_title": "The role of information and communication technologies in the relationship between group potency and group maintenance outcomes: a longitudinal study", "paper_id": "WOS:000316384200005"}
