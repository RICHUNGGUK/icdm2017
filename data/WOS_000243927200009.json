Space discretization is used, but the state variables, ordered to the nodes, are continuous functions of time. In spite of a direct mathematical programming technique, the structural response to the time-dependent loading can be followed and the energy dissipation is considered. The design variables are the cross-sectional dimensions and the dissipative forces, and design constraints enforce upper bounds on the flexibilities.", "paper_title": "Optimal limit design of elasto-plastic structures for time-dependent loading", "paper_id": "WOS:000243927200009"}
