The huge volume of reads, along with short read length, high coverage, and sequencing errors, poses a great challenge to de novo genome assembly. However, the paired-end information provides a new solution to these problems. In this paper, we review and compare some current assembly tools, including Newbler, CAP3, Velvet, SOAPdenovo, AllPaths, Abyss, IDBA, PE-Assembly, and Telescoper. In general, we compare the seed extension and graph-based methods that use the overlap/lapout/consensus approach and the de Bruijn graph approach for assembly. At the end of the paper, we summarize these methods and discuss the future directions of genome assembly.", "paper_title": "De Novo Assembly Methods for Next Generation Sequencing Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000209529400009"}
