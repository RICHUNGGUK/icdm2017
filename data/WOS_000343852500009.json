The procedure focuses on the extraction of paved areas and water bodies. Road density is used to fill in gaps in OSM polygon coverage. Furthermore, it includes automatic downloading of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data and improving the elevation model with man-made landscape features such as elevated roads that are sampled from OSM. This is useful for hydraulic modelling in data scarce flood plain areas, where sharp elevation differences are dominated by man-made elevated elements. Test cases in Europe, South East Asia and East Africa demonstrate the potential of the procedure, although large differences in completeness of OSM coverage suggest it is best used in combination with other data sources.
