However, due to the introduction of the multi-hop relaying, the D2D communication has to occupy extra transmission time, which may decrease the efficiency of the communication system. In this paper, we propose a scheme to make node receive D2D signal and BS signal at overlapping time to improve the spectrum efficiency according to ZigZag decoding and successive-interference-cancellation (SIC). In this way, more data can be delivered during the same duration, thus the network throughput can be further improved. Numerical results verify the performance improvement of the proposed scheme when compared with a baseline scheme. Moreover, we expand the proposed scheme from one-hop relay scenario to multi-hop relay scenario.", "paper_title": "Interference Cancellation for Relay-Assisted D2D Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000364203500001"}
