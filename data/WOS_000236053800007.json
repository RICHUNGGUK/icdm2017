Then we collect elementary data on publication delays from over 3000 articles in 18 Chinese journals in four subjects and respectively assess information loss caused by publication delays using the model; thus the validity of the model is demonstrated. The information loss caused by publication delays in Chinese science journals is serious, especially in mathematics. Final statistical and analytical results indicate that delays in publication of some Western journals are also noticeable.", "paper_title": "A scientometric assessment of the information loss caused by the delays in publication of Chinese science journals", "paper_id": "WOS:000236053800007"}
