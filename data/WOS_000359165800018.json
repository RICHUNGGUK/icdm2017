As a result, we provide an alternative and shorter proof of a result by Damanik and Lenz characterizing powers in Sturmian words [6]. Further, as a consequence, we obtain a previously known formula for the fractional index of a Sturmian word based on the continued fraction expansion of its slope. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
