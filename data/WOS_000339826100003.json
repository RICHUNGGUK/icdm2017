We first generalize the classical Poisson summation formula to the AWT. We then define a generalized notion of resilience with respect to an arbitrary statistical measure of Boolean functions. We apply the Poisson summation formula to obtain a condition equivalent to resilience for one such statistical measure. Last, we show that the AWT of a large class of Boolean functions can be expressed in terms of the AWT of a Boolean function of algebraic degree at most three in a larger number of variables.", "paper_title": "On the arithmetic Walsh coefficients of Boolean functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000339826100003"}
