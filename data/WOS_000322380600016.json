In this brief, a new hardware architecture for ECPM over GF(p) is presented, based on the residue number system (RNS). The proposed architecture encompasses RNS bases with various word-lengths in order to efficiently implement RNS Montgomery multiplication. Two architectures with four and six pipeline stages are presented, targeted on area-efficient and fast RNS Montgomery multiplication designs, respectively. The fast version of the proposed ECPM architecture achieves higher speeds and the area-efficient version achieves better area-delay tradeoffs compared to state-of-the-art implementations.", "paper_title": "Efficient RNS Implementation of Elliptic Curve Point Multiplication Over GF(p)", "paper_id": "WOS:000322380600016"}
