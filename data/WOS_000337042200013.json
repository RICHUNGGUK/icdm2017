The concept is useful in various commercial cryptographic applications such as copyright protection, e-voting, and e-libraries. This paper reports the shortest NSDVS so far that consists of only two elements. The scheme is inspired by an identification scheme and Cramer et al.'s OR-proof technique where a prover can prove that he knows at least one out two secrets. It is solidified by a symmetric key based group to group encryption algorithm. Two implementations of the algorithm are reported. The scheme is provably secure with respect to its properties of unforgeability, non-transferability, privacy of signer's identity, and non-delegatability.", "paper_title": "A short non-delegatable strong designated verifier signature", "paper_id": "WOS:000337042200013"}
