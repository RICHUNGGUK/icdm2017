Two well-known classes of graphs, trees and cographs, both belong to distance-hereditary graphs. In this paper, we first show that the perfect domination problem can be solved in sequential linear-time on distance-hereditary graphs. By sketching some regular property of the problem, we also show that it can be easily parallelized on distance-hereditary graphs.", "paper_title": "An efficient parallel strategy for the perfect domination problem on distance-hereditary graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000242731900003"}
