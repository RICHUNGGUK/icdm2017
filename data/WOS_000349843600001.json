The ecp package is designed to perform multiple change point analysis while making as few assumptions as possible. While many other change point methods are applicable only for univariate data, this R package is suitable for both univariate and multivariate observations. Hierarchical estimation can be based upon either a divisive or agglomerative algorithm. Divisive estimation sequentially identifiers change points via a bisection algorithm. The agglomerative algorithm estimates change point location by determining an optimal segmentation. Both apporaches are able to detect any type of distributional change within the data. This provides an advantage over many existing change point algorithm which are only able to detect changes within the marginal distributions.", "paper_title": "ecp: An R Package for Nonparametric Multiple Change Point Analysis of Multivariate Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000349843600001"}
