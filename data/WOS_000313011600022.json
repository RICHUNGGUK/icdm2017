The proposed method PUC-MP which stands for the primary unit commitment-modification process, addresses this problem firstly by using a simple and new priority for operating the generating units in each hour, and then, using a modification process which enhances the solution quality with lower cost. The PUC-MP takes advantage of both deterministic and stochastic algorithms in its structure to solve the discrete-variable part of the UC problem for choosing a suitable combination of units in each hour, and also, continuous-variable part of it which is dispatching the operating units' output power to the power network load economically. The latter part which is called economic dispatch (ED) has been solved using an intelligent algorithm which in turn has been customized by two new ideas to increase its efficiency. Simulation results show that this new approach even without using its modification process can be considered as an effective approach which surpasses some other popular and recently reported methods in producing near-optimal and robust solutions.
