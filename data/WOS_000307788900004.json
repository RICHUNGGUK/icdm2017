In order to provide a quality-of-service in terms of overload probability, we formulate the problem of energy consumption as a constrained optimization problem, i.e., minimizing the number of active servers to reduce the energy consumption while keeping the overload probability below a desired threshold. An overload probability estimation model is derived by applying large deviation principle, and an online measurement based algorithm is developed to decide the number of servers to power on/off, which makes decision based on current workload without any prior knowledge of the workload statistics. Moreover, the proposed dynamic cluster reconfiguration algorithm iteratively adjusts the number of the active servers, instead of directly determining the number of active servers that is hard to guarantee optimality for the nonstationary workloads. Since the distribution of the workloads among the servers has an impact on potential active servers to turn off, a server scheduling strategy is proposed to collaborate with the proposed decision algorithm to achieve better energy conservation. In order to provide an integrated solution, we present an event model-based implementation to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed approach. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the scheme by using real workloads. The experimental results show the adaptability of the proposed approach to the variations in the workload and robustness of quality-of-service for nonstationary workloads.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Cluster Reconfiguration for Energy Conservation in Computation Intensive Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000307788900004"}
