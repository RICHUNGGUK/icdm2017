Since they have the advantages of cost, time, and flexibility, architects use them to guide design space exploration and to quantify the efficacy of an enhancement. However, long simulation times and poor accuracy limit their effectiveness. To reduce the simulation time, architects have proposed several techniques that increase the simulation speed or throughput. To increase the accuracy, architects try to minimize the amount of error in their simulators and have proposed adding statistical rigor to their simulation methodology. Since a wide range of approaches exist and since many of them overlap, this paper describes, classifies, and compares them to aid the computer architect in selecting the most appropriate one.", "paper_title": "Simulation of computer architectures: Simulators, benchmarks, methodologies, and recommendations", "paper_id": "WOS:000234742400003"}
