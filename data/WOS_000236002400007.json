Two different types of finite element solvers, one using total plasticity and the other using incremental plasticity, have been used. A comparison between response surface methodology and space mapping (SM) with the one-step solver as surrogate model has been done. The conclusion of this study is that the use of the total plasticity theory drastically reduces the required computing time. Furthermore, the solution from the SM optimization algorithm is close to the solution obtained by the incremental plasticity solver.", "paper_title": "Minimizing the risk of failure in a sheet metal forming process", "paper_id": "WOS:000236002400007"}
