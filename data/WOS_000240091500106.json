GMST problems are encountered in telecommunications network planning. A Tabu Search (TS) for the GMST problem is presented in this article. In our computational tests on 194 TSPLIB instances, TS found 152 optimal solutions. For those 42 unsolved instances, our algorithm has improved some previously best known solutions. Lower bounds of some unknown problems are improved by our heuristic relaxation algorithm.", "paper_title": "Tabu search for generalized minimum spanning tree problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500106"}
