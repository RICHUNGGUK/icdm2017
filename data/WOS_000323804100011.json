Instead of using the change of the CT attenuation value, a set of fractal features based on fractional Brownian motion model is proposed in this paper to automatically distinguish malignant nodules from benign nodules. In a set of 107 CT images from 107 different patients with each image containing a solitary pulmonary nodule, our experimental results obtained from a support vector machine classifier show that the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the ROC curve are 83.11%, 90.92%, 71.70%, 80.05%, 87.52%, and 0.8437, respectively, by using the proposed fractal-based feature set. Such a result outperforms the conventional method of using the change of the CT attenuation value as the feature for classification. When combining this conventional method with our proposed fractal-based method, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the ROC curve can be promoted to 88.82%, 93.92%, 82.90%, 87.30%, 90.20%, and 0.9019, respectively. In other words, a high performance of pulmonary nodule classification can be achieved with a single post-contrast CT scan. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
