In order to achieve the fault-tolerant of distributed systems, the Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem needs to be paid attention. Under many circumstances, a healthy processor in a distributed system needs to reach a common agreement before performing some special tasks even if the faults exist. However, the traditional agreement problem is solved in the fully connected network, broadcast network and well-defined network. In, this study, the agreement problem is revisited in the MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork) that is getting popular and its network topology is dynamic in nature. The MANET consists of wireless processors that communicate with each other in the absence of a fixed well-defined infrastructure and perhaps it is an unfully connected network. Besides, the dual failure mode on both processors and transmission media are considered in this paper. Our new protocol uses the minimum number of message exchanges to reach a common value while tolerating the maximum number of faulty processors in MANET.", "paper_title": "HYBRID CONSENSUS AGREEMENT ON CDS-BASED MOBILE AD-HOC NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000018"}
