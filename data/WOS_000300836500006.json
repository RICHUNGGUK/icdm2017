This article discusses the results of a project to build a scalable OCR workflow for historical collections based on open source tools that is particularly tailored towards use in small-scale historical archives. It argues that open source tools allow for better customization to match these requirements, particularly with regard to character model training and per-project language modelling. We offer insights into our accuracy evaluation results of various open source OCR tools, as well as a case study about the challenges and opportunities of open source OCR in historical archives.", "paper_title": "Ocropodium: open source OCR for small-scale historical archives", "paper_id": "WOS:000300836500006"}
