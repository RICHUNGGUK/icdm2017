These research areas include space situational awareness, autonomous systems, sensing and information fusion, surveillance, navigation, robust decision making, human-computer interfaces, and computational and machine intelligence. The possible contributions of artificial intelligence to these topics will be described and illustrated whenever possible by recently awarded grants.", "paper_title": "Artificial Intelligence Basic Research Directions at the US Air Force", "paper_id": "WOS:000346911500006"}
