An extensive and systematic comparative study among these confidence interval estimators through Monte Carlo simulations is presented. The performance of these confidence intervals are evaluated in terms of their coverage probabilities and expected interval widths. Our simulation studies suggest that the confidence interval estimator based on saddlepoint approximation is more appealing for large coverage levels (e.g., nominal level1% ) whereas the score confidence interval estimator is more desirable for those commonly used coverage levels (e.g., nominal level1% ). We illustrate these confidence interval construction methods with a real data set from a maternal congenital heart disease study.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of confidence intervals for negative binomial proportion", "paper_id": "WOS:000263717400003"}
