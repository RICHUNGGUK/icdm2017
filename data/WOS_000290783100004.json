The authors emphasise manufacturing reuse to lower the total non-recurring engineering and mass-production cost of 3D chips for multiple applications. Given a set of applications each employing a set of IPs and needing a certain amount of mass-production volume, the author's target 3D IC stack consists of platform dies and customised dies. Platform dies can be manufactured in large volume at low unit cost and used in multiple applications; Customised dies for individual application, on the other hand, will be smaller and easier to implement, as certain functionality has been allocated to the platform dies. The authors have developed a 3D IC cost model to evaluate platform-die configurations and compare the cost benefit of Chipsburger with that of either one 2D system-on-a-chip or 3D IC per application. The authors also develop a platform generator program for finding an optimised platform for a set of applications. Experimental results over industrial examples indicate that Chipsburger is indeed cost-effective for certain range of volume requirements.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional integrated circuits implementation of multiple applications emphasising manufacture reuse", "paper_id": "WOS:000290783100004"}
