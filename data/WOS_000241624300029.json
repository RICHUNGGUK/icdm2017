It consists of three key components; Adaptable User Interface (AUI), Storytelling Engine, Multimedia Object Library (MOL). AUI module allows users to input their description of objects guided by selected genre template. Through context cognition process, storytelling engine finds proper multimedia objects from MOL. Multimedia Object Library (MOL) contains various objects (e.g. characters, graphic objects, background images, music, and etc.) that are carefully prepared for designated application. We believe this proposed system provides various products idea in the area of content producing including education, e-learning, multimedia book etc.", "paper_title": "Adaptive UI storytelling system using MOL", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300029"}
