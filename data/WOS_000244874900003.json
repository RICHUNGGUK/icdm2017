Fractal interpolation defines a new kind of approximants showing non-smoothness properties and whose graph possesses a fractal dimension. This number can be used to quantify and characterize experimental signals. In this paper we develop some procedures to construct affine fractal functions close to classical interpolants in the sense of uniform metric. Upper bounds of interpolation error are found in all the cases and the convergence is proved. In the last paragraph, we prove (in a constructive way) the existence of a Schauder basis of affine fractal functions in C[a, b].", "paper_title": "Construction of affine fractal functions close to classical interpolants", "paper_id": "WOS:000244874900003"}
