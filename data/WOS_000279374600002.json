Sufficient conditions for the existence of state feedback controller are derived in terms of linear matrix inequities (LMIs), which guarantee asymptotic stability with the provided performance index for the normal and possible actuator faults cases. The related optimization problem is also offered to minimize the guaranteed cost performance bound. Illustrative examples are given to show the validity of the present control scheme. (C) 2010 IMACS.
