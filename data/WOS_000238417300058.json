The analysis from that research can be used to validate proposed ideas in evacuation and building designs to ensure safety of buildings given various agent behaviors. Two separate models were used to simulate the components of the emergency situation: fire and agent. The independent models were able to run using data computed by the other interacting models, allowing careful examination of real-time interactions in a situation. Through study of the interactions, a better understanding is gained of how individual variables such as exit position and width affect the evacuation process and escape rate in the given scenario. Exits can be relocated and changed to quickly assess the effect on the model. The results can be used for improving building design and regulations as well as training first responders.", "paper_title": "DDDAS for fire and agent evacuation modeling of the Rhode Island nightclub fire", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300058"}
