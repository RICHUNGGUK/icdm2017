A virtual combinatorial library of cyclic tetrapeptides (CTPs) was generated and the bonds in the low-energy structures were overlapped with canonical reverse-turn C alpha-C beta bonds (Tran et al., J Comput Aided Mol Des 19(8):551-566, 2005) to determine the utility of CTPs as reverse-turn peptidomimetics. All reverse turns in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a crystal structures resolution a parts per thousand currency sign3.0 A... were classified into the same known canonical reverse-turn C alpha-C beta bond clusters (Tran et al., J Comput Aided Mol Des 19(8):551-566, 2005). CTP reverse-turn mimics were compiled that mimicked both the relative orientations of three of the four as well as all four C alpha-C beta bonds in the reverse turns of the PDB. 54% of reverse turns represented in the PDB had eight or more CTPs structures that mimicked the orientation of all four of the C alpha-C beta bonds in the reverse turn.", "paper_title": "A virtual library of constrained cyclic tetrapeptides that mimics all four side-chain orientations for over half the reverse turns in the protein data bank", "paper_id": "WOS:000262124900003"}
