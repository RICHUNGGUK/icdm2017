However the traditional use of CAS only in math labs has led to a narrow view by the student: the CAS is an additional work, not included in the learning process. The didactic guidelines of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) propose a new teaching-learning model based on competencies. We suggest the use of the CAS be adapted to the new rules. In this paper, we present a model for the integrated use of the CAS, and we describe and analyze two experiments carried out in the academic year 2011-2012. Our analysis suggests that the use of CAS in all learning and assessment activities has the potential to positively influence the development of competencies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
