In current surgical simulation systems, the lack of an effective sense of touch is still a major problem. In this paper, a dynamic touch-enabled virtual palpation model is proposed. The palpation force sensing between the index finger and virtual tissues is simulated through a body-based haptic interaction model. Both contact and frictional forces are evaluated based on Hertz's contact theory, and the press distribution within the contact area is also specified. The non-linear viscoelastic behavior of typical tissues is mimicked via a volumetric tetrahedral mass-spring system. Reaction during the palpation is restricted to a local area to highly reduce the order of the dynamic equation of the entire system to guarantee a fast working rate. Mechanical tests have been performed to evaluate the palpation force perception and the realistic behavior of typical human tissues.
