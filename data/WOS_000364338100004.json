However, designers, technologists, and policymakers often operate independently, leading to products that are out of sync, lack interoperability, or are hindered by well-meaning (but obstructive) policy. Here, a collaborative policy design framework is proposed that will enhance developing wearable devices and guide interdisciplinary collaborators as they explore the various implications and effects of device design in social, technological, and regulatory contexts.", "paper_title": "Innovation and Wearable Computing A Proposed Collaborative Policy Design Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000364338100004"}
