It is a combination of multiple academic subjects and the latest technologies representing the developing tendency of future automobile technology and attracts more and more attention. In this paper, we made some useful explorations in the fields of intelligent vehicle control technology and obstacle avoidance, and a deep research is carried out about the distance of vehicle, vehicle tracking, vehicle lane changing and intersections obstacle avoidance and communication protocols, and some innovative ideas are proposed during the research. By using VANET, some predictable status of tracing and tracking of intelligent vehicle technology was researched, and the communication protocols between two vehicles, the safe spacing algorithm, the method of computing the actual distance at corners and straights, and the trajectory of lane change were designed. In addition, a series of vehicle tracing and tracking technologies, such as without knowing the road conditions, homeostatic mechanism, keeping a safe spacing to the target vehicle, and adjusting its own speed to track the target vehicle smoothly to the destination by comparing the actual distance and safe spacing between vehicles, were discussed here.", "paper_title": "Research on Vehicle Automatically Tracking Mechanism in VANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000323045100001"}
