Different than conventional battery powered wireless nodes, energy harvesting transmitters have to adapt transmission to availability of energy at a particular instant. In this setting, the optimal power allocation problem to maximize the sum throughput with a given deadline is formulated. The convergence of the proposed iterative coordinate descent method for the problem is proved and the short-term throughput maximizing offline power allocation policy is found. Examples for interference regions with known sum capacities are given with directional water-filling interpretations. Next, stochastic data arrivals are addressed. Finally, online and/or distributed near-optimal policies are proposed. Performance of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated through simulations.", "paper_title": "Sum-Rate Optimal Power Policies for Energy Harvesting Transmitters in an Interference Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000304736100005"}
