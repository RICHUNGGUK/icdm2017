In this article we present a survey on the state of the art channel assignment schemes in IEEE 802.11-based WLANs. After detailing out all the schemes, we provide a qualitative comparison among different schemes in terms of algorithm execution behaviors, complexity, and scalability. We then conclude the survey with several research issues open for further investigation.", "paper_title": "Channel Assignment Schemes for Infrastructure-Based 802.11 WLANs: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000274737100004"}
