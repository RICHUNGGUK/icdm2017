Current solutions consider the displayed content as interference and largely depend on channels orthogonal to visible light. They cannot directly align projector images with real-world surfaces, even though this may be the actual goal. We propose instead to model the light emitted by projectors and reflected into cameras and to consider the displayed content as additional information useful for direct alignment. Using a color camera, our implemented software successfully tracks with subpixel accuracy a planar surface of diffuse reflectance properties at an average of eight frames per second on commodity hardware, providing a solid base for future enhancements.", "paper_title": "Augmenting moving planar surfaces robustly with video projection and direct image alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000318575200006"}
