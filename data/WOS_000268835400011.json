Design/methodology/approach - The method converts the non-linear partial derivative system into an iterative system of linear equations. Using the well-known finite difference approximation, a numerical solution is computed very quickly. Findings - The paper gives the truncated error and the approximation error to conclude to the convergence. Originality/value - The paper shows the fast numerical solution leads to confidence in the numerical approximations for the comprehension of the phenomenon. Extends the corona-electrostatic electric field for granular mixture separation to new geometries easily.", "paper_title": "New results on the approximate solution of the non-linear partial derivative equation system of corona-electrostatic separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000268835400011"}
