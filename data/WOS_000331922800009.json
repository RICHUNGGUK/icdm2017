The performances of these schemes are evaluated based on the relevant eye diagrams and bit error rate (BER). The proposed configurations are studied and analyzed mathematically. Eye diagrams and BER's indicate an acceptable performance for the suggested structures. Feasible settings for the RF electrical power of the links are considered and the link performance for each setting is evaluated. A 4-dense wavelength division multiplexing (4-DWDM) link is considered for transmitting different types of data over a single mode fiber (SMF). Baseband digital data in the format of OSSB and RF-OSSB signals are transmitted over a 4-DWDM link. Furthermore, the link performance is considered for different electrical power settings of OSSB signal in order to achieve efficient transmission for DWDM network. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
