It was originally developed with an accurate off-lattice particle-based model at its core. This has recently been enhanced with the addition of a computationally efficient on-lattice model, which can be run stand-alone or coupled together for multiscale simulations using both models in regions where they are most required, increasing the applicability of Smoldyn to larger molecule numbers and spatial domains. Simulations can switch between models with only small additions to their configuration file, enabling users with existing Smoldyn configuration files to run the new on-lattice model with any reaction, species or surface descriptions they might already have.", "paper_title": "Multiscale reaction-diffusion simulations with Smoldyn", "paper_id": "WOS:000358173500030"}
