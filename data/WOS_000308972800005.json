Due to the short transmit-receive distance, femtocells can greatly lower transmit power, prolong handset battery life, and enhance the user-perceived Quality of Service (QoS). On the other hand, technical challenges still remain, mainly including interference mitigation, security and mobility management, intercepting wide deployment and adoption by both mobile operators and end users. This paper introduces a novel energy-centric handover decision policy and its accompanied algorithm, towards minimizing the power consumption at the mobile terminal side in the integrated LTE macrocell-femtocell network. The proposed policy is shown to extend the widely-adopted strongest cell policy, by suitably adapting the handover hysteresis margin in accordance with standardized LTE measurements on the tagged user's neighbor cells. Performance evaluation results show that significantly lower interference and power consumption can be attained for the cost of a moderately increased number of network-wide handover executions events.
