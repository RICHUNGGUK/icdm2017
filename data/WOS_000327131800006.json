We hypothesize that computer-based learning can play a critical role in connecting \"bottom-up\" (sensorimotor-first) learning in the arts to \"top-down\" (creativity-first) learning, by employing machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques that can play the role of the sensorimotor expert. This approach allows learners to experience components of higher-level creativity and social interaction even before developing the prerequisite sensorimotor skills or academic knowledge.", "paper_title": "Using machine learning to support pedagogy in the arts", "paper_id": "WOS:000327131800006"}
