In order to perform surveillance tasks, effective coordination and control in multi-camera systems is very important, and is catching significant research attention these days. This survey aims to provide researchers with a state-of-the-art overview of various techniques for multi-camera coordination and control (MC3) that have been adopted in surveillance systems. The existing literature on MC3 is presented through several classifications based on the applicable architectures, frameworks and the associated surveillance tasks. Finally, a discussion on the open problems in surveillance area that can be solved effectively using MC3 and the future directions in MC3 research is presented.", "paper_title": "Multi-Camera Coordination and Control in Surveillance Systems: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000355933700010"}
