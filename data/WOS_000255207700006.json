A total of 129 electronic sensors were installed in 17 test sections and subjected to 2,100 truck passes over several months immediately after construction. The measured strains were highly variable in the thin flexible pavement, but the program was still able to successfully trigger each section independently. The majority of signal processing was also performed within the program, which was written in Lab VIEW 7 Express. This approach significantly reduced the amount of postprocessing effort that would have otherwise been required. The quality of the triggering approach was compared to independently collected weigh in motion data. The majority of the test sections recorded within 0.5% of the number of vehicles recorded by the weigh in motion system. Key components of all major facets of the data acquisition and programming performed are discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "Innovative data acquisition for heavily instrumented flexible pavements", "paper_id": "WOS:000255207700006"}
