Incremental methods for updating approximations in rough set theory and its extensions have received much attention recently. Most existing incremental methods have difficulties in dealing with fuzzy decision systems which decision attributes are fuzzy. This paper introduces an incremental algorithm for updating approximations of rough fuzzy sets under the variation of the object set in fuzzy decision systems. In experiments on 6 data sets from UCI, comparisons of the incremental and non-incremental methods for updating approximations are conducted. The experimental results show that the incremental method effectively reduces the computational time.", "paper_title": "Incremental Maintenance of Rough Fuzzy Set Approximations under the Variation of Object Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000343004800008"}
