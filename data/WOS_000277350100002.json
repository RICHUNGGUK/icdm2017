Since the required previous analysis implies a number of fuzzy concepts, the general procedure here presented considers fuzzy logic to deal with specifications. As a consequence, time devoted to elicitation and requirement analysis is reduced.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Specification in Real Estate Market Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000277350100002"}
