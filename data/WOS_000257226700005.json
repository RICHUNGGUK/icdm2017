Watershed-based image segmentation has gained much popularity in the field of biomedical image processing and computer vision where large images are not uncommon. Time-critical applications like road traffic monitoring, and steel fissure analysis require fast realization of the segmentation results. The present paper proposes a fast watershed transform based on hillclimbing technique. The complexity of the algorithm has been reduced by doing away with multiplication normally required to form a lower complete image in an intermediate step of the overall segmentation. The reduced complexity makes the algorithm suitable for dedicated hardware implementation. An FPGA-based architecture has been developed to implement the proposed algorithm involving moderate hardware complexity. This architecture enhances the applicability of this algorithm for real-time applications.", "paper_title": "An efficient hillclimbing-based watershed algorithm and its prototype hardware architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000257226700005"}
