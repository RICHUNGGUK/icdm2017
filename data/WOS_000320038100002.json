Furthermore, we use a one-way state-based coupling (Dirichlet-Dirichlet boundary-condition coupling) to transfer the required information from the continuum region to the rarefied one. The current hybrid DSMC-NS frame is applied to the hypersonic flows over nanoflat plate and microcylinder cases. The achieved solutions are compared with the pure DSMC and NS solutions. The results show that the current hybrid approach predicts the surface heat transfer rate and shear stress magnitudes very accurately. Some important conclusions can be drawn from this study. For example, although the shock wave region would be a non-equilibrium region, it is not necessary to use a pure DSMC simulator to solve it entirely. This is important when the researchers wish to predict the surface properties such as velocity slip, temperature jump, wall heat flux rate, and friction drag magnitudes accurately. Our investigation showed that our hybrid solution time would be at least 40% (for the flat plate) and 35% (for the cylinder) of the time that must be spent by a pure DSMC solver to attain the same accuracy.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "A hybrid DSMC/Navier-Stokes frame to solve mixed rarefied/nonrarefied hypersonic flows over nano-plateandmicro-cylinder", "paper_id": "WOS:000320038100002"}
