The major performance measures of WEDM process generally include material removal rate, cutting width (kerf), surface roughness and dimensional shift. Although different mathematical techniques, like artificial neural network, gray relational analysis, simulated annealing, desirability function, Pareto optimality approach, etc. have already been applied for searching out the optimal parametric combinations of WEDM processes, but in most of the cases, sub-optimal or near-optimal solutions have been arrived at. In this paper, an attempt is made to apply six most popular population-based non-traditional optimization algorithms, i.e. genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, sheep flock algorithm, ant colony optimization, artificial bee colony and biogeography-based optimization for single and multi-objective optimization of two WEDM processes. The performance of these algorithms is also compared and it is observed that biogeography-based optimization algorithm outperforms the others. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
