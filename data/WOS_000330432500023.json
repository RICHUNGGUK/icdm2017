We have developed SeqDepot-a novel database that focuses solely on two primary goals: (i) assimilating known primary sequences with predicted feature data and (ii) providing the most simple and straightforward means to procure and readily use this information. Access to >28.5 million sequences and 300 million features is provided through a well-documented and flexible RESTful interface that supports fetching specific data subsets, bulk queries, visualization and searching by MD5 digests or external database identifiers. We have also developed an HTML5/JavaScript web application exemplifying how to interact with SeqDepot and Perl/Python scripts for use with local processing pipelines.", "paper_title": "SeqDepot: streamlined database of biological sequences and precomputed features", "paper_id": "WOS:000330432500023"}
