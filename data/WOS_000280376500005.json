We analyze the flow parts from a still image in order to get continuous video by image matting, image inpainting, projecting flow field onto the image and modulation. We construct and project 3D flow models onto still images and propose 2D modulation methods that are more suitable and practical to our synthesis. Our technique can edit still images that have flow parts. The experiments show the method is effective.", "paper_title": "FLOW VIDEO SYNTHESIS FROM AN IMAGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000280376500005"}
