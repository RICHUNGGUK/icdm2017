I/O has risen to become the bottleneck in high-performance computing for many applications. A possible approach to address this problem is to schedule parallel I/O operations explicitly. To this end. we propose two new I/O scheduling algorithms and evaluate the relative performance of the proposed policies against two baseline policies. Simulation results show that the proposed policies Outperform the baseline policies.
