These mechanisms are designed mainly to assist in filtering of undesirable email messages, in particular spam and phishing emails. We clarify the limitations of these mechanisms, identify risks, and make recommendations. In particular, we argue that, properly used, SPF and DKIM can both help improve the efficiency and accuracy of email filtering. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
