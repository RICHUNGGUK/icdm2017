An L(p,q)-labeling of a graph G with a span s is a labeling of its vertices by integers between 0 and s such that adjacent vertices of G are labeled using colors at least p apart, and vertices having a common neighbor are labeled using colors at least q apart. We denote by lambda(p,q) (G) the least integer k such that G has an L(p,q)-labeling with span k. The maximum average degree of a graph G, denoted by , is the maximum among the average degrees of its subgraphs (i.e. MAd (G)=max{2 vertical bar E(H)vertical bar/vertical bar V(H)vertical bar; H subset of G}). We consider graphs G with Mad(G)<10/3, 3 and 14/5. These sets of graphs contain planar graphs with girth 5, 6 and 7 respectively. We prove in this paper that every graph G with maximum average degree m and maximum degree Delta has: -lambda(p,q)(G)<=(2q-1)Delta+6p+10q-8 if m<10/3 and p >= 2q. -lambda(p,q)(G)<=(2q-1)Delta+4p+14q-9 if m<10/3 and 2q>p. -lambda(p,q)(G)<=(2q-1)Delta+4p+6q-5 if m<3. -lambda(p,q)(G)<=(2q-1)Delta+4p+4q-4 if m<14/5. We give also some refined bounds for specific values of p, q, or Delta. By the way we improve results of Lih and Wang (SIAM J.
