We explore the algebraic structure of its multirelational semantics and develop an axiomatization of concurrent dynamic algebras from that basis. In this context, sequential composition is not associative. It interacts with parallel composition through a weak distributivity law. The modal operators of concurrent dynamic algebra are obtained from abstract axioms for domain and antidomain operators; the Kleene star is modelled as a least fixpoint. Algebraic variants of Peleg's axioms are shown to be derivable in these algebras, and their soundness is proved relative to the multirelational model. Additional results include iteration principles for the Kleene star and a refutation of variants of Segerberg's axiom in the multirelational setting. The most important results have been verified formally with Isabelle/HOL.", "paper_title": "Concurrent Dynamic Algebra", "paper_id": "WOS:000365216500003"}
