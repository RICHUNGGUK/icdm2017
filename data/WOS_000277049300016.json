By partitioning the entire symbol buffer into four separate parts with a special low-conflict access control strategy, the symbol deinterleaver can be implemented with four-bank single-port on-chip memory blocks with slight overhead. The experimental result shows that 30% savings of hardware cost can be achieved compared with the conventional double-buffer approach. In addition, a lookahead online circuit of a symbol permutation-address generator is also proposed, which can provide the required permutation addresses every cycle to avoid either the use of a lookup table or an extra temporary buffer. Being the major part of the entire DVB forward-error-correction decoder, the proposed symbol deinterleaver can contribute a great saving of the overall decoder cost.", "paper_title": "A Multibank Memory-Based VLSI Architecture of DVB Symbol Deinterleaver", "paper_id": "WOS:000277049300016"}
