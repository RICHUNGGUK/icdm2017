After constructing the calculation architecture of rotationally invariant multi-orbital slave boson model, we apply this optimization algorithm to find the stable ground state and magnetic configuration of two-orbital Hubbard models. The numerical results are consistent with available solutions, confirming the correctness and accuracy of our present algorithm. Furthermore, we utilize it to explore the effects of the transverse Hund's coupling terms on metal-insulator transition, orbital selective Mott phase and magnetism. These results show the quick convergency and robust stable character of our algorithm in searching the optimized solution of strongly correlated electron systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
