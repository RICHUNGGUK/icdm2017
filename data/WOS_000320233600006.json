Publishing these data, however, may risk privacy breaches, as they often contain personal information about individuals. Approaches to anonymizing transaction data have been proposed recently, but they may produce excessively distorted and inadequately protected solutions. This is because these approaches do not consider privacy requirements that are common in real-world applications in a realistic and flexible manner, and attempt to safeguard the data only against either identity disclosure or sensitive information inference. In this paper, we propose a new approach that overcomes these limitations. We introduce a rule-based privacy model that allows data publishers to express fine-grained protection requirements for both identity and sensitive information disclosure. Based on this model, we also develop two anonymization algorithms. Our first algorithm works in a top-down fashion, employing an efficient strategy to recursively generalize data with low information loss. Our second algorithm uses sampling and a combination of top-down and bottom-up generalization heuristics, which greatly improves scalability while maintaining low information loss. Extensive experiments show that our algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of retaining data utility, while achieving good protection and scalability.", "paper_title": "Efficient and flexible anonymization of transaction data", "paper_id": "WOS:000320233600006"}
