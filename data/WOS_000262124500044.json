In this paper we study a special kind of cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in order to investigate possible procedures to connect free boundary model of DCIS with clinical data. This paper is to present some results of our research on mathematical modeling, analysis, and numerical simulations of ductal carcinoma in situ. In particular, we formulate a number of inverse problems for the well-posed free boundary valued problems related to clinical diagnose of cancer (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
