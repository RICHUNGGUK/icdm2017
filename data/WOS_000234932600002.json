The four interactive dimensions of \"e\" learning are the following three originally described in Moore's editorial (1989): (1) interaction with the content, (2) interaction with the instructor, (3) interaction with the students, and an additional new fourth dimension, interaction with the system, which considered all of the new computer technology since his article. In our viewpoint we will highlight the impact that this fourth technological interactive dimension has on the results of \"e\" learning. The question then is not \"to 'e' or not to 'e',\" since \"e\" learning is already an essential factor of our contemporary learning environment. The question is how to \"e\", based on the understanding of the four interactive components of \"e\" learning, and the understanding that these four types of interactions are different from the ones we are accustomed to in the traditional learning environment.", "paper_title": "Interaction in distance-learning courses", "paper_id": "WOS:000234932600002"}
