We determine its value up to a factor 1 + o(1) whenever np = c > 1, c = O(ln n). In particular, we show that the cover time is not monotone for c = Theta(ln n). We also determine the cover time of the k-cores, k >= 2. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "The cover time of the giant component of a random graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000256925300001"}
