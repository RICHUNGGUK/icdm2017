In this study, given a membership function that returns the score of a point belonging to a contour, we propose a method for contour representation based on the principal curve (PC) of this function. The proposed method provides a piecewise linear representation of the contour with fewer points while preserving shape. Varied experiments are conducted, including lung boundary representation in CT images and shape representation in handwritten images. The results show that the technique provides accurate shape representation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
