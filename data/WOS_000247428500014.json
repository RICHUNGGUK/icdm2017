Via periodic density functional calculations the structure of the proposed catalytic sites are shown to be dependent on electrostatic and structural relaxation processes occurring at the surfaces of the precursor material. It is shown how these effects may be adequately captured by small molecular models of the active sites. The general methodology proposed should provide a computationally efficient basis for detailed future studies into catalytic reactions over double metal cyanide materials.", "paper_title": "Development of realistic models for Double Metal Cyanide catalyst active sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000247428500014"}
