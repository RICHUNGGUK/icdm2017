It is shown that a systematic application of one-dimensional continuous wavelet techniques, including a relatively new wavelet pattern recognition technique can reveal important three-dimensional features of the flow, assessing the validity of previously proposed wake topological models. Present results suggest that the high Reynolds number turbulent wakes are topologically similar, but not identical, to their laminar counterparts.", "paper_title": "Wavelet-based investigation of the high Reynolds number bluff body wake topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000238584100010"}
