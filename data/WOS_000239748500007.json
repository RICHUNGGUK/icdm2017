The classes of restricted sets of timed paths that we consider are (i) a single finite (or ultimately periodic) timed path, (ii) an infinite set of finite (or infinite) timed paths defined by a finite (or ultimately periodic) path in a region graph, (iii) an infinite set of finite (or infinite) timed paths defined by a finite (or ultimately periodic) path in a zone graph. Several results are quite negative: TPTL and MTL remain undecidable along region- and zone-paths. On the other hand, we obtained PTIME algorithms for model-checking TCTL along a region path, and for MTL along a single timed path. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
