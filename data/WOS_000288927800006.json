The device with the ultrathin DCJTB layer inserted between N, N'-bis-(1-naphthyl)-N, N'-diphenyl-1,1'-biph-enyl-4,4'- diamine (NPB) and tri-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq(3)) layers has an emission from both DCJTB and Alq(3). When utilizing the 5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphthacene (Rubrene) bilayer as the emitting-assistant layer in the fabrication of the device, the emission from Alq(3) disappears. We attribute the improvement of color purity to the exciton confinement and energy transfer from the Rubrene molecular. The device with 0.1 nm DCJTB layer has a luminance of 1130 cd/m(2) at 20 mA/cm(2) with an EL efficiency of 5.6 cd/A, and the CIE coordinates was [0.617. 0.379]. The maximum brightness of this device reaches 21,525 cd/m(2). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
