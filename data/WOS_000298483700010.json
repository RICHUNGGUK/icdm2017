New protocols have therefore been standardized to enable IPv6 mobility, such as the Network Mobility Basic Support (NEMO BS) protocol. This protocol is particularly suited for providing a global IPv6 connectivity in intelligent transportation systems. Yet, despite its popularity and maturity, it still suffers from various limitations which prevent its adoption in large-scale commercial deployments. Among these are operator specific issues such as the lack of practical and efficient bootstrapping procedure. Also, a global connectivity enables the provision of value-added services whose attractiveness mainly depends on their ease of configuration. In this paper, we focus on solutions to address both the bootstrapping of NEMO BS and service discovery in a mobile environment. By investigating various bootstrapping proposals, we advocate the use of a standardized solution extended with the missing pieces to operate in a NEMO BS environment. We also expose how operator services could be exported and announced in the mobile subnet. Authentication and authorization to access these services are also investigated. Experiments on a prototype show that our proposal brings the missing blocks towards the deployment of network mobility service in intelligent transportation systems.
