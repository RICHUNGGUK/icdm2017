Unlike Web documents, services are intended to be executed to achieve objectives and/or desired goals of users. This leads to the notion that service discovery should take the \"usage context\" of service into account as well as service content (descriptions) which have been well explored. In this paper, we introduce the concept of service context which is used to represent service usage. In query processing, both service content and service context are examined to identify services. We propose to represent service context by a weighted bipartite graph model. Based on the bipartite graph model, we reduce the gap between query space and service space by query expansion to improve recall. We also design an iteration algorithm for result ranking by considering service context-usefulness as well as content-relevance to improve precision. Finally, we develop a service search engine implementing this mechanism, and conduct some experiments to verify our idea.", "paper_title": "Context-sensitive Web service discovery over the bipartite graph model", "paper_id": "WOS:000327494200007"}
