This article presents an integrated fuzzy simulation-fuzzy data envelopment analysis (FSFDEA) to cope with a special case of maintenance activity planning' problem. First, the maintenance activities are simulated by means of Awesim((R)). Due to the ambiguity associated with the time between failures, fuzzy sets theory is incorporated into the simulation network. Different distribution functions for production, failure and maintenance times are estimated using historical data. Then, outputs are computed by carrying out the simulation for different scenarios which are combinations of periodic maintenances. Several outputs including machines and operators' availability, reliability, efficiency and queue length are computed. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) method is used to select the preferred policy for this multi-criteria problem. In order to handle fuzzy outputs of the simulation, fuzzy DEA model is applied. To show the applicability of the proposed FSFDEA algorithm for planning maintenance activities, the data for a series production line is used and different scenarios are investigated. The proposed approach of this study would help managers to identify the preferred strategy considering and investigating various parameters and scenarios.", "paper_title": "An integrated fuzzy simulation-fuzzy data envelopment analysis approach for optimum maintenance planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000327813700007"}
