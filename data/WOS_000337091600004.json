Swarm intelligence algorithms are nowadays successfully used in many areas, especially in optimization problems. To apply each swarm intelligence algorithm in recommender systems a special representation of the problem space is necessary. Here we present the comparison of efficiency of grade prediction of several evolutionary algorithms, such as: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Intelligent Weed Optimization (IWO), Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) and Bat Algorithm (BA).", "paper_title": "Comparison of Selected Swarm Intelligence Algorithms in Student Courses Recommendation Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000337091600004"}
