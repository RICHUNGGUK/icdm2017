This paper takes this research forward by using linguistic variables and triangular fuzzy numbers to model the decision maker's (DM) risk and confidence attitudes in order to define a more complete MCDM solution. To illustrate the computation process and demonstrate the feasibility of the results we use a travel problem that has been used previously to assess MCDM techniques. The results show that the method is useful for tackling imprecision and subjectivity in complex, ill-defined and human-oriented decision problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
