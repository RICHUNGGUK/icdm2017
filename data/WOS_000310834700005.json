We present an algorithm for partitioning the service region into subregions so as to balance the workloads of all vehicles when the service region is simply connected and point-to-point distances follow some \"natural\" metric, such as any L p norm. This algorithm can also be applied to load balancing of other combinatorial structures, such as minimum spanning trees and minimum matchings.", "paper_title": "Dividing a Territory Among Several Vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000310834700005"}
