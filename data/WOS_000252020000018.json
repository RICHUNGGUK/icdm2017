The point at which the number of pixel differences in the image is at a maximum is selected to embed the message. The selected difference is increased by I or left unchanged if the embedded bit is \"1\" or \"0\", respectively. On the other hand, differences larger than the selected difference are increased by 1. Increasing a difference is done by adding I to or subtracting I from the pixel if its value is larger or smaller than its preceding pixel, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a high payload capacity while the image distortion of the stego-image remains minimal.", "paper_title": "Hiding data reversibly in an image via increasing differences between two neighboring pixels", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020000018"}
