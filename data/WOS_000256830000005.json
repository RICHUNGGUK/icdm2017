In this paper, we present our link-time optimizer for the ARM architecture. We discuss how we can deal with the peculiarities of the ARM architecture related to its visible program counter and how the introduced overhead can to a large extent be eliminated. Our link-time optimizer is evaluated with four tool chains, two proprietary ones from ARM and two open ones based on GNU GCC. When used with proprietary tool chains from ARM Ltd., our link-time optimizer achieved average code size reductions of 16.0 and 18.5%, while the programs have become 12.8 and 12.3% faster, and 10.7 to 10.1% more energy efficient. Finally, we show how the incorporation of link-time optimization in tool chains may influence library interface design.", "paper_title": "Link-time compaction and optimization of ARM executables", "paper_id": "WOS:000256830000005"}
