Towards this goal, we collected 21 million tags (1.2 million unique terms) from Delicious and developed an unsupervised statistical algorithm that classifies such tags by applying a word space model adapted to the folksonomy space. Our algorithm analyses the co-occurrence network of tags to a target tag and exploits graph-based metrics for their classification. We validated its outcomes against a reference classification made by humans on a limited number of terms in three separate tests. The analysis of the outcomes of our algorithm shows, in some cases, a consistent disagreement among humans and between humans and our algorithm about what constitutes a topical tag, and suggests the rise of a new category of overly generic tags (i.e. umbrella tags).", "paper_title": "Topical tags vs non-topical tags: Towards a bipartite classification?", "paper_id": "WOS:000357746700006"}
