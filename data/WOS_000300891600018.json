It is based on the 2D Topological Active Nets model and provides information about the surfaces and the inside of the detected objects in the scene. This paper proposes new optimization approaches based on Genetic Algorithms that improve the results of the 3D segmentations and overcome some drawbacks of the model related to parameter tuning or noise conditions. The hybridization of the genetic algorithm with a greedy local search allows the treatment of topological changes in the model, with the possibility of an automatic subdivision of the Topological Active Volume. This combination integrates the advantages of the global and local search procedures in the segmentation process.", "paper_title": "Topological Active Volume 3D segmentation model optimized with genetic approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000300891600018"}
