Yet little work on devices that encode visual images into electrical stimuli have been reported to date. This paper presents a wearable image processor for use as the external module of a vision prosthesis. It is based on a dual-core microprocessor architecture and runs the Linux operating system. A set of image-processing algorithms executes on the digital signal processor of the device, which maybe controlled remotely via a standard desktop computer. The results indicate that a highly flexible and configurable image processor can be built with the dual-core architecture. Depending on the image-processing requirements, general-purpose embedded microprocessors alone may be inadequate for implementing image-processing strategies required by retinal prostheses.
