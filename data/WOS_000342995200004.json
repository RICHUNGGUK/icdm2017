In the wide cover area of WiMAX environment, there are many nodes and interference. In order to obtain the efficiency, the avoidance to the interference is important. In this paper, we propose a two-tier cluster-based route scheduling mechanism on WiMAX Mesh mode. It achieves both fairness and efficiency inside and outside the cluster. The simulation result shows that our mechanism provides great improvement in average delay time and throughput than other research.", "paper_title": "An efficient route scheduling mechanism for WiMAX network", "paper_id": "WOS:000342995200004"}
