The proposed method aggregates student marks to avoid the subjective judgments and unfair assessments. Experimental results indicated that students and instructors generally acknowledged the peer assessment as a valuable process for enhancing student critical thinking skills and improving learning performance.", "paper_title": "Applying an assessment agent to evaluate the learning effectiveness", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100088"}
