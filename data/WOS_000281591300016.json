But this process is restricted due to problems like stability, plasticity, computation and memory consumption. In this paper, we try to overcome these problems by proposing two interval networks (INs), based on a simple feed-forward neural network (NN) and Choquet integral (CI). They have simple structures that reduce the problems of computation and memory consumption. The use of Lyapunov stability (LS) in combination with fuzzy difference (FD) based learning algorithm evolve the converging and diverging process which in turn assures the stability. FD gives a range of variation of parameters having the lower and the upper bounds within which the system is stable thus defining the plasticity. Effectiveness and applicability of the NN and CI based network models are investigated on several benchmark problems dealing with both identification and control. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
