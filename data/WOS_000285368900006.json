The goal of this work is to propose a methodology to design a fuzzy logic based supervision of this new kind of production unit. A graphical modeling tool is proposed to facilitate the analysis and the determination of fuzzy control algorithms adapted to complex hybrid systems. To explain this methodology, the association of wind generators, decentralized generators and storage systems are considered for the production of electrical power. The methodology is divided in six steps covering the design of a supervisor from the system work specifications to an optimized implementation of the control. The performance of this supervisor is shown with the help of simulations. Finally, the application of this methodology to the supervision of different topologies of HRES is also proposed to bring forward the systematic dimension of the approach. (C) 2010 IMACS.
