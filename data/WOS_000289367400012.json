The existing MSD model and its improved method only highlight the role which within-class scatter matrix plays while they pay little attention to the action of between-class scatter matrix. Another weakness of the existing MSD model is that it is difficult to select an appropriate weight for within-class scatter matrix because the range of weight is usually too large. In order to make MSD more suitable for classification, different weights are assigned to both between-class and within-class scatter matrices, respectively. This scheme is more convenient for operation than original MSD because it confines the range of parameters to a small range. Finally, the results of experiments conducted on AR and FERET face database indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Weighted maximum scatter difference based feature extraction and its application to face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000289367400012"}
