Once a model has been defined and corroborated, sensitivity analysis techniques can be used to study the model behavior in relation to perturbations of the model parameters. Here, we describe how it is possible to combine regionalized sensitivity analysis and response surface methodology to screen and quantitatively characterize the relation between metabolic phenotypes and biochemical reactions rates. By means of this approach, we identified the most important reactions for the citric acid efflux from mitochondria, one of the key metabolic traits of cancer cells.", "paper_title": "SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR STUDYING THE RELATION BETWEEN BIOCHEMICAL REACTIONS AND METABOLIC PHENOTYPES", "paper_id": "WOS:000321004700003"}
