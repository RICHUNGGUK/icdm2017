A number of applications are discovered and analyzed throughout the LSRDP design procedure. Various design steps and particularly the DFG mapping process are discussed and our techniques for optimizing the area of accelerator will be presented as well. Different design alternatives are examined through exploring the LSRDP design space and an appropriate architecture is determined for the accelerator. Primary experiments demonstrate capability of the designed architecture to achieve performance values up to 210 Gflops for attempted applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
