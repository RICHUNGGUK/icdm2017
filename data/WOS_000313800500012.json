These restrictions may be alleviated by computation offloading: sending heavy computation to resourceful servers and receiving the results from these servers. Many issues related to offloading have been investigated in the past decade. This survey paper provides an overview of the background, techniques, systems, and research areas for offloading computation. We also describe directions for future research.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Computation Offloading for Mobile Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000313800500012"}
