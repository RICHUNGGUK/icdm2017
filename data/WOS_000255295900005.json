Support vector machines (SVM) have been successfully applied for solving both classification and regression problems in many applications. This paper evaluates the capability of SVM in predicting defect-prone software modules and compares its prediction performance against eight statistical and machine learning models in the context of four NASA datasets. The results indicate that the prediction performance of SVM is generally better than, or at least, is competitive against the compared models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
