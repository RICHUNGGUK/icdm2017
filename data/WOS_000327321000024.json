The complete system design methodology, taking blocker effects into account, is provided. Fully differential Op-Amp with Miller feedback and feed-forward compensations is proposed to support wideband analog circuits with low power consumption. The stability and isolation of inverter-based trans-conductance amplifier are analyzed in details. The design approach of high linearity Tow-Thomas trans-impedance amplifier is presented to reject out-of-band blockers. To compensate for PVT variations, IIP2, frequency tuning, DC offset and IQ calibration are also integrated on-chip. The SDR receiver has been implemented in 65 nm CMOS, with 1.2/2.5 V power supply and a core chip area of 2.4 mm(2). The receiver achieves S11 input matching below -10 dB and a NF of 3-8 dB across the 0.1-4 GHz range, and a maximum gain of 82-92 dB with a 70 dB dynamic range. Dissipated power spans from 30 to 90 mW across this entire frequency range. For LTE application with 20 MHz signal bandwidth and a LO frequency of 2.3 GHz, the receiver consumes 21 mA current.", "paper_title": "A 0.1-4 GHz SDR receiver with reconfigurable 10-100 MHz signal bandwidth in 65 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000327321000024"}
