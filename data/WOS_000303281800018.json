It is a reliable online method, which has high robustness to load variations and changing operating conditions. The phase current is only physical value to be measured. The steady state current is analyzed for broken bar fault via motor current signature analysis technique based on Hilbert transform. A two dimensional feature space is proposed. The features are: magnitude and frequency of characteristic peak extracted from spectrum of Hilbert transform series of the phase current. For classification task support vector machine is used due to its good robustness and generalization performances. A comparative analysis of linear, Gaussian and quadratic kernel function versus error rate and number of support vectors is done. The proposed classifier successfully detects a broken bar in various operational situations. The proposed method is sufficiently accurate, fast, and robust to load changes, which makes it suitable for use in real-time online applications in industrial drives. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
