The approach combines the strength of multiple feature sets to characterize the rich information of eye patches (concerning both local/global shapes and local textures) and to construct the eye state model. To further improve the model's robustness against image noise and scale changes, we propose a new feature descriptor named Multi-scale Histograms of Principal Oriented Gradients (MultiHPOG). The resulting eye closeness detector handles a much wider range of eye appearance caused by expression, lighting, individual identity, and image noise than prior ones. We test our method on real-world eye datasets including the ZJU dataset and a new Closed Eyes in the Wild (CEW) dataset with promising results. In addition, several crucial design considerations that may have significant influence on the performance of a practical eye closeness detection system, including geometric normalization, feature extraction, and classification strategies, are also studied experimentally in this work.
