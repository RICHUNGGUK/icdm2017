Sensors do not live in isolation. Instead, close-by sensors experience similar environmental conditions. Hence, close-by sensors may indulge in a correlated behavior and generate a \"phenomenon\". A phenomenon is characterized by a group of sensors that show \"similar\" behavior over a period of time. Examples of detectable phenomena include the propagation over time of a pollution cloud or an oil spill region. In this research, we propose a framework to detect and track various forms of phenomena in a sensor field. This framework empowers sensor database systems with phenomenon-awareness capabilities. Phenomenon-aware sensor database systems use high-level knowledge about phenomena in the sensor field to control the acquisition of sensor data and to optimize subsequent user queries. As a vehicle for our research, we build the Nile-PDT system, a framework for Phenomenon Detection and Tracking inside Nile, a prototype data stream management system developed at Purdue University.", "paper_title": "Phenomenon-aware sensor database systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200001"}
