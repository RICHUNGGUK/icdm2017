Our method consists of three main steps. First, lung boundary is extracted by our automatic segmentation method. Second, segmented lung contour is smoothed in each axial CT slice. Scan line search is proposed to track the points on lung contour and find rapidly changing curvature without conventional contour tracking. 2D closing in axial CT slice is applied to reduce the number of rapidly changing curvature points. Finally, to provide consistent appearance between lung contours in neighboring axial slices, 2D closing in coronal CT slice is applied within pre-defined subvolume. Experimental results show that the smoothness of lung contour considerably increased after applying proposed method.", "paper_title": "Smoothing segmented lung boundary in chest CT images using scan line search", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400015"}
