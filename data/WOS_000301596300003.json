The algorithm was used to perform a numerical simulation of mitral valve (MV) dynamics during diastolic filling. In numerical simulations of intraventricular flow and MV motion, the asymmetry of the leaflets is often neglected. In this study the MV was rendered as two rigid, asymmetric leaflets. The 2D simulations incorporated the dynamic interaction of blood flow and leaflet motion and an imposed subject-specific, transient left ventricular wall movement obtained from ultrasound recordings. By including the full Jacobian matrix in the algorithm, the speed of the simulation was enhanced by more than 20% compared to using a diagonal Jacobian matrix. Furthermore, our results indicate that important features of the flow field may not be predicted by the use of symmetric leaflets or in the absence of an adequate model for the left atrium.", "paper_title": "FSI simulation of asymmetric mitral valve dynamics during diastolic filling", "paper_id": "WOS:000301596300003"}
