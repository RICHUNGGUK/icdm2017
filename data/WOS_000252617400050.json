In the proposed algorithm, only a single RTTX (Round-Trip Transmission) of UWB pulses is utilized based on the ToA (Time of Arrival) principle. Hence, the proposed algorithm decreases power consumption and processing delay as compared to the basic ToA based on triple RTTXs. Moreover, unlike the TDoA (Time Difference of Arrival) algorithm, the proposed algorithm can perform the position location with low complexity since it does not require strict synchronization between multiple beacons. Simulation results using IEEE 802.15.4a UWB channel models reveal that the proposed algorithm achieves closely comparable position location performance of the basic ToA and TDoA algorithms.", "paper_title": "A simple asynchronous UWB position location algorithm based on single round-trip transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617400050"}
