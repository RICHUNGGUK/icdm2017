We collect a large amount of data from Twitter to compare the relative roles different types of users play in information flow. Using empirical data on the spread of news about major international headlines as well as minor topics, we investigate the relative roles of three types of information spreaders: 1) mass media sources like BBC; 2) grassroots, consisting of ordinary users; and 3) evangelists, consisting of opinion leaders, politicians, celebrities, and local businesses. Mass media sources play a vital role in reaching the majority of the audience in any major topics. Evangelists, however, introduce both major and minor topics to audiences who are further away from the core of the network and would otherwise be unreachable. Grassroots users are relatively passive in helping spread the news, although they account for the 98% of the network. Our results bring insights into what contributes to rapid information propagation at different levels of topic popularity, which we believe are useful to the designers of social search and recommendation engines.", "paper_title": "The World of Connections and Information Flow in Twitter", "paper_id": "WOS:000305584400017"}
