In this paper we introduce a new algorithm of processing range query in universal B-tree (UB-tree), which is an index structure for searching in multi-dimensional databases, The new range query algorithm (called the DRU algorithm) works efficiently, even for processing high-dimensional databases. In particular, using the DRU algorithm many of the UB-tree inner nodes need not to be accessed. We explain the DRU algorithm using a simple geometric model, providing a clear insight into the problem. More specifically, the model exploits an interesting relation between the Z-curve and generalized quad-trees. We also present experimental results for the DRU algorithm implementation.
