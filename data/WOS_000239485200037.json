SSMs were constructed from a training set of landmarks. The landmarks of the 3D shapes are extracted automatically using marching cubes and point correspondences are automatically obtained via a volumetric non-rigid registration technique using multiresolution B-Spline deformations. The surface registration resulted in no discernible differences between bone shapes, demonstrating the high accuracy of the registration method. An analysis of variations is applied on the shapes based on the model we built. The first mode of variation accounted for 42% of the variation in bone shape. This single component discriminated directly between great apes (including humans) and monkeys.", "paper_title": "3D statistical shape modeling of long bones", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485200037"}
