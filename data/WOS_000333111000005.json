In these hybrid DCIs, elasticity is emerging as a key property. In elastic infrastructures, resources available to execute application continuously vary, either because of application requirements or because of constraints on the infrastructure, such as node volatility. In the former case, there is no guarantee that the computing resources will remain available during the entire execution of an application. In this paper, we show that Bag-of-Tasks (BoT) execution on these \"Best-Effort\" infrastructures suffer from a drop of the task completion rate at the end of the execution. The SpeQuloS service presented in this paper improves the Quality of Service (QoS) of BoT applications executed on hybrid and elastic infrastructures. SpeQuloS monitors the execution of the BoT, and dynamically supplies fast and reliable Cloud resources when the critical part of the BoT is executed. SpeQuloS offers several features to hybrid DCIs users, such as estimating completion time and execution speedup. Performance evaluation shows that BoT executions can be accelerated by a factor 2, while offloading less than 2.5 % of the workload to the Cloud. We report on several scenarios where SpeQuloS is deployed on hybrid infrastructures featuring a large variety of infrastructures combinations. In the context of the European Desktop Grid Initiative (EDGI), SpeQuloS is operated to improve QoS of Desktop Grids using resources from private Clouds. We present a use case where SpeQuloS uses both EC2 regular and spot instances to decrease the cost of computation while preserving a similar QoS level. Finally, in the last scenario SpeQuloS allows to optimize Grid5000 resources utilization.", "paper_title": "SpeQuloS: a QoS service for hybrid and elastic computing infrastructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000333111000005"}
