The SDC processing engine is proposed to achieve 100% hardware resource utilization by sharing the common arithmetic resource in the time-multiplexed approach, including both adders and multipliers. Thus, the required number of complex multipliers is reduced to log(4) N - 0.5, compared with log(2) N - 1 for the other radix-2 SDC/SDF architectures. In addition, the proposed architecture requires roughly minimum number of complex adders log(2) N + 1 and complex delay memory 2N + 1.5 log(2) N - 1.5.", "paper_title": "A Combined SDC-SDF Architecture for Normal I/O Pipelined Radix-2 FFT", "paper_id": "WOS:000355212000018"}
