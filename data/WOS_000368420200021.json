By applying central limit theorem (CLT) approximations to non-asymptotic information-spectrum inner bounds, we obtain second-order achievable rate regions for the Gaussian MAC with a positive average error probability and per-codeword power constraints. Our achievability results use spherical inputs uniformly distributed on the power shells, which lead to summations of dependent information random variables. However, we conduct the analysis through a convenient yet powerful form of the CLT, called the CLT for functions.", "paper_title": "A Second-Order Achievable Rate Region for Gaussian Multi-Access Channels via a Central Limit Theorem for Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000368420200021"}
