This cTIM scheme is implemented in the range extensions of high-efficiency video coding (HEVC-RExt) as an additional tool of intracoding to complement conventional spatial angular prediction to better exploit the screen content redundancy. For each coding unit, a number of major colors will be selected to form the color table, then the original pixel block is translated to the corresponding index map. A 1D or hybrid 1D/2D string match scheme is introduced to derive matched pairs of index map for better compression. Leveraging the color distribution similarity between neighboring image blocks, color table merge is developed to carry it implicitly. For those blocks that color table has to be signaled explicitly, intertable color sharing and intratable color differential predictive coding are applied to reduce the signaling overhead. Extensive experiments have been performed and they have demonstrated the significant coding efficiency improvement over conventional HEVC-RExt, resulting in 26%, 18%, and 15% bit rate reduction at lossless case and 23%, 19%, and 13% Bjontegaard Delta-rate improvement at lossy scenario of typical screen content with text and graphics, for respective all intra, random access, and low-delay using B picture encoder settings. Detailed performance study and complexity analysis (as well as the comparison with other algorithms) have been included as well to evidence the efficiency of proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Advanced Screen Content Coding Using Color Table and Index Map", "paper_id": "WOS:000345531500008"}
