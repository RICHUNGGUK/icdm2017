Most planning support tools for location decisions do not take such uncertainty into account. To address this problem of uncertainty, we propose a 'Bayesian decision network' approach. In this approach, the possible courses of actions, causal knowledge and preferences of a decision maker are represented in a network of causal relationships between a set of variables. Uncertainty about future land-use developments, which may influence outcomes of location decisions, can be represented as conditional probabilities in these networks. However, estimating these probabilities for a given study area is not a trivial problem, as the space of all possible future scenarios is approximately infinitely large. In this paper, we propose and test a sampling method for this estimation purpose. As an illustrative case, we specify a decision network model of a retail location planning problem, investigate parameters of the sampling method and explore the extent to which different ways of coping with uncertainty affects outcomes of decisions.
