Some registration methods have focused on robustness and sacrificed speed, but a recent approach based on external contours offered both high computational processing speed and high accuracy. However, since contours can be influenced by local perturbations, we sought more global methods. Thus, we propose two new registration methods based on the Fourier transform, cross-correlation and phase correlation which offer high computational speed. We found out that both proposed methods revealed high accuracy for the similarity measures considered, using control geometric transformations. Additionally, both methods revealed high computational processing speed which, combined with their accuracy and robustness, allows their implementation in near-real-time applications. Furthermore, we found that the current methods were robust to moderate levels of noise, and consequently, do not require noise removal procedure like the contours method does.", "paper_title": "Registration of pedobarographic image data in the frequency domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000285145800011"}
