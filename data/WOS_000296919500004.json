We discovered that the authentication and key exchange (AKE) protocol in the newest HDCP specification v 2.0 fails to prevent against the UKS attack and the impersonation attack. Moreover, this protocol does not demonstrate forward secrecy and key confirmation properties. Based on these findings, we propose a carefully designed variant named SH-AKE. The new protocol satisfies all the security goals not contained in the original AKE protocol with a slight increase in the computational cost. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
