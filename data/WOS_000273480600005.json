We are given a set of unit sized items, where each item has a color associated with it. We are given an integer parameter ka parts per thousand yen1 and an integer bin size Ba parts per thousand yenk. The goal is to assign the items (or a subset of the items) into a maximum number of subsets of at least B items each, such that in each such subset the total number of distinct colors of items is at least k. We study both the offline and the online variants of this problem. We first design an optimal polynomial time algorithm for the offline problem. For the online problem we give a lower bound of 1+H (k-1) (where H (k-1) denotes the (k-1)-th harmonic number), and an O(k)-competitive algorithm. Finally, we analyze the performance of the natural heuristic First fit.", "paper_title": "Class Constrained Bin Covering", "paper_id": "WOS:000273480600005"}
