We provide an appropriate statistical model for this kind of registration problem, and a new criterion based on Fourier-type transforms is proposed to estimate the translation, rotation, and scaling parameters to align a set of images. This criterion is a two-step procedure which does not require the use of a reference template onto which all the images are aligned. Our approach is based on M-estimation, and we prove the consistency of the resulting estimators. A small-scale simulation study and real examples are used to illustrate the numerical performances of our procedure.", "paper_title": "Estimation of Translation, Rotation, and Scaling between Noisy Images Using the Fourier-Mellin Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000278101100012"}
