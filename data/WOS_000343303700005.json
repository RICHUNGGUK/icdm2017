The output feedback adaptive control scheme uses feedback actions only, and thus does not require a direct measurement of the command or disturbance signals. A suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii type functional is introduced to design the adaptation algorithms and to prove stability.", "paper_title": "Multivariable output feedback robust adaptive tracking control design for a class of delayed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000343303700005"}
