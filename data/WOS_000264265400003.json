In agreement with experimental data, [HS(AuPH3)(2) (+)](2) is a C-2h structure. However, [S(AuPH3)(2)](2) is predicted to favor a D-2d structure. Experimental structure parameters of the title compounds were reproduced at the X alpha level. The electronic structure and HOMO-LUMO gaps were investigated. When two monomers formed a dimer, the electronic structure of the dimer changed only slightly, but the chemical stability decreased. The intermolecular aurophilic interaction energy is decomposed and analyzed.", "paper_title": "Density functional studies of closed-shell attractions of S(AuPH3)(2) and HS(AuPH3)(2) (+) and their dimers", "paper_id": "WOS:000264265400003"}
