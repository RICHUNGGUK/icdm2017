The mathematical model consists of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations and a free boundary. It is quite general and can include a large variety of special situations. An existence and uniqueness theorem is discussed and properties of solutions are given. As a numerical application, simulations for a heterotrophic-autotrophic competition are developed by the method of characteristics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
