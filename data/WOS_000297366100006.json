The design is based directly on the sensor measurements as opposed to traditional solutions that resort to rotation parameterizations. The information provided by a low-cost star tracker is merged with the measurements of a triaxial rate gyro to provide accurate estimates of the attitude. The proposed multirate solution also includes the estimation of rate gyro bias and tuning procedures. Simulation and experimental results, including ground truth data for performance evaluation purposes, are shown that illustrate the attainable performance in the presence of realistic measurements provided by low-cost star trackers.", "paper_title": "Vector-Based Attitude Filter for Space Navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000297366100006"}
