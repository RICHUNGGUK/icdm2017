The method leads to a model which is compatible with commercial phasor-based software packages. Consequently; it enables calculation of fault currents in any branch of the network due to a winding fault of a power transformer. These currents can be used for evaluation of protective relays' performance and can lead to better setting of protective functions.", "paper_title": "Transformer Internal Faults Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264815000004"}
