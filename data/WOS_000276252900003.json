Though different anti-collision methods have been proposed, it still needs further study on how to improve the identification ability especially in the interference circumstance. This paper presents a new method based on independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm. Coded division multiple access (CDMA) technology is adopted at the transmitter and the maximum signal to noise ratio is applied at the receiver of the RFID system. The proposed method has been verified by computer simulation which shows that the system can separate different users' source data correctly based on ICA algorithm and has better performance compared with the traditional CDMA technology.", "paper_title": "Application of ICA-based anti-collision algorithm in RFID system", "paper_id": "WOS:000276252900003"}
