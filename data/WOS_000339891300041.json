This scheme not only captures intra-block correlation but also exploits the visual importance of image blocks to efficiently describe the content of images in a compressed domain. In the proposed algorithm, a query image is first divided by quadtree segmentation and then classified into smooth and high-detail blocks. For high-detail blocks, the local thresholding classifier with 28 edge binary templates is employed to extract a variety of visually important regions which are edge intensive. After all of the blocks in the image are encoded by the pre-trained QCVQ codebook, the indices in the compressed domain are obtained. Finally, the frequencies of indices are counted to build the index histogram as a feature of the query image. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme yields the better retrieval performance compared to the well-known vector quantization (VQ)-based image retrieval method and three other techniques. These results show that quadtree segmentation and edge style classification are indeed helpful for improving the performance of content-based image retrieval.", "paper_title": "Image retrieval based on quadtree classified vector quantization", "paper_id": "WOS:000339891300041"}
