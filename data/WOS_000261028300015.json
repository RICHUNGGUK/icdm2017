The neurons in the visual pathway generate their receptive fields using a parallel and hierarchical architecture. This architecture of the visual cortex is interesting and important for designing a novel perception system from an engineering perspective. The aim of this study is to develop a vision system hardware, which is designed inspired by a hierarchical visual processing in V1, for real time texture segregation. The system consists of a silicon retina, orientation chip, and field programmable gate array (FPGA) circuit. The silicon retina emulates the neural Circuits of the vertebrate retina and exhibits a Laplacian-Gaussian-like receptive field. The orientation chip selectively aggregates multiple pixels of the silicon retina in order to produce Gabor-like receptive fields that are tuned to various orientations by mimicking the feed-forward model proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The FPGA circuit receives the output of the orientation chip and computes the responses of the complex cells. Using this system, the neural images of simple cells were computed in real-time for various orientations and spatial frequencies. Using the orientation-selective outputs obtained from the multichip system, a real-time texture segregation was conducted based on a computational model inspired by psychophysics and neurophysiology. The texture image was filtered by the two orthogonally Oriented receptive fields of the multi-chip system and the filtered images were combined to segregate the area of different texture orientation with the aid of FPGA. The present system is also useful for the investigation of the functions of the higher-order cells that can be obtained by combining the simple and complex cells. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
