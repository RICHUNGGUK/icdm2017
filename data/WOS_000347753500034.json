By constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with triple and four integral terms and by using Finsler's lemma, a new delay-dependent stability criterion is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities to ensure the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point of the considered neural networks. The derived criteria use the information of the upper delay bounds, which may lead to conservativeness. Finally, numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
