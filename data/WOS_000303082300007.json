To understand such a dynamic behavior generation mechanism, we attempt to construct a neuromodulation model of behavior selection for the fighting behavior of a cricket. In this paper, we propose a dynamic system model of neuromodulation with the efficacy based on neurophysiological knowledge, facts, and hypotheses from the viewpoint of synthesis. The efficacy of the sensory processing center is introduced to our previous model and its dynamics is influenced by the frequency of the interactions with the other cricket. Utilizing an extended neuromodulation model, computer simulations related to a multiple-individual environment were carried out, and the results are discussed. In particular, the properties related to the standard deviation of the value of octopamine in several population density cases are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
