The Semantic Web relies on domain ontologies that structure underlying data enabling comprehensive and transportable machine understanding. It takes so much time and efforts to construct domain ontologies because these ontologies can be manually made by domain experts and knowledge engineers. To solve these problems, there have been many researches to semi-automatically construct ontologies. Most of the researches focused on relation extraction part but manually selected terms for ontologies. These researches have some problems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method to extract relations from domain documents which combines a named relation approach and an unnamed relation approach. Our named relation approach is based on the Hearst's pattern and the Snowball system. We merge a generalized pattern scheme into their methods. In our unnamed relation approach, we extract unnamed relations using association rules and clustering method. Moreover, we recommend candidate relation names of unnamed relations. We evaluate our proposed method by using Ziff document set offered by TREC.", "paper_title": "Semi-automatic construction of domain ontology for agent reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000327131800016"}
