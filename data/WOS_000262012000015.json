Since active devices such as transistors are the core of modern RF/microwave systems, the way they are modeled in terms of accuracy and flexibility will critically, influence the system design, and thus, the overall system performance. In this article, the authors present neural- and fuzzy neural-based computer-aided design techniques that can efficiently characterize and model RF/microwave transistors such as field-effect transistors and heterojunction bipolar transistors. The proposed techniques based on multilayer perceptrons neural networks and c-means clustering algorithms are demonstrated through examples. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.
