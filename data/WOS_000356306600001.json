In fact, the higher the number of available services is, the higher the impact and the market penetration of the considered technology will be. Also governance institutions appreciate the benefits of VANETs, having the possibility to increase safety level along the roads, saving lots of human lives, and reducing the severity of the collisions among vehicles. In this work we propose a multicast protocol, called partitioned multicast tree (PAMTree), which is suitable for spreading several kinds of services, increasing the reliability of the network, and giving the possibility to a higher number of users of having access to those services. The proposed protocol aims to exploit the characteristics of the VANET architecture in order to distribute services along the nodes of the network; owing to the high nodes mobility, several issues have to be faced to supply an optimal distribution, having a look at the quality of service (QoS) satisfaction.", "paper_title": "PAMTree: Partitioned Multicast Tree Protocol for Efficient Data Dissemination in a VANET Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000356306600001"}
