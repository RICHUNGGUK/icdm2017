One major issue for designing MSNs is the energy-validity trade-off, that is, the trade-off between the energy efficiency for mobile sensors (MSs) and the validity of sensing reports. In this article, we propose a novel mechanism, Energy-Efficient Distributedly Controlled Reporting ((EDCR)-D-2), to mitigate the energy consumption for MSs in real-time monitoring applications while keeping the sensing report valid. In this mechanism, we design dynamic sleeping adjustment (DSA) algorithms to adjust an MS's sleeping period using a heuristic method to reduce energy consumption. We provide analytical models to evaluate the performance of (EDCR)-D-2 in terms of the power savings and report validity. It has been shown that with (EDCR)-D-2, MSs can report with less energy consumption while satisfying delay constraints for real-time monitoring applications.", "paper_title": "Trade-off Between Energy Efficiency and Report Validity for Mobile Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322740200013"}
