The proposed circuit is designed using 0.18 mu m CMOS process parameters from TSMC. Simulation results show that the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the proposed circuit with a 2.5-V input amplitude is less than 1% for input frequency up to 200 MHz under a 1.8-V supply voltage. The total current consumption is 10.8 mA.", "paper_title": "Linear voltage-to-current converters with current reuse technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000307285700006"}
