In this paper we devise Phone2Cloud, a computation offloading-based system for energy saving on smartphones in the context of mobile cloud computing. Phone2Cloud offloads computation of an application running on smartphones to the cloud. The objective is to improve energy efficiency of smartphones and at the same time, enhance the application's performance through reducing its execution time. In this way, the user's experience can be improved. We implement the prototype of Phone2Cloud on Android and Hadoop environment. Two sets of experiments, including application experiments and scenario experiments, are conducted to evaluate the system. The experimental results show that Phone2Cloud can effectively save energy for smartphones and reduce the application's execution time.", "paper_title": "Phone2Cloud: Exploiting computation offloading for energy saving on smartphones in mobile cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000333350800008"}
