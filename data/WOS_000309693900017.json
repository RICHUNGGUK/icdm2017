The latter is used to compute the plant water stress status which can potentially be applied to an automated control system for optimal crop irrigation management. Due to the nature of image sources and plant scene, it is difficult to find enough common features between the pair of images to register them using a simple method. In this paper an improved registration algorithm is described, where a modified Sobel edge detector is adopted and a variable resolution scheme is applied. The algorithm can improve the registration efficiency considerably compared to our previous developed registration method. Experiment results show that the modified algorithm can achieve the same registration accuracy and a better success rate compared to that from the original algorithm with a substantial reduction of computational complexity.
