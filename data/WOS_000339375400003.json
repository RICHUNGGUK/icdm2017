The aim of this research is to improve the global reliability of the system by allocating alternative components (redundancies) that are associated in parallel with each original component. By considering a complex componential approach that simultaneously evaluates the interrelations among sub-systems, conflicting goals, and variables of different natures, a solution for the problem is proposed through a multi-objective formulation that joins a multi-objective elitist genetic algorithm with a high-level simulation environment also known as simulation optimization framework.", "paper_title": "Complex componential approach for redundancy allocation problem solved by simulation-optimization framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000339375400003"}
