Comparison of the cross-entropies of formants and cepstrum features indicates that formants are a better indicator of accents. In particular it appears that the measurements of differences in formants across accents are less sensitive to different recordings or databases compared to cepstrum features. It is found that the crossentropies of the same phonemes across speaker groups with different accents (inter-accent distances) are significantly greater than the cross-entropies of the same phonemes across speaker groups of the same accent (intra-accent distances). Comparative evaluations presented on cross-gender speech recognition shows that accent differences have an impact comparable to gender differences. The crossentropy measure is also used to construct cross-accent phonetic-trees, which serve to show the structural similarities and differences of the phonetic systems across accents.
