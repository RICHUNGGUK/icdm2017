Existing mixes require that the public key certificates of mix servers have been distributed among users. In this paper, we propose a new mix that uses techniques from identity-based cryptography. Our mix does not require any public certificates; as long as the users know the identities of mix servers, the mix can anonymize messages. We give proofs of correctness and privacy, as well as analysis of efficiency. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
