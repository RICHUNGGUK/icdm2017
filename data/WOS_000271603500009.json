Although researchers have proposed various semantic database system approaches over the years, it seems that most systems have tried to provide industrial-strength scalability too soon. Consequently, most semantic databases still rely on the relational model of storing data and still use SQL-like query languages for data retrieval. The db4OWL semantic database prototype addresses many of the shortcomings of current systems and features native OWL-querying as well as the ability to store and query multiple ontologies concurrently.", "paper_title": "db4OWL: An Alternative Approach to Organizing and Storing Semantic Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000271603500009"}
