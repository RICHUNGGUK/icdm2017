Competition will be consequently further intensified and there is a probability that in the process the role of offline retailers will shift from that of a traditional retailer to a displayer role. When this occurs, appropriate technological devices and business models should be explored so that both displayers and retailers can benefit. To this end, this paper proposes an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology-based pervasive comparison shopping business model. RFID will allow consumers to be seamlessly connected to the network, and the advent of a new shopping network will enable a smoothly functioning incentive mechanism between displayers and retailers. Ultimately, a new shopping network will enable consumers to be engaged in seamless commerce.", "paper_title": "Design of a RFID-based ubiquitous comparison shopping system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000152"}
