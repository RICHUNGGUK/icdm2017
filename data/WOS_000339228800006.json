The applications of MIMO SAR systems which involve 3D imaging, high-resolution wide-swath remote sensing, and multi-baseline interferometry are seriously limited to the orthogonal waveforms. Although orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) chirp waveforms can be used for MIMO SAR systems to avoid intra-pulse interferences, there is a small frequency shift between the transmitted OFDM pulses. This vulnerable shift, which can not only affect the waveform orthogonality, but also introduce residual phase error, renders the OFDM waveforms impractical. In this paper, an improved OFDM chirp waveform which works without the mentioned shift is presented, along with the novel modulation and efficient demodulation procedures. Comparison between the improved and the conventional OFDM chirp waveforms is detailed. The influence of random noise, quantization error, and Doppler shift on the orthogonality of OFDM waveform is also investigated in this paper. Theoretical analysis and simulation results illustrate the feasibility of this waveform scheme.", "paper_title": "An improved OFDM chirp waveform used for MIMO SAR system", "paper_id": "WOS:000339228800006"}
