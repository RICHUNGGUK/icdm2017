First, we extend 2D texture optimization techniques to synthesize 3D texture solids. Next, the non-parametric texture optimization approach is integrated with histogram matching, which forces the global statistics of the synthesized solid to match those of the exemplar. This improves the convergence of the synthesis process and enables using smaller neighborhoods. In addition to producing compelling texture mapped surfaces, our method also effectively models the material in the interior of solid objects. We also demonstrate that our method is well-suited for synthesizing textures with a large number of channels per texel.", "paper_title": "Solid texture synthesis from 2D exemplars", "paper_id": "WOS:000248914000005"}
