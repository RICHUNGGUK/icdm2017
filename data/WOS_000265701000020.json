It is known that detecting a singleton attractor, which is also called a fixed point, is NP-hard even for AND/OR BNs (i.e., BNs consisting of AND/OR nodes), where singleton attractors correspond to steady states. Though a naive algorithm can detect a singleton attractor for an AND/OR BN in O(n2(n)) time, no O((2-epsilon)(n)) (epsilon > 0) time algorithm was known even for an AND/OR BN with non-restricted indegree, where it is the number of nodes in a BN. In this paper, we present an O(1.787(n)) time algorithm for detecting a singleton attractor of a given AND/OR BN, along with related results. We also show that detection of a singleton attractor in a BN with maximum indegree two is NP-hard and can be polynomially reduced to a satisfiability problem.", "paper_title": "Detecting a Singleton Attractor in a Boolean Network Utilizing SAT Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701000020"}
