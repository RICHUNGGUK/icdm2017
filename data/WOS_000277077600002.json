We quantify the learning capabilities of three inbred strains and show that population distributions of hand preference emerge from the properties of individual mice. The model informs our understanding of gene-environment interactions because it accommodates genotypic differences in learning and memory abilities, and environmental biases. We tuned each strain's model to match their experimental hand-preference distributions in unbiased worlds and, by comparing simulations and experiments, identified and quantified a constitutive left-bias in hand preference of one strain. The models, tuned for unbiased worlds, match experimental measures in left-and right-biased worlds and in biased worlds after previous training. New measures quantitatively assess this matching, revealing that two strains, previously considered non-learners of hand preference, actually have significant learning ability and we confirm this with new experiments. Model mice match the kinetics of hand-preference learning of one strain and predict the limits of learning. We conclude that genetically evolved hand-preference behavior in mice is inherently probabilistic to provide robustness and allow constant adaptability to ever-changing environments.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Agent-Based Model of Hand-Preference Behavior Patterns in the Mouse", "paper_id": "WOS:000277077600002"}
