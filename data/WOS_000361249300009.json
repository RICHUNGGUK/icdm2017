The proposed method employs the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) algorithm. Compared to the previous branch and bound approach, a naive application of GBD to the ELOC problem will improve computational performance, due to less frequent calls to computationally slow semi-definite programming (SDP) routines. However, the reverse-convex constraints of the original problem will reappear in the relaxed master problem. In response, a convexification of the relaxed master constraints has been developed and proven to preserve global solution characteristics. The result is a multi-fold improvement in computational performance. A technological benefit of decomposing the problem into steady-state and dynamic parts is the ability to utilize nonlinear steady-state models, since the relaxed master problem is free of SDP type constraints and can be solved using any global nonlinear programming algorithm.
