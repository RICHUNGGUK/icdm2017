The main idea of the presented approach consists in including the controller input fuzzy sets into the adaptation process. In comparison with other FMRLC modifications the proposed method can be started with smaller number of input membership functions resulting in better reference signal tracking. Performance of the proposed procedure is demonstrated on control of a nonlinear laboratory system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
