Methods. The study is based upon experience in sensor-based telemedicine and rHIS projects, and on an analysis of HIS-related journal publications from 2003 to 2005 conducted in the context of publishing the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics. Results: Health-related parameters that are subject to sensor-based measurement in home care and telemonitoring are identified. Publications related to telemonitoring, home care and smart houses are analyzed concerning scope and utilization of sensor technology. Current approaches for integrating sensor technology in rHIS based on a corresponding eHealth infrastructure are identified. Based on a coarse architecture of home care and telemonitoring systems ten challenges for sensor-enhanced rHIS are identified and discussed: integration of home and health telematic platforms towards a sensor-enhanced telematic platform, transmission rate guarantees, ad hoc connectivity, cascading data analysis, remote configuration, message and alert logistic, sophisticated user interfaces, unobtrusiveness, data safety and security, and electronic health record integration. Conclusions. Utilization of sensor technology in health care is an active field of research. Currently few research projects and standardization initiatives focus on general architectural considerations towards suitable telematic platforms for establishing sensor-enhanced rHIS. Further research finalized by corresponding standardization is needed. Part 2 of this paper will present experiences with a research prototype for a sensor-enhanced rHIS telematic platform.", "paper_title": "Towards new scopes: Sensor-enhanced regional health information systems - Part 1: Architectural challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000249094000016"}
