The prototype consists of the server part and the client part. In the server part, the images are acquired, stored, computed their wavelet transform and the wavelet coefficients stored, then transmitted progressively, when required, via TCP to the client. In the client part, with the inverse wavelet transform, the received wavelet coefficients are used to build successive improved reconstructions of the image. This prototype has been implemented and is being tested in the Radiotherapy Service of the Valencia University Hospital (Valencia, Spain). (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
