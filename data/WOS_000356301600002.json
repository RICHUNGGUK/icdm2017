Focusing on the class of symmetric broadcast channels with state, we derive an expression for the maximum achievable symmetric rate using the SW scheme. We show that the MAT results for the two-receiver case can be recovered by evaluating this expression for the special case in which superposition coding and Marton coding are not used. We then introduce a new broadcast channel example that shares many features of the MAT examples. We show that another special case of our maximum symmetric rate expression in which superposition coding is also used attains a higher symmetric rate than the MAT scheme. The symmetric capacity of this new example is not known, however.", "paper_title": "A Note on the Broadcast Channel With Stale State Information at the Transmitter", "paper_id": "WOS:000356301600002"}
