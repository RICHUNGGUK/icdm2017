In order to tackle this problem, a new model-based clustering algorithm with a certainty factor is proposed to evaluate the certainty degree of time series data being in a cluster. The new algorithm can be used to show a reasonable result for time series data clustering and reduce the computation complexity greatly. Performance of the algorithm is verified by the experiments on both synthetic data and real data.", "paper_title": "A new clustering algorithm for time series analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400093"}
