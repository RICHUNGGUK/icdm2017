The segmentation problem is distributed to many individual workers such that each receives only simple questions regarding whether two points in an image are placed on the same object. A large pool of micro-labor workers available through Amazon's Mechanical Turk system provides the labor in a scalable manner.", "paper_title": "DP2: Distributed 3D image segmentation using micro-labor workforce", "paper_id": "WOS:000319428200021"}
