In a progressive image transmission system, an image is divided into several parts. In each transmission phase, a sender transmits a part of the image to a receiver. The receiver uses the received parts to reconstruct the original image for quickly seeing the outline of the whole image. This paper proposes a progressive image transmission scheme based on discrete wavelet transformation. In the proposed scheme, a digital image is transformed from spatial domain into frequency domain using Haar wavelet transformation. In other words, the spatial pixels in the image are decomposed into the frequency coefficients. The significant coefficients are transmitted to the receiver far image reconstruction. The scheme also transmits some selected coefficients along with the significant coefficients to the receiver for improving the image quality of the reconstructed image. As the experimental results indicated, the proposed scheme indeed outperforms other schemes in terms of image quality of the reconstructed image in early transmission phases.", "paper_title": "A progressive image transmission technique using Haar wavelet transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211200013"}
