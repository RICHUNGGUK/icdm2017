We propose an approach combining abstraction techniques and heuristic search to overcome the problem above. In particular, heuristic search can avoid the bottleneck of the exhaustive exploration of the global state graph of a system, while retaining the advantages of abstraction techniques.", "paper_title": "Abstract reduction in directed model checking CCS processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000307243100003"}
