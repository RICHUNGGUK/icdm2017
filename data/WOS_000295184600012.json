However, cloud computing's focus on resources and costs limits progress in realizing more flexible, adaptive processes. The authors introduce elastic processes, which are based on explicitly modeling resources, cost, and quality, and show how they improve on the state of the art.", "paper_title": "Principles of Elastic Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000295184600012"}
