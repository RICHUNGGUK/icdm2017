The IT industry has adopted virtualization technology because of its ability to improve hardware resource utilization, achieve low-power consumption, support concurrent applications, simplify device management, and reduce maintenance costs. However, because of the hardware limitation of storage devices, the I/O capacity could cause performance bottlenecks. To address the problem, we propose a hybrid storage access framework that exploits solid-state drives (SSDs) to improve the I/O performance in a virtualization environment.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Storage Access Framework for High-Performance Virtual Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000346416300013"}
