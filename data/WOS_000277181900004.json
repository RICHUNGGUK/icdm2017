The recovery of the optical carrier with the precise wavelength is implemented using an injection laser incorporating an optical phase locked loop (OPLL). In the computer simulation, the OPLL is implemented by a Simulink model consisting of interconnected system blocks following exactly the physical phenomena of the hardware structures. This model is then integrated with DQPSK modulation formats for up- and down-transmissions in PONs. Pulse shaping of Non-Return-to-Zero and Return-to-Zero (RZ) of 50% duty cycle and 67% duty cycle are used, respectively. Dispersion tolerance of 25 ps/nm with a bit error rate (BER) of 10(-9) is achieved for both down- and upstream transmissions over fully dispersion compensated 80- km standard SMF and 1.5- km SSMF equivalent dispersion with carrier suppressed RZ pulse shaping (CS-RZ 67%). The contribution to BER by the timing synchronization error at the sampling of the optical network unit for re-modulation and related power penalty of these modulation formats is also investigated. It is noted that using the optical phase locking technique it is possible to remove any cross talks which may be generated from nonlinear effects such as cross-phase modulation, self-phase modulation, and four wave mixing.", "paper_title": "Wavelength re-generation and re-modulation using optical phase lock loop techniques for 100-Gb/s DQPSK up-stream transmission in DWDM passive optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000277181900004"}
