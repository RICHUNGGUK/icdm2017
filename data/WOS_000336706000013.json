In this note, we focus in the absence of the conservative assumption upon developing a novel decentralized adaptive fuzzy control scheme. In virtue of fuzzy systems and a regularized inverse matrix, the developed control scheme not only addresses controller singularity under an overall design framework but also copes with interconnections with arbitrary nonlinear bounds. The resulting closed-loop large-scale system is proved to be asymptotically stable. The controller design is applicable to an automated highway system, and simulation results confirm its practical usefulness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
