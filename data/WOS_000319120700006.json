Cooperative Extension Service clients provide the basis for analyzing how implementation procedures affect response rates and substantive findings. These clients form three strata based on contact information provided: postal address only, e-mail only, and both. From clients who provided mail and e-mail addresses, four experimental groups were created, including two mixed-mode groups, a mail-only group and an e-mail-only group. Using mail and e-mail addresses to implement a sequence of e-mail and postal invitations in a mixed-mode design resulted in response rates that are equivalent to those for mail-only surveys. Also, clients who provided a postal address only differed on some attributes from those in the other strata. This study demonstrates the benefit of obtaining e-mail addresses and using them in mixed-mode surveys.", "paper_title": "Combining Mail and E-Mail Contacts to Facilitate Participation in Mixed-Mode Surveys", "paper_id": "WOS:000319120700006"}
