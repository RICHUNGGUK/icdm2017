We present some implementations of robust motion detection algorithms on three architectures: a general purpose RISC processor-the PowerPC G4-a parallel artificial retina dedicated to low level image processing-Pvlsar34-and the Associative Mesh, a specialized architecture based on associative net. To handle the different aspects and constraints of embedded systems, execution time and power consumption of these architectures are compared.", "paper_title": "High performance motion detection: some trends toward new embedded architectures for vision systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283783200003"}
