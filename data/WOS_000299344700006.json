One of the most intractable issues in designing MPS is how to load balance traffic across its multiple paths while not disturbing the intraflow packet orders. Previous packet-based solutions either suffer from delay penalties or lead to O(N-2) hardware complexity, hence do not scale. Flow-based hashing algorithms also perform badly due to the heavy-tailed flow-size distribution. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme, namely, Flow Slice (FS) that cuts off each flow into flow slices at every intraflow interval larger than a slicing threshold and balances the load on a finer granularity. Based on the studies of tens of real Internet traces, we show that setting a slicing threshold of 1 - 4 ms, the FS scheme achieves comparative load-balancing performance to the optimal one. It also limits the probability of out-of-order packets to a negligible level (10(-6)) on three popular MPSes at the cost of little hardware complexity and an internal speedup up to two. These results are proven by theoretical analyses and also validated through trace-driven prototype simulations.", "paper_title": "Load-Balancing Multipath Switching System with Flow Slice", "paper_id": "WOS:000299344700006"}
