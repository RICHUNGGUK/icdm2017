These sensors are connected to each other in a mesh topology, with conductive yarns used as one-wire bidirectional communication links. The circuit is designed to perform synchronization in the MAC layer, so that the deterministic part of the clock skew between nodes is kept constant and compensated with a single message exchange. In each sensor node, the synchronization circuit provides a programmable clock signal and a real-time counter for time stamping. Experimental results from a fabricated ASIC (in a CMOS 0.35 mu m technology) show that the circuit keeps the one-hop average clock skew below 4.6 ns and that the skew grows linearly as the hop distance to the reference node increases. The sub-microsecond average clock skew achieved by the proposed solution satisfies the requirements of many wearable sensor network applications. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
