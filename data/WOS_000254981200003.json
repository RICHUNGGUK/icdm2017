The uncertain parameters are supposed to reside in a convex polytope and the state delay is assumed to be time-varying. A sufficient condition for the existence of fuzzy filters guaranteeing a prescribed energy-to-peak disturbance attenuation level for all possible uncertainties is investigated. Based on this condition, an admissible filter is proposed in terms of LMIs. One numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "Robust L-2-L-infinity filtering of convex polyhedral uncertain time-delay fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254981200003"}
