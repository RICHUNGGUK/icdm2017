The introduction of a non-linear formulation of visco-elasticity is necessary because experimental data from the literature referring to animal models show that the relaxation rate depends on the level of strain applied. In particular, the percentage of relaxation increases with decrease of the applied strain. The constitutive model is consistent with the non-linear elastic behavior of the PDL in the case of high rate loading and large strains attained by the tissue. A hyperelastic formulation is adopted for the elastic behavior of the PDL and this formulation is developed adopting suitable measures of stress and strain. The anisotropy of the tissue induced by specific spatial orientation of collagen fibers is included in the model. With respect to recent numerical formulation proposed to describe the non-linear visco-elasticity of the PDL, the proposed model has the advantage of being more consistent with the micro-structural configuration of the tissue and the large strains it can undergo. The results obtained show that a reasonable description of the PDL relaxation phenomena can be obtained by assuming that relaxation times are independent of strain, whereas the relative stiffness results are dependent on strain applied through an exponential function.
