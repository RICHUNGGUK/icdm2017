In DPSO, we define several detecting particles that are randomly selected from the population. The detecting particles use the newly proposed velocity formula to search the adjacent domains of a settled position in approximate spiral trajectories. In addition, we define the particles that use the canonical velocity updating formula as common particles. In each iteration, the common particles use the canonical velocity updating formula to update their velocities and positions, and then the detecting particles do search in approximate spiral trajectories created by the new velocity updating formula in order to find better solutions. As a whole, the detecting particles and common particles would do the high-performance search. DPSO implements the common particles' swarm search behavior and the detecting particles' individual search behavior, thereby trying to improve PSO's performance on swarm diversity, the ability of quick convergence and jumping out the local optimum. The experimental results from several benchmark functions demonstrate good performance of DPSO.
