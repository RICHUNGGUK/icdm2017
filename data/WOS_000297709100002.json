Typical structures, classifications, and naming of the TOP and basic operation units (BOUs) are described in this paper. The circuit implementations, commands, and processes for the reconfiguration are also discussed in detail. A simple analysis of the high performance and low power consumption of ternary optical computers is presented. Finally, an experiment is performed on reconfiguring a 1-bit BOU, which shows that the principles of reconfigurable TOPs are valid, and that the implementations and commands for the reconfiguration are effective.", "paper_title": "Principles, structures, and implementation of reconfigurable ternary optical processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000297709100002"}
