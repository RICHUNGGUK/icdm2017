The solution is uniform (all the instances of a fixed size are solved by the same P system) and uses only communication rules: evolution rules, as well as membrane division and dissolution rules, are not used. Our result shows that, as it happens with Turing machines, this model of P systems can solve in exponential time and polynomial space problems that cannot be solved in polynomial time, unless P = SPACE.", "paper_title": "P systems with active membranes: trading time for space", "paper_id": "WOS:000288255800013"}
