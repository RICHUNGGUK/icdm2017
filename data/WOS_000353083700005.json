The functions are characterized by the property that their Hermite coefficients decay exponentially fast. We use Gauss-Hermite integration rules and show that the errors of our algorithms decay exponentially fast. Furthermore, we study tractability in terms of s and log epsilon(-1) and give necessary and sufficient conditions under which we achieve exponential convergence with EC-weak, EC-polynomial, and EC-strong polynomial tractability.
