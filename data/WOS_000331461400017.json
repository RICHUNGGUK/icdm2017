The number of coalescent histories for a pair consisting of a labeled gene tree topology and a labeled species tree topology is important in gene tree probability computations, and more generally, in studying evolutionary possibilities for gene trees on species trees. Defining the T-r-caterpillar-like family as a sequence of n-taxon trees constructed by replacing the r-taxon subtree of n-taxon caterpillars by a specific r-taxon labeled topology T-r, we examine the number of coalescent histories for caterpillar-like families with matching gene tree and species tree labeled topologies. For each T-r with size r <= 8, we compute the number of coalescent histories for n-taxon trees in the T-r-caterpillar-like family. Next, as n -> infinity, we find that the limiting ratio of the numbers of coalescent histories for the T-r family and caterpillars themselves is correlated with the number of labeled histories for T-r. The results support a view that large numbers of coalescent histories occur when a tree has both a relatively balanced subtree and a high tree depth, contributing to deeper understanding of the combinatorics of gene trees and species trees.", "paper_title": "Coalescent Histories for Caterpillar-Like Families", "paper_id": "WOS:000331461400017"}
