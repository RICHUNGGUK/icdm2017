Today, that much information is created weekly. The opportunity to capture the opinions of the general public about social events, political movements, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product preferences has raised increasing interest both in the scientific community, for the exciting open challenges, and in the business world, for the remarkable fallouts in marketing and financial prediction. Keeping up with the ever-growing amount of unstructured information on the Web, however, is a formidable task and requires fast and efficient models for opinion mining. In this paper, we explore how the high generalization performance, low computational complexity, and fast learning speed of extreme learning machines can be exploited to perform analogical reasoning in a vector space model of affective common-sense knowledge. In particular, by enabling a fast reconfiguration of such a vector space, extreme learning machines allow the polarity associated with natural language concepts to be calculated in a more dynamic and accurate way and, hence, perform better concept-level sentiment analysis.
