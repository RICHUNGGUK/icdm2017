Earlier work in this area has modeled social networks with fixed agent relations. We instead focus on dynamic social networks in which agents can rationally adjust their neighborhoods based on their individual interests. We propose a new connection evaluation theory, the Highest Weighted Reward (HWR) rule: agents dynamically choose their neighbors in order to maximize their own utilities based on rewards from previous interactions. We prove that, in the two-action pure coordination game, our system would stabilize to a clustering state in which all relationships in the network are rewarded with an optimal payoff. Our experiments verify this theory and also reveal additional interesting patterns in the network.", "paper_title": "How behaviors spread in dynamic social networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310993900004"}
