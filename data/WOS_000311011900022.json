It is important to choose an appropriate MCS for each layer, decide how many parity packets in one layer should be transmitted, and determine the resources allocated to multiple video sessions to apply scalable video coding to wireless multicast streaming. We prove that such resource allocation problem is NP-hard and propose an approximate optimal algorithm with a polynomial run time. The algorithm can get the optimal transmission configuration to maximize the expected utility for all users where the utility can be a generic non-negative, non-decreasing function of the received rate. The results from simulations revealed that our algorithm offer significant improvements to video quality over a nave algorithm, an optimal algorithm without feedback from users, and an algorithm with feedback from designated users, especially in scenarios with multiple video sessions and limited radio resources.", "paper_title": "Optimization Algorithm for SVC Multicast with Light-Weight Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000311011900022"}
