This approach utilises the results of research into the embedding of Petri-net functions within microcontroller based architectures. This research is presented here through its application to the design, development and deployment of a process monitoring system into a laboratory based hydro-forming press test rig. The paper illustrates how this approach can provide real time online process information and demonstrates how the microcontroller-based architecture can be used to identify the cause and effects of process faults. The paper further considers how results are captured and processed, and how the management information that they enable can be displayed using a web page based architecture. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
