An AT-graph A is simply realizable if G can be drawn in the plane in such a way that each pair of edges from R crosses exactly once and no other pair crosses. We present a polynomial algorithm which decides whether a given complete AT-graph is simply realizable. On the other hand, we show that other similar realizability problems for (complete) AT-graphs are NP-hard.", "paper_title": "Simple Realizability of Complete Abstract Topological Graphs in P", "paper_id": "WOS:000287146600002"}
