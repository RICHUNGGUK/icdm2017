In this paper, we adopt two novelty detection methods, the support vector data description (SVDD) and the Parzen density estimation, to represent known fault class samples, and to detect new fault class samples. The experiments on real multi-class bearing fault data show that the SVDD can give both high identification rates for the prescribed 'unknown' fault samples and the known fault samples, which shows an advantage over the Parzen density estimation method in our experiments, via choosing the appropriate SVDD algorithm parameters.", "paper_title": "Novel fault class detection based on novelty detection methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300124"}
