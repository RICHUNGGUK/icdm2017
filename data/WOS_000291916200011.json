A dynamic response sensitivity-based finite element model updating approach is used to identify both the structural damages and the vehicular parameters. The solution is obtained iteratively with the penalty function method with regularization from the measured dynamic responses. The effects of measurement noise, different vehicle models, measurement time duration and modeling error on the identification results are investigated in the numerical simulation. Studies in this paper indicate that the proposed method is efficient and robust for both damage and parameter identification. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
