It examines the influence of the permanent magnet (PM) materials, and proposes a simple and practical method of optimizing the air-gap field to achieve sinusoidal back electromotive force (EMF), and to reduce the cogging torque. Design/methodology/approach - IPM AC motors with different magnet materials and various topologies are comparatively studied. Finite elementmethod (FEM) is used to predict the performances of these designs. Material costs and manufacture costs are both taken into account. Finally, an optimized design is prototyped and tested, validating the design considerations. Findings - In an IPM AC motor, even if the rotor outer profile is round, the air-gap field distribution can be fined, while the cogging torque can be significantly reduced, by properly shaping the stator tooth tips. Nevertheless, this technique is usually applicable to motor configurations with concentrated windings, but not to those with distributed windings. Originality/value - While using ferrite magnets for PM AC motors with a kW power, interior magnets are usually inserted in V-shaped slots, and the rotor outer profile is often shaped in order to enhance the air-gap field distribution. However, such a rotor configuration usually increases the manufacture costs, and also deteriorates the consistency of mass production. Therefore, a new motor configuration with a round rotor outer profile and shaped stator tooth tips is proposed. It can not only overcome the aforementioned problems, but also improve the motor performance.", "paper_title": "Optimal design of low-cost IPM AC motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000341713700008"}
