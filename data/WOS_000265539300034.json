To simulate the crumpling and deformation of thin-shell objects when burning, we present an FFD-based deformation model which takes the physical theory of burning phenomena into account. The fire is rendered by the method of particle systems. By inputting different parameters and initial conditions, our framework can simulate various burning phenomena of different thin-shell objects. Experiments validate that it is efficient and easy to implement.", "paper_title": "Physically based simulation of thin-shell objects' burning", "paper_id": "WOS:000265539300034"}
