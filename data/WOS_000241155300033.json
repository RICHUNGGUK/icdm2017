By using some concepts that derived from XML, such as XML type, XML object etc, we encapsulate the nodes of an XML document to represent the semantic relations among them. We also represent a method about document combination based on XML keys, which can maintain the structural consistency and content consistency between history files and original documents. Since the range of inference control is enlarged and the granularity of authorized objects is expanded, our approach can provide higher security and flexibility for XML documents.", "paper_title": "An approach for XML inference control based on RDF", "paper_id": "WOS:000241155300033"}
