We have in particular identified those sensory capabilities as key components for modern user interfaces that can detect movement, actions and intentions to enrich human-computer interaction in a natural way. In this work, we present research around using smartphones as input controllers in the context of exertion videogames. We propose a conceptual framework that identifies the core elements of such interfaces, regardless of the underlying technological platforms, and provides a design pattern for their integration into existing videogames without having to change the game's source code. We present a proof of concept implementation for the framework, with two smartphone input controllers, which using a soft button and accelerometer data, interface to a target-shooting exertion game played while exercising on a stationary bicycle. We present findings from a user experience evaluation.", "paper_title": "Exertion interfaces for computer videogames using smartphones as input controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000320379500008"}
