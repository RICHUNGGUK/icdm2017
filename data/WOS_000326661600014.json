Real-time Optimally Adapting Mesh (ROAM) algorithm is involved to produce terrain deformation with dynamic resolution and a modified Fundamental Earthmoving Equation model is applied to predict excavation forces. A GPU (graphics processing unit) based terrain-rendering method is adopted to create realistic visual appearance of different operating regions on terrain such as excavated pit and dumped mound during the simulation. In the system, surrounding LCDs (liquid crystal displays) are placed at the corresponding windows' position in the driving cab instead of using multiple projectors. For irregular screens, the oblique perspective projection matrix is deduced for the seamless conjoining of graphic scenes in different LCDs. Finally, through the feedback of consumers, we proceed the comprehensive evaluation about the simulator. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
