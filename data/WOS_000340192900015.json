The objective of this paper is to apply the optimal control theory to solve the production-inventory problem with deteriorating items and tradable emission permits, and derive the optimal inventory level and the optimal production rate that minimise the total cost. The results are discussed with a numerical example and a sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution with respect to the parameters of the production-inventory system is carried out.", "paper_title": "Optimal control of the production-inventory system with deteriorating items and tradable emission permits", "paper_id": "WOS:000340192900015"}
