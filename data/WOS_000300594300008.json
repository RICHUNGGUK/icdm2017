A novel evolving multi-local-world model is proposed, and the dynamic mechanisms that govern networks' evolution is described and analyzed. Based on the analytical model, we uncover the topological structure that characterizes both the scale-free feature and the small-world effect and further analyze the surprising emergence of characteristics mutation. Evolution mechanism of these structural properties and their implications in economy are studied. Simulation study reveals some factors that play an important part in influencing network evolution and its structural characteristics mutation. Empirical study of textile industry networks in China verifies the validity of the multi-local-world evolving model and explains its implications in economy field. Model developed in this paper provides some new insights into the evolution of social and economic networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
