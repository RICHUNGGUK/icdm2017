They are useful both to obtain adequate initial conditions for a maximum likelihood iteration and to provide final estimates when maximum likelihood is considered inadequate or computationally expensive. The state-space foundation of these procedures provides flexibility, as they can be applied to any linear fixed-coefficients model, such as ARIMA, VARMAX or structural time-series models. A simulation exercise shows that their computational costs and finite-sample performance are very good.", "paper_title": "Fast estimation methods for time-series models in state-space form", "paper_id": "WOS:000261415400002"}
