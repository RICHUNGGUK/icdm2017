POD modes are constructed using the method snapshot. Karhunen-Loeve (Galerkin) projection to develop a reduced-order model obtained by projecting the velocity field onto the most important POD modes. The resulting finite-dimensional dynamical system is suitable for the design of nonlinear observers. The estimate of the velocity field is then used to estimate the concentration field of a contaminant from the 20 advection-diffusion equation. The prime application considered is the estimation of airflow and contaminant flow in building systems. A 2D simulation example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the technique.
