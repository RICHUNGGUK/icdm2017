A continuous t-norm modeling AND connective in antecedent part of fuzzy rules can be reduced just to strict or nilpotent t-norm. The isomorphism of strict (nilpotent) t-norms enables simpler fitting of TSK fuzzy system parameters and reduces the computational complexity. Similar principle can also be used in the case of some noncommutative conjunctive aggregation functions modeling AND connective. The effect of the choice of a continuous t-norm is then evaluated on well-known case studies in fuzzy control, the Sinc function, and the urban traffic noise control system.", "paper_title": "Differences between t-norms in fuzzy control", "paper_id": "WOS:000304396100002"}
