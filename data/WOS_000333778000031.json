Despite this, few frameworks for validating BBNs have been proposed and fewer have been applied to substantive real-world problems. In this paper we adopt the approach by Pitchforth and Mengersen (2013), which includes nine validation tests that each focus on the structure, discretisation, parameterisation and behaviour of the BBNs included in the case study. We describe the process and result of implementing a validation framework on a model of a real airport terminal system with particular reference to its effectiveness in producing a valid model that can be used and understood by operational decision makers. In applying the proposed validation framework we demonstrate the overall validity of the Inbound Passenger Facilitation Model as well as the effectiveness of the validity framework itself.
