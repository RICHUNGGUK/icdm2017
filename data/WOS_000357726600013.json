Based on differential inclusion theory, sufficient conditions for this problem are obtained by means of generalized Lyapunov approach. The theoretical results can be checked by solving some linear matrix inequalities. The results extend previous researches on the passivity of delayed neural networks.", "paper_title": "Passivity Analysis of Delayed Neural Networks with Discontinuous Activations", "paper_id": "WOS:000357726600013"}
