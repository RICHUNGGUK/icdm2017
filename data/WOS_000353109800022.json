Both shopping and payment can be completed through the Internet and bring convenience to consumers and business opportunities to industry. These trade techniques are mostly set up based on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL provides the security for transaction information and is easy to set up, which makes it is widely accepted by individuals. Although attackers cannot obtain the real content even when the transferred information is intercepted, still there is risk for online trade. For example, it is impossible to prevent credit card information from being stolen by virtual merchant. Therefore, we propose a new mechanism to solve such security problem. We make use of the disposable dynamic security code (DSC) to replace traditional card security code. So even attackers get DSC for that round of transaction, they cannot use it for the next time. Besides, we apply visual secret sharing techniques to transfer the DSC, so that interceptors cannot retrieve the real DSC even for one round of trade. This way, we can improve security of credit card transaction and reliability of online business. The experiments results validate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed mechanism.", "paper_title": "Enhancing the Security of Credit Card Transaction based on Visual DSC", "paper_id": "WOS:000353109800022"}
