Three examples of how the gestural control of synthesized textures can be implemented are presented: scratching textures, based on the gesturalized exploration of a visual space; dynamic noise filtering, where gestures influence a virtual slowly moving string used to filter a noise; and breathing textures, where the metaphor of breathing is used in the sound as well as in the gestural control. Lastly, we discuss how to find connexions between appropriate gestures and sonic texture processes, with a view to producing coherent and expressive digital musical instruments.", "paper_title": "Some experiments in the Gestural control of synthesized sonic textures", "paper_id": "WOS:000237042600033"}
