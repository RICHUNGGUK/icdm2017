We consider different types of information on individual preferences, and on weights of the group members, and study their effects on conclusiveness, efficiency and fairness of outcomes at the group level. Furthermore, we analyze possible violations of the axiom of independence of irrelevant alternatives (HA) as well as the impact of problem characteristics, in particular initial agreement between group members. Our results indicate that providing information in the form of a ranking of differences between consecutive alternatives comes close to providing exact cardinal preference information in several outcome dimensions. However, group decision procedures based on incomplete preference information also show a significant amount of violations of the IIA axiom. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
