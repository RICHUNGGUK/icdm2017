In RFFB, the bandwidth and center frequency of sub-bands can be varied with high frequency resolution without hardware reimplementation. This is achieved with an improved modified frequency transformation-based variable digital filter (MFT-VDF) at the first stage of the proposed multistage implementation. Existing second-order frequency transformation-based low-pass VDFs have limited cutoff frequency range which is approximately 12.5% of the sampling frequency. The proposed low-pass MFT-VDF offers unabridged control over the cutoff frequency on a wide frequency range thereby, improving the cutoff frequency range of existing VDFs. The design example shows that the RFFB is easy to design and offers substantial savings in gate counts over other filter banks.", "paper_title": "Low-Complexity Reconfigurable Fast Filter Bank for Multi-Standard Wireless Receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000337159500027"}
