Specifically, the coevolution of morphology and control in robots is analyzed and a particular strategy to address this problem is contemplated. To this end, the main issues of this approach such as encoding, evaluation or transfer to reality are studied through the use of heterogeneous modular structures with distributed control. We also propose a constructive evolutionary algorithm based on tree-like representations of the morphology that can intrinsically provide for a type of generative evolutionary approach. The algorithm introduces some new elements to smooth the search space and make finding solutions much easier. The evaluation of the individuals is carried out in simulations and then transferred to real robots assembled from the modules considered. To this end, the extension of the principles proposed by classical authors in traditional evolutionary robotics to brain-body evolution regarding how simulations should be set up so that robust behaviors that can be transferred to reality are obtained is considered here. All these issues are analyzed by means of an evolutionary design system called EDHMoR (Evolutionary Designer of Heterogeneous Modular Robots) that contains all the elements involved in this process. To show practical evidences of the conclusions that have been extracted with this work, two benchmark problems in modular robotics are considered and EDHMoR is tested over them. The first one is focused on solving a linear robot motion mission and the second one on a static task of the robot that does not require displacements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
