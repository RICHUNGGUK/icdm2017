The environment is endowed with a set of sensors (to perceive humans or other physical entities such as dogs, bicycles, etc.), interacting with a set of actuators (lights). The model for the interaction and action of sensors and actuators is a dissipative multilayered cellular automata, supporting a self-organization of the system as a response to the presence and movements of people inside it. The paper will introduce the model, as well as the results of simulations of its application in a concrete case study.", "paper_title": "CA-based self-organizing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000292658000001"}
