Engaging the binary MPM technique, this work develops a multi-class MPM classification for reliable iris recognition with high accuracy. The experiments on iris database demonstrate that compared to the existent methods, the MPM-based iris recognition algorithm obtains better classification performance. It can significantly improve the recognition accuracy and has a competitive and promising performance.", "paper_title": "Minimax probability machine for iris recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000006"}
