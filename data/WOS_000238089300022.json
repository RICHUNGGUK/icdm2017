It aims to utilize the learning characteristics and provide a personalized learning environment that exploit pedagogical model and fuzzy logic techniques. The learning material consists of 4 structures, 1) theory, 2) examples 3) exercises and 4) activities. The pedagogical model and learning characteristics are based on the student's personality factor (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)), whilst the fuzzy logic techniques are used to classify the structure of learning material which is based on student's personality factors. This paper tend to illustrate the construction of fuzzy set and fuzzy rules to find the best rules based on combination of two approaches; learning style approach and fuzzy logic approach for adapting the content to the user, allowing a learning system to dynamically adapt the choice of possible learning structure through the learning material based on the user's personality factor.", "paper_title": "The construction of fuzzy set and fuzzy rule for mixed approach in adaptive hypermedia learning system", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300022"}
