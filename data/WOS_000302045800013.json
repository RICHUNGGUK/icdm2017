TZ allows automated creation of optimal spatial links where the only required inputs are the coordinates of the terminals and the geometry of the obstacles. As an example a six-terminal network created with a backtracking based algorithm is shown. An alternative method of aligning consecutive modules to a given 3D path is also presented. A preliminary static analysis of the 17 module is carried out - the topological qualities of rigidity and independence are demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
