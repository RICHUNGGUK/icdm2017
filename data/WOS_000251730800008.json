Numerical simulation of the respiratory system plus ETT (inertance L plus a flow-dependent resistance, K-1 and K-2), with the following non-linear equation of motion P-AW(t) = ((K-1 + K-2 center dot vertical bar <(V)over dot>vertical bar) center dot (V)over dot >(t) + L center dot <(V)double over dot > (t)) + Rrs center dot (V)over dot >vertical bar (t) + (E-1 + E-2 center dot V(t)) center dot V(t) + P-0 (P-AW pressure at the airways opening, V volume), under volume-controlled mechanical ventilation. An index %E2 = 100 center dot(E-2 center dot V-T)/( E-1 + E-2 center dot VT) can be calculated where %E-2 > 30% represents AO and %E-2 < 0% represents CR. Parameters were estimated by the least-squares method, either with the complete equation or supressing L, K-2 or both. %E-2 is always underestimated (down to -152 percent points) with incomplete equations of motion. The estimation of %E-2 may be strongly biased in the presence of an ETT excluded from the estimation model.", "paper_title": "The endotracheal tube biases the estimates of pulmonary recruitment and overdistension", "paper_id": "WOS:000251730800008"}
