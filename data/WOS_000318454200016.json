A lot of relevant studies have been carried out, but all lack versatility. In this paper, a general solution is proposed which makes a peer-to-peer (P2P) network need not pay much attention to churn problem by introducing a logic layer named Dechurn, and most of churn could be eliminated in the Dechurn layer. For utilizing the complementary nature of node joining and leaving, a network scheme, named Constellation, for handling churn is designed on the Dechurn layer through which the resources cached in a node for its spouse node who has left network would be succeeded by a node in latent period. The simulation results indicate that the proposed solution is effective and efficient in handling churn and easy to put into practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
