It is shown that each cluster can be decomposed into its constituent basin level cells and can be naturally extended to an enlarged clustered domain, which serves as a basis for inductive clustering. A simplified weighted graph preserving the topological structure of the clusters is also constructed and is employed to develop a robust and inductive clustering algorithm. Simulation results are given to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Dynamic characterization of cluster structures for robust and inductive support vector clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000240443400014"}
