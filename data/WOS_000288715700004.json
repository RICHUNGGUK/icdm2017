In this scheme, two pairs of the two-particle partially entangled state are used as quantum channel. Alice performs the single-particle measurement three times and sends the information to the receiver. In accordance with the information, the receiver can construct the original state. By this method, the total probability of successful preparation is enhanced.", "paper_title": "REMOTE PREPARATION OF A TWO-PARTICLE ENTANGLED STATE", "paper_id": "WOS:000288715700004"}
