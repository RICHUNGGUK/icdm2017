Both linear and nonlinear stochastic perturbations are considered. The main features of this paper are twofold: 1) Based on generalized Finsler lemma, some improved delay-dependent stability criteria are established, which are more efficient than the existing ones in terms of less conservatism and lower computational complexity; and 2) when the nonlinear stochastic perturbation acting on the system satisfies a class of Lipschitz linear growth conditions, the restrictive condition P < delta I (or the similar ones) in the existing results can be relaxed under some assumptions. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "Stability Analysis of Time-Delay Neural Networks Subject to Stochastic Perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000327647500050"}
