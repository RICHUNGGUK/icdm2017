With the use of a routing algorithm based on the total uplink transmit power minimization criterion, the total transmit power of all the multi-hop links between the mobile terminal and the central port can be significantly reduced, in comparison with the present (single-hop) cellular network. In this paper, an \"on-demand\" channel assignment strategy, using the channel segregation dynamic channel allocation (CSDCA) algorithm, is proposed for multi-hop DS-CDMA VCN. Computer simulation is conducted to evaluate the blocking probability performance and make a comparison between the VCN and the present cellular network.", "paper_title": "Blocking probability of a DS-CDMA multi-hop virtual cellular network", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961400002"}
