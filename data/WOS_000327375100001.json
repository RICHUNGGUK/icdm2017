This special issue introduced a spread sample of educational projects around the world. The success of the call and the quality of the selected contribution aimed us to organize a new issue regarding educational research projects, but this time with a special focus on socio-semantic technologies applied to teaching and learning processed at all the educational levels. As result, we present the current JUCS issue including information and the main outcomes of 9 international research projects about technology socio-semantic applied to education.", "paper_title": "International Research Projects on Socio-Semantic Technologies Applied to Education", "paper_id": "WOS:000327375100001"}
