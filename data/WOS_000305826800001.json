The book examines Alan Turing's contribution to the implementation of practical stored-program digital computers and the relation between Turing and the other computer pioneers active in the period 1945-55. In this invited article, the book's Editor gives an overall view of the subject, focussing particularly on Alan Turing's special contributions in the first decade of the Information Age.", "paper_title": "A Synopsis of the Book Alan Turing and his Contemporaries: Building the World's First Computers", "paper_id": "WOS:000305826800001"}
