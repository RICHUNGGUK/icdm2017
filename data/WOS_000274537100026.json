From a quaternary LCZ sequence set with parameters (N, M, L, 1), the proposed method constructs a new quaternary LCZ sequence set with parameters (2N, 2M, L, 2), where N is odd. If the employed LCZ sequence set in the construction is optimal, the extended LCZ sequence set becomes also optimal where N = kL, L > 4, and k > 2.", "paper_title": "New Extension Method of Quaternary Low Correlation Zone Sequence Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537100026"}
