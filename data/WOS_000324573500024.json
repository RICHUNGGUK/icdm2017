Although polar codes are explicitly defined, straightforward construction is intractable since the resulting polar bit-channels have an output alphabet that grows exponentially with the code length. Thus, the core problem that needs to be solved is that of faithfully approximating a bit-channel with an intractably large alphabet by another channel having a manageable alphabet size. We devise two approximation methods which \"sandwich\" the original bit-channel between a degraded and an upgraded version thereof. Both approximations can be efficiently computed and turn out to be extremely close in practice. We also provide theoretical analysis of our construction algorithms, proving that for any fixed epsilon > 0 and all sufficiently large code lengths, polar codes whose rate is within of channel capacity can be constructed in time and space that are both linear in n.", "paper_title": "How to Construct Polar Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000324573500024"}
