[A fast algorithm for sparse reconstruction based on shrinkage, subspace optimisation and continuation, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 32 (2010), pp. 1832-1857] for solving the l(1)-regularized problem, i.e. a weighted sum of the l(1)-norm parallel to x parallel to(1) and a smooth function f(x). The active-set algorithm alternatively iterates between two stages. In the first 'non-monotone line search (NMLS)' stage, an iterative first-order method based on 'shrinkage' is used to estimate the support at the solution. In the second 'subspace optimization' stage, a smaller smooth problem is solved to recover the magnitudes of the non-zero components of x. We show that NMLS itself is globally convergent and the convergence rate is at least R-linearly. In particular, NMLS is able to identify the zero components of a stationary point after a finite number of steps under some mild conditions. The global convergence of FPC_AS is established based on the properties of NMLS.", "paper_title": "On the convergence of an active-set method for l(1) minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000306841500011"}
