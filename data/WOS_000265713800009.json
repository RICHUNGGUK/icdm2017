Design/methodology/approach - In cascaded multi-level inverters, it is usually assumed that the DC sources have the same constant voltage and output harmonics minimization is accomplished by applying proper switching angles. Employing different DC voltages with proper ratios am result in further reduction of the harmonics. After formulation of the system, i.e. describing the inverter's output voltage components in terms of the switching angles and unequal DC source voltages, a rule is applied to obtain the step heights of the staircase output waveform (DC source voltages), so that the output waveform becomes as close to the required fundamental sine wave as possible. Substituting the obtained DC source voltages into the harmonics elimination equations results in a set of equations, which are functions of switching angles only. Solving these equations leads to proper switching angles, which, regardless of the fundamental component's value, provide the specified harmonic conditions. The Output voltage is then controlled by DC sources voltage regulation. Findings - Computer simulations show that employing the proposed concept results in substantial improvement in the harmonic minimization, as well as, extending the operating range of the inverter, compared to the conventional methods with equal DC source Voltage multi-level inverters. Originality/value - The proposed concept according to which the ratio of the DC source voltages are determined, is original.", "paper_title": "Optimum regulation of DC sources in cascaded multi-level inverters", "paper_id": "WOS:000265713800009"}
