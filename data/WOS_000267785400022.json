Twenty-seven university undergraduate students were trained on three games from Big Brain Academy (Wii): Calculus, Backward Memory and Train. Participants did not have any previous experience with these games. General intelligence was measured by five ability tests before the training session. Training comprised 10 blocks of trials (10 trials per block). Ackerman's (Ackerman, P. L. (1988). Individual differences and skill acquisition. In P. L. Ackerman, R. J. Sernberg, & R. Glaser (Eds.), Learning and individual differences: Advances in theory and practice (pp. 165-217). New York: W.H. Freeman and Company) theory of skill learning was used as a framework for the present study. Results show that playing the Train game increases the correlation with general intelligence across blocks of trials. This is not the case for Calculus and Backward Memory. These findings suggest strategies for designing video-games presumably appropriate to stimulate our core cognitive abilities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
