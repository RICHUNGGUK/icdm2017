The average SNR and the SNRs on the subchannels can all be estimated by the proposed algorithm, and its performance is independent of the channel's frequency selectivity. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed method is highly improved and much better than that of Boumard's method.", "paper_title": "SNR estimation algorithm based on the preamble for wireless OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256529900010"}
