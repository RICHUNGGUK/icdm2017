To address such issue, in this paper, a weighted couple sparse representation model is presented to remove IN. In the proposed model, the complicated relationships between the reconstructed and the noisy images are exploited to make the coding coefficients more appropriate to recover the noise-free image. Moreover, the image pixels are classified into clear, slightly corrupted, and heavily corrupted ones. Different data-fidelity regularizations are then accordingly applied to different pixels to further improve the denoising performance. In our proposed method, the dictionary is directly trained on the noisy raw data by addressing a weighted rank-one minimization problem, which can capture more features of the original data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to several state-of-the-art denoising methods.", "paper_title": "Weighted Couple Sparse Representation With Classified Regularization for Impulse Noise Removal", "paper_id": "WOS:000359563500001"}
