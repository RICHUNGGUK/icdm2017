Typically, classes of known active compounds taken from the medicinal chemistry literature are divided into reference molecules (search templates) and potential hits that are added to background databases assumed to consist of compounds not sharing this activity. Then VS calculations are carried out, and the recall of known active compounds is determined. However, conventional benchmarking is affected by a number of problems that reduce its value for method evaluation. In addition to often insufficient statistical validation and the lack of generally accepted evaluation standards, the artificial nature of typical benchmark settings is often criticized. Retrospective benchmark calculations generally overestimate the potential of VS methods and do not scale with their performance in prospective applications. In order to provide additional opportunities for benchmarking that more closely resemble practical VS conditions, we have designed a publicly available compound database (DB) of reproducible virtual screens (REPROVIS-DB) that organizes information from successful ligand-based VS applications including reference compounds, screening databases, compound selection criteria, and experimentally confirmed hits. Using the currently available 25 hand-selected compound data sets, one can attempt to reproduce successful virtual screens with other than the originally applied methods and assess their potential for practical applications.", "paper_title": "REPROVIS-DB: A Benchmark System for Ligand-Based Virtual Screening Derived from Reproducible Prospective Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000296044200003"}
