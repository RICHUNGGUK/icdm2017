Current approaches rely on complicated procedures which do not work well, if at all, in high dimensions and usual parameter set-ups. We use a Gibbs sampler which seems necessary in practical situations of high dimensions.", "paper_title": "Sampling from compositional and directional distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238746900004"}
