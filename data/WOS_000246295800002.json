In this research, we examine user Website behaviour as a way to understand Website design using a \"think aloud'' protocol analysis. Main theoretical contributions of this research are the illustration of the. ow of cognitive processes during the Website browsing and the establishment of Website design dimensions - the meaning and content implied by Website content, its outward form, and the structure and navigation - in relation to user performance.
