In this paper, we propose an enhanced energy saving scheme to overcome this problem. An embedded Markov chain model is adopted to analyze the enhanced energy saving scheme analytically. At the same time, a closed-form expression of the average energy consumption in the sleep-mode for the suggested scheme is presented. We evaluate and validate the suggested scheme via analytical results and simulation results. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can obtain better effects of energy conservation to minimize MS power usage and to extend the lifetime of MS effectively.", "paper_title": "An enhanced energy saving scheme in Mobile Broadband Wireless Access systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000010"}
