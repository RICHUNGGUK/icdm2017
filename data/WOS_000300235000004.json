In the problem, the radii of the disks can be changed arbitrarily unless they overlap outside of the container, and the disks are allowed to overlap with each other. We present an approximation algorithm for this problem assuming that the container is a convex polygon. Our algorithm achieves approximation ratio (0.78 - epsilon) for any small epsilon > 0. Since the computation tine of our algorithm depends on the number of corners of the convex polygon exponentially, we also give a heuristic to reduce the number of corners.", "paper_title": "AN APPROXIMATION ALGORITHM FOR LOCATING MAXIMAL DISKS WITHIN CONVEX POLYGONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000300235000004"}
