However, bufferless NoC only works well under low-to-medium load because it becomes more easily congested as message injection rate increases. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed source-throttling congestion control mechanism that relieves the effect of congestion in bufferless NoC under high load, called Cbufferless. The proposed strategy uses a novel congestion detection and control mechanism, computing average deflection rate of routing flit and distributed throttling message injection. Utilizing the new mechanism, the congestion information can be directly obtained inside node, which allows the mechanism to be fully distributed without requiring any transmission of global congestion information among neighbor routers and within a router. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism improves system throughput by up to 30 and 15.5 %, saves energy consumption by up to 40 and 19 % than that of baseline and injection rate throttling bufferless NoCs, respectively, and keeps lower message latency under congested load when compared.", "paper_title": "A novel distributed congestion control for bufferless network-on-chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000335559500014"}
