Real-world deployments demonstrate that, in practice, a network is not always entirely localizable, leaving a certain number of theoretically nonlocalizable nodes. Previous studies mainly focus on how to tune network settings to make a network localizable. However, the existing methods are considered to be coarse-grained, since they equally deal with localizable and nonlocalizable nodes. Ignoring localizability induces unnecessary adjustments and accompanying costs. In this study, we propose a fine-grained approach, localizability-aided localization (LAL), which basically consists of three phases: node localizability testing, structure analysis, and network adjustment. LAL triggers a single round adjustment, after which some popular localization methods can be successfully carried out. Being aware of node localizability, all network adjustments made by LAL are purposefully selected. Experiment and simulation results show that LAL effectively guides the adjustment while makes it efficient in terms of the number of added edges and affected nodes.", "paper_title": "Localization-Oriented Network Adjustment in Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327662100016"}
