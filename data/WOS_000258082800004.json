The method facilitates a classical teach-by-showing approach where a reference image is used to control the robot to the desired pose (position and orientation). As a result of our proposal a mobile robot carries out a smooth trajectory towards the target and the epipolar geometry model is used through the whole motion. The control scheme developed considers the motion constraints of the mobile platform in a framework based on the epipolar geometry that does not rely on artificial markers or specific models of the environment. The proposed method is designed in order to cope with the degenerate estimation case of the epipolar geometry with short baseline. Experimental evaluation has been performed in realistic indoor and outdoor settings. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
