The developed results encompass all available results on H. approach, passivity and positive realness for singular time-delay systems as special cases. Both, delay-independent and delay-dependent cases are investigated and all the sufficient stability conditions are cast as linear matrix inequality-based feasibility tests. Robust dissipativity results are also derived for the case of convex polytopic uncertainties. A numerical example are provided to illustrate the developed results.", "paper_title": "DISSIPATIVITY RESULTS FOR LINEAR SINGULAR TIME-DELAY SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260923100007"}
