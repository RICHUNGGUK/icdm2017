On the other hand, we show that the speed-up of adiabatic quantum algorithms by selecting particular adiabatic evolution paths or injecting energy into the quantum system can be explained as a form of entanglement enlargement. These findings suggest that entanglement plays a fundamental role for the efficiency of algorithm performance.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT PROPERTIES OF ADIABATIC QUANTUM ALGORITHMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273426500011"}
