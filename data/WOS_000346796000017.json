We focus on a single cell, with the aim of developing a unifying framework for designing low-complexity scheduling policies that can provide optimal performance in terms of both throughput and delay. We develop new easy-to-verify sufficient conditions for rate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic regime) and throughput optimality (in general nonasymptotic setting), respectively. The sufficient conditions allow us to prove rate-function delay optimality for a class of Oldest Packets First (OPF) policies and throughput optimality for a large class of Maximum Weight in the Fluid limit (MWF) policies, respectively. By exploiting the special features of our carefully chosen sufficient conditions and intelligently combining policies from the classes of OPF and MWF policies, we design hybrid policies that are both rate-function delay-optimal and throughput-optimal with a complexity of O(n(2.5) log n), where n is the number of channels or users. Our sufficient condition is also used to show that a previously proposed policy called Delay Weighted Matching (DWM) is rate-function delay-optimal. However, DWM incurs a high complexity of O(n(5)). Thus, our approach yields significantly lower complexity than the only previously designed delay and throughput-optimal scheduling policy. We also conduct numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Low-Complexity Scheduling Policies for Achieving Throughput and Asymptotic Delay Optimality in Multichannel Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000346796000017"}
