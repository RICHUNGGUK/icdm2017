Then, the environmental impact factors analysis decision support system based on self-organizing data mining model is designed Design/methodology/approach - Applying data mining methods in the analysis and decision making of regional environmental impact factors will have broad perspective. Self-organization data mining is anew modeling method of complex systems modeling with strong modeling capability It was first presented by A.G Ivakhnenko, based on the principle of self-organization of biological cybernetics and Kolmogoorov-Gabor polynomial function In this paper, the impact factors of regional environment quality evolution based on self-organization data mining method is studied, selecting the main impact factors of environment change automatically by computer simulation, analyzing the impact contribution rate of environmental impact factors. Findings - The environmental impact factors analysis decision support system based on self-organizing data mining model is designed. Research limitations/implications - Accessibility and availability of data are the main limitations affecting which model will be applied Practical implications - The paper has important theoretical and practical significance for the sustainable development of regional environment, resource. economy system and the constitution of environmental protection and management measures. Originality/value - This paper not only exploits new application domains of self-organization data mining, but also explores new ways for regional environment impact factors analysis", "paper_title": "Self-organizing data mining research on the decision support system for environmental evolution analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500024"}
