It uses a mixture model made up of two Gaussian distributions and one inverted lognormal distribution to analyze the image histogram. The image is clustered in three parts: background, soft tissue, and bone using this model. Improvement in the visibility of both structures is achieved through a local transformation based on gamma correction, stretching, and saturation, which is applied using different parameters for bone and soft-tissue pixels. A processing time of 1 s for 5 M pixel images allows the filter to operate in real time. Although the default value of the filter parameters is adequate for most images, real-time operation allows adjustment to recover under- and overexposed images or to obtain the best quality subjectively. The filter was extensively clinically tested: quantitative and qualitative results are reported here.", "paper_title": "Enhancing digital cephalic radiography with mixture models and local gamma correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000234233600010"}
