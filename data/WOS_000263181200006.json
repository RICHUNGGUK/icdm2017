A by-product of this task gave us an infinite mixture representation of the Fisher-Bingham distribution; the mixing distributions being based on the Dirichlet distribution. Finite numerical approximations are considered and a sampling algorithm based on a finite mixture approximation is compared with the slice sampling algorithm.", "paper_title": "On the Fisher-Bingham distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000263181200006"}
