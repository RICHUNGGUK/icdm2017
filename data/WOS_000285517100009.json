This paper addresses the problem of minimizing power/ground noise in the clock tree synthesis. Contrary to the previous approaches which only make use of assigning polarities to clock buffers to reduce power/ground noise, our approach solves a new problem of simultaneous consideration of assigning polarities to clock buffers and determining buffer sizes to fully exploit the effects of buffer sizing together with polarity assignment on the minimization of power/ground noise while satisfying the clock skew constraint. Specifically, the contributions of this paper are: 1) precisely estimating peak currents by clock buffers and reflecting them on the power/ground noise minimization; 2) proposing a pseudo-polynomial time optimal algorithm based on dynamic programming for solving the integrated problem, together with the proof of intractability of the problem; 3) devising a systematic design flow framework for reducing the power/ground noise over the entire chip; and 4) considering the effect of thermal variation on the clock skew bound and the noise minimization.", "paper_title": "Buffer Sizing and Polarity Assignment in Clock Tree Synthesis for Power/Ground Noise Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000285517100009"}
