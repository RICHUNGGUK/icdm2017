The first option is to offer a previewing result of the secret image according to the stacking operation, while the second one is to retrieve a lossless secret image. However, a meaningless shadow of Yang-Ciou scheme may cause the attention of malicious attackers. This study improves the security issues of previous schemes by introducing a user-friendly cover image to each shared image, which can help prevent the shadows from being intercepted by attackers. In particular, the proposed approach provides a previewing of a vague image as an authentication mechanism. This can greatly help to verify whether all the shadows are valid or not.", "paper_title": "A User-Friendly and Authenticatable Secret Image Sharing Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000336885500012"}
