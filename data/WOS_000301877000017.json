In this paper, we describe a discrete-time, deterministic MILP model that allows optimal production planning for continuous power-intensive processes. We emphasize the systematic modeling of operational transitions, that result from switching the operating modes of the plant equipment, with logic constraints. We prove properties on the tightness of several logic constraints. For the time horizon of 1 week and hourly changing electricity prices, we solve an industrial case study on air separation plants, where transitional modes help us capture ramping behavior. We also solve problem instances on cement plants where we show that the appropriate choice of operating modes allows us to obtain practical schedules, while limiting the number of changeovers. Despite the large size of the MILPs, the required solution times are small due to the explicit modeling of transitions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
