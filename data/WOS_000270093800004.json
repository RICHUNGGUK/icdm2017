The method uses 3D structural comparison to a crystallographically determined ligand in a bioactive 'template' conformation, using a geometric hashing method, in order to prioritize each database compound. We show that LigMatch outperforms several other widely used VS methods on the 13 DUD targets. We go on to demonstrate that improved VS performance can be gained from using multiple, structurally diverse templates rather than a single template ligand for a particular protein target. In this case, a 2D fingerprint-based method is used to select a ligand template from a set of known bioactive conformations. Furthermore, we show that LigMatch performs well even in the absence of 2D similarity to the template ligands, thereby demonstrating its robustness with respect to purely 2D methods and its potential for scaffold hopping.", "paper_title": "LigMatch: A Multiple Structure-Based Ligand Matching Method for 3D Virtual Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000270093800004"}
