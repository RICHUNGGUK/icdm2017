Such problematics arise, for instance, when one solves a local model on a fine grid that is nested in a coarser one of greater extent. Usually, the local solution Uloc is computed from the coarse solution Uext, thanks to an OBC formulated as BhUloc=BHUext, where Bh and BH are discretizations of the same differential operator B (Bh being defined on the fine grid and BH on the coarse grid). In this paper, we show that such an OBC cannot lead to the exact solution, and we propose a generalized formulation BhUloc=BHUext+g, where g is a correction term. When Bh and BH are discretizations of a transparent operator, g can be computed analytically, at least for simple equations. Otherwise, we propose to approximate g by a Richardson extrapolation procedure. Numerical test cases on a 1D Laplace equation and on a 1D shallow water system illustrate the improved efficiency of such a generalized OBC compared with usual ones.
