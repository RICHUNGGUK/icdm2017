In this paper we study from the mathematical point of view this fuzzy metric and other fuzzy metrics related to it. As a consequence of this study we introduce, throughout the paper, some questions relative to fuzzy metrics. Also, as another practical application, we show that this fuzzy metric is useful for measuring perceptual colour differences between colour samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
