In this paper, we first propose a centralised k-connected fault-tolerant topology control algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) called CKFTC-PSO. In CKFTC-PSO, we take both issues of node failure and power efficiency into consideration and give the mathematical model of k-connected fault-tolerant topology control problem. Inspired by physics of Genetic Algorithm (GA), the principles of mutation and crossover operator in GA are incorporated into the proposed CKFTC-PSO algorithm to achieve a better diversity and break away from local optima. Based on CKFTC-Pso, we then propose a distributed k-connected fault-tolerant topology control algorithm with PSO called DKFTC-PSO. DICFIC-PSO has better performance than CKFTC-PSO in power-efficiency while preserve k-connectivity. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Distributed k-connected fault-tolerant topology control algorithms with PSO in future autonomic sensor systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308785000005"}
