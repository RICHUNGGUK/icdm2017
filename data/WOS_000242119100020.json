Previous works on the MOA* algorithm (Multi-objective A*) concluded that the importance of the monotone property of heuristics was not as important as in A*. The recent development of an alternative algorithm (NAMOA*), gives a chance to review these results. The paper presents a formal analysis on the comparison of heuristics in NAMOA* and concludes that the properties of consistency and monotonicity are of fundamental importance in search efficiency.", "paper_title": "Comparison of heuristics in multiobjective A* search", "paper_id": "WOS:000242119100020"}
