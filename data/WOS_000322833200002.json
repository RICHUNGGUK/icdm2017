Since the 1990s, an increasing number of works have thus proposed the application of MOEAs to solve complex financial and economic problems, involving multiple objectives. This paper provides a survey on the state-of-the-art of research, reported in the specialized literature to date, related to this framework. The taxonomy chosen here makes a distinction between the (widely covered) portfolio optimization problem and the other applications in the field. In addition, potential paths for future research within this area are identified.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms for the Solution of the Portfolio Optimization Problem and Other Finance and Economics Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000322833200002"}
