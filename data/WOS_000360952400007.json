The near-wall region is excluded from the main computational mesh. This eliminates the expense of computing the solution in the viscous sub layer and reduces the total computation time. A one-dimensional boundary layer equation is used to transfer the wall boundary condition from the wall to an interface located within the flow domain. The boundary conditions imposed on the interface are of Robin type and are written in mesh-independent form. The boundary layer equation can contain source terms such as the pressure gradient or near-wall damping terms. Scalar boundary conditions can be calculated using the same formalism as the boundary conditions for the velocity. The implementation of the boundary conditions is tested on a channel flow, two heated annulus flows and a two-dimensional, asymmetric diffuser. For each case, different locations of the interface boundary are tested. The results are not sensitive to the location of the interface. Friction factors and heat transfer data calculated with the domain decomposition approach compare well to the results obtained with the fully-resolved forms of the respective turbulence models.
