Numerical experiments are presented where the technique is applied to detect and locate pitchfork and transcritical bifurcation points on a one parameter dependent system. With an appropriate selection of the initial guess in the GMRES method, the technique is shown to detect and accurately locate bifurcation points. We present an analysis that helps to explain the good performance observed in practice.", "paper_title": "Krylov methods and determinants for detecting bifurcations in one parameter dependent partial differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000242498500004"}
