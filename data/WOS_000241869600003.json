Consequently, they exhibit high potential to provide strong mechanisms for building intelligent systems that must operate in rapidly changing environments. However, to fully exploit the potential of FNN structures, efficient parallel-processing implementations are highly desired. In this study, our objective is to investigate this avenue and identify various critical hardware design issues as we propose a versatile neurofuzzy platform with a topology strongly influenced by theories of fuzzy modelling. With a novel hybrid-learning scheme involving structural and parametric optimization, we demonstrate how fuzzy neural networks are well suited in forming the adaptive logic-processing core of this platform, supporting intelligent information processing. The core emulates aspects of human thought, dealing with information at a granular level and using logic-oriented approximate reasoning to solve a problem. It is able to learn and approximate real-world concepts, building a knowledge base that may be interpreted and modified by the user. Drawing upon this knowledge, a high-speed parallel implementation has potential for performing inference of many simultaneous concepts in real-time, realizing cognition as it perceives the current state of its environment.
