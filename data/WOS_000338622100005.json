Unconscious search mimics the process of psychoanalytic psychotherapy in which the psychoanalyst tries to access the unconscious of a mental patient to find the root cause his/her problem, which is encapsulated in unconsciousness. Unconscious search is a multi-start metaheuristic which has three main stages, namely construction, construction review and local search. In construction phase a new solution is generated. In construction review the generated solution in construction phase is used to produce more starting points for using in the local search phase. The results of applying US to UFLP shows that this metaheuristic can determine high quality solutions in short processing time comparing to other heuristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
