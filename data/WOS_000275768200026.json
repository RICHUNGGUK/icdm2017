The results showed that, for CJL, the difficulty of Japanese language learning was the recognition and understanding of Japanese sentences with Kana, not Japanese Kanji", "paper_title": "AN ERP RESEARCH ON CHINESE JAPANESE LEARNERS' PROCESSING OF JAPANESE KANJI AND SENTENCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000275768200026"}
