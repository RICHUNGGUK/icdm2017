Due to the underlying geometry of the circle standard constrained inference procedures developed for Euclidean space data are not applicable. Recently,statistical inference for parameters under such order constraints on a unit circle was discussed in Rueda ,Fernandez, and Peddada (2009) and Fernandez, Rueda,and Peddada(2012).In this paper we introduce the R package isocir which provides as et of functions that can be used for analyzing angular data subject to order constraints on a unit circle. Since this work is motivated by applications in cellbiology, we illustrate the proposed package using a relevant cell cycle data.", "paper_title": "isocir: An R Package for Constrained Inference Using Isotonic Regression for Circular Data, with an Application to Cell Biology", "paper_id": "WOS:000323909800001"}
