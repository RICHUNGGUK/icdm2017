We show that there is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given an square, finds the minimal tile system (i.e., the system with the smallest number of distinct tile types) that uniquely self-assembles the square, answering an open question of Adleman et al. (Combinatorial optimization problems in self-assembly, STOC 2002). Our investigation leading to this algorithm reveals other positive and negative results about the relationship between the size of a tile system and its \"temperature\" (the binding strength threshold required for a tile to attach).", "paper_title": "Program Size and Temperature in Self-Assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000355939800010"}
