In this article we show how to develop a representation theory over a category of domains with morphisms partial continuous functions. The raison d'etre for introducing partial continuous functions is that by passing to partial maps, we are free to consider totalities which are not dense. We show that there is a natural subcategory of the category of representable spaces with morphisms representable maps which is Cartesian closed. Finally, we consider the question of effectivity.", "paper_title": "Partial continuous functions and admissible domain representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424100010"}
