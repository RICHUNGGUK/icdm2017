The fingerprinting technique can be used to generate unique copies for individual subscribers and can be used to identify the copyright violator. Thus for tracing the copyright violator, unique copy per subscriber is needed whereas broadcasting requires a single copy to be transmitted to everyone. The proposed method efficiently incorporates both these requirements. In addition to the fingerprinting requirement to trace the subscriber who is violating the copyright, a confidentiality requirement needs to be implemented against the non-subscribers in the broadcast region. The proposed algorithm efficiently combines both the fingerprinting requirement and confidentiality requirement into one single atomic process. The proposed algorithm uses robust invisible watermarking technique for fingerprinting and masking technique for confidentiality. The additional advantage of the proposed scheme is that it also supports MPEG-2 compressed domain processing, which is useful for many broadcasting standards.", "paper_title": "Mask-based fingerprinting scheme for digital video broadcasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000241890500002"}
