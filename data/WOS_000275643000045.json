The definition of MS-stability and CMS-stability of these two numerical methods is introduced. Under the conditions which guarantee the stability of the analytical solution, the Euler scheme is proved to be MS-stable and the semi-implicit scheme is to be MS-stable and GMS-stable. An example is given for illustration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
