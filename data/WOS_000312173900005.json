Our main contribution is combination of T-S fuzzy models and a moving horizon H-infinity control scheme by Chen and Scherer to address the disturbance attenuation of nonlinear constrained system. A sufficient condition for the disturbance amplitude is given to guarantee the feasibility of the optimization problem at each time. A parameter-dependent state feedback control law is adopted, and the corresponding optimization problem is reduced to a convex optimization problem involving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The H-infinity attenuation index for the nonlinear moving horizon H-infinity control problem is adapted online to satisfy time-domain constraints. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is successfully demonstrated by control of a continuous stirred tank reactor and active queue management for routers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
