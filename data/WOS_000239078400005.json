A next-to-shortest (u, v)-path is a shortest (u, v)-path amongst (u, v)-paths with length strictly greater than the length of the shortest (u, v)-path. The first polynomial algorithm for this problem was presented in [I. Krasikov, S.D. Noble, Finding next-to-shortest paths in a graph, Inform. Process. Lett. 92 (2004) 117-119]. We improve the upper bound from O(n(3)m) to O(n(3)). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
