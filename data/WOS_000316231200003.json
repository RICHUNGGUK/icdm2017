In order to manage and keep such distributed simulations consistent, the high level architecture (HLA) standard has been designed; however, it does not provide any solution that directly solves simulation performance issues. Many balancing approaches have been proposed in order to offer a suboptimal balancing solution, but they are limited to certain simulation aspects, are specific to determined applications, or are unaware of the HLA-based simulation characteristics. In light of considering both computational and communication aspects for HLA-based simulations, a centralized hierarchical balancing scheme was proposed. This scheme presents several drawbacks that make it susceptible to bottlenecks, overheads, global synchronization, and single point of failure. Therefore, a scheme based on a distributed algorithm to re-arrange the computational and communication load is proposed. Experiments have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the distributed scheme when compared with the scheme based on a centralized redistribution algorithm. The results showed that the distributed balancing technique could provide similar performance gain or even improve it for some specific cases.
