In order to address this issue, an improved version of Chung et al.'s reversible data hiding-based approach for intra-frame error concealment is proposed for H.264/AVC codec. By using the histogram shifting technique, the original work reversibly embeds the motion vector (MV) of a macroblock (MB) into other MB within the same intra-frame. If an MB is corrupted at the decoder side, the embedded MV can be extracted from the corresponding MB for the recovery of the corrupted MB. However, Chung et al.'s work did not fully exploit the number of coefficients which need to be modified in order to reversibly hiding data, and did not consider many extra nonzero residual blocks produced by data hiding. These two issues could reduce the visual quality of the stego-video. This paper adopts MV data pre-processing, the selection of most suitable embedding region, and the minimum possible amount of histogram modification, which lead to higher PSNR of the stego-video for a given payload. Experimental results further reveal that the proposed method offers stego-video with better visual quality over Chung et al.'s work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
