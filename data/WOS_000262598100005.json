In order to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, we apply it for classifying athletics videos into two classes: videos of individual and videos of team sports. The videos used are real and characterized by dynamic and unconstrained environment. Moreover, in the case of team sport, we propose a shape deformations based method for running/hurdling discrimination (activity recognition). Robust, adaptive and independent from color, illumination changes and the camera motion, the proposed features are combined in the Transferable Belief Model (TBM) framework providing a two-level (frames and shot) video categorization. Experimental results of 97% of accuracy for individual/team sport categorization using a dataset of 252 real videos of athletic meetings, acquired by moving cameras under varying view angles, indicate the stability and the good performance of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "SHAPE-BASED INDIVIDUAL/GROUP DETECTION FOR SPORT VIDEOS CATEGORIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000262598100005"}
