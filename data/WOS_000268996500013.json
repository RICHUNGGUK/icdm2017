For this purpose, we introduce the idea that the motion of an articulated body can be decomposed into rigid motions of planes defined by triplets of body points. Using the fact that the homography induced by the motion of a triplet of body points in two identical pose transitions reduces to the special case of a homology, we use the equality of two of its eigenvalues as a measure of the similarity of the pose transitions between two subjects, observed by different perspective cameras and from different viewpoints. Experimental results show that our method can accurately identify human pose transitions and actions even when they include dynamic timeline maps, and are obtained from totally different viewpoints with different unknown camera parameters.", "paper_title": "View-Invariant Action Recognition from Point Triplets", "paper_id": "WOS:000268996500013"}
