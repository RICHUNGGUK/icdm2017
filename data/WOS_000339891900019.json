Dashboards typically capture and visualize traces of learning activities, in order to promote awareness, reflection, and sense-making, and to enable learners to define goals and track progress toward these goals. Based on an analysis of our own work and a broad range of similar learning dashboards, we identify HCI issues for this exciting research area.", "paper_title": "Learning dashboards: an overview and future research opportunities", "paper_id": "WOS:000339891900019"}
