Using random difference schemes a random discrete eigenfunctions method is developed in order to construct a discrete approximating stochastic process. Mean square consistency of the random difference scheme is treated and mean square stability of the numerical solution is studied and illustrated with examples. Statistical moments of the numerical solution are also computed. (c) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
