In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction algorithm named tensor locality sensitive discriminant analysis which accepts tensors as inputs. The algorithm preserves the key structure of data by using the labeled samples and has high performance as well as low time complexity. Experiments on the three standard databases show that the proposed method has better performance and achieves high accuracy.", "paper_title": "TENSOR LOCALITY SENSITIVE DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS AND ITS COMPLEXITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000272695100011"}
