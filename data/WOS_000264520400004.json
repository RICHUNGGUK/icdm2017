The main building block is a regularization algorithm based on a penalty term enforcing sparsity. The overall strategy we propose is also effective for training sets of limited size and reaches competitive performances with respect to the state-of-the-art. To show the versatility of the proposed strategy we apply it to both face detection and authentication, implementing two modules of a monitoring system working in real time in our lab. Aside from the choices of the feature dictionary and the training data, which require prior knowledge on the problem, the proposed method is fully automatic. The very good results obtained in different applications speak for the generality and the robustness of the framework.", "paper_title": "A Regularized Framework for Feature Selection in Face Detection and Authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000264520400004"}
