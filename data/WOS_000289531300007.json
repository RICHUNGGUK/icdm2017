Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to optimize the investigated structures and to calculate the properties such as dipole moment, bond length, band gap, total energy, binding energy and quadrupole coupling constant. The results indicated that, due to the functionalization of CNT by T and U, the hybrids exhibit new properties in which they are similar in both types of CNT-T and CNT-U hybrids.", "paper_title": "Covalent hybridization of CNT by thymine and uracil: A computational study", "paper_id": "WOS:000289531300007"}
