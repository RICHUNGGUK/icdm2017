Discovering new association information related to drugs and ATC codes is still difficult for this topic. We propose a novel method named drug-domain hybrid (dD-Hybrid) incorporating drug-domain interaction network information into prediction models to predict drug's ATC codes. It is based on the assumption that drugs interacting with the same domain tend to share therapeutic effects. The results demonstrated dD-Hybrid has comparable performance to other methods on the gold standard dataset. Further, several new predicted drug-ATC pairs have been verified by experiments, which offer a novel way to utilize drugs for new purposes effectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
