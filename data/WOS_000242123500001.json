To reach this goal, a schema of intelligent applications is provided for each aspect as frame base structure, meaning the knowledge of intelligent applications in that specific aspect. Then, a semantic network is developed for intelligent manufacturing based on hierarchical structure of manufacturing systems to provide Meta knowledge of intelligent manufacturing applications. The analysis of semantic network indicates an increasing growth in application of soft computing in manufacturing aspects. Specially, fuzzy logic and its derivates have found more applications in recent years. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
