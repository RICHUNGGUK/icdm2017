While typical EEG artifacts are usually removed by trial rejection or by filtering, noise induced in the data by the Subject's failure to produce the required mental state is very harmful. Such \"noise\" effects are rather common. especially for naive Subjects in their training phase and, thus, standard artifact removal methods would inevitably fail. In this paper, we present a novel method which aims to detect such defected trials taking into account the intended task by use of Relevant Dimensionality Estimation (RDE). a new machine learning method for denoising in feature space In this manner. out method effectively \"cleans\" the training data and thus allows better BCI classification. Preliminary results conducted oil a data set of 43 naive subjects show a significant improvement for 74% of the subjects (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Improving BCI performance by task-related trial pruning", "paper_id": "WOS:000272073800011"}
