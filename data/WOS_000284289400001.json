We present a, method for such computing. We constructed an inference system using a non monotone neural network, which is a kind of recurrent neural network with continuous-time dynamics. This system deduces a conclusion according to state transitions of the network in which knowledge is embedded as trajectory attractors. It has the powerful ability of analogical reasoning without special treatment for exceptional knowledge. We also propose a method of linking different neurodynamical systems and show that two mutually interacting systems can process complex spatiotemporal patterns.", "paper_title": "Brain-like Computing Based on Distributed Representations and Neurodynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000284289400001"}
