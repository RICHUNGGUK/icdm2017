In this method, first, the model is classified into three meta-model levels: core level, basic level and application level. The core-level meta-model describes some core conceptions of enterprise modelling. The basic-level meta-model extends the core level on the base of the some current modelling methods to meet the generic needs of the application system. The application-level model can build the elements and their attributes extensions to meet the needs of the different systems according to extension mechanism. The model of each level and the extension mechanism are discussed in detail. Furthermore, a method is given to guarantee the consistency of the extended model. Also the modelling process of this method is specified. This method is flexible and can meet the various modelling demands. An application example is provided to confirm the validity and feasibility of this method.", "paper_title": "An enterprise modelling method based on an extension mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000269658700002"}
