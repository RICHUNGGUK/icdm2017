This paper provides a thorough study on SSP under the GMPLS-based recovery framework, where an effective survivable routing algorithm for SSP is proposed. The tradeoff between the price (i.e., cost representing the amount of resources, and the blocking probability), and the restoration time is extensively studied by simulations on three networks with highly dynamic traffic. We demonstrate that the proposed survivable routing algorithm can be a powerful solution for meeting stringent delay upper bounds for achieving high restorability of transport services. This can significantly improve the network reliability, and enable more advanced, mission critical services in the networks. The comparison among the three protection types further verifies that the proposed scheme can yield significant advantages over Shared Path Protection, and Shared Link Protection.", "paper_title": "A new shared segment protection method for survivable networks with guaranteed recovery time", "paper_id": "WOS:000258763700007"}
