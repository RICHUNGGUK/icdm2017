One of the most popular learning techniques, the Back-Propagation (BP) Artificial Neural Networks, can be used as a computer model to predict peptides binding to the Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). The major advantage of computational screening is that it reduces the number of wet-lab experiments that need to be performed, significantly reducing the cost and time. A recently developed method, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which has superior properties over BP has been investigated to accomplish such tasks. In our work, we found that the ELM is as good as, if not better than, the BP in term of time complexity, accuracy deviations across experiments, and most importantly - prevention from over-fitting for prediction of peptide binding to HLA.", "paper_title": "Extreme learning machine for predicting HLA-peptide binding", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300105"}
