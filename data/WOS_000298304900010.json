Locating the sensor nodes is a fundamental problem in developing applications for wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we introduce a distributed localization scheme, called the Rectangle Overlapping Approach (ROA), using a mobile beacon with GPS and a directional antenna. The node locations are computed by performing simple operations that rely on the rotation angle and position of the mobile beacon. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is very efficient and that the node positions can be determined accurately when the beacon follows a random waypoint movement model.", "paper_title": "Localization Using a Mobile Beacon with Directional Antenna for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304900010"}
