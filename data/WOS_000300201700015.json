G is said to be super edge connected (or super-lambda for short) if every minimum edge cut of G isolates one of the vertex of G. A graph G is called m-super-lambda if for any edge set S subset of E(G) with |S| <= m, G - S is still super-lambda. The maximum cardinality of m-super-lambda is called the edge fault tolerance of super edge connectivity of G. In this paper, we discuss the edge fault tolerance of super edge connectivity of three families of interconnection networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
