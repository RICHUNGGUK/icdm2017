An analytical model of trench excavation is constructed by applying linearly-distributed total earth pressure changes on the sidewalls and the base of the trench in a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic half-space. By applying the principle of superposition appropriately, an explicit solution to calculate ground surface settlements is derived by integrating Mindlin's displacement formulae. The validity of the solution is verified by three-dimensional finite-element analyses and case studies. Based on the results obtained from a parametric study using the newly derived solution, an algebraic formula is obtained as a first approximation for calculating ground surface settlements.
