To confront the issues of interoperability, scalability, and openness in heterogeneous e-health environments, a FIPA2000 standard compliant agent development platform-JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) was adopted for the design and implementation of the proposed intelligent multi-agent based MADIP system.
