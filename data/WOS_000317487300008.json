The model consists of multiple elementary cells, and every cell in the distributed model represents a single stacked inductor. The model also takes into account the distributed effect of the via-hole with feedline which is used to connect the test pad to the lowest mental layer. A parameter-extraction approach for proposed model which combines the analytical approach and empirical optimization procedure is investigated. Good agreement is obtained between simulated and measured results for a six metal layers on-chip inductor on silicon in the frequency range of 50 MHz to 20 GHz. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
