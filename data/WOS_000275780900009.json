Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) algorithms have been successfully applied for laser range finders. However, vision-based approaches present several problems with Occlusions, real-time operation, and environment modifications. In this article, an omnivision-based MCL algorithm that solves these drawbacks is presented. The algorithm works with a variable number of particles through the use of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). The measurement model is based on an omnidirectional camera with a fish-eye lens. This model uses a feature-based map of the environment and the feature extraction process makes it robust to Occlusions and changes in the environment. Moreover, the algorithm is scalable and works in real-time. Results on tracking, global localization and kidnapped robot problem show the excellent performance of the localization system in a real environment. In addition, experiments under severe and continuous occlusions reflect the ability of the algorithm to localize the robot in crowded environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
