In contrast to previous work that requires the user to decide where next to position a mobile camera, we actively compute and visualize during runtime a recommendation for the next sampling position and orientation taking into account the current camera pose and required camera alignments. This supports efficient capture of various types of large-field-of-view light fields in just a matter of minutes and without specialized camera equipment. To further reduce the overall capture time, we describe an extension of our guidance algorithm to collaborative light-field photography by small groups of users. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
