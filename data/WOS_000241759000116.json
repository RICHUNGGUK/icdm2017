In this paper, a mathematic model is formulated to solve the bottleneck capacity expansion problem of network with fuzzy demand. A linear program model with fuzzy coefficient is put forward. We present a decomposition algorithm to solve the model. The results show the decomposition algorithm can improve the solving speed greatly. So, we can minimize the expansion cost and provide evidence for the decision maker to make reasonable and effective decision.", "paper_title": "A study on decision model of bottleneck capacity expansion with fuzzy demand", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000116"}
