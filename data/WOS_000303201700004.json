The evolved Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (e-MBMS) feature is introduced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as a complement to the existing MBMS service in order to accommodate multicast groups that are interested in receiving the same data. MBMS service is provided by MBMS over a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and/or Point-To-Multipoint (PTM) transmission methods. One of the challenges of MBMS is the complete error recovery of the transmitted files, a matter of great importance since the distribution of binary data must result in 100% error-free download. To fulfill this tight requirement, Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanism has been proposed by 3GPP. In this work, we investigate the reliable multicasting by introducing a transmission method that combines the advantages of MBSFN and PTM transmission methods. We compare several FEC-based file recovery methods and evaluate them against various network parameters in a realistic simulation environment. The comparison is based on a cost-oriented analysis of MBMS service that takes into account the transmission cost over all the interfaces and nodes of the LTE architecture. The simulation results are performed with the aid of a new simulation tool and show that the performance of the file repair schemes depend on the network configuration.", "paper_title": "Cost optimization of MBSFN and PTM transmissions for reliable multicasting in LTE networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303201700004"}
