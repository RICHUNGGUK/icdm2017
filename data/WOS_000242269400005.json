Design/methodology/approach - A range of published works relevant to dc-ac-dc converters and their control methods based on PWM technique are evaluated and their limitations in converter output voltage control are indicated in the first section of this paper. The Simulink model and different stages of the converter are described in the second section. In Section 3, the general mathematical model of the system is derived and the phase-shift PWM switching technique is explained. The equivalent circuit of the high-voltage high-frequency transformer used in the converter and the effects of the transformer parameters on the converter operation are presented in Section 4. In Section 5, fuzzy logic control and the basic concepts of this method are described and its application to the proposed converter output voltage control is explained. In Section 6, the Simulink simulation results of the fuzzy logic control application are given for different operating conditions. In Section 7, an overview of the hardware used in this study is presented and the experimental results are given to show the performance of the controller. Finally, Section 8 gives the conclusions of the study. Findings - The fuzzy logic control which is a suitable method for nonlinear systems such as the converter proposed in this paper, is successfully applied for output voltage control of the converter. The controller performance is satisfied. The phase-shift angle of the converter is used as the control parameter. The paper also presents how the parasitic parameters of the transformer used in high-voltage applications can be used as the circuit resonant elements. Research limitations/implications - In preparing this paper, the resources books and periodic journals existing in our university library and also the English resources relative to dc-ac-dc converters reachable through the internet were researched. Practical implications - The suggested control method can be used in the control of linear and nonlinear systems. The study carried out in this paper is also a very good approach to be used in high-voltage high-frequency converters output voltage control. Originality/value - Since, the control approach proposed in this paper does not require the information on converter and transformer parameters that affect the converter output voltage, so it can effectively be used in applications where there are parameter variation problems. The design of the transformer for the required load, finding an optimum operating frequency for the converter, and using the transformer parameters as resonant elements of the circuit to decrease the switching losses are the other contributions of this paper.", "paper_title": "DSP microcontroller-based fuzzy control of a DC/DC parallel resonant converter using phase-shift PWM technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000242269400005"}
