We demonstrate here that the state space equidistant repartition of these attractors is on an arbitrarily precise zone of a paraboloid or plane. We determine the state space domains where the attractors are generated from different initial conditions. A mathematical formula giving their maximal number in function of the controller piecewise-constant values is then deduced. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
