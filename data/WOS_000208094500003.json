G is said to be k-resonant if, for 1 <= t <= k, any t disjoint hexagons of G are mutually resonant, that is, there is a Kekule structure (or perfect matching) K of G such that each of the k hexagons is an K-alternating hexagon. A connected graph G is said to be k-cycle resonant if, for 1 <= t <= k, any t disjoint cycles in G are mutually resonant. The concept of k-resonant graphs is closely related to Clar's aromatic sextet theory, and the concept of k-cycle resonant graphs is a natural generalization of k-resonant graphs. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for a benzenoid system or a tubule or a toroidal polyhex (resp. a graph) to be k-resonant (resp. k-cycle resonant) have been established. In this paper, we will give a survey on investigations of k-resonant benzenoid systems, k-resonant tubules, k-resonant toroidal polyhexes, and k-cycle resonant graphs.", "paper_title": "k-Resonance in Benzenoid Systems, Open-ended Carbon Nanotubes, Toroidal Polyhexes; and k-Cycle Resonant Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000208094500003"}
