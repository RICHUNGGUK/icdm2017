Based on the analysis of initial alignment method of SINS, the nonlinear model for two-position attitude calculation is derived, and the two-position method is used to eliminate the constant error of inertial devices, while the errors of the inertial devices are not needed to be expanded to be states, and the amount of computation is reduced under the premise of ensuring the alignment accuracy of UKF. Furthermore, according to the characteristics of nonlinear model of two-position attitude algorithm, the UKF filter using hybrid model is designed to reduce the amount of initial alignment computation. Simulation results show that, within the nonlinear model of two-position attitude calculation, the heading angle is directly observable, and tins system can improve the accuracy and speed of heading angle alignment, which satisfies the real-time requirements of UKF filter for the initial alignment of SINS.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED ARITHMETIC OF TWO-POSITION FAST INITIAL ALIGNMENT FOR SINS USING UNSCENTED KALMAN FILTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000302664400036"}
