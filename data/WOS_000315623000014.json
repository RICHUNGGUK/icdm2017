It is especially useful for newly sequenced genomes that have not been well annotated. We applied gKaKs to estimate the genome-wide substitution rates in five pairs of closely related species. The average Ka and Ks computed by gKaKs were consistent with previous studies. We also compared the Ka, Ks and Ka/Ks of mouse and rat orthologous protein-coding genes estimated by gKaKs and based on the alignments generated by PAL2NAL. Results from two methods are compatible.", "paper_title": "gKaKs: the pipeline for genome-level Ka/Ks calculation", "paper_id": "WOS:000315623000014"}
