Although each dispersed phase has its own velocity field, the present implementation considers only the interfacial momentum exchange between the continuous and the dispersed phases. The multiphase flow formulation was described and the details of the PBE-CFD coupling algorithms in OpenFOAM were provided. The implementation of the multiphase flow code was verified and evaluated against the original OpenFOAM two-phase flow solver for flow through a 2D backward facing step, using simplified breakage and aggregation kernels. The computational cost of both codes were compared for serial and parallel simulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
