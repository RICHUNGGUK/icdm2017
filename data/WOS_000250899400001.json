Under the broadcast document dissemination strategy, a web document source periodically broadcasts (portions of) its documents to a potentially large community of users, without the need for explicit requests. By secure broadcasting, we mean that the delivery of information to users must obey the access control policies of the document source. Traditional access control mechanisms that have been adapted for XML documents, however, do not address the performance issues inherent in access control. In this paper, a labeling scheme is proposed to support rapid reconstruction of XML documents in the context of a well-known method, called XML pool encryption. The proposed labeling scheme supports the speedy inference of structure information in all portions of the document. The binary representation of the proposed labeling scheme is also investigated. In the experimental results, the proposed labeling scheme is efficient in searching for the location of decrypted information. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
