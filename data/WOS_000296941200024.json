The proposed method is very suitable for the bimodal biometrics systems with two similar biometrics traits such as the system with visible light and infrared face images and the system with palm images captured at two bands. The proposed method first runs for the first and biometrics traits, respectively. For each of these two biometrics traits, the proposed method calculates the matching scores between the testing sample and each training sample. The matching scores generated from the first and second traits are referred to as the first and second matching scores, respectively. Second, the proposed method calculates the crossing matching scores, i.e. the matching scores between the testing sample of the second biometrics trait and the training samples of the first biometrics trait. Finally, we use a weighted fusion scheme to combine the first, second and crossing matching scores for personal authentication. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
