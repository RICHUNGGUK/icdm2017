We investigate the termination detection problem in an asynchronous distributed system under the crash-recovery model. It has been shown that the problem is impossible to solve under the crash-recovery model in general. We identify two conditions under which the termination detection problem can be solved in a safe manner. We also propose algorithms to detect termination under the conditions identified.
