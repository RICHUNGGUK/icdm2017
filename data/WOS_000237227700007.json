The proposed modified throttling algorithm may speed up detecting worm spread and lower the possibility of false alarm to burst innocent connection requests. Based on an observation that normal connection requests passing through a network has a strong locality in destination IP addresses, the proposed algorithm counts the number of connection requests with different destinations, in contrast to simple length of delay queue as in the typical throttling algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithm utilizes the trend value of weighted average queue length for reducing worm detection time. The performance is empirically verified in various aspects.", "paper_title": "Tackling worm detection speed and false alarm in virus throttling", "paper_id": "WOS:000237227700007"}
