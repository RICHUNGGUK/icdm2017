The algorithm calculates the Jacobian after every two computations of the step. It preserves the global convergence as the traditional trust region algorithms. Moreover, it converges nearly q-cubically under the local error bound condition, which is weaker than the nonsingularity of the Jacobian at a solution. Numerical results show that the algorithm is very efficient for both singular problems and nonsingular problems.", "paper_title": "On the modified trust region algorithm for nonlinear equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000356936400004"}
