We consider here the practical efficiency of these approaches by defining five classes of variable orders more and more dynamic which guarantee time complexity bounds from O(exp(w+1)) to O(exp(2(w+k))), with w the \"tree-width\" of a CSP and k a constant. Finally, we assess practically their relevance.", "paper_title": "An extension of complexity bounds and dynamic heuristics for tree-decompositions of CSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400061"}
