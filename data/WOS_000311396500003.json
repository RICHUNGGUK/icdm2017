With multimodel, we mean the simultaneous usage of more than one quality approach (e.g. standards, methods, techniques to improve software processes). This paper discusses first the current problems regarding the use of multiple software quality approaches. Subsequently, multimodel initiatives are categorized into three different groups, respectively: quality approach harmonization, quality approach integration, and quality approach mapping. Based on an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of current multimodel initiatives in these three classes, we derive a set of criteria, which can provide a basis for multimodel software process improvement solutions.
