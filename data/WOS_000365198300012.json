Ideally, the benefits that are offered by cloud computing technology can accommodate the rapidly increased demands of the organizations and individual customers. However, the usage of cloud computing has potential security concerns. The proposed research will put forward an approach for investigating the cost of security in cloud computing. The proposed method is based on a multi-level security model, which uses the distribution of partitioned workflows upon hybrid clouds. Furthermore, the PEPA Eclipse plug-in tool will be used to create a cost model that uses the valid deployment choices that generated by the multi-level security model. The outcomes that can be obtained by means of implementing this research will used to describe the evaluation of the performance. Thus, predictions of the performance can be derived as well as the potential cost of deployment under different options and scenarios.", "paper_title": "A Case Study in Inspecting the Cost of Security in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000365198300012"}
