The newly proposed spatial chromatic tessellation (SCT) provides a novel model to explore this relationship. SCT has demonstrated a variety of potential applications in GIS, such as reasoning spatial topology, point pattern analysis, and Voronoi diagrams. This study aims to theoretically investigate SCT by focusing on two aspects: (1) extending SCT to higher dimensional spaces. Results show that cells missing in lower dimensional spaces are hidden in higher dimensional spaces; (2) exploring the uniqueness of chromatic codes, particularly the chromatic codes of 2-cell and 3-cell clusters: their codes are proved to be unique. In a mathematical perspective, the observed phenomena from the above two aspects bring some new thoughts into the first law of geography and spatial heterogeneity. Based on these new understandings of entity-space relationship, SCT is replaced by spatial chromatic model (SCM) in which spaces are created by entities themselves rather than by partitioning the space preexisted. This makes a change from an absolute geographic space to a relative geographic space.", "paper_title": "Spatial chromatic model in high-dimensional spaces and the uniqueness of chromatic code: a new perspective of geographic entity-space relationship", "paper_id": "WOS:000350367900002"}
