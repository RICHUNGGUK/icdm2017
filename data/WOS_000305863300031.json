The FTC approach is based on two steps, fault detection and isolation (FDI) and fault accommodation. The fault detection is performed by a model-based approach using fuzzy modeling and fault isolation uses a fuzzy decision making approach. The information obtained on the FDI step is used to select the model to be used in fault accommodation, in a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. The fault accommodation is performed with one fuzzy model for each identified fault. The FTC scheme is used to accommodate the faults of two systems a container gantry crane and three tank benchmark system. The fuzzy FTC scheme proposed in this paper was able to detect, isolate and accommodate correctly the considered faults of both systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
