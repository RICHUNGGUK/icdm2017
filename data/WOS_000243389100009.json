We show that the analysis of the results of a clustering engine can significantly take advantage of enhanced graph drawing and visualization techniques. We propose a graph-based user interface for Web clustering engines that makes it possible for the user to explore and visualize the different semantic categories and their relationships at the desired level of detail.", "paper_title": "Graph visualization techniques for web clustering engines", "paper_id": "WOS:000243389100009"}
