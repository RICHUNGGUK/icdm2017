It is known that these identities imply a Kleene type theorem. Some computationally important semirings, such as N or N(rat) <<Sigma*>> of rational power series of words on Sigma with coefficients in N, cannot have a total star operation satisfying the Conway identities. We introduce here partial Conway semirings, which are semirings S which have a star operation defined only on an ideal of S; when the arguments are appropriate, the operation satisfies the above identities. We develop the general theory of partial Conway semirings and prove a Kleene theorem for this generalization.", "paper_title": "Partial Conway and Iteration Semirings", "paper_id": "WOS:000262367100002"}
