Performance of the service-oriented systems highly depends on the remote Web services as well as the unpredictability of the Internet. Performance prediction of service-oriented systems is critical for automatically selecting the optimal Web service composition. Since the performance of Web services is highly related to the service status and network environments which are variable over time, it is an important task to predict the performance of service-oriented systems at run-time. To address this critical challenge, this paper proposes an online performance prediction framework, called OPred, to provide personalized service-oriented system performance prediction efficiently. Based on the past usage experience from different users, OPred builds feature models and employs time series analysis techniques on feature trends to make performance prediction. The results of large-scale real-world experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of OPred.", "paper_title": "An Online Performance Prediction Framework for Service-Oriented Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342278600004"}
