However, moving from one access network to another gives rise to a Break-Before-Make handover process that incurs packet losses and service disruption for the Mobile Node (MN) in the basic PMIPv6. Mobility Support combined with multihoming is the missing piece in basic PMIPv6. This motivated us to design and analyze the PMIPv6 multihoming based Make-Before-Break handover mechanism and implement it in a real network test-bed. From the experimental results, we show that our approach completely mitigates the consequences of handover latency and packet losses when applied to the basic PMIPv6 protocol.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of PMIPv6 Based Multihoming for Make-Before-Break Handover", "paper_id": "WOS:000274703600002"}
