The proposed work has been used to analyze the personalized similarities between learner's profile preferences collaboratively. The proposed work consists of two hybridizations: the first hybridization has been made with content-based filtering and collaborative features to overcome the new-learners zero-rated profile recommendations issue; the second hybridization has been done with collaborative filtering and k-neighborhood scheme features to improve the average-learner's low-rated profile recommendations issue. Therefore, the proposed goal-based hybrid filtering approach that hybridized content-based filtering, collaborative filtering and k-neighborhood features simultaneously works on both types of learner's profiles recommendation issues in e-learning environments. The experiments in the proposed work are done using the famous \"MovieLens\" dataset, while the evaluation of experimental results has been performed with mean of precision 83.44% and mean of recall 85.22%, respectively. t-test result shows the probability difference value of 0.29 between the proposed hybrid approach and the evaluated literature work. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid recommender systems in e-learning scenarios.", "paper_title": "E-Learning Recommender Systems Based on Goal-Based Hybrid Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000339212000001"}
