Drawing on the information systems success model and flow theory, this research identified the factors affecting continuance intention of mobile payment. We conducted data analysis with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that service quality is the main factor affecting trust whereas system quality is the main factor affecting satisfaction. Information quality and service quality affect flow. Trust, flow and satisfaction determine continuance intention of mobile payment The results imply that service providers need to offer quality system, information and services in order to facilitate users' continuance usage of mobile payment (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
