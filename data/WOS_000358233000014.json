However, it could incur a tremendous cost. Meanwhile, most viewers terminate viewing sessions within 20% of their durations; only a small fraction of each video is consumed. Built upon this user viewing pattern, we propose a Partial Transcoding Scheme for content management in media clouds. Particularly, each content is encoded into different bitrates and split into segments. Some of the segments are stored in cache, resulting in storage cost; others are transcoded online in the case of cache miss, resulting in computing cost. We aim to minimize the long-term overall cost by determining whether a segment should be cached or transcoded online. We formulate it as a constrained stochastic optimization problem. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization framework and Lagrangian relaxation, we design an online algorithm which can achieve the optimal solution within provable upper bounds. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can reduce 30% of operational cost, compared with the scheme of caching all the segments.", "paper_title": "Towards Cost-Efficient Video Transcoding in Media Cloud: Insights Learned From User Viewing Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000358233000014"}
