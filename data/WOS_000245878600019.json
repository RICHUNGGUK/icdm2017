Both plants and transshipment points are capacitated. Scatter search is a population-based heuristic that has been applied to several combinatorial optimization problems. We develop an efficient scatter search-based heuristic approach with hybrid improvements including local search and path-relinking routines. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the heuristic even for realistic problems with larger instances and tighter capacities. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
