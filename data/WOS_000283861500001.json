An imprecise terrain is given by a triangulated point set where the height component of the vertices is specified by an interval of possible values. We restrict ourselves to terrains with a one-dimensional projection, usually referred to as 1.5-dimensional terrains, where an imprecise terrain is given by an x-monotone polyline, and the y-coordinate of each vertex is not fixed but only constrained to a given interval. Motivated mainly by applications in terrain analysis, in this paper we study five different optimization measures related to obtaining smooth terrains, for the 1.5-dimensional case. In particular, we present exact algorithms to minimize and maximize the total turning angle, as well as to minimize the maximum slope change. Furthermore, we also give approximation algorithms to minimize the largest turning angle and to maximize the smallest turning angle.", "paper_title": "SMOOTHING IMPRECISE 1.5D TERRAINS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283861500001"}
