To mitigate these attacks, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are deployed in order to both control HTTP data streams and detect malicious contents. Nevertheless, attackers can bypass WAFs by using sophisticated SQL injection evasion techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel Web Application Firewalls architecture that aims to improve the internal security rules management process and detect complex SQL injection codes. Our model is a Hybrid Injection Prevention System (HIPS) which combines both a machine learning classifier and a pattern matching inspection engine. Based on reduced sets of security rules and a Multi-nomial Bayesian classifier, our Web Application Firewall can predict legitimate contents and exclude them from the heavy inspection process, and consequently improve the WAF's overall performances.", "paper_title": "Toward a Novel Web Application Firewalls Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000373692400002"}
