The induced logical equivalence is hereditary history-preserving bisimilarity, and fragments of the logic can be identified which correspond to other true concurrent behavioural equivalences in the literature: step, pomset and history-preserving bisimilarity. Standard Hennessy-Milner logic, and thus (interleaving) bisimilarity, is also recovered as a fragment. We also propose an extension of the logic with fix-point operators, thus allowing to describe causal and concun-ency properties of infinite computations. This work contributes to a rational presentation of the true concurrent spectrum and to a deeper understanding of the relations between the involved behavioural equivalences.", "paper_title": "A Logic for True Concurrency", "paper_id": "WOS:000340342000005"}
