The research presented in this paper incrementally builds on TAM-based research to gain meaningful insights into the potential differences individuals' exhibit in three types of diffusion outcomes in a post-acceptance context. The authors model and test the effects of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use on intentions to use, intentions to explore, and trying to innovate - IT diffusion outcomes proposed as vital in a post-acceptance context. In addition to TAM predictive variables, the authors investigate how autonomy, a personal control factor, and subjective norms, a social factor, influence individuals' intentions toward and behaviors associated with technology use. The findings suggest cognitive intention outcomes are more likely to be influenced by technology-related factors, while behavioral outcomes are more likely to be influenced by social and personal control factors in post-acceptance contexts. Implications of the study for practice and future research are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Post-Acceptance Intentions and Behaviors: An Empirical Investigation of Information Technology Use and Innovation", "paper_id": "WOS:000208914200001"}
