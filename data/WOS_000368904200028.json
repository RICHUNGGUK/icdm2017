However, this also causes some loss of detail. Yet, when an image is captured without the OLPF, moire generally appears in the high spatial frequency region of the image. Accordingly, this paper presents a moire reduction method that allows omission of the OLPF. Since most digital still cameras use a CCD or a CMOS with a Bayer pattern, moire patterns and color artifacts are simultaneously induced by aliasing at high spatial frequencies. Therefore, in this study, moire reduction is performed in both the luminance channel to remove the moire patterns and the color channel to reduce color smearing. To detect the moire patterns, the spatial frequency response (SFR) of the camera is first analyzed. The moire regions are identified using patterns related to the SFR of the camera and then analyzed in the frequency domain. The moire patterns are reduced by removing their frequency components, represented by the inflection point between the high-frequency and DC components in the moire region. To reduce the color smearing, color changing regions are detected using the color variation ratios for the RGB channels and then corrected by multiplying with the average surrounding colors. Experiments confirm that the proposed method is able to reduce the moire in both the luminance and color channels, while also preserving the detail.", "paper_title": "Moire Reduction Using Inflection Point and Color Variation in Digital Camera of No Optical Low Pass Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000368904200028"}
