Many scenarios exist where the required second-order signal and noise statistics are not known in which the decorrelation is difficult or expensive to calculate. An asymptotically optimal estimation scheme proposed here uses a 2-D discrete wavelet transform to approximately decorrelate the signal in space and the discrete Fourier transform to decorrelate between channels. The coefficient weighting is replaced with a wavelet-domain thresholding operation to result in an efficient estimation scheme for both stationary and nonstationary signals. in contrast to optimal estimation, this new scheme does not require second-order signal statistics, making it well suited to many applications. In addition to providing vastly improved visual quality, the new estimator typically yields signal-to-noise ratio gains 12 dB or higher for hyperspectral imagery and functional magnetic resonance images.", "paper_title": "Asymptotically optimal blind estimation of multichannel images", "paper_id": "WOS:000236287400016"}
