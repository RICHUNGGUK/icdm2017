A Maple package is developed for periodically oscillating systems of center and limit cycle types, which delivers accurate approximations of frequency, mean of motion and amplitude of oscillation automatically. Since HAM is valid for highly nonlinear problems, the package can be used to find accurate approximate solutions of nonlinear oscillation systems with strong nonlinearity. For systems with physical parameters, it can provide possible constraint conditions on parameters. Several examples are given to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the algorithm and the Maple package. This package is freely available online, which provides an easy-to-use tool for scientist and engineer to solve accurate approximations of periodic oscillations of dynamic systems with high nonlinearity.
