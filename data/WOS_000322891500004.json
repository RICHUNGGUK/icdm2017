Existing research recognise the emotions using a range of classification techniques. However, low accuracy rate, large training set, large extracted features or priority for sequence images are the main drawbacks of those works. One of the recent techniques to address the facial expressions problem is fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS) which is used as a successful method to model and solve the natural-based problems. However, FRBS is poor to adapt the existing knowledge with the diverse conditions. In this article a novel hybrid genetic-fuzzy rule-based model is proposed to optimise the performance of fuzzy classification while the limited raw input data as the features are used. In this model, the proposed genetic algorithm simulates the honey bees offspring generation process called bee royalty offspring algorithm (BROA) to improve the training process of classic genetic algorithm. The comparison results illustrated that the genetic-fuzzy classification model improves considerably the accuracy rate and performance of FRBS while the BROA modify the training process of genetic-based algorithms.", "paper_title": "Bee royalty offspring algorithm for improvement of facial expressions classification model", "paper_id": "WOS:000322891500004"}
