One reason for this is the lack of suitable lexical resources. Indeed, in order to support such tasks, various types of such resources need to be collected or acquired (i.e., morphological, orthographic, synonymous). Methods: We propose a novel method for the acquisition of synonymy resources. This method is language-independent and relies on existence of structured terminologies. It enables to decipher hidden synonymy relations between simple words and terms on the basis of their syntactic analysis and exploitation of their compositionality. Results: Applied to series of synonym terms from the French subset of the UMLS, the method shows 99% precision. The overlap between thus inferred terms and the existing sparse resources of synonyms is very low. In order to better integrate these resources in an EHR search system, we analyzed a sample of clinical queries submitted by healthcare professionals. Conclusions: Observation of clinical queries shows that they make a very little use of the query expansion function, and, whenever they do, synonymy relations are rarely involved.", "paper_title": "Automatic Acquisition of Synonym Resources and Assessment of their Impact on the Enhanced Search in EHRs", "paper_id": "WOS:000264704200009"}
