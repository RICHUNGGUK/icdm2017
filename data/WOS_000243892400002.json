Three QoS criteria are considered, namely payment, deadline and reliability, which are formulated as utility function. The optimisation problem is split into two parts: task optimisation performed on behalf of the user and resource optimisation performed on behalf of the grid. The strategy employs three types of agents: task agents responsible for task optimisation, computation resource and network resource agents responsible for resource optimisation. The agents apply economic models for optimisation purposes. Dynamic programming is used to optimise the total system utility function in terms of an iterative algorithm. The objective of multi-criteria scheduling is to maximise the global utility of the system. This paper proposes an iterative scheduling algorithm that is used to perform QoS optimisation-based multi-criteria scheduling. The proposed QoS optimisation-based multi-criteria scheduling problem solution has been practically examined by simulation experiments. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
