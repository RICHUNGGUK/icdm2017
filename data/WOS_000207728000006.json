Terms one user employs to describe an instance of a file may not be those that are commonly associated with the file, making this instance difficult to locate. To alleviate this problem, a server can ask its peers for help in improving the description of files they have in common. We consider the design of a fully distributed, automatic system for the exchange of descriptive metadata. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques are effective in improving search accuracy with reasonable cost.", "paper_title": "Distributed, automatic file descriptor tuning in P2P file-sharing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000207728000006"}
