A method to evaluate electromagnetic loop circuit opening schemes by combining analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is presented in the paper. The AHP are used to establish a hierarchical model and to rank the influencing factors. Five performance indices and corresponding membership functions are presented to denote their contributions on overall objective. After detailed analyses and calculations for each electromagnetic loop circuit opening scheme, quantitative evaluation results that considering various factors comprehensively are obtained by two-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. A decision supporting software is developed and tested on a practical power system. The simulation results show its validity and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Decision support for choosing optimal electromagnetic loop circuit opening scheme based on analytic hierarchy process and multi-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000272371700001"}
