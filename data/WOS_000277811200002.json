Results from a prior study (Farouki et al., 2009a) concerned with tensor-product patches are adapted to identify constraints on the given curves for the existence of such geodesicbounded triangular surface patches. For curves satisfying these conditions, the patch is constructed by means of a cubically-blended triangular Coons interpolation scheme. A formulation of thin-plate spline energy in terms of barycentric coordinates with respect to a general domain triangle is also derived, and used to optimize the smoothness of the geodesic-bounded triangular surface patches.
