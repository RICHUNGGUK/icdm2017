This study proposes an optimization algorithm for cutting stock problems of the TFT-LCD industry. The proposed algorithm minimizes the number of glass substrates required to satisfy the orders, therefore reducing the production costs. Additionally, the solution of the proposed algorithm is a global optimum which is different from a local optimum or a feasible solution that is found by the heuristic algorithm. Numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
