CPR images, created via a transformation from image-based to spine-based coordinate system, follow the structural shape of the spine and allow the whole course of the curved structure to be viewed in a single image. The spine-based coordinate system is defined on the 3D spine curve and on the axial vertebral rotation, both described by polynomial models. The 3D spine curve passes through the centers of vertebral bodies, and the axial vertebral rotation determines the rotation of vertebral spinous processes around the spine. The optimal polynomial parameters are found in an optimization framework, based on image analysis. The method was evaluated on 19 MR images of the spine from 10 patients.", "paper_title": "Generation of curved planar reformations from magnetic resonance images of the spine", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700017"}
