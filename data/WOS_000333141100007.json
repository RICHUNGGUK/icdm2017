A novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is introduced with the idea of delay-partitioning, and a new exponential stability criterion is derived based on the new functional and free-weighting matrix method. This new criterion proves to be less conservative than the most existing results. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "NEW RESULTS ON STABILITY OF STOCHASTIC NEURAL NETWORKS WITH MARKOVIAN SWITCHING AND MODE-DEPENDENT TIME-VARYING DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000333141100007"}
