In this paper, we introduce a new shrinking projection method for the approximation of fixed points of a family of pseudocontractive mappings in a Hilbert space. Using this method, we also deal with the problem of finding a common zero of a family of monotone operators and obtain a strong convergence theorem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
