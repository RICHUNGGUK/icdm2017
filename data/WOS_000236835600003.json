This paper introduces a new framework for modeling quantifiers in natural languages in which each linguistic quantifier is represented by a family of fuzzy measures, and the truth value of a quantified proposition is evaluated by using Sugeno's integral. This framework allows us to have some elegant logical properties of linguistic quantifiers. We compare carefully Our new model of quantification and other approaches to linguistic quantifiers. A set of criteria for linguistic quantification was proposed in the previous literature. The relationship between these criteria and the results obtained in the present paper is clarified. Some simple applications of the Sugeno's integral semantics of quantifiers are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
