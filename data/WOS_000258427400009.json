Computer used to be a tool and its development had been mainly emphasized on the speed of information processing. However, by understanding not only semantic information but also ambiguous information such as emotion, computer can be a versatile partner for human that can detect emotional state of a person and can response appropriately the emotion. As a primary study of text-based emotion estimation by computer we focused on statistically analyzing the relationship between word emotion and sentence emotion based on the originally created emotion tagged corpus then propose two emotion estimation methods according to the obtained statistic features. The proposed methods are evaluated using a prototype system.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of emotion estimation methods based on statistic features of emotion tagged corpus", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400009"}
