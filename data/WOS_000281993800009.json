Using these structural members in complex structures such as aircrafts, turbine blades and space vehicles, exact static and dynamic analyses of these members become more significant. Based on structural/mechanical principles, the purpose of this paper is to present a new method to evaluate exact structural matrices for nonprismatic Euler-Bernoulli beam elements. Design/methodology/approach - Through introducing the concept of basic displacement functions (BDFs), it is shown that exact shape functions are derived in terms of BDFs. BDFs and their derivatives have structural interpretations; therefore, they are obtained via application of flexibility method. Unlike the conventional methods, which are almost always categorized as displacement-based methods, the flexibility basis of the method ensures the true satisfaction of equilibrium equations at any interior point of the element. Findings - The exact shape functions and consequently structural matrices are derived for general nonprismatic beam elements. Numerical examples are carried out to determine static deflection and natural frequencies, and the results are highly competent with the other methods in literature. Research limitations/implications - The method can be extended to structural analysis of curved beams, plates and shells as well. Moreover, it is possible to derive exact dynamic shape functions via BDFs by solving the governing equation for transverse vibration of beams. Theoretically, the method faces limitation in analysis of nonprismatic beams that converge to a point where cross-sectional area and moment of inertia are equal to zero. Practical implications - The development of this idea, i.e. BDFs seems to lead to promotive novel approaches for structural analysis and could be a breaking point for developing new elements for plates and shells as it was shown for beam elements. Originality/value - The paper's introduction of special functions, namely BDFs and their application in both static and dynamic analyses of structures, could be a breaking point in analysis procedures.", "paper_title": "Basic displacement functions in analysis of nonprismatic beams", "paper_id": "WOS:000281993800009"}
