The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the extent to which young people who play games engage in related IT practices, such as creating and sharing content or creating fan sites. Additional goals were to identify differences in such practices according to grade level, gender, and access to IT-related resources in the home, as well as to explore relationships between engagement in game-related practices and perceived proficiency in general computer-related skills.
