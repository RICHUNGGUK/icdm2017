They include a novel and simple empirical formulation for total head loss caused by bridges which covers all flow regimes: free water surface, partially submerged flow, and fully submerged flow. The performances of the different representations of bridges are assessed using experimental results of steady and unsteady flows, presented for the first time in this work. A case study of a real flood is presented giving insight into the application of the representation techniques to real engineering problems. The proposed solution of a head loss representation together with the novel formulation is shown to be accurate for both steady and unsteady flows, and to perform efficiently for solving the flood case.
