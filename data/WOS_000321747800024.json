ChemMapper collects >350 000 chemical structures with bioactivities and associated target annotations ( as well as >3 000 000 non-annotated compounds for virtual screening). Taking the user-provided chemical structure as the query, the top most similar compounds in terms of 3D similarity are returned with associated pharmacology annotations. ChemMapper is designed to provide versatile services in a variety of chemogenomics, drug repurposing, polypharmacology, novel bioactive compounds identification and scaffold hopping studies.", "paper_title": "ChemMapper: a versatile web server for exploring pharmacology and chemical structure association based on molecular 3D similarity method", "paper_id": "WOS:000321747800024"}
