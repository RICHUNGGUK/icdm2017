Hence, an effective algorithm for classification of tea leaves will be important for automatic tea processing. However, most of tea classification researches were focused on gross tea, instead of fresh tea leaves. In this paper, a texture extraction method combing a non-overlap window local binary pattern (LBP) and Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) has been proposed for green tea leaves classification. By taking advantages of both LBP and GLCM for texture extraction, this method is able to effectively extract texture of tea leaves for classification at low computational cost to meet automatic tea production line requirements. The experiments have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
