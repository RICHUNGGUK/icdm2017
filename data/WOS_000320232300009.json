The most diffused approach uses three or more not aligned markers, attached to each instrument and surveyed by a set of cameras. However, the structure required to carry the markers does modify the instrument's mass distribution and can interfere with surgeon movements. To overcome these problems, we propose here a new methodology, based on structured markers, to compute the six degrees of freedom of a surgical instrument. Two markers are attached on the instrument axis and one of them has a stripe painted over its surface. We also introduce a procedure to compute with high accuracy the markers center on the cameras image, even when partially occluded by the instrument's axis or by other structures. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the proposed approach. The introduction of structured passive markers can open new possibilities to accurate tracking, combining markers detection with real-time image processing.", "paper_title": "Compact tracking of surgical instruments through structured markers", "paper_id": "WOS:000320232300009"}
