An interactive method is designed for solving the multi-objective TPD problem where the fuzzy data are represented by modified S-curve membership functions. The proposed method attempts to simultaneously minimize the total production and transportation costs and the total delivery time with reference to budget constraints and available supply, machine capacities at each source, as well as forecast demand and warehouse space constraints at each destination. An interactive fuzzy approach is applied to solve the multi-objective TPD problem and to find a preferred compromise solution. Finally, the performance of S-curve membership functions that represent uncertainty goals and constraints in TPD problems with linear membership functions in an industrial case is compared.
