Previous stability conditions are relaxed by further exploring the properties of the time derivatives of normalized fuzzy weighting functions and by introducing more slack matrix variables. By relying on analysis of the positive and negative characteristics of the time derivatives of normalized fuzzy weighting functions, some redundant terms are removed from the problem formulation. Furthermore, more slack matrix variables are introduced to enlarge the design space. Consequently, less conservative stability conditions are obtained. Finally, a well-known numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed result. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
