However, botnets of all kinds continue to plague the Internet, as many ISPs and organizations do not deploy these techniques. We aim to mitigate this state by creating a very low-cost method of detecting infected hot host. Our approach is to leverage the botnet detection work carried out by some organizations to easily locate collaborating bats elsewhere. We created BotMosaic as a countermeasure to IRC-based botnets. BotMosaic relies on captured bot instances controlled by a watermarker, who inserts a particular pattern into their network traffic. This pattern can then be detected at a very low cost by client organizations and the watermark can be tuned to provide acceptable false-positive rates. A novel feature of the watermark is that it is inserted collaboratively into the flows of multiple captured hots at once, in order to ensure the signal is strong enough to be detected. BotMosaic can also be used to detect stepping stones and to help trace back to the botmaster. It is content agnostic and can operate on encrypted traffic. We evaluate BotMosaic using simulations and a testbed deployment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
