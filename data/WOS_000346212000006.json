TWDM-PON was selected as the best candidate for NG-PON2 solution because of its ability to support the NG-PON2 requirements, such as enhanced bandwidth capacity, 40 Gb/s, and coexistence with previously existing generations without any change to optical distribution network (ODN). This paper reviewed the recent progress carried out on a TWDM-PON system configuration, with emphasis on tunable transmitter and receiver optical network unit (ONU) in terms of the amount of tuning range reported in exploiting the wavelength plan provided with cost efficiency. The speed of data rate transmitted on the downstream and upstream links between optical line terminal (OLT) and ONU with the way of stacking approach in NG-PON2 is reviewed. In addition, the power system budget is reviewed to determine the number of users allocated with the system with each transmission allowed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
