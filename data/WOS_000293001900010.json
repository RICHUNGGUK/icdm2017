Similar conditions are often encountered in requirements engineering. In this paper, we introduce the PriS approach, a security and privacy requirements engineering framework which aims at incorporating privacy requirements early in the system development process. Specifically, PriS provides a set of concepts for modelling privacy requirements in the organisation domain and a systematic way-of-working for translating these requirements into system models. The conceptual model of PriS uses a goal hierarchy structure. Every privacy requirement is either applied or not on every goal. To this end every privacy requirement is a variable that can take two values [0,1] on every goal meaning that the requirements constraints the goal (value 1) or not (value 0). Following this way of working PriS ends up suggesting a number of implementation techniques based on the privacy requirements constraining the respective goals. Taking into account that the mapping of privacy variables to a crisp set consisting of two values [0,1] is constraining, we extend also the PriS framework so as to be able to address the degree of participation of every privacy requirement towards achieving the generic goal of privacy. Therefore, we propose a fuzzification of privacy variables that maps the expression of the degree of participation of each privacy variable to the [0,1] interval. We also present a mathematical framework that allows the concurrent management of combined independent preferences towards the necessity of a privacy measure; among the advantages of the presented extended framework is the scalability of the approach in such a way that the results are not limited by the number of independent opinions or by the number of factors considered while reasoning for a specific selection of privacy measures.
