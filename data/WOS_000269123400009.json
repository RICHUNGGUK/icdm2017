This paper proposes a modular synthesis method to realize a reversible BCD-full adder (BCD-FA) and subtractor circuit. We propose three approaches to design and optimize all parts of a BCD-FA circuit using genetic algorithm and don't care concept. Our first approach is based on the Hafiz's work, and the second one is based on the whole BCD-FA circuit design. In the third approach, a binary to BCD converter is presented. Optimizations are done in terms of number of gates, number of garbage inputs/outputs, and the quantum cost of the circuit. We present four designs for BCD-FA with four different goals: minimum garbage inputs/outputs, minimum quantum cost, minimum number of gates, and optimum circuit in terms of all the above parameters.", "paper_title": "MINIMIZATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF REVERSIBLE BCD-FULL ADDER/SUBTRACTOR USING GENETIC ALGORITHM AND DON'T CARE CONCEPT", "paper_id": "WOS:000269123400009"}
