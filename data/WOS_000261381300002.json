The principle used in I-DyCML is the reduction of the leakage current by turning the part of the circuit to \"standby mode\", when not in use, while achieving lower dynamic power during the active mode. HSpice simulations show that I-DyCML saves up to 15-30% of the total power dissipation when compared to Dynamic Current mode logic.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED DYNAMIC CURRENT MODE LOGIC FOR LOW POWER APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261381300002"}
