We prove that this conjecture holds and in fact that the age algebra of a relational structure R is an integral domain if and only if R is age-inexhaustible. We deduce these results from a combinatorial lemma asserting that if a product of two non-zero elements of a set algebra is zero then there is a finite common tranversal of their supports. The proof is built on Ramsey theorem and the integrity of a shuffle algebra.", "paper_title": "When is the orbit algebra of a group an integral domain? Proof of a conjecture of P. J.
