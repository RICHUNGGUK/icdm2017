However, they do not always provide perfect solutions. This work presents a genetic algorithm in evolutionary computation for patch-based texture synthesis. The representation of an input source texture is first adjusted. Then, the synthesizing result is generated and refined by the selection of individuals based on their fitness and executing crossover and mutation until the criteria are met. After the entire execution, a large output texture is generated with texture features similar to the source texture. Because this approach optimizes the genetic algorithm, the results are satisfactory.", "paper_title": "GENETIC-BASED APPROACH FOR SYNTHESIZING TEXTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000260806800007"}
