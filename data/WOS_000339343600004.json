The key contribution of this short note is the realization that ECOC and, in fact, all class-based decomposition schemes, can be efficiently implemented in a Na < ve Bayes classifier, so that-because of the additive nature of the classifier-all binary classifiers can be trained in a single pass through the data. In contrast to the straight-forward implementation, which has a complexity of O(na <...ta <...g), the proposed approach improves the complexity to O((n+t)a <...g). Large-scale learning of ensemble approaches with Na < ve Bayes can benefit from this approach, as the experimental results shown in this paper demonstrate.", "paper_title": "Efficient implementation of class-based decomposition schemes for Na < ve Bayes", "paper_id": "WOS:000339343600004"}
