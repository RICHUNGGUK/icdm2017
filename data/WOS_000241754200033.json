To this end, we analyze past access patterns and compute frequencies of method calls. Based on these frequencies, the system automatically decides when to recompute materialized methods. The framework was implemented and experimentally evaluated. The results are reported in this paper.", "paper_title": "PMAP: Framework to predicting method access patterns for materialized methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000241754200033"}
