This way, several zones of the landscape are explored in parallel and solutions with different features can be discovered. The interchange of information is a key point for the performance of these algorithms, since the combination of those solutions usually produces better ones. In this work, it is proposed a method based in path relinking which makes the combination process more effective.", "paper_title": "Improvement in the performance of island based genetic algorithms through path relinking", "paper_id": "WOS:000241619200004"}
