In this paper, a content security protection scheme that integrates encryption and digital fingerprinting is proposed to provide comprehensive security protection for multimedia information during its transmission and usage. In contrast to other schemes, this method is implemented in the JPEG compressed domain with no transcoding or decompression, therefore, this scheme is highly efficient and suitable for multimedia information, which is seldom available in an uncompressed form. In addition, a variable modular encryption method is proposed to solve the invalid variable length coding (VLC) problem when a compressed data stream is encrypted directly. Experimental results demonstrate improved security and the efficiency provided by the proposed scheme. The experiments also demonstrate imperceptibility and collusion resistance of fingerprints.
