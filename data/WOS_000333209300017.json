This paper dealt with semantic image classification based on hierarchical Fuzzy Association Rules (FARs) mining in the image database. Intuitively, an association rule is a unique and significant combination of image features and a semantic concept, which determines the degree of correlation between features and concept. The main idea behind this approach is that any image visual concept has some associated features, so that, there are strong correlations between the concepts and their corresponding features. Regardless of the semantic gap, an image concept appears when the corresponding features emerge in an image and vice versa. Specially, this paper's contribution was to propose a novel Fuzzy Association Rule for improving traditional association rules. Moreover, it was concerned with establishing a hierarchical fuzzy rule base in the training phase and setup corresponding fuzzy inference engine in order to classify images in the testing phase. The presented approach was independent from image segmentation and can be applied on multi-label images. Experimental results on a database of 6000 general-purpose images demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A semantic image classifier based on hierarchical fuzzy association rule mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000333209300017"}
