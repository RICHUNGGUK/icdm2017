Given two query face images, our task is to tell whether or not they are of the same person. The main contribution of this paper comes from two aspects: (1) We adopt the one-shot similarity kernel [35] for learning the similarity of two face images. The learned similarity measures are then used to map a face image to reference images. (2) We propose a graph-based method for selecting an optimal set of reference images. Instead of directly working on the image features, we use the learned similarity to the reference images as the new features and compute the corresponding matching score of the two query images. Our approach is effective and easy to implement. We show encouraging and favorable results on the \"Labeled Faces in the Wild\" - a challenging data set of faces. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
