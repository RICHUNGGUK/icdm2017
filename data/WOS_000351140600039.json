Complex system reliability is mainly dependant on the credibility of its components. It is very difficult to evaluate precise value of component's reliability at the beginning stage of reliability evaluation, due to unavailable or inadequate information. In this respect, fuzzy reliability variable can play an important role in complex system reliability evaluation. In this paper, a fuzzy reliability variable based fuzzy non-linear programming problem is formulated to maximize the complex system reliability. Symmetrical trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used as fuzzy variable for the component's reliability. Since fuzzy variable for optimization is not well defined, we first reduced the problem to an equivalent multi-objective non-linear programming problem. The proposed approach is applied on landing system of Boeing 747D airplane to evaluate the system reliability in fuzzy environment. The proposed approach and the complex system reliability model are well substantiated by providing numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy variable based fuzzy non-linear programming approach for optimization of complex system reliability", "paper_id": "WOS:000351140600039"}
