Estimation of the magnetic field inhomogeneity based on image registration enables the off-resonance correction with no additional radio-frequency pulses or acquisitions. In addition to this advantage, a fast and straightforward calculation was achieved by using the first-order components of the magnetic field inhomogeneity. Imaging experiments using a phantom and a chemically fixed mouse demonstrated practical benefits in improving blurring and artifacts in magnetic resonance images in low field magnetic resonance imaging systems.", "paper_title": "Two-Dimensional Compressed Sensing Using the Cross-sampling Approach for Low-Field MRI Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000341773600012"}
