In this paper, we investigate some topological properties of grids without boundary wrap-around (meshes) and with boundary wrap-around (tori). In particular, we study the problem of finding the number of nodes located at/within a given distance from a given node (surface area/volume) in the network and derive some expressions for computing such a number. Furthermore, we provide similar expressions that improve on previous results already reported in the literature for some special cases of grids, notably hypercubes and k-ary n-cubes. We also show some applications of the derived expressions in analytical performance modelling of some grid-based networks under uniform and hotspot traffic loads.", "paper_title": "On the Topological Properties of Grid-Based Interconnection Networks: Surface Area and Volume of Radial Spheres", "paper_id": "WOS:000290315200008"}
