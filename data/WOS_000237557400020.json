We generate the unknown high frequency components of the given partially aliased (low resolution) image by minimizing the total variation of the interpolant subject to the constraint that part of unaliased spectral components in the low resolution observation are known precisely and under the assumption of sparsity in the data. This provides a mathematical basis for exact reproduction of high frequency components with probability approaching one, from their aliased observation. The primary application of the given approach would be in super-resolution imaging.", "paper_title": "Alias-free interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237557400020"}
