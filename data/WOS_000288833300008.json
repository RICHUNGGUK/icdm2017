We present a method that has the following advantages: (a) no human intervention in pre-processing stages, (b) a reduced feature set, (c) modularity of the recognition system and (d) control of the model's complexity in acceptable for real-time operation levels. Representation of each video frame and feature extraction procedure are formulated its the lattice theory context. The recognition system consists of two components: an ensemble of neural network predictors which correspond to the training video sequences and one classifier, based on the PREMONN approach, capable of deciding at each time instant which known video source has potentially generated a new sequence of frames. Extensive experimental study on three well known benchmarks validates the flexibility and robustness of the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
