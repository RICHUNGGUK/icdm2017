These types of problems arise in monitoring and controlling applications using wireless sensor networks. SFSDP implements the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation proposed in Kim et al. [2009] for sensor network localization problems, as a sparse version of the full semidefinite programming relaxation (FSDP) by Biswas and Ye [2004]. To improve the efficiency of FSDP, SFSDP exploits the aggregated and correlative sparsity of a sensor network localization problem. As a result, SFSDP can handle much larger problems than other software as well as three-dimensional anchor-free problems. SFSDP analyzes the input data of a sensor network localization problem, solves the problem, and displays the computed locations of sensors. SFSDP also includes the features of generating test problems for numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 920: SFSDP: A Sparse Version of Full Semidefinite Programming Relaxation for Sensor Network Localization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308331100005"}
