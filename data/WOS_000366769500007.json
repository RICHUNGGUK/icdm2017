In this study, we apply an artificial immune network to collaborative filtering for movie recommendation. We propose new formulas in calculating the affinity between an antigen and an antibody and the affinity of an antigen to an immune network. In addition, a modified similarity estimation formula based on the Pearson correlation coefficient is also developed. A series of experiments based on MovieLens and EachMovie datasets are conducted, and the results are very encouraging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
