The first derivation based on the maximum entropy theory elaborates the statistical significance of KS function. The second one points out the relationship between KS and the p-norm global function. The properties of these two global functions validate these substitutions are reasonable.", "paper_title": "A note on the derivation of global stress constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000272178500043"}
