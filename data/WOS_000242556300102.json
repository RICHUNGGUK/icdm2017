A methodology based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to overcome the non-deterministic delays in data communication of the network. The general algorithm of dynamic matrix control (DMC) has been improved to make it suitable for network condition. When data packets can not arrive at target nodes in sequence, the predictive value of the system output can be used to take the place of the actual measure value by the controller, and the predictive value of control input will be acted as the required control value which coordinate the whole control system. The experiment results based on Motor Ethernet Control Open Platform (MECOP) show the effectiveness of the real-time networked control strategy.", "paper_title": "MPC-based control methodology in networked control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300102"}
