Till now many authentication solutions had been proposed, such as cryptology and watermarking based methods. However, in latest heterogeneous network the video stream transmission has been coded in scalable way such as H.264/SVC, there is still no good authentication solution. In this paper, we firstly summarized related works and proposed a scalable content authentication scheme using a ratio of different energy (RDE) based perceptual hashing in Q/S dimension, which is used Dempster-Shafer theory and combined with the latest scalable video coding (H.264/SVC) construction. The idea of \"sign once and verify in scalable way\" can be realized. Comparing with previous methods, the proposed scheme based on perceptual hashing outperforms previous works in uncertainty (robustness) and efficiencies in the H.264/SVC video streams. At last, the experiment results verified the performance of our scheme.", "paper_title": "Scalable Content Authentication in H.264/SVC Videos Using Perceptual Hashing based on Dempster-Shafer theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000309220000019"}
