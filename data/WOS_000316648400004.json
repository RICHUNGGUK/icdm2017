In the expression of fractional derivatives of a real polynomial f(x), we view the order of differentiation q as a new indeterminate; then we define a new bivariate polynomial P-f(x, q). For 0 <= q <= 1, P-f(x, q) defines a homotopy between the polynomials f(x) and xf'(x). Iterating this construction, we associate to f(x) a plane spline curve, called the stem of f. Stems of classic random polynomials exhibits intriguing patterns; moreover in the complex plane P-f(x, q) creates an unexpected correspondence between the complex roots and the critical points of f(x). We propose 3 conjectures to describe and explain these phenomena. Illustrations are provided relying on the Computer algebra system Maple. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
