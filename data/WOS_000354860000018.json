It was originally proposed to recruit ordinary citizens to collect and share massive amounts of sensory data using their portable smart devices. By attracting participants and paying rewards as a return, incentive mechanisms play an important role to guarantee a stable scale of participants and to improve the accuracy/coverage/timeliness of the sensing results. Along this direction, a considerable amount of research activities have been conducted recently, ranging from experimental studies to theoretical solutions and practical applications, aiming at providing more comprehensive incentive procedures and/or protecting benefits of different system stakeholders. To this end, this paper surveys the literature over the period of 2004-2014 from the state of the art of theoretical frameworks, applications and system implementations, and experimental studies of the incentive strategies used in participatory sensing by providing up-to-date research in the literature. We also point out future directions of incentive strategies used in participatory sensing.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Incentive Mechanisms for Participatory Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000354860000018"}
