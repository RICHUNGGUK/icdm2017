Here it is shown that the class L(R) of languages that are accepted by R-automata is incomparable under set inclusion to the class CRL of Church-Rosser languages and to the class GCSL of growing context-sensitive languages. In fact this already holds for the class L(2-mon-R) of languages that are accepted by 2-monotone R-automata. In addition, we prove that already the latter class contains NP-complete languages, showing that already the 2-monotone R-automaton has a surprisingly large expressive power.", "paper_title": "On the complexity of 2-monotone restarting automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000254920900004"}
