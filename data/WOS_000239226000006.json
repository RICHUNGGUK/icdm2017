This study, based on an analysis of 47 million inbound e-mail messages drawn from a cross-section of e-mail inbox owners over a one-year period, characterizes resource overuse in the e-mail commons. The absence of a growth trend in UCE message volume raises questions about the sampling methodologies underlying media reports about spam. The distribution of UCE messages reveals a cyclical trend, peaking in mid-week and subsiding on weekends, that can be explained in part by the trend of regular e-mail messages-on unanticipated finding given the difference between UCE and ordinary e-mail communication. Ruling out technological constraints and workweek conventions, the study suggests that these covarying patterns come about because UCE senders strategically exploit the unique features of the on-line commons, including instantaneous feedback, information transparency, identity misrepresentation, and technological progress. Analysis of these properties can lead to improved management of the digital commons.", "paper_title": "Unsolicited commercial e-mail: Empirical analysis of a digital commons", "paper_id": "WOS:000239226000006"}
