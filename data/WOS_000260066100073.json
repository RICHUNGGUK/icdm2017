Considering the evolvement feature of the chaotic system, we utilize the recurrent version of least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) to manipulate the iterative problem. From the high-dimensional phase space point of view, the function approximation in the high-dimensional embedding phase space is carried out and the noise reduction achieved simultaneously based on the reconstructed embedding phase theory. We show by means of simulation of Ikeda map that the proposed method is able to provide accurate results in noise reduction of chaotic system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
