Then some discussions about the individual properties of these chaotic maps are presented, from a dynamical systems view point. Also, one of these chaotic map is used as a Nonlinear Pseudo Random Generator (NPRNG). This paper addresses the chaotic features of this map which are useful for generating nonlinear pseudo random numbers. Results of the analysis and extensive tests such as the NIST, DIEHARD and ENT test suites indicate that the NPRNG exhibits good statistical randomness properties.", "paper_title": "PSEUDO RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR BASED ON SYNCHRONIZED CHAOTIC MAPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275469100010"}
