The expression of wavelength-related polarization-dependent loss (PDL) for TFBGs with different tilt angles is derived and calculated. Simulation results are compared, and the results indicate that the polarization capability of TFBGs with 45 degrees angle is stronger than other TFBGs with smaller angles. The degree of polarization for unpolarized light passing TFBGs is also simulated to further evaluate the polarization properties for various tilt angles. In addition, the relationship between physical parameters of a TFBG and its polarization capability is discussed.", "paper_title": "Theoretical analysis of polarization properties for tilted fiber Bragg gratings", "paper_id": "WOS:000276598700017"}
