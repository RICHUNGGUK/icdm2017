To mitigate the design efforts, the self-learning ability embedded in the neural networks model was emphasized for improving the rule extraction performance. An aeration unit in an Aerated Submerged Biofilm Wastewater Treatment Process (ASBWTP) was picked up to support the derivation of a solid fuzzy control rule base. Four different fuzzy operators were compared against one other in terms of their actual performance of automated knowledge acquisition in the system based on a partial or full rule base prescribed. Research findings suggest that using bounded difference fuzzy operator (O-b) in connection with back propagation neural networks (BPN) algorithm would be the best choice to build up this feedforward fuzzy controller design.
