Collective intelligence, among others, deals with creating the knowledge of a collective which is consistent and complete. This means that it should contain all elements not belonging to the knowledge of collective members, but can be inferred on the basis of knowledge of them. For this process the methodologies for knowledge integration seem to be very useful. In this paper the authors present a framework for integrating knowledge of a collective which shows that knowledge of a collective should not be a normal sum of knowledge of its members. The model for knowledge integration using complex hierarchical structures has been also presented and analyzed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
