In an instance of the parameterized edge dominating set problem, we are given a graph G = (V, E) and an integer k, and we are asked to decide whether G has an edge dominating set of size at most k. In this paper, we show that the parameterized edge dominating set problem can be solved in O*(2.3147(k)) time and polynomial space. We also show that this problem can be reduced to a quadratic kernel with O(k(3)) edges. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
