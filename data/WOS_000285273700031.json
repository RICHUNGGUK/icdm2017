In this approach we used a PDC fuzzy controller built on the time-Varying Fuzzy Sets (VFS) based on a function depending on the error which characterizes the movement of the midpoint of the universe to the left or to the right. To achieve this objective, we use a decay rate controller and relaxed stability conditions for a nonlinear system.", "paper_title": "A TIME-VARYING FUZZY SETS AS FUNCTIONS OF THE ERROR", "paper_id": "WOS:000285273700031"}
