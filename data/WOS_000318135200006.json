The algorithm is developed with inspiration from T cell signalling processes and has application in anomaly detection. Connections between the Receptor Density Algorithm and kernel density estimation with exponential smoothing are demonstrated. Finally, the paper evaluates the algorithm's performance on two types of anomaly detection problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
