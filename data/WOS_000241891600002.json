The explicit bound is derived on the relative difference between the generalization error and leave-one-out error for classification learning algorithm under the condition of leave-one-out stability by using Markov's inequality, and then this bound is used to estimate the generalization error of classification learning algorithm. We compare the result in this paper with previous results in the end.", "paper_title": "The study of leave-one-out error-based classification learning algorithm for generalization performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600002"}
