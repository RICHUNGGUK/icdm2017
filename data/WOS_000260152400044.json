For this new approach, requires no prior knowledge or information about the sensors, or the system behavior, and no learning processes are required. The proposed hybrid approach consists of two main phases. In the first phase a single fuser for the input sensor signals is generated using the fuzzy clustering c-means algorithm. The fused output is based on the cluster centers that contain the maximum number of the input elements. In the second phase a fault detector was generated base on the artificial immune system AIS.
