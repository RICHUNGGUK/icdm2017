Components can be reused under various business environments through its changmibility This paper proposes a feature-based semantics model of reusable component, which describes semantics of components by using domain feature space and expresses changeability of components through five kinds of changeable mechanisms of domain features. In addition, this study proposes a self-contained classification of features according to enterprise business model, divides semantics structure and hierarchical relation of three kinds of components, and sets up mapping relations between semantics model of component and business model. The model is verified through the case study of a Web-based information platform for logistics enterprise.", "paper_title": "A feature-based semantics model of reusable component", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100133"}
