However, the presence of such units is usually limited to professional receivers that dispose of additional computational power that can be used for interference detection and mitigation. In this paper, the two-pole notch filter, that is the natural extension of the one-pole notch filter, is proposed as computationally effective solution for interference detection and mitigation. The notch filter structure and the adaptive algorithm employed for tracking the disturbing signal are analyzed, and an interference detection unit, based on the adaptive algorithm convergence, is proposed. The two-pole notch filter coupled with the detection unit is used as elementary block for the design of a multi-pole notch filter that can efficiently mitigate more than one CW interference. Theoretical and simulative analyses show the feasibility and the good performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Two-Pole and Multi-Pole Notch Filters: A Computationally Effective Solution for GNSS Interference Detection and Mitigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000207469700005"}
