In this paper, the MPM Job-shop scheduling problem, where the machine maintenance has to be performed within certain time intervals inducing machine unavailability, is studied. Two approaches to solve the problem are proposed. The first is a two-phase approach where the assignment and the sequencing are solved separately. The second is an integrated approach based on the exact resolution of the 2-job problem using the geometric approach.", "paper_title": "MPM Job-shop under Availability Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000270844700011"}
