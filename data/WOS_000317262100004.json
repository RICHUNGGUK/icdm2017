The building services subsector is no exception. Based on extensive literature review and industry focus group investigations, the reported research develops a useful application of system dynamics modeling to address production process inefficiencies in this subsector. A generic process model is systematically developed to simulate the effects of varying levels of a set of identified variables on construction projects in practical scenarios. The simulation model provides relevant insights to project managers, who may apply this knowledge when designing or targeting better performance through more appropriate project settings and conducive conditions when planning building services works. It is concluded from the model-based approach that building services works can be improved through specific better focused managerial efforts, such as an increasing coordination effectiveness at the planning stage, clarifying design decisions collaboratively for interdependent works and improving critical prerequisite conditions prior to installations. Otherwise, pending works arising from work clashes can lead to knock-on effects resulting in productivity constraints and pressures, as well as more rework and demolition. This model is then applied in two quite different projects in Hong Kong. The findings reveal that the model enables deep insights into estimating and potentially improving construction performance levels, by addressing the dynamics of the various identified critical input parameters.
