We characterize the security level of a confined region in a quasi-static fading environment by computing the probability of secrecy outage in connection with two new measures of physical-layer security: the jamming coverage and the jamming efficiency. Our analysis for various jamming strategies based on different levels of channel state information provides insight into the design of optimal jamming configurations and shows that a single jammer is not sufficient to maximize both figures of merit simultaneously. Moreover, a single jammer requires full channel state information to provide security gains in the vicinity of the legitimate receiver.", "paper_title": "Wireless Secrecy Regions With Friendly Jamming", "paper_id": "WOS:000290737100002"}
