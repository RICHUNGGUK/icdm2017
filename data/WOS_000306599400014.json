Due to the layout disturbance induced by the transitions between scales, a new heuristic algorithm is proposed to restrict changes to bounded summary segments. Conducted user evaluations show that the proposed methodology improves usability while keeping the summaries compact and informative.", "paper_title": "Scalable Comic-Like Video Summaries and Layout Disturbance", "paper_id": "WOS:000306599400014"}
