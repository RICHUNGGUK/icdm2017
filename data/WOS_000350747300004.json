Here, the experimental studies are conducted in two different stages. In the first stage, different concepts of machine learning systems are taken into account to find a simple yet accurate intelligent model for identifying the LSFF process. To do so, multi-layered neural network with different types of analytical, gradient-based and heuristic learning strategies, i.e. extreme learning machine, back-propagation and steepest descend gradient-based learning and Nelder-Mead simplex heuristic, respectively, are adopted and applied to the LSFF process. In the second stage, different types of swarm- and evolutionary-based metaheuristics, i.e. differential evolutionary algorithm, particle swarm optimisation, the great salmon run, firefly algorithm, bee algorithm, are used to simultaneously find the optimal values of melt-pool depth and clad height during the LSFF process. The statistical results of the simulation indicate that the conducted experiments can result in a fast, robust and accurate hybrid intelligent system which can easily cope with the nonlinearities and uncertainties of the resulting optimisation problem.", "paper_title": "An experimentally derived hybrid intelligent tool for analysing and optimising the clad height and melt-pool depth in laser solid freeform fabrication process", "paper_id": "WOS:000350747300004"}
