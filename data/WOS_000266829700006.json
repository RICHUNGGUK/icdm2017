It is proved that the new constant-composition codes are optimal with respect to the Luo-Fu-Vinck-Chen bound, when m is an odd positive integer greater than 1. Finally, we point out that two constructions of constant-composition codes, proposed by Ding Cunsheng et al. in 2005, are equivalent to two special types of the new constant-composition codes.", "paper_title": "On the constructions of constant-composition codes from perfect nonlinear functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000266829700006"}
