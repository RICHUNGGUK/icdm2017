To detect copied versions of digital images, which are generated by various image processes, several schemes have been proposed. However, none of them can successfully detect tampering when those images are rotated 90 or 270 degrees from the original image. To solve this problem, we propose a new copy detection scheme based on Y component of image and block strategy. A test image is just converted to a YUV color model where only Y component is used to generate the image signatures. Then, the transformed image is divided into 8 x 8 blocks. Finally, the relationship between each block and its neighboring eight blocks are recorded by comparing these block's mean values. This image signature generated by our proposed scheme contains the comparative relationship between each block and its neighboring blocks. Our proposed scheme can detect modifications those are generated by 90 or 270 rotation of original one, which can not be detected by Kim's scheme.. The optimal block numbers used for image partition have been explored and the efficiency of the proposed scheme is extensively tested with 20,000 test images.", "paper_title": "A robust content-based copy detection scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000239018100011"}
