Basis device architecture is indium tin oxide (ITO)/N, N'-diphenyl-N, N'-bis(1-naphthyl-phenyl)-1, 1'-biphenyl-4, 4'-diamine (NPB)/4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-tert-butyl-6-(1, 1, 7, 7- tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-pyran (DCJTB)/NPB (spacer)/tris-(8-hydroxyl quinoline) aluminum (Alq(3))/2, 9-dimethyl-4, 7-diphenyl-1, 10-phenanthroline (BCP)/Al. Exciton recombination zone is located at DCJTB and Alq(3) layers. When the NPB spacer is 10-nm-thick, Alq(3) emission governs in electro-luminescent (EL) spectra owing to absence of FRET between DCJTB and Alq3. FRET occurs while the NPB spacer is 5-nm-thick and thus DCJTB emission is dominant in EL spectra. As the emissive layout of DCJTB/Alq(3)/NPB substitutes for DCJTB/NPB/Alq(3), both DCJTB and NPB emissions are observed due to electron-blocking effect of NPB. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
