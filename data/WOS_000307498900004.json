The present coupling model was validated by two-dimensional natural convection flows with and without an isolated internal vertical plate. The results from the coupling model agree well with those from the pure-finite volume method, pure-LBM and references, and all the physical quantities cross the coupled interface smoothly. On the basis of residual history curves, it is likely that the convergence property and the numerical stability of the present model are better than those of the pure-LBM at fine grid numbers and high Rayleigh numbers.
