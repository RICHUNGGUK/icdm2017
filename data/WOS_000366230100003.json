To address these problems we present a technique for extracting, presenting, and making use of signatures for Simulink subsystems. The signature of a subsystem is defined to be a generalization of its interface, including the subsystem's explicit ports, locally defined and inherited data stores, as well as scoped gotos/froms. We argue that the use of signatures has significant benefits for model comprehension and subsystem testing, and show how the incorporation of signatures into existing Simulink models is practical and useful by discussing various usage scenarios. Furthermore, outside of the model setting, signatures have proven to be an asset when exported and included in software documentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
