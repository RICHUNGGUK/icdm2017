This can be done when the descriptor uses a circular grid and quantized orientation steps, by computing or providing a global reference orientation based on the feature matches. The proposed matching strategy is compared with the standard approaches used with the SIFT and GLOH descriptors and the recent rotation invariant MROGH and LIOP descriptors. A new evaluation protocol based on an approximated overlap error is presented to provide an effective analysis in the case of non-planar scenes, thus extending the current state-of-the-art results.
