The model parameters are firstly calibrated through optimum fitting of typical basic material test data. Then the model is verified through comparing the numerical simulation results with a second large group of experiment data in the literature. The simulated experiments include tension, compression and shear as well as their various combinations. Close agreement between the numerical predictions and a very broad range of test data is found. Finally the model is implemented into a commercial finite element package and is applied to nonlinear structural analysis. Several complex but commonly encountered problems in the engineering practice are computationally investigated. The model predictions are in good agreement with the test observations.
