These graphs are applicable as interconnection networks and in theoretical chemistry, and lead to the Fibonacci dimension of a graph. In this paper a survey on Fibonacci cubes is given with an emphasis on their structure, including representations, recursive construction, hamiltonicity, degree sequence and other enumeration results. Their median nature that leads to a fast recognition algorithm is discussed. The Fibonacci dimension of a graph, studies of graph invariants on Fibonacci cubes, and related classes of graphs are also presented. Along the way some new short proofs are given.", "paper_title": "Structure of Fibonacci cubes: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000317973700003"}
