The proxy cannot, however, learn anything about the encrypted messages. At CCS 2007, Canetti and Hohenberger left an interesting open problem of how to design a PRE scheme that is simultaneously unidirectional and multi-hop. This is a rather interesting problem since in some applications we may need this feature, such as in the scenario of email forwarding, a delegatee wants forward his emails that received from the delegator to another delegatee. In this work we design an unidirectional and multi-hop PRE scheme by using multilinear maps. A shortcoming of our scheme is that its security relies on some rather strong assumptions in the setting of multilinear groups.", "paper_title": "Multi-Hop Unidirectional Proxy Re-Encryption from Multilinear Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400041"}
