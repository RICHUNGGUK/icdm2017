In general. the W-disjoint orthogonality assumption is used for blind source separation using multi-microphones. However, in this Letter, it is utilized to mask the residual echo component in the time-frequency domain using a single microphone. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the echo return loss enhancement and speech enhancement.", "paper_title": "W-Disjoint Orthogonality Based Residual Acoustic Echo Cancellation for Hands-Free Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000269648400045"}
