An adaptive fuzzy backstepping controller that can compensate the system nonlinearities is incorporated into the sliding mode control scheme in the Lyapunov framework. An adaptive fuzzy controller is used to learn the unknown upper bound of model uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a backstepping sliding mode controller is designed to compensate the model uncertainties and external disturbances. Then, an adaptive fuzzy control approach is developed to estimate the upper bound of the lumped uncertainty in the configuration of backstepping sliding mode control. Numerical simulation is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Adaptive fuzzy backstepping sliding mode control for MEMS gyroscope", "paper_id": "WOS:000341191800023"}
