The recognition algorithm mainly consists of three stages. First, an initial preprocessing is applied on the captured signature, removing noise and normalizing information related to horizontal and vertical positions. Afterwards, a dynamic time warping algorithm is used to align this processed signature with its template previously stored in a database. Finally, a set of features are extracted and passed through a Gaussian Mixture Model, which reveals the degree of similarity between both signatures. The algorithm was tested using a public database of 100 users, obtaining high recognition rates for both genuine and forgery signatures. The implemented system consists of a vector floating-point unit (VFPU), specifically designed for accelerating the floating-point computations involved in this biometric modality. Moreover, the proposed architecture also includes a microprocessor, which interacts with the VFPU, and executes by software the rest of the online signature verification process. The designed system is capable of finishing a complete verification in less than 68 ms with a clock rated at 40 MHz. Experimental results show that the number of clock cycles is accelerated by a factor of x4.8 and x11.1, when compared with systems based on ARM Cortex-A8 and when substituting the VFPU by the Floating-Point Unit provided by Xilinx, respectively.", "paper_title": "Embedded System for Biometric Online Signature Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600048"}
