Define the sequence (or word) t(k,m) = s(k)(n) (mod m)(n >= 0). which generalizes the well-known Thue-Morse sequence t(2,2). We give a much shorter proof of the main result in Allouche and Shallit (2000)[1], which says that t(k,m) has no overlaps (that is, contains no subword of the form axaxa, where x is any finite word and a is a single symbol), using techniques from Cusick and StanicA (2009) [2]. We also give different proofs of some other results from Allouche and Shallit (2000) [1] and one result from Morton and Mourant (1991)[3], using the same techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
