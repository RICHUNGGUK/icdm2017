E) is a subset T D-k of V such that every vertex in V is adjacent to at least k vertices of T Dk. In minimum k-tuple total dominating set problem (MIN k-TUPLE TOTAL DOM SET), it is required to find a k-tuple total dominating set of minimum cardinality and DECIDE MIN k-TUPLE TOTAL DOM SET is the decision version of MIN k-TUPLE TOTAL DOM SET problem. In this paper, we show that DECIDE MIN k-TUPLE TOTAL DOM SET is NP-complete for split graphs, doubly chordal graphs and bipartite graphs. For chordal bipartite graphs, we show that MIN k-TUPLE TOTAL DOM SET can be solved in polynomial time. We also propose some hardness results and approximation algorithms for MIN k-TUPLE TOTAL DOM SET problem. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
