These procedures as well as weighted versions of the classical ? 2 test are examined by power simulation in the context of functional data analysis. It is seen that the AN test exhibits good properties consistently across a range of dimensionalities and configurations of the alternative. Certain tests based on AIC are found to exhibit comparable performance at moderate dimensionalities. Weighted ? 2 tests are seen to exhibit very good properties in specific scenarios, but appear extremely sensitive to the shape of the alternative.", "paper_title": "Use of goodness-of-fit procedures in high dimensional testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000234635400008"}
