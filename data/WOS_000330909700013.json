AOI tends to overgeneralise as it uses a fixed global static threshold to cluster and generalise attributes irrespective of their features, and does not evaluate intermediate interestingness. In contrast, clusterAOI uses attribute features to dynamically recalculate new attribute thresholds and applies heuristics to evaluate cluster quality and intermediate interestingness. Experimental results show improved interestingness, better output pattern distribution and expressiveness, and improved runtime. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
