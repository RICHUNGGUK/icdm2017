The parameters and states of the local recurrent neural network models are used for a local direct and indirect adaptive trajectory tracking control systems design. The designed local control laws are coordinated by a fuzzy rule-based control system. The upper level defuzzyfication is performed by a recurrent neural network. The applicability of the proposed intelligent control system is confirmed by simulation examples and by a DC-motor identification and control experimental results. Two main cases of a reference and plant output fuzzyfication are considered-a two membership functions without overlapping and a three membership functions with overlapping. In both cases a good convergent results are obtained. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
