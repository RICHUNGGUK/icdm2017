In our knowledge, this is one of the first works that uses as features for fingerprint verification the response of a minutiae matcher between two fingerprint. The feature vector obtained by the minutiae matching is classified into \"genuine\" or \"impostor\" by support vector machines. Results from FVC2002 are presented, yielding remarkable performance improvement with respect to other state-of-the-art approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
