The proposed router utilizes the 3-stage permutation network instead of the serialized switch allocator and 7 x 7 crossbar to achieve the frequency of 1.25 GHz in TSMC 65 nm technology. Compared with the other two 3D bufferless routers, the proposed router occupies less area and consumes less power consumption. Simulation results under both synthetic and application workloads illustrate that the proposed router achieves less average packet latency than the other two 3D bufferless routers.", "paper_title": "A 1-Cycle 1.25 GHz Bufferless Router for 3D Network-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000304573100036"}
