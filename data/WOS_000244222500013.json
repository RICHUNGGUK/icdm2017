This paper presents an approach to the management and provisioning of end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) in next generation networks (IP and non-IP networks) that is being developed in the IST ENTHRONE1 project. The primary goal of this project is to provide a solution for seamless access to multimedia content with end-to-end QoS support through integrated management of content, networks and terminals. The adopted methodology in providing end-to-end QoS is through an integrated management in the context of MPEG-21 framework for managing services at both customer and provider levels using Service Level Agreements (SLA) concept and provisioning network resources for satisfying the customer QoS demands as well as meeting the QoS requirements of multimedia contents.
