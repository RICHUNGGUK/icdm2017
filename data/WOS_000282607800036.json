It is also a key mechanism through which social network structure affects individuals. Bridging can be contrasted with triadic closure and all of the social capital benefits. But this research found that structural holes benefit unable to appear when network structure is not close enough. With cluster analysis, this research also finds that photoelectric industries present close interaction in innovation activities than other industries in Taiwan, thereby obtaining competitive advantage in the world.
