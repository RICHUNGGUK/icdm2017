Source implantation masked by the comb-shaped gate can result in comb-shaped channel region. With this comb-shaped gate configuration, increased tunneling area can be obtained and hence higher on-state current without area penalty. Moreover, an optimized CG-TFET with silicide source is fabricated to further improve the on-state current by introducing Schottky barrier tunneling current which is much more efficient than band-to-band tunneling. In addition, the electron barrier in the comb-shaped channel region is raised due to the self depleted effect, which can effectively suppress the Schottky injection leakage from the silicide source in the off-state. 1.5 orders of magnitude higher than conventional TFET with the same footprint on-state current and more than 10(6) on-off current ratio can be achieved.", "paper_title": "A comb-gate silicon tunneling field effect transistor with improved on-state current", "paper_id": "WOS:000323202000011"}
