In this paper, we extend some of these results to a nonlinear type of fuzzy numbers called adaptive fuzzy numbers (see Bodjanova (2005, Information Science, 172, 73-89) for detail). We then discuss the application of these results to decision making problems in which the parameters may involve uncertainty and vagueness. As an application, we develop expression for fuzzy net present value (FNPV) of future cash flows involving adaptive fuzzy numbers by using their possibilistic moments. An illustrative numerical example is given to illustrate the results.", "paper_title": "Application of possibility theory to investment decisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000259100700003"}
