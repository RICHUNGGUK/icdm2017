In this paper, steady-state analysis of the low power DBD is presented, considering the inevitable parasitic capacitance of the high-step transformer. The rectifier-compensated first harmonic approximation (RCFHA) is applied to linearize the equivalent load circuit of DBD at low frequency and the derived expressions are accurate and convenient for the analysis and design of the power supply. Based on the proposed linear equivalent load circuit, the influence of transformer parasitic capacitance on the key parameters, including the frequency range and the applied electrode voltage, is discussed when the power is regulated with pulse frequency modulation (PFM). Also, a design procedure is presented based on the derived expressions. A prototype is constructed according to the design results and the accuracy of the design is verified by experimental results.", "paper_title": "Analysis and design of pulse frequency modulation dielectric barrier discharge for low power applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000350792700007"}
