This notion can be defined for the uniform case, when the elements of F are picked according to a uniform distribution, or for the more general, biased case, in which the elements of F are chosen according to a given distribution D. It is known that this notion is a useful tool for indexing replicated documents on the web. We show that even in the more general, biased case, for all admissible k and epsilon and all large n, the size of F must satisfy |F| >= Omega (k/epsilon(2)log(1/epsilon) log n), as well as |F| >= Omega (k(2)/epsilon log(1/epsilon) log n). This improves the best known previous estimates even for the uniform case.(C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "On (epsilon, k)-min-wise independent permutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000249700800007"}
