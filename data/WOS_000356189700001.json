Visualizing ET dynamics could provide key insight into understanding and possibly controlling these processes. We present a computational framework named VizBET to visualize biological ET dynamics, using an outermembrane Mtr-Omc cytochrome complex in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 as an example. Starting from X-ray crystal structures of the constituent cytochromes, molecular dynamics simulations are combined with homology modeling, protein docking, and binding free energy computations to sample the configuration of the complex as well as the change of the free energy associated with ET. This information, along with quantum-mechanical calculations of the electronic coupling, provides inputs to kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations of ET dynamics in a network of heme groups within the complex. Visualization of the KMC simulation results has been implemented as a plugin to the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software. VizBET has been used to reveal the nature of ET dynamics associated with novel nonequilibrium phase transitions in a candidate configuration of the Mtr-Omc complex due to electron electron interactions.
