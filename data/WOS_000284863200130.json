Area of multi-objective optimization is attractive not only for offering new opportunities for defining problem, but it helps us to extend and solve the anonymous problem. So a new multi-objective mixed integer model is presented for DCMS. The proposed model considers some real-world critical conditions in lean production which are neglected in similar studies in the literature. This model solves the part and machine grouping simultaneously with labor assignment to minimize the cost of various terms like reassignment cost of human resource, over time cost of equipments and labors, and maximize utilization rate of human resource. The model is linearized and validated with GAMS 22.1\\Cplex. Because the Benders' decomposition approach has not been applied to solve multi-objective CMS problems so far, we use this method to solve our model. The results are presented at the end.
