It is known that d-representable implies d-collapsible implies d-Leray, and no two of these notions coincide for d >= 2. The famous Helly theorem and other important results in discrete geometry can be regarded as results about d-representable complexes, and in many of these results, \"d-representable\" in the assumption can be replaced by \"d-collapsible\" or even \"d-Leray.\" We investigate \"dimension gaps\" among these notions and construct, for all d >= 1, a 2d-Leray complex that is not (3d - 1)-collapsible and a d-collapsible complex that is not (2d - 2)-representable. In the proofs, we obtain two results of independent interest: (i) The nerve of every finite family of sets, each of size at most d, is d-collapsible; (ii) If the nerve of a simplicial complex K is d-representable, then K embeds in R(d).", "paper_title": "Dimension Gaps between Representability and Collapsibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000271198900008"}
