Our idea is to exploit it to find the positions of the class centroids in the search space such that for any class the average distance of instances belonging to that class from the relative class centroid is minimized. The performance of the resulting best individual is computed in terms of error rate on the testing set. Then, such a performance is compared against those of other ten classification techniques well known in literature. Results show the effectiveness of the approach in solving the classification task.", "paper_title": "Automatic classification of handsegmented image parts with differential evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900036"}
