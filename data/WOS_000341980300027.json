In particular, the corresponding fading numbers are identical. Furthermore, the asymptotic capacity of a single-input single-output nonregular Gaussian fading channel with memory is investigated, and it is shown that the prelog is unaffected by noiseless feedback.", "paper_title": "Impact of Feedback and Side-Information on the Asymptotic Capacity of Single-Input Multiple-Output Fading Channels With Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000341980300027"}
