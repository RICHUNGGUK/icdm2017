Knowledge reduction is one of the most important problems in rough set theory. However, in real-world most of information systems are based on dominance relations in stead of the classical rough set because of various factors. To acquire brief decision rules from systems based on dominance relations, knowledge reductions are needed. The main aim of this paper is to study the problem. The basic concepts and properties of knowledge reduction based on evidence reasoning theory are discussed. Furthermore, the characterization and knowledge reduction approaches based on evidence reasoning theory are obtained with examples in several kinds of ordered information system, which is every useful in future research works of the ordered information systems.", "paper_title": "Knowledge reduction based on evidence reasoning theory in ordered information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200045"}
