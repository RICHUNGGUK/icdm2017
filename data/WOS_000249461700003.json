The economic mechanism can guarantee the interest of participants in the grid with fairness and efficiency. In this paper, an economic-based resource management framework is put forward for grid computing, and then how to determine the price of resources with the economic mechanism is studied. A general equilibrium method is presented for general resources and a double auction method is proposed for special resources in the grid environment, respectively. Simulations are performed and experimental results indicate that the two methods are effective for corresponding application scenarios.", "paper_title": "Grid resource management based on economic mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000249461700003"}
