Among the well-established location determination approaches, probabilistic techniques show good performance and, thus, become increasingly popular. For these techniques to achieve a high level of accuracy, however, a large number of training samples are usually required for calibration, which incurs a great amount of offline manual effort. In this paper, we aim to solve the problem by reducing both the sampling time and the number of locations sampled in constructing a radio map. We propose a novel learning algorithm that builds location-estimation systems based on a small fraction of the calibration data that traditional techniques require and a collection of user traces that can be cheaply obtained. When the number of sampled locations is reduced, an interpolation method is developed to effectively patch a radio map. Extensive experiments show that our proposed methods are effective in reducing the calibration effort. In particular, unlabeled user traces can be used to compensate for the effects of reducing the calibration effort and can even improve the system performance. Consequently, manual effort can be reduced substantially while a high level of accuracy is still achieved.", "paper_title": "Reducing the calibration effort for probabilistic indoor location estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000245757500007"}
