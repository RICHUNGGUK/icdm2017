The power spectrum of the proposed pulses fits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) spectral mask for very high data rates that have quantized values with various levels. Using this scheme and a particular choice of design variables, it is possible to design orthogonal pulses that could be used for multi-user data communication after they are truncated for the same time interval. Several possible improvements for these proposed pulses are considered for certain practical cases.", "paper_title": "ISI-free pulses for high-data-rate ultra-wideband wireless systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000253854900002"}
