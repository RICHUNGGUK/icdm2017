In this article the overall architecture and structure of an intelligent E-learning system is presented. The intelligent E-learning system described has a typical architecture for this kind of system and consists of three modules: the student module, the domain module, and the pedagogical module. Each part of the system is responsible for different functions and activities. Methods and algorithms applied in the modules are also presented. In addition, a proof of the statement that a personalized learning scenario should provide better effects than a randomized scenario is included. It has been pointed out that the probability of passing all lessons from the learning scenario is greater if the opening learning scenario is determined using a worked-out method than if the opening learning scenario is chosen randomly. The obtained results have significant implications for development of an intelligent E-learning system.", "paper_title": "A Method for Scenario Recommendation in Intelligent E-Learning Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000288242600003"}
