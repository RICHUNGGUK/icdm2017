This problem and related topics were subject for extensive research in the last 40 years. In this paper, two product constructions for perfect Lee codes and diameter perfect Lee codes are presented. These constructions yield a large number of nonlinear perfect codes and nonlinear diameter perfect codes in the Lee and Manhattan metrics. A short survey and other related problems on perfect codes in the Lee and Manhattan metrics are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Product Constructions for Perfect Lee Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000297046100018"}
