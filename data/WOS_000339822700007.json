This problem is helpful to many computer vision tasks such as stereo matching and object recognition. Since the solution of this problem is affected by perturbations such as noise, the analysis for the perturbation bounds is crucial to evaluate the performance of algorithm from a mathematical point of view. In this paper we first introduce a shape matching algorithm using QR factorization with column pivoting (QRP), which gives a closed-form solution to the problem. In the QRP-based algorithm, the Householder transform plays a central role. So a sharp perturbation bound for the Householder transform is derived, then theoretical perturbation bounds for the matching algorithm are proven. Based upon the perturbation analysis a point clustering scheme (PCS) is proposed to improve the algorithm robustness. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world images, as well as application results for logo retrieval are provided to demonstrate the proposed method and compare it with existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Matching and Perturbation Theories for Affine-Invariant Shapes Using QR Factorization with Column Pivoting", "paper_id": "WOS:000339822700007"}
