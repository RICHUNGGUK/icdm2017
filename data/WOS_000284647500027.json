According to the estimated clutter probability distribution, power spectrum model and generalized matching filter theory, the forward scattering clutter in bistatic radar is effectively suppressed and the target motion parameters are accurately estimated from the measured clutter data.", "paper_title": "Statistic characteristic analysis of forward scattering surface clutter in bistatic radar", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647500027"}
