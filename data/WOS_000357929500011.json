Our framework uses parallel patterns in capturing important characteristics of multi-threaded applications and generates synthetic multicore benchmarks from those applications. The resulting synthetic benchmarks are small, fast, portable, human-readable, and they accurately reflect microarchitecture dependent and independent characteristics of the original multicore applications. Also, they can use either Pthreads or MCA libraries. We implement our techniques in the MINIME tool and generate synthetic benchmarks from PARSEC, Rodinia, and EEMBC Multibench (TM) benchmarks on x86 and Power Architecture (R) platforms. We show that synthetic benchmarks are representative across a range of multicore machines with different architectures, while being on average 21 x faster and 14 x smaller than original benchmarks.", "paper_title": "MINIME: Pattern-Aware Multicore Benchmark Synthesizer", "paper_id": "WOS:000357929500011"}
