To fix our ideas, we apply the methodology to the problem of blind ptychographic imaging. Compared to other schemes in the literature, our approach differs in two ways: (i) it is posed within a clear mathematical framework with practical verifiable assumptions, and (ii) under the given assumptions, it is provably convergent to critical points. A numerical comparison of our proposed algorithm with the current state of the art on simulated and experimental data validates our approach and points toward directions for further improvement.", "paper_title": "Proximal Heterogeneous Block Implicit-Explicit Method and Application to Blind Ptychographic Diffraction Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000352213100014"}
