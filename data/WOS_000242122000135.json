However, these studies were on the indices based on R-tree, and there are a few studies on how to increase the search performance of the spatial data by compressing MBRs. This study was conducted in order to propose a new MBR compression scheme, SA (Semi-approximation), and a SAR-tree that indexes spatial data using R-tree. The basic idea of this paper is the compression of MBRs in a spatial index. Since SA decreases the size of MBR keys, halves QMBR enlargement, and increases node utilization. Therefore, the SAR-tree heightens the overall search performance. The experiments show that the proposed index has increased performance, higher than that of the preestablished schemes on compression of MBRs.", "paper_title": "MBR compression in spatial databases using semi-approximation scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000135"}
