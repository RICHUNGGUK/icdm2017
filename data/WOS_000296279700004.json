In the interface, a vibrating motor presents timing information to the foot, and pressure sensors measure walking pace. Our method is a combination of the walking-state monitoring and vibro-tactile feedback to maintain or promote a walking pace. Vibration stimuli with a constant presentation interval are alternately and repeatedly given to the right or left foot of the user according to the measured walking pace, and then the walking pace gradually conforms to the presented interval of the vibration. In the experiments, we specified the effective timing and intervals of the vibration stimuli for efficient inductance of walking pace. The method is applicable for training and coaching in sports and rehabilitation in health care.", "paper_title": "Pace-sync shoes: intuitive walking-pace guidance based on cyclic vibro-tactile stimulation for the foot", "paper_id": "WOS:000296279700004"}
