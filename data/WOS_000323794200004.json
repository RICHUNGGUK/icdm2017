In particular, a complete lattice is a poset that contains the infimum as well as the supremum of each of its subsets. In this paper, we introduce the quantale-based associative memory (QAM), where the notion of a quantale is defined as a complete lattice together with a binary operation that commutes with the supremum operator. We show that QAMs can be effectively used for the storage and the recall of color images. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
