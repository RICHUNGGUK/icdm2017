It can identify the elements corresponding to each other. With the rapid development of ontology applications, domain ontologies became very large in scale. Dealing with the large scale ontology mapping problems is beyond the reach of the existing algorithms. To improve this situation a modularization-oriented approach (called MOM) was proposed in this paper. This approach tries to decompose a large mapping problem into several smaller ones and use a method to reduce the complexity dramatically. Several large and complex ontologies have been chosen and tested to verify this approach. Experimental results indicate that the MOM method can significantly reduce the time cost while keeping the high mapping accuracy.", "paper_title": "Effective large scale ontology mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200038"}
