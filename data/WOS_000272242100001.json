Unconstrained registration of the carpal bones results in anatomically nonfeasible wrists. In this paper, we propose to constrain the registration using the shapes of adjacent bones, by keeping the width of the gap between adjacent bones constant. The registration is formulated as an optimization involving two terms. One term aligns the wrist bones by minimizing the distances between corresponding bone surfaces. The second term constrains the registration by minimizing the distances between adjacent sliding surfaces. The registration is based on the Iterative Closest Point algorithm. All bones are registered concurrently so that no bias is introduced towards any of the bones. The proposed registration method delivers anatomically correct configurations of the bones. The registration errors are in the order of the voxel size of the acquired CT data (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 mm(3)). The standard deviation in the widths of gaps between adjacent bones is in the order of 10% with an insignificant bias. This is a large improvement over the standard deviations of 30%-80% encountered in unconstrained registration. The value of this method is its capability of accurately registering joints in varying poses resulting in physiological joint configurations.", "paper_title": "Constrained Registration of the Wrist Joint", "paper_id": "WOS:000272242100001"}
