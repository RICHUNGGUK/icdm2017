Based on the characteristics of contractile patterns and information on their frequencies, the contractions can be investigated using essential image features extracted from WCE videos. In this study, we proposed a coherent three-stage procedure using temporal and spatial features. The possible contractions are recognized by changes in the edge structure of the intestinal folds in Stage I and evaluating similarity features in consecutive frames in Stage 2. In order to take account of the properties of contraction frequency. we consider that the possible contractions are located within windows including consecutive frames. The size of these contraction windows is adjusted according to the passage of the WCE. These procedures aim to exclude as many non-contractions as possible. True contractions are determined through spatial analysis of directional information in Stage 3. Using the proposed method, 81% of true contractions are detected with a 37% false alarm rate for evaluations in the experiments. The overall performance of this method is better than that of previous methods, in terms of both the quality and quantity indices. The results suggest feasible data for further clinical applications.
