Clinical decision support tools could improve patient fall risk identification and prevention plans, acommonconcern for nursing. This quality-improvement project used clinical decision support to improve the rate of nurse compliance with documented fall risk assessments and, for patients at high risk, fall prevention plans of care in 16 adult inpatient units. Preintervention and postintervention data were compared using quarterly audits, retrospective chart review, safety reports, and falls and falls-with-injury rates. Documentation of fall risk assessments on the 16 units improved significantly according to quarterly audit data (P =.05), whereas documentation of the plans of care did not. Retrospective chart review on two units indicated improvement for admission fall risk assessment ( P =.05) and a decrease in the documentation of the shift plan of care (P=.01); one unit had a statistically significant decrease in documentation of plans of care on admission (P=.00). Examination of safety reports for patients who fell showed all patients before and after clinical decision support had fall risk assessments documented. Falls and falls with injury did not change significantly before and after clinical decision support intervention.", "paper_title": "Clinical Decision Support for Nurses A Fall Risk and Prevention Example", "paper_id": "WOS:000369888400004"}
