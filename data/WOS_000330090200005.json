In the EEPS scheme, a base station determines either a single-hop or two-hop path that uses less energy consumption. The simulation results show that the EEPS scheme outperforms a conventional path selection scheme which uses high signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) strength based path selection in terms of system throughput and energy consumption. Also, we suggest the appropriate relay station position and optimal resource allocation for access and relay communications. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
