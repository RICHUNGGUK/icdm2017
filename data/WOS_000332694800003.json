In particular, we focus on classON(1), a tool that provides teachers and students with the appropriate information to make the most out of face-to-face sessions in the computer lab. classON has been well tested in small-medium face-to-face lab sessions and we discuss some of its characteristics (current ones and foreseen) to adapt it to massive courses. As a result, we provide a set of recommendations for adapting tools to support massive face-to-face learning activities.", "paper_title": "Adapting an Awareness Tool for Massive Courses: the Case of ClassON", "paper_id": "WOS:000332694800003"}
