In this paper, we develop a methodology for fuzzy group decision making with group consensus. Firstly, each expert makes his/her judgement on each alternative with respect to multiple criteria by the intuitionistic fuzzy sets, the group preference vectors for each alternative are calculated by the formula. Secondly, the similarity measure between two intuitionistic fuzzy sets is defined to compute each expert's decision deviation, a threshold value is used to determine the decision deviation whether be acceptable. Then, based on the expert's group consensus decision information, the group matrix is obtained by weighted similarity measure. Using the ordered weight operator, the order of the alternatives is got and the best one can be easily selected. Finally, we apply our method to facility location selection problem and the other group consensus example in [3] to verify our methodology's feasibility and effectiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
