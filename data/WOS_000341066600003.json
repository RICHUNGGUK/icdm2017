In this article, we propose VGRIS, a resource management framework for virtualized GPU resource isolation and scheduling in cloud gaming. A set of application programming interfaces (APIs) is provided so that a variety of scheduling algorithms can be implemented within the framework without modifying the framework itself. Three scheduling algorithms are implemented by the APIs within VGRIS. Experimental results show that VGRIS can effectively schedule GPU resources among various workloads.", "paper_title": "VGRIS: Virtualized GPU Resource Isolation and Scheduling in Cloud Gaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000341066600003"}
