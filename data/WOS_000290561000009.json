Microarray technology permits simultaneous monitoring of the expression levels of a large number of genes over different time points. Clustering is an important unsupervised analysis tool in this domain for finding groups of co-expressed genes. In this regard, the performance of the well-known fuzzy c-means algorithm is also studied in addition to the above mentioned soft computing-based approaches. Subsequently, support vector machine, a well-known technique for supervised learning, is utilized to improve the result of the clustering techniques. For this purpose, a fraction of the data points selected from different clusters based on their proximity to the respective centers, is used for training the support vector machine. The cluster assignments of the remaining points are thereafter determined using the trained classifier. Two publicly available benchmark microarray data sets have been used for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Biological significance tests have been performed to show that the proposed method is able to produce biologically relevant clusters of co-expressed genes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
