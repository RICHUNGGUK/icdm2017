Many of these new mechanisms have been implemented using the behaviors of certain animals, such as ants, bees, or schools of fish. These systems are called bioinspired systems and are used to improve aspects such as handling large-scale networks, provide dynamic nature, and avoid resource constraints, heterogeneity, unattended operation, or robustness, among many others. Therefore, this paper aims to study bioinspired mechanisms in the field of WSN, providing the concepts of these behavior patterns in which these new approaches are based. The paper will explain existing bioinspired systems in WSNs and analyze their impact on WSNs and their evolution. In addition, we will conduct a comprehensive review of recently proposed bioinspired systems, protocols, and mechanisms. Finally, this paper will try to analyze the applications of each bioinspired mechanism as a function of the imitated animal and the deployed application. Although this research area is considered an area with highly theoretical content, we intend to show the great impact that it is generating from the practical perspective.", "paper_title": "Systems and Algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Animal and Natural Behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000352376000001"}
