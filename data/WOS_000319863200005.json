We show that these two opposing paradigms are the consequence of two corresponding conceptions of time. In addition, we assume that the temporal aspects of a performer's interpretation of a musical composition can be linked to both paradigms. Based on this theoretical study, we propose a formalism for composing pieces of electroacoustic music that can be interpreted in performance.", "paper_title": "Towards a Hybrid Temporal Paradigm for Musical Composition and Performance: The Case of Musical Interpretation", "paper_id": "WOS:000319863200005"}
