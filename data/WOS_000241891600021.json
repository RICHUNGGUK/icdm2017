Under the ramp current stimulation, the neuron's discharge pattern gradually changes into dynamic period I discharge pattern whose ISI drops off with the ramp's amplitude increasing; and slow adaptation current gradually increases according to the linear function with the ramp's amplitude increasing, which reflects the linear cumulation of intramembranous calcium ion. Under the half wave sine current stimulation, the current frequency affects greatly the neuron's discharge patterns; and under the fixedness of the current's amplitude, the neuron presents the integral multiple period discharge pattern, the periodic parabolic bursting pattern and the chaos discharge pattern under different frequency current Stimulation. This investigation shows the mechanism of the frequency and the amplitude of the slow wave current stimulating the neuron, and the neuron's discharge patterns can be adjusted and controlled by the slow wave current. This result is of far reaching importance to study synchronization and encode of many neurons or neural network, and provides the theoretic basis for studying the mechanism of some nervous diseases such as epilepsy by the slow wave of EEG.", "paper_title": "Study on discharge patterns of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons under slow wave current stimulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600021"}
