Conditions for an N-subalgebra (resp. N-closed ideal) to be an N-closed ideal (resp. closed N-filter) are provided. Characterizations of an N-structure with N-regularity are considered. A condition for an N-closed ideal to satisfy the N-structure is discussed. The union (resp. intersection) of two N-soft BCH-algebras are discussed.", "paper_title": "Soft set theory and N-structures applied to BCH-algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000330603000006"}
