The objective of this paper is to develop a strategy which can use a set of grids with suitable local refinements for the continuity equations and Poisson's equation in 2D and 3D geometries with a high-order discretization. The advantages of this approach are presented with a filamentary discharge simulation in plane-plane geometry in nitrogen within the diffusion-drift approximation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
