Design/methodology/approach - In this algorithm, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values of channels are adaptively estimated. After analyzing the relationship between the statistics of the received vectors R and the channel SNR, an adaptive method of tuning the decoding complexity is presented. Findings - Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has greatly decreased the decoding complexity and sped up the decoding process while achieving better bit error rate performance. Originality/value - Simulation experiments described in this paper show that the proposed algorithm can decrease the decoding complexity, shorten the decoding time and achieve good decoding performance.", "paper_title": "Adaptive SNR estimation algorithms for decoding block turbo codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000281928100010"}
