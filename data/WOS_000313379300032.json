It is one of the crucial steps in embedded system design. For a given task, hardware with different areas may provide different execution speeds due to the potential of parallel execution in hardware implementation. Thus, one task may have multiple-choice in hardware implementation according to the available hardware areas. Existing HW/SW partitioning approaches typically consider only a single implementation manner in hardware, overlooking the multiple-choice of hardware implementations. This paper presents a computing model to cater for the HW/SW partitioning problems with the multiple-choice implementation in hardware. An efficient heuristic algorithm is proposed to rapidly generate approximate solution, that is further refined by a tabu search algorithm also customized in this paper. Moreover, a dynamic programming algorithm is proposed for the exact solution of the relatively small problems. Extensive simulation results show that the approximate solutions are very close to the exact ones, and they can be refined by tabu search to the solutions with the error no more than 1.5% for all cases considered in this paper.
