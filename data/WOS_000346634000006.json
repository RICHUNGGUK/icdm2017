The processor system can perform temporally fine-grained power gating and achieve longer standby times. Area overheads incurred by the backup circuits are kept small because the crystalline oxide semiconductor transistors are stacked on silicon transistors.", "paper_title": "EMBEDDED SRAM AND CORTEX-M0 CORE USING A 60-NM CRYSTALLINE OXIDE SEMICONDUCTOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000346634000006"}
