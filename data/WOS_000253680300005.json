In order to suppress coefficients errors due to process variation, this structure can be reused to automatically tune the integration capacitor to a value with acceptable error. Both the auto-tuning function and jitter error compensation function are suitable for active-RC integrator and Gm-C integrator. This structure is implemented in a third-order single-bit CT Sigma Delta modulator operating at sampling frequency of 200 MHz and OSR = 48. Compared with modulator without compensation, the SNR is simulated to be improved by 30 dB under a clock jitter of 2.5%. The coefficients of modulator are simulated to be tuned to the value with the error of less than 2.8% under the process variation of 70 - 130%.", "paper_title": "A clock jitter error compensation and auto-tuning structure for continuous-time Sigma Delta modulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000253680300005"}
