Previous works on Dynamic Traffic Grooming (DTG) did not consider the signaling and related information update. The performance is poor when we incorporate the signaling requirement in previous DTG algorithms. This shows that the effect of signaling cannot be ignored in a practical network. In this paper, we discuss the effect of signaling on DTG, and propose a new technique called DTG-PRL to handle the DTG problem. In DTG-PRL, we divide the DTG into two steps: (1) pre-reserve some lightpaths based on statistical traffic observations and (2) dynamically groom the traffic based on the established virtual topology. We have developed an ILP formulation and a heuristic algorithm for the purpose. The simulation results show that the DTG-PRL outperforms previous DTG algorithms in IP Bandwidth Blocking Probability, Network Resource Utilization, Connection Setup Time and Control Message Efficiency. This demonstrates the usefulness of DTG-PRL in practical networks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
