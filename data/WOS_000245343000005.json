High-level representations such as time-frequency maps convey a wealth of useful information, but they involve a large number of parameters that make statistical investigations of many signals difficult at present. In this paper, we describe a method that performs drastic reduction in the complexity of time-frequency representations through a modelling of the maps by elementary functions. The method is validated on artificial signals and subsequently applied to electrophysiological brain signals (local field potential) recorded from the olfactory bulb of rats while they are trained to recognize odours. From hundreds of experimental recordings, reproducible time-frequency events are detected, and relevant features are extracted, which allow further information processing, such as automatic classification.
