This paper presents an efficient iterative algorithm for finding optimal thresholds that minimize a weighted sum-of-squared-error objective function. We have proven that the proposed algorithm is mathematically equivalent to the well-known Otsu's method, but requires much less computation. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of thresholds t+o be calculated as against the exponential complexity of the Otsu's algorithm. Experimental results have verified the theoretical analysis and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
