It is found that neither particle strength nor confining pressure had much effect on the particle size distribution of completely broken particles. That is, the aggregates with different particle strengths have approximately the same fractal dimension. Hardin's relative breakage was modified based on the concept of optimum distribution. Also, a relationship between relative breakage and plastic work was suggested and verified in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
