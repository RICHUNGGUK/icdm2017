In some partition problems, the partition size, i.e., the number of nonempty parts in a partition, is fixed; while in others, the size can vary arbitrarily. We call the former the size-partition problem and the latter the open-partition problem. In general, it is much harder to solve open problems since the objective functions depend on size. In this paper, we propose a new approach by allowing empty parts and transform the open problem into a size problem allowing empty parts, called a relaxed-size problem. While the sortability theory has been established in the literature as a powerful tool to attack size partition problems, we develop the sortability theory for relaxed-size problems as a medium to solve open problems.", "paper_title": "A new approach to solve open-partition problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299081200006"}
