The FIFO size is proportional to the length of the filters and input data width, causing large area and power consumption. We have proposed an energy- and area-efficient FIFO design for image/video applications through FIFO with error-reduced data compression (FERDC) and near-threshold operation. On architecture level, FERDC technique is proposed to reduce the size and power consumption of the FIFO by utilizing the spatial correlation between neighboring pixels and performing error-reduced data compression together with quantization to minimize the mean square error (MSE). On circuit level, near-threshold operation is adopted to achieve further power reduction while maintaining the required performance. To demonstrate the proposed FIFO, it has been implemented using a 0.18-mu m CMOS process technology. The implementation covers different FIFO length, including 128, 256, 512, and 1024. The experimental results show that the proposed FIFO operating at 0.5 V and 28.57 MHz achieves up to 99%, 65%, and 34.91% reduction in dynamic power, leakage power, and area, respectively, with a small MSE of 2.76, compared with the conventional FIFO design. The proposed FIFO can be applied to a wide range of image/video signal processing applications to achieve high area and energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "An Area- and Energy-Efficient FIFO Design Using Error-Reduced Data Compression and Near-Threshold Operation for Image/Video Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000005"}
