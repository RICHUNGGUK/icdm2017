We show that if at least 50% of the (partial) support information is accurate, then weighted minimization is stable and robust under weaker sufficient conditions than the analogous conditions for standard minimization. Moreover, weighted minimization provides better upper bounds on the reconstruction error in terms of the measurement noise and the compressibility of the signal to be recovered. We illustrate our results with extensive numerical experiments on synthetic data and real audio and video signals.", "paper_title": "Recovering Compressively Sampled Signals Using Partial Support Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000300246900040"}
