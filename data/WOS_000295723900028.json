The molar ratio is altered by manipulating the monomer and hydrogen feed rates using nonlinear model predictive controller. The simulation revealed promising results however a trade-off between utilizing both the monomer and hydrogen flows simultaneously and the hydrogen flow exclusively exists. Utilization of the monomer and hydrogen flows together favors the rapid transition to the required MWD but at the expense of higher purge and inconsistent production rate. Exclusive use of the hydrogen intake leads to steady production rate and less consumption of the purge. However, longer time is needed to achieve the desired MWD. The same phenomena are observed when discrete mechanism for product withdrawal is implemented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
