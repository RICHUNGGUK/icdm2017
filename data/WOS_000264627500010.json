We first assume that a decentralized output feedback controller has been designed for a multi-channel continuous-time system so that the closed-loop system is Hurwitz stable and a desired H-infinity disturbance attenuation level is achieved. However, since the local measurement outputs are quantized by a general quantizer before they are passed to the controller, the system's performance is not guaranteed. For this reason, we propose a local-output-dependent strategy for updating the quantizers' parameters, so that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and achieves the same H-infinity disturbance attenuation level. We also extend the discussion and the result to the case of multi-channel discrete-time H-infinity feedback control systems.", "paper_title": "A STUDY ON DECENTRALIZED H-infinity FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH LOCAL QUANTIZERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264627500010"}
