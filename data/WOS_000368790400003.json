The decreasing feature size makes it harder to make DRAM cells which can keep the current data-holding time. When DRAM cells cannot hold data for a long time, DRAM chips need a more frequent refreshing operation. Therefore, in the near future, time and energy cost on DRAM refreshing will be no longer trivial. In this paper, we propose DRAM Error Correction Pointer (ECP), an error-correction-manner framework, to reduce DRAM refreshes without data loss. We exploit the non-uniform feature of DRAM cells with respect to the data retention time. Compared with the conventional refreshing mechanisms, which refresh DRAM chips by the retention time of the leakiest cells, we refresh the chips much fewer times, and treat the not-in-time refreshed cells as fault elements. We use the structure of ECP as a fault tolerant element. By recording the data which are supposed to be written into the leaky cells in our DRAM-ECP structures, DRAM-ECP can significantly decrease refreshing frequency. When these data are to be read out, DRAM-ECP retrieves the data stored in ECPs and covers them to the corresponding position in the data row. Our experiments show that DRAM-ECP can reduce over 70% refreshing operations than the current refreshing mechanism and also get significant energy saving.", "paper_title": "Reducing DRAM refreshing in an error correction manner", "paper_id": "WOS:000368790400003"}
