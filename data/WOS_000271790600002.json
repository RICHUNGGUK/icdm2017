The SOoA is pivotal in a refined version of a recently-introduced methodology for formulating excitation-adaptive wave equation FDTD (WE-FDTD) schemes, described below. This concept is the basis for a unified classification for both existing and new schemes. Both one- and two-dimensional cases are presented for boundless, source free, homogeneous, isotropic and lossless media. The 1-D and 2-D cases are developed in detail for the (3,2M + 1) (temporal, spatial) and (3,3) 2-D stencils, respectively. Stability analysis is built into the methodology in terms of either analytical conditions or \"stability maps\" defined herein. The methodology is seen as a generalization of many existing schemes that also provides a unified tool for a systematical design of WE-FDTD schemes subject to specific requirements in terms of the spectral content of the excitation. The computational efficiency for all schemes remains the same for a given stencil, since the core of the FDTD code is unchanged between schemes, the difference being only in the values of scheme coefficients.
