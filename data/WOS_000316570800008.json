This paper presents a signed-distance-based method for determining the objective importance of criteria and handling fuzzy, multiple criteria group decision-making problems in a flexible and intelligent way. These advantages arise from the method's use of interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to represent alternative ratings and the importance of various criteria. An integrated approach to determine the overall importance of the criteria is also developed using the subjective information provided by decision-makers and the objective information delivered by the decision matrix. In addition, a linear programming model is developed to estimate criterion weights and to extend the proposed multiple criteria decision analysis method. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods are illustrated by a group decision-making problem of patient-centered medicine in basilar artery occlusion.", "paper_title": "A signed-distance-based approach to importance assessment and multi-criteria group decision analysis based on interval type-2 fuzzy set", "paper_id": "WOS:000316570800008"}
