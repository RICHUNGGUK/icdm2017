This may be avoided by using optimal machining parameters, e.g. feed-rate, and continuing to monitor it throughout the machining process. To optimize feed-rate, we propose a system that consists of an optimisation module, a process control module and a knowledge based evaluation module. STEP-NC is the underlying data model for optimisation. Given the nominal powers, the cutting force can be estimated based on the higher-level production information such as workpiece properties, tool materials and geometries, and machine capabilities. The main function of the Process Control module is process monitoring and control. The output is the desired actual feed-rate. Finally, the actual feed-rate is recorded and evaluated in the Knowledge Based Evaluation module.", "paper_title": "A framework for machining optimisation based on STEP-NC", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160600007"}
