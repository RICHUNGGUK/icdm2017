Many researchers rely on closed source software which is not ubiquitously available, and gives only little control over the computation and data presentation. R in contrast, is open source, highly adaptable and provides numerous utilities for data import, sophisticated statistical analysis and presentation in publication quality. This article covers methods, implemented in the MBmca package, for DNA Melting Curve Analysis on microbead surfaces. Particularly, the use of the second derivative melting peaks is suggested as an additional parameter to characterize the melting behavior of DNA duplexes. Examples of microbead surface Melting Curve Analysis on fragments of human genes are presented.", "paper_title": "Surface Melting Curve Analysis with R", "paper_id": "WOS:000330193300005"}
