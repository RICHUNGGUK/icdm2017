RPC requires that server must be certain and online all the time, which will endow the server with heavy burden and the system with single dependence on the server. The task certification and result certification, based on SPKI, are proposed to transform the RPC to Request/Response of XML-fonned Certification. DHT is used to store and look up the certificates, which enable MR2CG (the Method of Coarse-Grained P2P Computing Based on XML Request/Response) to get rid of the limitation of the server and support the different kinds of Coarse-grained P2P computing.", "paper_title": "The coarse-grained computing P2P algorithm based on SPKI", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100048"}
