Therefore, durability based design of concrete structures in severe condition has gained great significance in recent decades and various mathematical models for estimating the service life of rein-forced concrete have been proposed. In spite of comprehensive researches on the corrosion of rein-forced concrete, there are still various controversial concepts in quantitation of durability parameters such as chloride diffusion coefficient and surface chloride content. Effect of environment conditions on the durability of concrete structures is one of the most important issues. Hence, regional investigations are necessary for durability based design and evaluation of the models. Persian Gulf is one of the most aggressive regions of the world because of elevated temperature and humidity as well as high content of chloride ions in seawater. The aim of this study is evaluation of some parameters of durability of RC structures in marine environment from viewpoint of corrosion initiation. For this purpose, some experiments were carried out on the real RC structures and in laboratory. The result showed that various uncertainties in parameters of durability were existed.", "paper_title": "Assessment of some parameters of corrosion initiation prediction of reinforced concrete in marine environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000330971600005"}
