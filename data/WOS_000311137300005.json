However, in sparse mobile ad hoc networks where end-to-end connectivity cannot be achieved and store-carry-forward algorithms are needed, such worst-case analyses have not been possible to perform on real mobility traces due to lack of suitable models. We propose a new metric called delay expansion that reflects connectivity and reachability properties of intermittently connected networks. Using the delay expansion, we show how bounds on worst-case latency can be derived for a general class of broadcast protocols and a wide range of real mobility patterns. The paper includes theoretical results that show how worst-case latency can be related with delay expansion for a given mobility scenario, as well as simulations to validate the theoretical model.", "paper_title": "Worst-case latency of broadcast in intermittently connected networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000311137300005"}
