These systems are proposed as a novel approach to the analysis and simulation of the behavior of complex systems. We introduce all necessary definitions of these systems and of their dynamical aspects, we describe the functioning of the parallel and stochastic algorithm used in computer simulation, and evaluate its time complexity. Finally, we show some applications of dynamical probabilistic P systems for the investigation of the dynamics of the Lotka-Volterra system and of metapopulation systems.", "paper_title": "Dynamical probabilistic P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235344700011"}
