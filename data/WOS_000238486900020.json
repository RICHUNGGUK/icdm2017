This framework is independent of specific modelling approaches or technologies and as such provides an objective means of delineating the exception-handling capabilities of specific workflow systems. It is subsequently used to assess the level of exceptions support provided by eight commercial workflow systems and business process modelling and execution languages. On the basis of these investigations, we propose a graphical, tool-independent language for defining exception handling strategies in workflows.", "paper_title": "Workflow exception patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000238486900020"}
