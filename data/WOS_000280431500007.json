A very huge number of videos of news, shows, series, movies, and so on have to be stored with the aim of being accessed later on. Moreover, channels have a clear need of sharing videos so as to settle a real collaboration among them that minimizes the cost of information acquisition. These features demand a huge storage capacity and a sharing information environment. Both requirements can be solved by using grid computing. It provides both computing and storage capacities to store that great volume of data required, as well as the resource sharing capabilities for the cooperation of different TV channels. This paper presents a video retrieval system that covers these needs and suggests a work allocation (WA) broker to improve the performance of video accesses. An evaluation shows the feasibility and the scalability of this approach showing the benefits of the WA made to store and retrieve large video data.
