Our own approach is based on the intuitive engineering idea of space mapping. In this article, we explain the art of microwave design optimization through tuning space mapping procedures. We list various appropriate types of models (called surrogates). We demonstrate the implementation of these surrogates through a simple bandstop filter. We provide application examples using commercial simulation software. Our purpose is to help microwave engineers understand the tuning space mapping methodology and to inspire new implementations and applications. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
