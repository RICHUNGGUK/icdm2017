Gaining insight into what actually makes a hit song would provide tremendous benefits for the music industry. In this research we tackle this question by focussing on the dance hit song classification problem. A database of dance hit songs from 1985 until 2013 is built, including basic musical features, as well as more advanced features that capture a temporal aspect. Anumber of different classifiers are used to build and test dance hit prediction models. The resulting best model has a good performance when predictingwhether a song is a 'top 10' dance hit versus a lower listed position.", "paper_title": "Dance Hit Song Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000342325300005"}
