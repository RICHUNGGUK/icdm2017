For example, any loading vector can be multiplied by 1 if another vector of that particular component is also multiplied by 1 without affecting the loss function values. This sometimes causes problems, for example, with respect to interpretation. In this paper, a method is developed to fix the sign indeterminacy for the PARAFAC, Tucker3 and PARAFAC2 models.
