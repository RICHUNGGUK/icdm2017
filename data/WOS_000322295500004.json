The delivery time of any product is the maximum of the suppliers' delivery time of the parts needed for that product. We assume that the final stage is non-bottleneck. Chen and Hall (2007) show that the suppliers' problem of minimizing the total weighted number of tardy parts is binary (i.e., weakly) NP-hard and left open whether it is unary (i.e., strongly) NP-hard. In this paper we resolve this open problem by showing that it is unary NP-hard. Moreover we show that the suppliers' problem of minimizing the total late work of parts is also unary NP-hard.
