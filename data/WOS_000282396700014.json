We first identify through extensive statistical experimentation which parameters of the medium suffer a significant deviation from normality, then we construct a very efficient blind steganalytic algorithm based on their use. We finally present the results obtained with this steganalytic approach over various sets of mp3 files, and an algorithm for the estimation of the amount of hidden data.", "paper_title": "Blind Steganalysis of Mp3stego", "paper_id": "WOS:000282396700014"}
