Normal design procedures result in a set of values for the discrete components that do not match with the preferred set of values. This results in the selection of approximated values that cause error in the associated design process. An optimal solution to the design problem would include selection of the best possible set of components from the numerous possible combinations. The search procedure for such an optimal solution necessitates the usage of Evolutionary Computation (EC) as a potential tool for determining the best possible set of circuit components. Recently algorithms based on Swarm Intelligence (SI) have gained prominence due to the underlying focus on collective intelligent behavior. In this paper a novel hybrid variant of a swarm-based metaheuristics called Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed and shall be referred to as CRbABC_Dt (Collective Resource-based ABC with Decentralized tasking) and it incorporates the idea of decentralization of attraction from super-fit members along with neighborhood information and wider exploration of search space. Two separate filter design instances have been tested using CRbABC_Dt algorithm and the results obtained are compared with several competitive state-of-the-art optimizing algorithms. All the components considered in the design are selected from standard series and the resulting deviation from the idealized design procedure has been investigated. Additional empirical experimentation has also been included based on the benchmarking problems proposed for the CEC 2013 Special Session & Competition on Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization.
