In this paper, we study the synchronization role of coupled chaotic oscillators in networks of general topology. Specifically, a rigorous proof is presented to show that a large number of oscillators with arbitrary geometrical connections can be synchronized by providing a sufficiently strong coupling strength. Moreover, the results presented in this paper not only are valid to a wide class of chaotic oscillators, but also cover the parameter mismatch case. Finally, we show how the obtained result can be applied to construct an oscillatory network for scene segmentation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
