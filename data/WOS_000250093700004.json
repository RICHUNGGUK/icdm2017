The generalized parallel error correcting codes can handle with more errors compared with the original ones. We show construction methods of independent and non-independent parallel error correcting codes and decoding methods. We derive some bounds about the size of respective parallel error correcting codes. The obtained results imply a single parallel error correcting code can be constructed by two or more kinds of error correcting codes with distinct error correcting capabilities.", "paper_title": "A generalization of the parallel error correcting codes by allowing some random errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093700004"}
