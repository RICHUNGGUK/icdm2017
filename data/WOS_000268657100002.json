The EuQoS architecture preserves the openness and the decentralized decision model of the actual Internet, runs on off-the-shelf hardware and network equipment, and allows end users to request various services without changing the Application Signaling protocol, while meeting regulators' and users' Net Neutrality requirements. This paper presents the key elements of the EuQoS architecture and describes the main results obtained in field trials performed on a fully-functional EuQoS system prototype developed over a pan-European testbed. Furthermore, the paper discusses the main strengths of the system and the issues related to its actually deployment on a large scale, from both technical and market points of view.
