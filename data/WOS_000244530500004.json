This paper proposes a Sensor-based Pervasive Healthcare (SPH) System, which comprises the Home Healthcare End (HHE) system, E-healthcare Service Provider (ESP) and E-healthcare Control Center (ECC). At the ECC, healthcare professionals remotely monitor the physiological status of patients using the WSN-based HHE system. The ESPs provide patients and healthcare professionals of the ECC with healthcare information services. The ESP is developed based on proposed Healthcare Service Middleware (HSM), which integrates the heterogeneous computing and communication devices, and provides the flexible healthcare platform to enrich the healthcare services. Additionally, a Seamless Healthcare Information Delivery (SHID) scheme is proposed to allow healthcare professionals to access patients' with their relevant healthcare data anywhere in real-time without manual manipulations. The ultimate objective of the proposed SPH system is to effectively reduce healthcare labor and to further provide a streamlined, convenient, and low cost healthcare platform for patients and healthcare professionals.", "paper_title": "Sensor-based pervasive healthcare system: Design and implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000244530500004"}
