We argue in this experience report that the \"EDSL approach\" can surprisingly ease the task of building a high-assurance compiler. We do not strive to build a fully formally-verified tool-chain, but take a \"do-it-yourself\" approach to increase our confidence in compiler-correctness without too much effort. Copilot is an EDSL developed by Galois, Inc. and the National Institute of Aerospace under contract to NASA for the purpose of runtime monitoring of flight-critical avionics.
