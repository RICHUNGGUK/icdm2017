In addition, the automobile makers are trying to popularize the start stop system by combining the system to the generalized smart key system to not only arouse purchasing but also provide the convenience and reduce the energy consumption as well. In this paper, we designed and implemented the start stop system algorithm for the aftermarket smart key system which uses the OBD-II interface. The implemented start stop system is capable of controlling two independent systems, both an eco-friendly start stop system and a convenient smart key system, on a single ECU. Furthermore, the implemented start sop system standardizes the interface with the vehicles to reduce the time required for installing the start stop system to the various vehicles, and satisfies every standard response time limit for the vehicle status request signals.", "paper_title": "The implementation of start stop system with the OBD-II interface in the automotive smart key system", "paper_id": "WOS:000361492600021"}
