The proposed scheme enables quality of service (QoS) agreements per data item, contrary to the per-dataset approach of existing solutions. Constraints abiding by any of the existing models (impatience, utility, and waiting time) are allowed to exist concurrently. The impact of individual agreements on the system's performance as a whole is analytically studied and quantified. Comparison with related approaches rendered the proposed scheme optimally efficient and flexible enough to serve as a basis for the implementation of specialized QoS metrics as well.", "paper_title": "Optimal Periodic Scheduling Under Multimodel Per-Item Constraints in Wireless Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000310139700024"}
