We consider sorting procedures applying general additive value functions compatible with the given assignment examples. For the decision alternatives, we provide four types of results: (1) necessary and possible assignments from Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR), (2) class acceptability indices from a suitably adapted Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) model, (3) necessary and possible assignment-based preference relations, and (4) assignment-based pair-wise outranking indices. We show how the results provided by ROR and SMAA complement each other and combine them under a unified decision aiding framework. Application of the approach is demonstrated by classifying 27 countries in 4 democracy regimes. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
