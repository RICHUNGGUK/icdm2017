The ANDD representation at a pixel is a function of the oriented angle and characterizes the local directional grayscale variation around the pixel. The proposed corner detector fuses the ideas of the contour-and intensity-based detection. It consists of three cascaded blocks. First, the edge map of an image is obtained by the Canny detector and from which contours are extracted and patched. Next, the ANDD representation at each pixel on contours is calculated and normalized by its maximal magnitude. The area surrounded by the normalized ANDD representation forms a new corner measure. Finally, the nonmaximum suppression and thresholding are operated on each contour to find corners in terms of the corner measure. Moreover, a corner classifier based on the peak number of the ANDD representation is given. Experiments are made to evaluate the proposed detector and classifier. The proposed detector is competitive with the two recent state-of-the-art corner detectors, the He & Yung detector and CPDA detector, in detection capability and attains higher repeatability under affine transforms. The proposed classifier can discriminate effectively simple corners, Y-type corners, and higher order corners.", "paper_title": "Corner Detection and Classification Using Anisotropic Directional Derivative Representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000321926600024"}
