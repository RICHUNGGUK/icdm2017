For comparison, other fullerene oxides C60O29, C60O3, C60O2 and C60O were also studied. The highly symmetrical Ih structure of the parent C-60 is reserved in C60O30 and C60O30 was calculated to be a nonpolar molecule. It was demonstrated that C60O30 should be more stable than other C-60 oxides such as C60O29, C60O3, C60O2 and C60O. Compared with C-60, it is less possible for C60O30 to accept or donate electrons from the reduced EAs and enhanced IPs. The IR active modes and harmonic vibrational frequencies of C60O30 were also discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
