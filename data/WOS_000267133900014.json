An advantage of this formulation is that it allows for a thermodynamically consistent treatment of the interface conditions in the presence of a contact point involving a third phase. It is argued that such an approach in fact represents a closure model for the original system and some of its key properties are investigated. We describe an efficient iterative solution method for the Stefan problem formulated in this way which uses shape differentiation and adjoint equations to determine the gradient of the cost functional. Performance of the proposed approach is illustrated with sample computations concerning 2D steady solidification phenomena. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
