Based on the various solutions of the proposed model, we outline the optimization strategy of null space of within-class scatter matrix and the framework of complex PCA for classification purpose. We test the performance of the proposed algorithms on the ORL and Yale face databases. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are effective. Particularly, the complex PCA enhanced by complex LDA appears to be the best among the considered algorithms in terms of recognition performance and is robust against noises. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
