This model is also an extension of the dirty-paper channel introduced by Costa since its main channel is the dirty-paper channel. A perfect-secrecy-achieving coding strategy for the model is proposed. It is used to derive achievable rates with asymptotic perfect secrecy and an achievable rate-equivocation region. The achievable rates with asymptotic perfect-secrecy are then compared to upper and lower bounds. The comparison indicates that the proposed coding strategy is optimal in some cases.", "paper_title": "An achievable region for the Gaussian wiretap channel with side information", "paper_id": "WOS:000237147400027"}
