In this letter, we investigate the efficient use of multiple radio access technologies (RATs) to improve the energy efficiency in cooperative networks. Considering the circuit power consumption of each RAT, we study energy-efficient best-select relaying and show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms traditional best-select relaying as well as direct communications.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Cooperative Relaying in Heterogeneous Radio Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300018"}
