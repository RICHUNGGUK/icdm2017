We show that if a uniformly best biased (UBB) estimator exists, then it is unique, and it can be directly obtained from any locally best biased (LBB) estimator. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a UBB estimator is derived. It is shown that if there exists an optimal bias, such that this condition is satisfied, then it is unique, and its closed-form expression is obtained. The proposed approach is exemplified in two nonlinear estimation problems, where uniformly minimum-variance-unbiased estimators do not exist. In the considered examples, we show that the UBB estimators outperform the corresponding maximum-likelihood estimators in the MSE sense.", "paper_title": "Uniformly Best Biased Estimators in Non-Bayesian Parameter Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000297046100032"}
