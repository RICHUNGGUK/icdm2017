This paper examines the implementation of CRM at the Housing and Development Board (HDB) in Singapore. The CRM architecture (comprising operational CRM, collaborative CRM and analytical CRM) deployed at HDB reflects a holistic approach to CRM implementation that integrates three key perspectives of CRM, namely, the business, technology and customer perspectives. Drawing from the case study, we present a holistic framework for CRM that binds information technologies with business processes for the delivery of high service quality. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
