Our method addresses directional stippling, where the collective flows of dots are directed parallel and/or orthogonal to the local feature orientations. To facilitate regular and directional spacing of dots, we introduce the notion of a structure grid, which is extracted from the smoothed feature orientation field. We represent a structure grid as a 2D texture and develop an efficient construction algorithm that outperforms conventional Lloyd's method in terms of the rigor of dot alignment. Moreover, the criss-crossing nature of a structure grid allows for the inclusion of line primitives, providing effective description of dark tone. Given a structure grid, we determine the appropriate positions and attributes of primitives in the final illustration via rapid pixel-based primitive rendering. Experimental results show that our directional stippling method nicely reproduces features and tones of various input images. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
