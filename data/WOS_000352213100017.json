To this end, we prove a general theorem for how, and under which assumptions, domain characterizations based on the range of the square root of an operator transform into domain characterizations based on the operator itself. To show the flexibility of this general theory, we apply this general principle to a variety of shape determination problems in inverse acoustic and electromagnetic scattering theory and inverse elliptic boundary value problems. Further, we also establish a regularization strategy for noisy measurement operators.", "paper_title": "Indicator Functions for Shape Reconstruction Related to the Linear Sampling Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000352213100017"}
