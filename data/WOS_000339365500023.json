This article aims to develop an effective and practical algorithm of joint subcarrier, code, and power allocation for parallel multi-radio access of the downlink in heterogeneous wireless networks (e.g., CDMA and OFDMA). Firstly, we propose a unified framework to formulate the subcarrier, code, and power allocation as an optimization problem. Secondly, we propose a resource element (subcarrier and code) scheme based on the threshold type. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing algorithm for considered wireless scenarios.", "paper_title": "Joint subcarrier, code, and power allocation for parallel multi-radio access in heterogeneous wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339365500023"}
