In this paper, we focus on the spatial resolution scalability of H. 264/SVC and propose a blind video watermarking algorithm for the copyright protection of H. 264/SVC coded video. The watermark embedding occurs before the H. 264/SVC encoding, and only the original enhancement layer sequence is watermarked. However, because the watermark is embedded into the average matrix of each macro block, it can be detected in both the enhancement layer and base layer after downsampling, video encoding, and video decoding. The proposed algorithm is examined using JSVM, and experiment results show that is robust to H. 264/SVC coding and has little influence on video quality.", "paper_title": "Video Watermarking Algorithm for H.264 Scalable Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000315022000004"}
