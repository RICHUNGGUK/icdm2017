The discretized Jensen inequality and lower bounds lemma are adopted to deal with the involved finite sum quadratic terms, and a sufficient condition is derived to ensure the considered neural networks to be globally asymptotically stable in the mean square and strictly (Q, S, R)-gamma-dissipative, which is delay-dependent in the sense that it depends on not only the discrete delay but also the finite-distributed delay. Based on the dissipativity criterion, some special cases are also discussed. Compared with the existing ones, the merit of the proposed results in this paper lies in their reduced conservatism and less decision variables. Three examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and benefits of our theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Dissipativity Analysis for Discrete-Time Stochastic Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000314843800001"}
