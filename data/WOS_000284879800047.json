As part of this study, we aim to comprehensively evaluate existing rate adaptation algorithms in real environments. Further, if required, we aim to develop a simple, low-overhead rate adaptation algorithm suited for vehicular WiFi access.", "paper_title": "Vehicular WiFi Access and Rate Adaptation", "paper_id": "WOS:000284879800047"}
