The realization is through the use of a properly embedded structured light sensing scheme that enables a regular light-colored table surface to serve the dual roles of both a projection screen and a touch-sensitive display surface. A random binary pattern is employed to code structured light in pixel accuracy, which is embedded into the regular projection display in a way that the user perceives only regular display but not the structured pattern hidden in the display. With the projection display on the table surface being imaged by a camera, the observed image data, plus the known projection content, can work together to probe the 3-D workspace immediately above the table surface, like deciding if there is a finger present and if the finger touches the table surface, and if so, at what position on the table surface the contact is made. All the decisions hinge upon a careful calibration of the projector-camera-table surface system, intelligent segmentation of the hand in the image data, and exploitation of the homography mapping existing between the projector's display panel and the camera's image plane. Extensive experimentation including evaluation of the display quality, hand segmentation accuracy, touch detection accuracy, trajectory tracking accuracy, multitouch capability and system efficiency are shown to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed realization.", "paper_title": "Touchscreen Everywhere: On Transferring a Normal Planar Surface to a Touch-Sensitive Display", "paper_id": "WOS:000342226900012"}
