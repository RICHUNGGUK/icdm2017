We prove that, for a given bit budget, the set of optimal nonnegative integer-valued bit allocations is equal to the set of nonnegative integer-valued bit allocation vectors which minimize the Euclidean distance to the optimal real-valued bit-allocation vector of Huang and Schultheiss. We also give an algorithm for finding optimal nonnegative integer-valued bit allocations. The algorithm has lower computational complexity than Fox's algorithm, as the bit budget grows. Finally, we compare the performance of the Huang-Schultheiss solution to that of an optimal integer-valued bit allocation. Specifically, we derive upper and lower bounds on the deviation of the mean-squared error (MSE) using optimal integer-valued bit allocation from the MSE using optimal real-valued bit allocation. It is shown that, for asymptotically large transmission rates, optimal integer-valued bit allocations do not necessarily achieve the same performance as that predicted by Huang-Schultheiss for optimal real-valued bit allocations.", "paper_title": "Quantization of multiple sources using nonnegative integer bit allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805700013"}
