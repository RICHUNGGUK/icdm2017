However, at times the techniques used to fit the power law distribution have been inappropriate. This paper describes the poweRlaw R package, which makes fitting power laws and other heavy-tailed distributions straight forward. This package contains R functions for fitting, comparing and visualizing heavy tailed distributions. Overall, it provides a principled approach to power law fitting.", "paper_title": "Fitting Heavy Tailed Distributions: The poweRlaw Package", "paper_id": "WOS:000352910600001"}
