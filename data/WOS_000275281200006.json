The test statistic is in the form of an L2 distance between the empirical characteristic function of the residuals in a parametric regression fit and the corresponding empirical characteristic function of the residuals in a non-parametric regression fit. The asymptotic null distribution as well as the behavior of the test statistic under contiguous alternatives is investigated.
