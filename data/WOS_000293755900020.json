While such methods are an important part of an overall anti-Trojan strategy, it is statistically inevitable that some Trojans will escape verification-stage detection, in particular in light of the increasing size and complexity of system-on-chip (SoC) solutions and the increasing use of third-party designs. In contrast with much of the previous work in this area, we specifically focus on run-time methods to identify the attacks of a Trojan and to adapt the system and respond accordingly. We describe a solution including a bus architecture in which the arbitration, address decoding, multiplexing, wrapping, and other components protect against malicious use of the bus.", "paper_title": "A System-On-Chip Bus Architecture for Thwarting Integrated Circuit Trojan Horses", "paper_id": "WOS:000293755900020"}
