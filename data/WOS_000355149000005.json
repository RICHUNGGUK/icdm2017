Although various considerations such as non-isothermal mixing and bypass streams are applied to consider real world alternatives in modeling phase, many challenges are faced because of its properties within non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). We propose a modified superstructure, which contains a utility substage for use in considering multiple utilities in a simultaneous MINLP model. To improve model size and convergence, fixed utility locations according to temperature and series connections between utilities are suggested. The numbers of constraints, discrete, and continuous variables show that overall model size decreases compared with previous research. Thus, it is possible to expand the feasible search area for reaching the nearest global solution. The model's effectiveness and applications are exemplified by several literature problems, where it is used to deduce a network superior to that of any other reported methodology.
