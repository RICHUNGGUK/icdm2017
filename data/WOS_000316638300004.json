Robustness of performance under uncertainty is typically ensured by minimizing the variation of the performance function, usually modeled by its variance or standard deviation. Such moment-based methods generally become cumbersome to solve as the number of performance functions increases, because of a large number of objective functions. The current paper proposes a new approach that tackles both robustness and optimality using the joint probability density function of all the performance functions. For a set of designer-specified thresholds, which can be viewed as upper bounds on the performance functions (for minimization), joint optimality is ensured by maximizing a single quantity irrespective of the number of performance functions: the joint probability that the design's performance is bounded by the thresholds. To ensure joint robustness, we minimize a single scalar quantity irrespective of the number of performance functions: the determinant of the covariance matrix of the performance functions. Two examples are presented: an automobile side impact problem with two performance functions and a two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle conceptual design problem with three performance functions.", "paper_title": "Design optimization for robustness in multiple performance functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000316638300004"}
