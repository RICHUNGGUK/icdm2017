We solve a variant of this question. For every f, we prove that the task of computing, on input x and y, both of the quantities f (x boolean AND y) and f (x boolean OR y) has polynomially related classical and quantum bounded-error complexities. We further show that the quantum bounded-error complexity is polynomially related to the classical deterministic complexity and the block sensitivity of f. This result holds regardless of prior entanglement.", "paper_title": "ON QUANTUM-CLASSICAL EQUIVALENCE FOR COMPOSED COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000276215200005"}
