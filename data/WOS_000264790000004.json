The free surface locations are represented by volume of fluid function (VOF). The model was satisfactorily tested against empirical equation of overflow discharge at a vertical seawall, and experimental data of overtopping discharge at a sloping seawall. The validated model was used to simulate wave overtopping of the levee system during storm surge of Hurricane Katrina. The time history of wave profiles and velocity magnitude field in the vicinity of the levee are demonstrated and analyzed. It is concluded that the failure of parts of the levee system was caused by erosion during wave overtopping.
