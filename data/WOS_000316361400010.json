Using easily collected \"weak\" tracking data (short and frequently broken tracks) as input, we construct a set of entity tracks to provide more reliable entry and exit observations. These observations are then clustered to produce a set of potential entry and exit regions within the scene, and a behavior-based reliability metric is used to score each region and select the final zones. We also present an extension of our fixed-view approach to detect entry and exit regions within the entire viewspace of a pan-tilt-zoom camera. We additionally provide methods employing the regions to learn scene occlusions and causal relationships from entry-exit pairs along with exploitation algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection). Qualitative and quantitative experiments are presented using multiple outdoor surveillance cameras and demonstrate the reliability and usefulness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Detecting behavioral zones in local and global camera views", "paper_id": "WOS:000316361400010"}
