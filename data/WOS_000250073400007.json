The network synthesis problem is decomposed into three main iterative steps: (1) synthesizing a network candidate with a minimum total annual cost (TAC) according to a finite number of operating conditions; (2) performing flexibility test without considering the size restrictions to verify whether the current network candidate is operable for a large number of uncertain parameters that are generated randomly within the expected operating ranges; appending test point(s) that mostly violates the constraints of the candidate network when the network configuration is proved infeasible through simulations, then returning to step (1) again to synthesize a new candidate structure; (3) considering the size restraints that have been ignored previously, executing flexibility test to the network qualified in step (2), and increasing the size of exchange units if necessary. A few iterations of these design steps may be required to secure the desirable results. Also in this paper are several numerical examples supplied to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed strategy for the synthesis of flexible heat exchange networks or mass exchange networks.
