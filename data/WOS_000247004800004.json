Originally, the method was introduced for the application to discrete optimization problems. Recently we proposed a first ACO variant for continuous optimization. In this work we choose the training of feed-forward neural networks for pattern classification as a test case for this algorithm. In addition, we propose hybrid algorithm variants that incorporate short runs of classical gradient techniques such as back-propagation. For evaluating our algorithms we apply them to classification problems from the medical field, and compare the results to some basic algorithms from the literature. The results show, first, that the best of our algorithms are comparable to gradient-based algorithms for neural network training, and second, that our algorithms compare favorably with a basic genetic algorithm.", "paper_title": "An ant colony optimization algorithm for continuous optimization: application to feed-forward neural network training", "paper_id": "WOS:000247004800004"}
