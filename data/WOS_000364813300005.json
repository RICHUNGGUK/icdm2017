They are involved in all aspects of our daily lives and make it easier. Despite the great strides in these networks, several problems arose and are still open. The localisation of sensor networks nodes is one of the most challenging problem that has attracted many researches. Consequently, a lot of work has been carried out to provide accurate location information of sensors and sensing field. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of the most important localisation technologies proposed for WSNs. We survey different published localisation algorithms in the literature while giving an up-to-date with the most recent schemes. Then we highlight their characteristics and describe metrics used for their classification. A complete comparison will be given and also directions of future research will be discussed.", "paper_title": "Localisation algorithms for wireless sensor networks: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000364813300005"}
