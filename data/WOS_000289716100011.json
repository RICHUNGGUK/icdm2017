As a key function of JIT manufacturing, the material delivery characterised by real time, accuracy and optimisation can make sure of JIT's implementation in enterprises effectively and efficiently. In the study, we present a new kind of real-time optimal material delivery method for plant production by utilising radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. In the method, the precise and visual layouts for the whole physical plant and all kinds of its inner manufacturing resources such as machines, RFID devices, forklifts and inventories are realised. Later, the mathematical model for dynamically obtaining the optimal routes for forklifts is established by taking the minimal travel distance as the objective. Particularly, to solve the problem, a real-time optimum route planning method based on the ant colony optimisation (ACO) algorithm is developed. In order to monitor and navigate the forklifts in real time during material distribution in the plant for material delivery planners and operators, a position locating scheme for forklifts and materials is proposed. Finally, a case study is carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the presented method, which establishes the base for implementing JIT manufacturing in plant production.", "paper_title": "A radio frequency identification based optimal material delivery method for digital plant production", "paper_id": "WOS:000289716100011"}
