Today's I/O-intensive workloads require architectures whose performance scales with increasing storage capacity. The advent of switch-based. low-latency and high-bandwidth network protocols. such as Virtual Interface Architecture and InfiniBand, promises to improve both performance and scalability beyond current state-of-the-art I/O interconnect topologies. This paper evaluates a disk-based distributed smart storage architecture composed of fully distributed processor-e m bedded disks that are interconnected by a high-performance switched network. and investigates the performance of the proposed processing model on different storage interconnects with representative workloads, including TPC-H queries. association rules mining, high-dimensional data clustering, and two-dimensional fist Fourier transform (FFT).
