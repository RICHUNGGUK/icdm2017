To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new automatic 3D shape co-segmentation algorithm by using spectral graph method. Our method firstly represents input shapes as a set of weighted graphs and extracts multiple geometric features to measure the similarities of faces in each individual shape. Secondly all graphs are embedded into the spectral domain to find meaningful correspondences across the set. After that we build a joint weighted matrix for the graph set and then apply normalized cut criterion to find optimal co-segmentation of the input shapes. Finally we evaluate our approach on different categories of 3D shapes, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can accurately co-segment a wide variety of shapes, which may have different poses and significant topology changes.", "paper_title": "Automatic 3D Shape Co-Segmentation Using Spectral Graph Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000324661300015"}
