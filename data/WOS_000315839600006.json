The resulting logic, called ALC + T-min, is built upon a previously introduced (monotonic) logic ALC + T that is obtained by adding a typicality operator T to ALC. The operator T is intended to select the \"most normal\" or \"most typical\" instances of a concept, so that knowledge bases may contain subsumption relations of the form T(C) subset of D (\"T(C) is subsumed by D\"), expressing that typical C-members are instances of concept D. From a knowledge representation point of view, the monotonic logic ALC + T is too weak to perform inheritance reasoning. In ALC + T-min, in order to perform non-monotonic inferences, we define a \"minimal model\" semantics over ALC + T. The intuition is that preferred or minimal models are those that maximize typical instances of concepts. By means of ALC + T-min we are able to infer defeasible properties of (explicit or implicit) individuals. We also present a tableau calculus for deciding ALC + T-min entailment that allows to give a complexity upper bound for the logic, namely that query entailment is in co-NExp(NP).
