Multicast-based applications are expected to be widely deployed. In this paper, a new network selection scheme is proposed for a mobile host to select the most appropriate wireless access network to maximize user satisfaction and ISP's profit, simultaneously. We have devised a metric to measure a user's satisfaction and we also developed a normalized network resource metric for system profit measure. We have compared our scheme with three other reference schemes, through simulations. Depending on the network deployment situations, our scheme exhibits one-fifth service disruption time of other reference schemes, while the resource consumption of our scheme is comparable to that of the minimum resource scheme. Overall, the gain of our scheme becomes higher as users move faster and/or the population density increases.
