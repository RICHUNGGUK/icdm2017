DVB-T2 operations need 1K/2K/4K/8K/16K/32K-point multiple mode FFT processors. The proposed architecture employs pipelined shared-memory architecture in which radix-2/2(2)/2(3)/2(4) FFT algorithms, multi-path delay commutator (MDC), and a novel data scaling approach are exploited. Based on this architecture, a novel low-cost data scaling unit is proposed to increase area efficiency, and an elaborate memory configuration scheme is designed to make single-port SRAM without degrading throughput rate. Also, new scheduling method of twiddle factor is proposed to reduce the area. The SQNR performance of 32K-point FFT mode is about 45.3 dB at 11-bit internal word length for 256QAM modulation. The proposed FFT processor has a lower hardware complexity and memory size compared to conventional FFT processors.", "paper_title": "Low-Complexity Multi-Mode Memory-Based FFT Processor for DVB-T2 Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300040"}
