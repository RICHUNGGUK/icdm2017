Efficient execution of such applications necessitates intelligent distribution of the application components and tasks on a parallel machine, and the execution can be orchestrated by utilizing task, data, pipelined, and/or replicated parallelism. The scheduling problem that encompasses all of these techniques is called pipelined workflow scheduling, and it has been widely studied in the last decade. Multiple models and algorithms have flourished to tackle various programming paradigms, constraints, machine behaviors, or optimization goals. This article surveys the field by summing up and structuring known results and approaches.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Pipelined Workflow Scheduling: Models and Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000327934000010"}
