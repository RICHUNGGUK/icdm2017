The necessity to allow inventory and maintenance cost reduction will favour WDM PUN solutions based on colourless transceivers. We present the proposal of a network embedded self-tuning colourless transmitter, based on reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) self-seeding architectures. We analyse the fibre-to-the-antenna network requirements and evidence the capabilities of the network embedded self-tuning colourless transmitter, showing its principle of operation, the development and the modelling of the active elements. We present and discuss recent experimental results up to 10 Gbit/s, which are encouraging for the transmitter exploitation in fronthaul WDM multiplexing technology. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
