The stable design of Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy controllers is guaranteed by means of a stability theorem based on LaSalle's global invariant set theorem formulated for a class of multi input-multi output (MIMO) nonlinear processes. An IFT algorithm characterized by setting the step size to guarantee the FCS stability is proposed. The theoretical approaches are applied in a case study that deals with the IFT-based stable design of fuzzy controllers dedicated to the level control of a cylindrical three tank system as a representative MIMO system. A set of experimental results for a laboratory setup illustrates the performance improvement. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
