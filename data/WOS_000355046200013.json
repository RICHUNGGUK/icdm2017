Particular attention is paid to the enhancement of measurement and optimization techniques employed in geometric parameter identification. The developed method implements a complete and irreducible geometric model for serial manipulator, which takes into account different sources of errors (link lengths, joint offsets, etc). In contrast to other works, a new industry-oriented performance measure is proposed for optimal measurement configuration selection that improves the existing techniques via using the direct measurement data only. This new approach is aimed at finding the calibration configurations that ensure the best robot positioning accuracy after geometric error compensation. Experimental study of heavy industrial robot KUKA KR-270 illustrates the benefits of the developed pose strategy technique and the corresponding accuracy improvement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
