Veracity of the computational models is assessed for physiologically accurate flow rates of 10, 15, and 30 l/min by comparison of numerical results with hot-wire [Johnstone A, Uddin M, Pollard A, Heenan A, Finlay WH. The flow inside an idealised form of the human extra-thoracic airway. Exp Fluids 2004;37(5):673-89] and particle image velocimetry (PIV) [Heenan AF, Matida E, Pollard A, Finlay WH. Experimental measurements and computational modelling of the flow field in an idealised extra-thoracic airway. Exp Fluids 2003;35:70-84] mean velocity data for the central sagittal plane of the ETA. Furthermore, flow features predicted by numerical models are compared to those from experimental flow-visualisation studies [Johnstone et a]., 2004]. The flow in the ETA is shown to be highly three-dimensional, having strong secondary flows. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
