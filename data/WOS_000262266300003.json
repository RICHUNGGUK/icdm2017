In this paper, an easy-to-use geometry-optimized virtual human head is presented. By using a uniform two-step refinement operator, the virtual model has a natural multiresolution structure. In the coarsest level, the model is represented by a control mesh M-0 which serves as the anatomical structure of the head. To achieve fine geometric details over M-0, a multi-level detail set is assigned to the corresponding control vertices in M-0, with the aid of a uniquely defined local frame field. We show in this paper that with a carefully designed control mesh, the presented virtual model not only captures the physical characteristics of the head, but also is optimal in the geometric sense. The contributions of this paper also include that diverse applications of the presented virtual model are presented, showing that (1) the model deformation is smooth and natural, and (2) the presented virtual model is easy to use.
