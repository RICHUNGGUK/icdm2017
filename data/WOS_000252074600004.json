This will permit one to identify the basic features to be attained by this kind of installations and based on them a new cooperative and autonomous robotic platform will be proposed. The major novelty of the approach presented in this paper relies on its short- and long-term adaptation capabilities. The technical details of its basic building blocks and the results of the preliminary field tests will be provided, showing that it constitutes a very efficient platform for the construction of actual adaptive and immersive artistic installations.
