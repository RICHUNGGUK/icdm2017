All the CHPs take the \"horse-saddle\" conformations at the interface and the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the side chains influences the backbones' structural deformations. The orientations and distributions of the CHPs at the interface and the differences of interaction energies (Delta Delta E) between the CHPs and the two liquid phases have been determined. RDF analysis shows that the H-bonds were formed between the O-C atoms of the CHPs' backbones and H-w atoms of water molecules. N atoms of the CHPs' backbones formed the H-bonds or van der Waals interactions with the water solvent. It was found that there is a parallel relationship between Delta Delta E and the lateral diffusion coefficients (D (xy) ) of the CHPs at the interface. The movements of water molecules close to the interface are confined to some extent, indicating that the dynamics of the CHPs and interfacial water molecules are strongly coupled.", "paper_title": "Cyclo-hexa-peptides at the water/cyclohexane interface: a molecular dynamics simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000314051200012"}
