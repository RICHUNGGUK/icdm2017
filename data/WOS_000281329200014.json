We extend this work by considering the automatic creation of graphical user interfaces to allow interaction between a user and the web service generated by KWATT. The key aspects of this work are three-fold. First, comment lines inserted into the script provide hints to the interface generator regarding the interface widgets. Second, the structure of the GUI is encoded into an XML file, and third, a plugin architecture permits the interface to be the output in one of several languages. We present an example interface to illustrate the concepts.
