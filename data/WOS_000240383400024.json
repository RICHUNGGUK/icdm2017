Multi-sensor detectors can monitor multiple aspects of a wide variety of signatures produced by flaming fires, smoldering fires and nuisance source. A new method based on support vector machines (SVMs) is proposed to identify flaming fires, smoldering fires and nuisance sources incorporating smoke, temperature and carbon monoxide (CO) sensors. The usefulness and acceptability of the fire discriminating method has been demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Discriminating fire detection via support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400024"}
