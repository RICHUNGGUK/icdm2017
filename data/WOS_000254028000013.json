In order to automate and streamline the generation process of such rich-information programs, this paper proposes to use the STEP-NC manufacturing features right at the modelling stage, and presents an integrated framework for part modelling, process planning and part program generation through direct use of the manufacturing features and the adoption of the STEP-NC data model. To examine the feasibility a STEP-NC programming system (SPS) is designed with respect to the prismatic parts with 2.5D manufacturing features. Major issues relating to feature validation and process planning are addressed in particular, and a prototype is implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and potential advantages of the approach.", "paper_title": "A design-by-feature approach to step-compliant NC programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000013"}
