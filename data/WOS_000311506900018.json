Since tumor data in gene expression contain thousands of attributes, attribute selection for tumor data in gene expression becomes a key point for tumor classification. Inspired by the concept of gain ratio in decision tree theory, an attribute selection method based on fuzzy gain ratio under the framework of fuzzy rough set theory is proposed. The approach is compared to several other approaches on three real world tumor data sets in gene expression. Results show that the proposed method is effective. This work may supply an optional strategy for dealing with tumor data in gene expression or other applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
