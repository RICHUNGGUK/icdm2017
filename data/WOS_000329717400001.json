In traditional methods, robots easily drop into premature convergence. In this paper, we propose a Swarm Intelligence based algorithm to reduce the expectation time for searching targets and removing. We modify the traditional PSO algorithm with a random factor to tackle premature convergence problem, and it can achieve a significant improvement in multi-robot system. It performs well even in a obstacle environment. The proposed method has been implemented on self-developed simulator for searching task. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility, robustness, and scalability of our proposed method compared to previous methods.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Distributed Search and Collective Cleanup in Complex Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000329717400001"}
