The possibility of evaluating these characteristics on virtual prototypes at almost any stage of the design process reduces the need for very expensive and time consuming physical prototype testing. However, despite their steady improvements and extensions, CAE techniques are still primarily used by analysis specialists. In order to turn them into easy-to-use, versatile tools that are also easily accessible for designers, several bottlenecks have to be resolved. The latter include, amongst others, the lack of efficient numerical techniques for solving system-level functional performance models in a wide frequency range. This paper reviews the CAE modelling techniques which can be used for the analysis of time-harmonic acoustic problems and focusses on techniques which have the Trefftz approach as baseline methodology. The basic properties of the different methods are highlighted and their strengths and limitations are discussed. Furthermore, an overview is given of the state-of-the-art of the extensions and the enhancements which have been recently investigated to enlarge the application range of the different techniques. Specific attention is paid to one very promising Trefftz-based technique, which is the so-called wave based method. This method has all the necessary attributes for putting a next step in the evolution towards truly virtual product design.", "paper_title": "Trefftz-based methods for time-harmonic acoustics", "paper_id": "WOS:000250373100001"}
