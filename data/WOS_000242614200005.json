In the hierarchical cooperative caching problem, a set of n machines residing in an ultrametric space cooperate with one another to satisfy a sequence of read requests to a collection of read-only files. A seminal result in the area of competitive analysis states that the \"least recently used\" (LRU) paging algorithm is constant-competitive if it is given a constant-factor blowup in capacity over the offline algorithm. Does such a constant-competitive deterministic algorithm, with a constant-factor blowup in the machine capacities, exist for the hierarchical cooperative caching problem? In this paper we present a deterministic hierarchical generalization of LRU that is constant-competitive when the capacity blowup is linear in d, the depth of the cache hierarchy. Furthermore, we exhibit an infinite family of depth-d hierarchies such that any randomized hierarchical cooperative caching algorithm with capacity blowup b has competitive ratio Omega(log(d/b)) against an oblivious adversary. Thus, our upper and lower bounds imply a tight bound of Theta(d) on the capacity blowup required to achieve constant competitiveness.", "paper_title": "Online hierarchical cooperative caching", "paper_id": "WOS:000242614200005"}
