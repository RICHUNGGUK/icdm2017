This paper intends to do the same thing for search, proposing constraint-centered heuristics which guide the exploration of the search space toward areas that are likely to contain a high number of solutions. We first propose new search heuristics based on solution counting information at the level of individual constraints. We then describe efficient algorithms to evaluate the number of solutions of two important families of constraints: occurrence counting constraints, such as all different, and sequencing constraints, such as regular. In both cases we take advantage of existing filtering algorithms to speed up the evaluation. Experimental results on benchmark problems show the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Solution counting algorithms for constraint-centered search heuristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000266448200005"}
