In this paper, a strong coupling algorithm for the partitioned fluidstructure interaction simulation of a BMHV is presented. The convergence of the coupling iterations between the flow solver and the leaflet motion solver is accelerated by using the Jacobian with the derivatives of the pressure and viscous moments acting on the leaflets with respect to the leaflet accelerations. This Jacobian is numerically calculated from the coupling iterations. An error analysis is done to derive a criterion for the selection of useable coupling iterations. The algorithm is successfully tested for two 3D cases of a BMHV and a comparison is made with existing coupling schemes. It is observed that the developed coupling scheme outperforms these existing schemes in needed coupling iterations per time step and CPU time.", "paper_title": "A fast strong coupling algorithm for the partitioned fluidstructure interaction simulation of BMHVs", "paper_id": "WOS:000315719300004"}
