We have been able to identify 29 novel inhibitors of Eyes absent homologue 2 (Eya2) by means of a structure-based de novo design with the two known inhibitor scaffolds that contain a proper chelating group for the active-site Mg2+ ion. Because these newly found inhibitors were screened for having desirable physicochemical properties as a drug candidate and exhibited a moderate inhibitory activity with IC50 values ranging from 6 to 50 mu M, they deserve consideration for further investigation to develop new anticancer medicines. Structural features relevant to the stabilization of the identified inhibitors in the active site of Eya2 phosphatase are discussed in detail. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
