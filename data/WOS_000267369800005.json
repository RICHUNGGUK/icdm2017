The basic idea is to predict the label of a data point according to its neighbors in a linear way. This method can be cast into a second-order intrinsic Gaussian Markov random field framework. Its result corresponds to a solution to an approximate inhomogeneous biharmonic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Different from existing approaches, our approach provides a novel graph structure construction method by introducing multiple-wise edges instead of pairwise edges, and presents an effective scheme to estimate the weights for such multiple-wise edges. To the best of our knowledge, these two contributions are novel for semi-supervised classification. The experimental results on image segmentation and transductive classification demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Linear Neighborhood Propagation and Its Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000267369800005"}
