Algorithms to calculate the utility function are developed and verified in detail. To validate and evaluate the scheduling behaviour based on utility functions in agent-based simulation, comparative simulation experiments are carried out on the basis of a case study in the Chinese industry. Simulation results show that the agent's behaviour in the development process simulation is close to the real working process of designers. In the comparative case study, the scheduling behaviour considering both task urgency and task importance can significantly shorten project lead time compared with considering task urgency only. It can also save time for the whole project if the agent assigns collaborative tasks high priority. The developed model and simulation approach can help organisations to identify efficient and effective scheduling behaviours in collaborative and complex product development processes.", "paper_title": "Task scheduling behaviour in agent-based product development process simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000309118700006"}
