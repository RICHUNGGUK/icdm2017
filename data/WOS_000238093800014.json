This paper is an effort in the direction of obtaining efficient distributed systems. To this end, a universality result using 2 components is obtained using two-level distributed H systems. This is an improvement over the existing universality result with 3 components. Further, we propose lazy communicating distributed H systems (LCDH systems), a variant of communicating distributed H systems, with lesser communication. A universality result is obtained with this variant, using only 2 components. This improves the universality result RE = CDH3 by reducing the number of components as well as the communication between components.", "paper_title": "Communicating distributed H systems: Optimal results with efficient ways of communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000238093800014"}
