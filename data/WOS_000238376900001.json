In the single-class case (voice), we considered conventional and successive interference cancellation (SIC) schemes, determining the maximum number of users of each mode. Next, modeling and results proposed in the literature are extended for multi-cell dual-class systems (voice and data) and we compare the maximum data throughputs obtained with conventional, SIC and scheduling (transmission) schemes, for some user configurations.
