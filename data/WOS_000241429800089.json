Although translation-based motion compensation can be applied to the picture prediction between different cameras, a better prediction exists if the camera parameters are known. This paper analyses the rules between pictures taken at the parallel or arc camera arrangements where the object is facing to an arbitrary direction. Based on the derived rules, block-width, block-slant and block-height compensations are proposed for the accurate picture prediction. A fast disparity vector detection algorithm and an efficient disparity vector compression algorithm are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Disparity-compensated picture prediction for multi-view video coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800089"}
