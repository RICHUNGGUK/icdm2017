This model expresses a relationship between the number of vias and wire length. We also provide an estimate for the total number of vias in a circuit, derived from the via distribution and the wire-length distribution. The via distribution is modeled as a function of track utilization, and the wire-length distribution can be derived from the gate-level netlist and the layout area. We extract model parameters from the commercial chips designed for 0.18-mu m and 0.13-mu m CMOS processes, and demonstrate the yield degradation caused by vias.", "paper_title": "Statistical modeling of a via distribution for yield estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600025"}
