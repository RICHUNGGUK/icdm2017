We use geometric refinement of the grid to isolate the effect of singularities and use non-uniform polynomial degree to reduce the number of unknowns. Initial distributions of the polynomial degree are generated automatically through the use of a dispersion relationship. The large complex linear system is solved efficiently by using a parallel linear equation solver. Both bistatic and monostatic scattering examples are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach.
