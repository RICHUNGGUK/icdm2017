Fault tolerance and process migration are the effective methods of improving system's reliability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a service-oriented intelligent seamless migration (SOISM) mechanism and algorithm for pervasive computing environments. We introduce the architecture of the service migration system, design and implement a service fault detector and a service fault manager. We propose two judgment theorems of triggering a service migration activity and completing a successful service migration activity. We also adopt a method of optimizing service migration route among the service resource networks by scheduling to minimize average completion time. We have implemented the SOISM mechanism in an intelligent service selection prototype (ISSPS) system which provides the pervasive web services for users for pervasive computing environments. We have fulfilled various simulations and the results show that the proposed service selection and migration mechanism is not only reliable but also efficient. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
