This fostered substantial research on designs and techniques that enhance these systems with an autonomous behavior. In this survey, we focus on the self-healing branch of the research and give an overview of the current existing approaches. The survey is introduced by an outline of the origins of self-healing. Based on the principles of autonomic computing and self-adapting system research, we identify self-healing systems' fundamental principles. The extracted principles support our analysis of the collected approaches. In a final discussion, we summarize the approaches' common and individual characteristics. A comprehensive tabular overview of the researched material concludes the survey.", "paper_title": "A survey on self-healing systems: approaches and systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000286205100004"}
