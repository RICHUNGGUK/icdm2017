However, two major challenges need to be overcome to provide a better service: The first is that interactive multimedia systems have to provide the contents a user needs at the right time no matter where the user is located and what device the user is using; the second is that the performance of such systems needs to be improved. Apparently, classification and clustering (also called unsupervised classification) algorithms play an indispensable role in these respects. Thus, this paper contains a review of the classification algorithms for interactive multimedia systems. Also discussed in this paper are several important issues, open questions, and trends.", "paper_title": "Classification algorithms for interactive multimedia services: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000322787800008"}
