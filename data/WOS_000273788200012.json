Among these problems are road accidents caused by human-related factors, such as tiredness, loss of control, a slow reaction time, limited field of view, etc. Another transport-related problem is that of loss of time which may be caused by a slow driving speed due to weather conditions, road conditions, visibility, traffic congestion, etc. In this paper, we present a distributed architecture and the underline distributed algorithm for solving the global road transportation system, which is being developed by several European Universities.", "paper_title": "A holonic architecture for the global road transportation system", "paper_id": "WOS:000273788200012"}
