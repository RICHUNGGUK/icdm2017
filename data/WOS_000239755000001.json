The proposed LDO has been fabricated in a standard 0.5 mu m CMOS technology, and the die area is small as 1330 mu m x 1330 mu m with the area-efficient waffle layout for power transistors. Both load and line regulation are less than +/- 0.1%. And the output voltage can recover within 80 mu s for full load changes. The power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR) at 20 KHz is -30 dB. Moreover, it is stable enough with a ceramic capacitor small to 2.2 mu F, and the added series resistance is not needed.", "paper_title": "A 3-A CMOS low-dropout regulator with adaptive Miller compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239755000001"}
