This paper presents a simple but effective method for computing word relatedness to improve question retrieval based on word co-occurrence information directly extracted from question and answer archives. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms translation-based approaches.", "paper_title": "Computing Word Semantic Relatedness for Question Retrieval in Community Question Answering", "paper_id": "WOS:000265703000019"}
