To incorporate deep learning into speaker verification, this paper proposes novel approaches of extracting and using features from deep learning models for text-dependent speaker verification. In contrast to the traditional short-term spectral feature, such as MFCC or PLP, in this paper, outputs from hidden layer of various deep models are employed as deep features for text-dependent speaker verification. Fours types of deep models are investigated: deep Restricted Boltzmann Machines, speech-discriminant Deep Neural Network (DNN), speaker-discriminant DNN, and multi-task joint-learned DNN. Once deep features are extracted, they may be used within either the GMM-UBM framework or the identity vector (i-vector) framework. Joint linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic linear discriminant analysis are proposed as effective back-end classifiers for identity vector based deep features. These approaches were evaluated on the RSR2015 data corpus. Experiments showed that deep feature based methods can obtain significant performance improvements compared to the traditional baselines, no matter if they are directly applied in the GMM-UBM system or utilized as identity vectors. The EER of the best system using the proposed identity vector is 0.10%, only one fifteenth of that in the GMM-UBM baseline. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
