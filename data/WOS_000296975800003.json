The TD, used here, mainly helps to provide a smooth reference signal and largely avoid actuator saturation. The reduced order CNF control law, on the one hand, estimates those unmeasurable state variables for measurement feedback control and, on the other hand, ensures satisfactory system performance. The stability of the newly developed TDCNF is proved in detail. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the newly developed TDCNF control law, two illustrative examples are demonstrated and therein a novel design of the proposed control law is given. Simulation results show that the proposed control law can achieve good tracking performance and effectively avoid the actuator saturation.", "paper_title": "Precise control of linear systems subject to actuator saturation using tracking differentiator and reduced order composite nonlinear feedback control", "paper_id": "WOS:000296975800003"}
