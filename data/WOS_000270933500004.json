TCP employing both packet loss discrimination mechanism and available bandwidth estimation algorithm, known as the good existing solution, shows significant performance enhancement in wireless networks. For instance, TCP New Jersey which exhibits high throughput in wireless networks intends to improve TCP performance by using available bandwidth estimation and congestion warning. Even though it achieves 17% and 85% improvements in terms of goodput over TCP Westwood and TCP Reno, respectively, we further improve it by exploring maximized available bandwidth estimation, handling bit-error-rate error recovery, and effective adjustment of sending rate for retransmission timeout. Hence, we propose TCP NJ+, showing that for up to 5% packet loss rate, it outperforms other TCP variants by 19% to 104% in terms of goodput when the network is in bi-directional background traffic.", "paper_title": "NJ plus : An Efficient Congestion Control Mechanism for Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270933500004"}
