Traditional geospatial data processing could be task-oriented, since a geoprocessing task can be described by a set of action steps, implemented as a workflow, and executed using distributed geoprocessing services. Tasks facilitate the expression of user requirements and capture the problem solving knowledge of users. In this paper, the task-oriented approach is extended to the OGC Sensor Web environment. It highlights how the event-driven technologies adopted by the Sensor Web can be leveraged with geoprocessing workflows to support environment monitoring tasks. The proposal of a Task Model Language (TaskML) and task trigger mechanism allows environmental events to be plugged into an existing model builder, GeoJModelBuilder. Tasks can be created in a stepwise manner, and their execution priority can be updated automatically using triggers. Compared to the traditional \"reactive\" task enactment mode, the trigger-augmented task can support \"active\" environmental monitoring. Use cases on PM2.5/PM10 monitoring demonstrate the applicability of the approach.", "paper_title": "Task-oriented Sensor Web data processing for environmental monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000360693000005"}
