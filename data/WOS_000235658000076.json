The modeling of grid workflow system is a challenging task, due to the high degree of autonomy and heterogeneity of the cooperative organizations under distributed environments. This paper presents a formal specification methodology for grid workflow modeling which is founded upon the Pi-Calculus process algebra. This method works well for characterizing the behaviors and interactions of the grid workflow processes that belong to different organizations in terms of the semantics of Pi-Calculus.", "paper_title": "A novel architecture for realizing grid workflow using Pi-Calculus technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000076"}
