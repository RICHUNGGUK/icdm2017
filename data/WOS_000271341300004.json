In this model, edge weights of networks evolve according to the flow quantity, and then traffic flows can detour congested nodes. This paper simulates and analyzes the process of the emergence and spreading of congestion, which is triggered by adjusting of data generating speed and data sending ability of the network. A recover process of the network from congestion to normal state is also studied, since, in this model, nodes could resume from congestion when the traffic on the network is not busy. Results show that, if the time interval of network's rush hour last longer than a certain threshold, the congested nodes cannot resume automatically. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
