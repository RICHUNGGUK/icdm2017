Fortunately, assisted by LTE (Long Term Evolution) techniques, the robots can be deployed more widely to support bandwidth-intensive applications. Hence, this paper proposes a LTE-based robotics system integrated with cloud computing to enhance the capability of data transmissions and intelligence for providing higher quality and more friendly services. Furthermore, we develop a robot with emotional recognition and feedback for improving Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE), and design a testbed for verifying system's feasibility and performance.
