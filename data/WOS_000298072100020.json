It does bother subscribers and make them distress to check SMS messages of mobile system. Statistically, each mobile subscriber receives an average number of 8.29 short messages every week. Thus, to furnish legitimate message service to the mobile subscribers, engineers have strived to figure out an interactive service system which can certify the user-participation in a communicatory session. If a system can verify whether the communicating party is human being or not, the machine tries can be detected to mitigate the risk. To realize this essential, we aim to develop an interactive SMS confirmation mechanism using the famous techniques - CAPTCHA and secret sharing. Experimental results show that it takes slight computation costs to complete the authentication including the identity verification and the check of user-participation. This has led to predominance that the new method is suitable for mobile environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
