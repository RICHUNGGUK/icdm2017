It allows to prove some combinatorial properties of a class of patterns called (m, n)-cubes. This study has also some consequences on local estimators of area: we prove that the local estimators restricted to regions of plane never converge to the exact area when the resolution tends to zero for almost all slopes of plane. All the results are generalized for the regions of hyperplanes in any dimension d >= 3. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
