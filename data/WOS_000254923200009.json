To alleviate this problem, we propose a scrambling method to exploit temporal diversity and spatial dependency of collected signal samples. We present methods on how these properties can be applied to enhance the positioning accuracy of several existing schemes. Simulation studies and experimental results show that the scrambling method can greatly improve positioning accuracy, especially when the tracked object has some degree of mobility.", "paper_title": "A scrambling method for fingerprint positioning based on temporal diversity and spatial dependency", "paper_id": "WOS:000254923200009"}
