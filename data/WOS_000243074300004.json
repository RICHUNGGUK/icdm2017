However, quite often only limited animation of the polygon-based shapes can be found there, specifically when using the virtual reality modeling language (VRML) and its successor extensible 3D (X3D). This greatly limits the expressive power of visual cyberworlds and has motivated our research in this direction. In this paper, we present function-based extensions of VRML and X3D, which allow for time-dependent shape modeling on the web. Our shape modeling approach is based on the concurrent use of implicit, explicit and parametric functions defining geometry, appearance and their transformations through time. The functions are typed straight in VRML/X3D code as individual formulas and as function scripts. We have also developed a web enabled interactive software tool for modeling function-based VRML/X3D objects.", "paper_title": "Function-defined shape metamorphoses in visual cyberworlds", "paper_id": "WOS:000243074300004"}
