Using this method we investigated amplitude changes in subjects undergoing myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with Dipyridamole (Dp). Fifty-three patients having reversible perfusion defects and 19 normal subjects (NS) who were free of: perfusion defects on their MPI, standard ST-T changes during Dp stress, and a negative clinical follow up. Mean Pi(1) (Pi(1)>) was similar for the NS and patient group (6.2 +/- 6.1 vs. 6.3 +/- 6.2, P = 0.95). (<Pi(1)>) was 4.6 +/- 3.0 in patients not having ST-T changes during Dp stress (n = 42), whereas in patients having ST-T changes (n = 11) it was 13.1 +/- 10.2 (P < 0.001). For both groups <Pi(QRS)> was smaller than <Pi(ST)>, which in turn was smaller than <Pi T >. The values of <Pi(QRS)>, <Pi(ST)>, and <Pi(T)> for the NS, patients without and with ST-T changes were: 26.8 +/- 28.6, 42.6 +/- 41.8, 44.9 +/- 36.5; 19.6 +/- 20.8, 26.4 +/- 31.4, 38.7 +/- 27.3; 51.0 +/- 30.0, 71.0 +/- 36.8, 75.1 +/- 20.9, respectively (P < 0.05 for all comparisons of patients with versus without ST-T changes). This study showed that Dp stress, with or without hypoperfusion, had a clear effect on myocyte electrophysiology, expressed by consistent ECG amplitude changes, detected by the EVC method. The EVC method did not distinguish between NS and patients in this clinical setting.", "paper_title": "ECG variability contour method reveals amplitude changes in both ischemic patients and normal subjects during Dipyridamole stress: a preliminary report", "paper_id": "WOS:000296640300009"}
