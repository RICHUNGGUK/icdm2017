The model geometry was reconstructed through computerised tomography scan. Unsteady-state computational fluid dynamic analyses were performed under different conditions using a commercial software package ADINA R&D, Inc., (Watertown, MA, USA) in order to assess the impact of the boundary conditions on the flow variables. In particular, the results showed that the peripheral vessels massively impact the pressure while the flow is relatively unaffected. As an example of application of these outflow conditions, an unsteady fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation was carried out and the dependence of the wall shear stress (WSS) on the arterial wall compliance in the carotid bifurcation was studied. In particular, a comparison between FSI and rigid-wall models was conducted. Results showed that the WSS distributions were substantially affected by the diameter variation of the arterial wall. In particular, even similar WSS distributions were found for both cases, and differences in the computed WSS values were also found.", "paper_title": "Impedance-based outflow boundary conditions for human carotid haemodynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000334018600009"}
