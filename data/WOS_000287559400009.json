In addition to temporal redundancy, exploiting the inter-view redundancy is crucial to improve the performance of multi-view video coding. In this paper, we present a novel method to construct the optimal inter-view prediction structure for multi-view video coding using simulated annealing. In the proposed model, the design of the prediction structure is converted to the arrangement of coding order. Then, a simulated annealing algorithm is employed to minimize the total cost for obtaining the best coding order. This method is applicable to arbitrary irregular camera arrangements. As experiment results reveal, the annealing process converges to satisfactory results rapidly and the generated optimal prediction structure outperforms the reference prediction structure of the joint multi-view video model (JMVM) by 0.1-0.8 dB PSNR gains.", "paper_title": "Optimizing inter-view prediction structures for multi-view video coding using simulated annealing", "paper_id": "WOS:000287559400009"}
