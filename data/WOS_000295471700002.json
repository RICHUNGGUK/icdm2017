We see that in 9 x 9, computers are very close to the best human level, and can be improved easily for the opening book; whereas in 19 x 19, handicap 7 is not enough for the computers to win against top level professional players, due to some clearly understood (but not solved) weaknesses of the current algorithms. Applications far from the game of Go are also cited. Importantly, the first ever win of a computer against a 9th Dan professional player in 9 x 9 Go occurred in this event.", "paper_title": "Current Frontiers in Computer Go", "paper_id": "WOS:000295471700002"}
