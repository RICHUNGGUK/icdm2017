We prove that if the elements of F and U have comparable size, then a small subset of F suffices to cover most of the volume of U; we analyze how small this subset can be depending on the geometry of the elements of F and show that smooth convex sets and axis parallel squares behave differently. We obtain similar results for surface-to-surface visibility amongst balls in three dimensions for a notion of volume related to form factor. For each of these situations, we give an algorithm that takes F and U as input and computes in time O(vertical bar F vertical bar * vertical bar H-is an element of vertical bar) either a point in U not covered by F or a subset H-is an element of covering U up to a measure is an element of, with vertical bar H-is an element of vertical bar meeting our combinatorial bounds.", "paper_title": "Helly-Type Theorems for Approximate Covering", "paper_id": "WOS:000267824300004"}
