The GNUFDA can effectively deal with the small sample-size problem and perform satisfactorily when the dimensionality of the null space decreases with increase in the number of training samples per class and/or classes, C. The proposed GNUFDA can extract at most C - 1 optimal uncorrelated discriminative vectors without being influenced by the null-space dimensionality. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
