If performance becomes an issue, they are ported to C and integrated with interpreted systems, not fully utilizing object-oriented software development. This paper presents an overview of Scopira, an open source C++ framework suitable for biomedical data analysis and visualization. Scopira provides high-performance end-to-end application development features, in the form of an extensible C++ library. This library provides general programming utilities, numerical matrices and algorithms, parallelization facilities, and graphical user interface elements.
