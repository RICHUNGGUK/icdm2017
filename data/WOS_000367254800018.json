Though much prior research focuses on scaling graph-analytics on distributed environments, the strong desire on performance per core, dollar and joule has generated considerable interests of processing large-scale graphs on a single server-class machine, which may have several terabytes of RAM and 80 or more cores. However, prior graph-analytics systems are largely neutral to NUMA characteristics and thus have suboptimal performance. This paper presents a detailed study of NUMA characteristics and their impact on the efficiency of graph-analytics. Our study uncovers two insights: 1) either random or interleaved allocation of graph data will significantly hamper data locality and parallelism; 2) sequential inter-node (i.e., remote) memory accesses have much higher bandwidth than both intra-and inter-node random ones. Based on them, this paper describes Polymer, a NUMA-aware graph-analytics system on multicore with two key design decisions. First, Polymer differentially allocates and places topology data, application-defined data and mutable runtime states of a graph system according to their access patterns to minimize remote accesses. Second, for some remaining random accesses, Polymer carefully converts random remote accesses into sequential remote accesses, by using lightweight replication of vertices across NUMA nodes. To improve load balance and vertex convergence, Polymer is further built with a hierarchical barrier to boost parallelism and locality, an edge-oriented balanced partitioning for skewed graphs, and adaptive data structures according to the proportion of active vertices. A detailed evaluation on an 80-core machine shows that Polymer often outperforms the state-of-the-art single-machine graph-analytics systems, including Ligra, X-Stream and Galois, for a set of popular real-world and synthetic graphs.", "paper_title": "NUMA-Aware Graph-Structured Analytics", "paper_id": "WOS:000367254800018"}
