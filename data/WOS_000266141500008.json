In addition, in order to provide secure multimedia data services, multimedia data protection and management, authentication, and authorization management methods that fit the purpose of the above demands are expected to be required. In this paper, ubiquitous-hybrid multimedia system for secure and intelligent multimedia data services in Ubi-Home is proposed. In addition, an authentication method suitable for the Ubi-Home is suggested. The proposed system provides intelligent services by reflecting context information (user preference, user location, device status information) through sensor network modules, providing transparent and secure multimedia service.", "paper_title": "U-HMS: hybrid system for secure intelligent multimedia data services in Ubi-Home", "paper_id": "WOS:000266141500008"}
