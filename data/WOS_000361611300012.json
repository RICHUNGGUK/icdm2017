Currently, most studies on Ethernet performance assume that the channel is divided into time slots, or the network load is saturated with little attention to a non-slotted channel and the non-saturation status. However, this situation is more consistent with the practical application of Ethernet. This paper first calculates the original collision probability and the retransmission collision probability in the original load, then obtains the retransmission load of the network based on those two collision probabilities, and finally acquires the actual load of the network by an iterative method. In addition, the accuracy of the analysis is checked against simulation results.", "paper_title": "Real-time performance analysis of non-saturated and non-slotted Ethernet based on a two-dimensional collision state model", "paper_id": "WOS:000361611300012"}
