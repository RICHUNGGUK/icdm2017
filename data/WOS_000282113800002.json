In this paper, we present a survey on constraint satisfaction, planning, and scheduling from the Artificial Intelligence point of view. In particular, we present the main definitions and techniques, and discuss possible ways of integrating such techniques. We also analyze the role of constraint satisfaction in planning and scheduling, and hint at some open research issues related to planning, scheduling, and constraint satisfaction.", "paper_title": "New trends in constraint satisfaction, planning, and scheduling: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000282113800002"}
