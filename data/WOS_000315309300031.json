In order to evaluate HIP-SVM's capability, six benchmark data sets, Australian, Heart disease, Iris, Ionosphere, Sonar and Vowel, were employed. The computational results showed that HIP-SVM has better performance than AIS-based SVM and PSO-based SVM. HIP-SVM was also applied to classify RSSI for indoor positioning. The experiment results indicated that HIP-SVM can achieve highest accuracy compared to those of AIS-SVM and PSO-SVM. It demonstrated that RFID can be used for storing information and in indoor positioning without additional cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
