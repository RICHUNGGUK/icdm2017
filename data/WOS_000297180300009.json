Moreover, their missions often involve unforeseen physical interactions with the environment. To deal with these difficulties, endowing the controllers of the robots with the capability to learn a model of their kinematics and dynamics under changing circumstances is becoming mandatory. This emergent necessity has given rise to a significant amount of research in the Machine Learning community, generating algorithms that address more and more sophisticated on-line modeling questions. In this paper, we provide a survey of the corresponding literature with a focus on the methods rather than on the results. In particular, we provide a unified view of all recent algorithms that outlines their distinctive features and provides a framework for their combination. Finally, we give a prospective account of the evolution of the domain towards more challenging questions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
