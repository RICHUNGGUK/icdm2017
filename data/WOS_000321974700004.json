CR users in CR systems should not cause any interference to primary users (PUs) of the primary network. For this purpose, CR users need to accurately estimate the features and activities of the primary users. In this paper, a novel characterization of heterogeneous PUs and a novel reconfigurability solution in CR networks are introduced. The characterization of PUs consists of a detector and classifier that distinguishes between heterogenous PUs. The PU characteristics stored in radio environmental maps are utilized by an interference/throughput adapter for the optimization of CR parameters. The performance of the proposed solutions is evaluated by showing false alarm and missed detection probabilities of the detector/classifier in a multipath fading channel with additive white Gaussian noise. Moreover, the impact of the PU characteristics on the CR throughput is analyzed.", "paper_title": "Characterization and exploitation of heterogeneous OFDM primary users in cognitive radio networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000321974700004"}
