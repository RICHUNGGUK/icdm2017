Based on the low-dimensional intrinsic of face images, we design a novel two-step shadow compensation method for face recognition. Three indexes are proposed and employed to distinguish the shaded-images. Then, we compensate the shadows adaptively by using a modified Robust PCA result. Experimental results on Yale database and Yale B database demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the recognition rate. Showing our method is suitable for face recognition with illumination variations.", "paper_title": "Shadow determination and compensation for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000348040400009"}
