Consider an ideal clutter with a nonnegative capacity function on its vertices. It follows from ideality that for any nonnegative capacity the total multiplicity of an optimal fractional packing is equal to the minimum capacity of a vertex cover. Our scheme finds an optimal packing using at most edges with positive multiplicities, performing minimization for the clutter at most times and minimization for its blocker at most (2) times, where denotes the cardinality of the vertex set. Applied to the clutter of dijoins (directed cut covers), the scheme provides the first combinatorial polynomial-time algorithm for fractional packing of dijoins.", "paper_title": "Fractional packing in ideal clutters", "paper_id": "WOS:000304158900007"}
