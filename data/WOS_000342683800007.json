Embedded systems with DVR (Digital Video Recorder) capabilities are able to generate multimedia (video/audio) data, and can act as vital pieces of evidence in the field of digital forensics. To counter anti-forensics, it is necessary to derive systematic forensic techniques that can be used on data fragments in unused (unallocated) areas of files or images. Specifically, the techniques should extract meaningful information from various types of data fragments, such as non-sequential fragmentation and missing fragments overwritten by other data. This paper proposes a new digital forensic system for use on video data fragments related to DVRs. We demonstrate in detail special techniques for the classification, reassembly, and extraction of video data fragments, and introduce an integrated framework for data fragment forensics based on techniques described in this paper.
