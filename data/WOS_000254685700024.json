The semiGLS method is recalled as a modification of the Galerkin least-squares method. The presented work extends our previous paper on this method by its other important aspects. The main aim of this paper is to analyse and comment on the accuracy of the method. A posteriori error estimates For incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are used as the main tool for error analysis and some conclusions concerning accuracy are derived. Several numerical experiments are presented for both benchmark and practical problems.
