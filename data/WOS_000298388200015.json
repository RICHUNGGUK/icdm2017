Let O be a convex object, such as a disk, a square, or an equilateral triangle. We present a scheme for computing a minimum cover of Q, consisting of homothets of O contained in X. In particular, a minimum disk cover of Q with respect to X, can be computed in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "A Scheme for Computing Minimum Covers within Simple Regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000298388200015"}
