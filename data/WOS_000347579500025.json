The Bullwhip Effect is a proven cause of significant inefficiencies in SCM. This paper applies Goldratt's Theory of Constraints (TOC) to reduce it. KAOS methodology has been used to devise the conceptual model for a multi-agent system, which is used to experiment with the well known 'Beer Game' supply chain exercise. Our work brings evidence that TOC, with its bottleneck management strategy through the Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR) methodology, induces significant improvements. Opposed to traditional management policies, linked to the mass production paradigm, TOC systemic approach generates large operational and financial advantages for each node in the supply chain, without any undesirable collateral effect.
