As a result, the detection of these critical points can lead to correct understanding and effective therapy of the tachycardia. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this problem. The proposed approach includes four stages: image smoothing, motion estimation, motion decomposition, and detection of the critical points. In the image smoothing stage, the noisy cardiac optical data are smoothed using anisotropic diffusion equation. The conduction velocity fields of the cardiac electrical patterns can then be estimated from two consecutive smoothed images. Using the recently developed discrete Hodge-Helmholtz motion decomposition technique, the curl-free and divergence-free potential surfaces of an estimated velocity field are extracted. Finally, hierarchically searching the minima and maxima on the potential surfaces, the sources, sinks, and rotational centers are located with high accuracy. Experimental results with four real cardiac videos show that the proposed approach performs satisfactorily, especially for the cardiac electrical patterns with simple propagations.
