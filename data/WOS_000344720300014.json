Existing work proposes transmitting the compressed local feature descriptors instead of the query image to reduce the transmission overhead. Although many kinds of compressed descriptors are proposed, designing a suitable lossless compressed descriptor has proven elusive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for MVS with low transmission overhead rather than focusing on compressed descriptors. The key point of the proposed framework is to migrate the vector quantization in the bag of visual words model from the server to the client. In this framework, no matter what descriptors are used, the client only transmits the ID numbers of the visual words to the server, thereby reaching the minimal possible transmission overhead. To achieve this goal, we present vocabulary decomposition by which we can decompose the large vocabulary into several small ones satisfying storage constraints on mobile devices. In this paper, we first formulate vocabulary decomposition as an optimization problem. We then present Joint Product Quantization (JPQ) and Joint Optimized Product Quantization (JOPQ) to address the proposed optimization problem. Finally, we conduct a large number of simulation experiments and real experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the existing framework by reducing more than 95% of the transmission overhead.", "paper_title": "A Low Transmission Overhead Framework of Mobile Visual Search Based on Vocabulary Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000344720300014"}
