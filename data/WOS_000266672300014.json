MAGFLOW is intended for use in emergency response situations during an eruption to quickly forecast the lava flow path over some time interval from the immediate future to a long-time forecast. Major discrepancies between the observed and simulated paths occurred in the early phase of the 2006 eruption due to an underestimation of the initial flow rate, and at the time of the overlapping with the 2004-2005 lava flow. Very good representations of the areas likely to be inundated by lava flows were obtained when we adopt a time-varying effusion rate and include the 2004-2005 lava flow field in the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of topography.
