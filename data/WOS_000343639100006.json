We study the complexity of this problem in the space-restricted random-access model: The input array is stored on read-only memory, and the algorithm has access to a limited amount of workspace. We prove that the linear-time prune-and-search algorithm-presented in most textbooks on algorithms-can be modified to use Theta(N) bits instead of Theta(N) words of extra space. Prior to our work, the best known algorithm by Frederickson could perform the task with Theta(N) bits of extra space in O (Nlg* N) time. Our result separates the space-restricted randomaccess model and the multi-pass streaming model, since we can surpass the Omega(Nlg* N) lower bound known for the latter model. We also generalize our algorithm for the case when the size of the workspace is O (S) bits, where lg(3) N <= S <= N. The running time of our generalized algorithm is O (Nlg* (N/S) + N(lgN)/lg S), slightly improving over the O (Nlg*(N (lgN)/S) + N(lgN)/lg S) bound of Frederickson's algorithm. To obtain the improvements mentioned above, we developed a new data structure, called the wavelet stack, that we use for repeated pruning. We expect the wavelet stack to be a useful tool in other applications as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
