Similarly, routing labeling schemes are schemes that label the vertices of a graph with short labels in such a way that given the label of a source vertex and the label of a destination, it is possible to compute efficiently (e.g., in constant or logarithmic time) the port number of the edge from the source that heads in the direction of the destination. In this paper we show that the three major classes of non-positively curved plane graphs enjoy such distance and routing labeling schemes using O (log(2) n) bit labels on n-vertex graphs. In constructing these labeling schemes interesting metric properties of those graphs are employed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.
