The key idea is to use multiple existing anomaly detection algorithms in parallel on thousands of network traffic subclasses, which not only enables us to detect hidden anomalies but also to increase the accuracy of the system. The main challenge then is the management and aggregation of the vast amount of data generated. We propose a novel aggregation process that uses the internal continuous anomaly metrics used by the algorithms to output a single system-wide anomaly metric. The evaluation on real-world attack traces shows a lower false positive rate and false negative rate than any individual anomaly detection algorithm.", "paper_title": "Accurate Anomaly Detection through Parallelism", "paper_id": "WOS:000263161900005"}
