A large number of algorithms have been devised to compute \"good\" clusters in a WSN but few papers have tried to characterize these algorithms in an analytical manner. In this paper, we use a local world model to understand and characterize the functioning of three tree based clustering algorithms. In particular, we have chosen simple tree, CDS Rule K, and A3 topology construction protocols. Using our theoretical framework based on a complex network model, we have also tried to quantify some of the observed features of these algorithms such as number of cluster heads and average degree of the resultant graph. The theoretically obtained measures have reasonably matched with measures obtained by simulation studies.", "paper_title": "Analysing Topology Control Protocols in Wireless Sensor Network Using Network Evolution Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000364075500001"}
