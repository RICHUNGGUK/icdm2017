This language benefits from an important syntactic operation, which is called a graph homomorphism. This operation is sound and complete with respect to logical deduction. Hence, it is possible to do logical reasoning without using the language of logic but only graphical, thus visual, notions. This paper presents the main knowledge constructs of this language, elementary graph-based reasoning mechanisms, as well as the graph homomorphism, which encompasses all these elementary transformations in one global step. We put our work in context by presenting a concrete semantic annotation application example.", "paper_title": "Visual reasoning with graph-based mechanisms: the good, the better and the best", "paper_id": "WOS:000323889400003"}
