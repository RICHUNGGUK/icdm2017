It aims to overcome the resistance of the current Internet to architectural change. Application of this technology relies on algorithms that can instantiate virtualized networks on a substrate infrastructure, optimizing the layout for service-relevant metrics. This class of algorithms is commonly known as \"Virtual Network Embedding (VNE)\" algorithms. This paper presents a survey of current research in the VNE area. Based upon a novel classification scheme for VNE algorithms a taxonomy of current approaches to the VNE problem is provided and opportunities for further research are discussed.", "paper_title": "Virtual Network Embedding: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000327250500017"}
