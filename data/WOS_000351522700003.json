The investigated primal-dual algorithms are fully decomposable, in the sense that the operators are processed individually at each iteration. We also discuss the modified algorithms in the context of convex optimization problems and present numerical experiments in image processing and pattern recognition in cluster analysis.", "paper_title": "On the convergence rate improvement of a primal-dual splitting algorithm for solving monotone inclusion problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000351522700003"}
