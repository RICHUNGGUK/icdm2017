In conventional system, centralized management system is applied but it tends to congest when user requests increase or resources rapidly move. Therefore, this paper proposes Autonomous Coordination Technology (ACT) through community organization for resource utilization. In ACT, a node which has surplus resources autonomously constructs community with a surplus-level based size and distributes resources to members which are deficient in resources. ACT consists of autonomous coordination within community and among communities. According to community organization, online property and flexibility can be satisfied. However, it is difficult to achieve service provision timeliness and resource allocation operatability in the mean time. Thus, ACT includes successive transportation method, and autonomous resource allocation which dynamic decision is made by a tradeoff between timeliness and operatability. As a result, the service assurance in terms of timeliness and operatability can be assured. The effectiveness of proposed technology is affirmed through the simulation of taxi dispatching application in terms of response time and standard deviation versus user rates.", "paper_title": "Autonomous Coordination Technology through Community Organization for Resource Utilization", "paper_id": "WOS:000293258900003"}
