In this paper we show that the one-sample method of testing about the mean of a fuzzy random variable can be extended to general ones (more precisely, to those whose range is not necessarily finite and whose values are fuzzy subsets of finite-dimensional Euclidean space). This extension is immediately developed by combining some tools in the literature, namely, bootstrap techniques on Banach spaces, a metric between fuzzy sets based on the support function, and an embedding of the space of fuzzy random variables into a Banach space which is based on the support function.
