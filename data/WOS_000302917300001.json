The focus is on the use of Internet access gateways that allow a choice of alternative routes to avoid potentially lengthy and low-capacity multihop wireless paths. A set of heuristic-based algorithms is described that together aim to maximize reliable network capacity: the two-tier integrated architecture algorithm, the weighted gateway uploading algorithm, the link-controlled routing tree algorithm, and the dynamic group management algorithm. These algorithms use different approaches to arrange nodes involved in video multicasting into a clustered and two-tier integrated architecture in which network protocols can make use of multiple gateways to improve system throughput. Simulation results are presented, showing that our multicasting algorithms can achieve up to 40 percent more throughput than other related published approaches.", "paper_title": "Resource-Aware Video Multicasting via Access Gateways in Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000302917300001"}
