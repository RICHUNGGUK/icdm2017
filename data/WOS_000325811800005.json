We exploit the utilities of scalable videos produced by the scalable extension of H.264/AVC (SVC) and investigate the multidimensional diversities of the multiuser MIMO-OFDM wireless networks. First, we study the rate-utility relationship of SVC via a packet prioritization scheme. Based on the rate-utility analysis, a scalable resource-allocation framework is proposed to achieve differentiated service objectives for different scalable video layers. To provide users with fair opportunities to acquire basic viewing experience, a fair scheme is designed to guarantee that each user is entitled to a MAXMIN fairness to have their base layer video packets received. After all users have their base layer packets successfully scheduled, resources are distributed to exploit the network efficiency. The two schemes are integrated into a unified bit loading and power allocation solution to enhance the practicability of the scalable framework. Experiment results confirms that the proposed scheme handles fairness and efficiency better at different scenarios than the conventional schemes.", "paper_title": "Scalable Resource Allocation for SVC Video Streaming Over Multiuser MIMO-OFDM Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325811800005"}
