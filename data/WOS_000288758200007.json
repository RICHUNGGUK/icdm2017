In [14], Vahidi-Asl and Wierman showed, using sub-additivity theory, that the rescaled first-passage time converges to a finite and non-negative constant mu. We show a sufficient condition to ensure that mu > 0 and derive some upper bounds for fluctuations. Our proofs are based on percolation ideas and on the method of martingales with bounded increments.", "paper_title": "Asymptotics for First-Passage Times on Delaunay Triangulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000288758200007"}
