We propose a new tree-based ensemble multi-task learning method for classification and regression (MT-ExtraTrees), based on Extremely Randomized Trees. MT-ExtraTrees is able to share data between tasks minimizing negative transfer while keeping the ability to learn non-linear solutions and to scale well to large datasets.", "paper_title": "Tree-Based Ensemble Multi-Task Learning Method for Classification and Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784300036"}
