The underlying methodology is based on Gaussian process inference on a differential equation model that allows the use of short, unevenly sampled, time series. The method has been designed with efficient parallel implementation in mind, and the package supports parallel operation even without additional software.", "paper_title": "tigre: Transcription factor inference through gaussian process reconstruction of expression for bioconductor", "paper_id": "WOS:000289162000026"}
