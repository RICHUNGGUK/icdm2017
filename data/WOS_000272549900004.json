Based on crawled data covering a representative subset of videos and users, we present a characterization from two perspectives: the video response view and the interaction network view. In addition to providing valuable statistical models for various characteristics, our study uncovers typical user behavioral patterns in video-based environments and shows evidence of opportunistic behavior.", "paper_title": "Video Interactions in Online Video Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000272549900004"}
