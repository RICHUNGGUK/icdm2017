In this paper, we develop a novel framework named as multilevel user cluster mining (MUCM) to measure user's behavior similarity under different network prefix levels. Focusing on aggregated traffic behavior under different network prefixes cannot only reduce the number of traffic flows but also reveal detailed patterns for a group of users sharing similar behaviors. First, we employ the bidirectional flow and bipartite graphs to model network traffic characteristics in large-scale networks. Four traffic features are then extracted to characterize the user's behavior profiles. Second, an efficient method with adjustable weight factors is employed to calculate the user's behavior similarity, and entropy gain is applied to select the weight factor adaptively. Using the behavior similarity metrics, a simple clustering algorithm based on k-means is employed to perform user clustering based on behavior profiles. Finally, we examine the applications of behavior clustering in profiling network traffic patterns and detecting anomalous behaviors. The efficiency of our methods is verified with extensive experiments using actual traffic traces collected from the northwest region center of China Education and Research Network (CERNET), and the cluster results can be used for flow control and traffic security monitoring.", "paper_title": "MUCM: Multilevel User Cluster Mining Based on Behavior Profiles for Network Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000365406200021"}
