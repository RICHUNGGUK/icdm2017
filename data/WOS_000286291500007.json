Among 50 investigated regression models with 227 descriptors extracted from the literature, the sign change problem was shown to have a very high frequency, according to four new criteria proposed in this work for its assessment. The sign change problem can be substantially reduced and even eliminated for a given dataset by statistically based variable selection and by checking for the sign change problem before model validation and interpretation. Knowing the fundamentals of statistics related to the sign change problem, its identification and understanding aid in finding effective means to remedy regression models with this deficiency.
