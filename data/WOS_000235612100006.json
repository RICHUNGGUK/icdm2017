The algorithm is characterized by a pressure-correction method with the interfaces represented by volume fractions. Within this flow algorithm, we devise a continuous (e.g., continuum surface tension model) and a sharp (e.g., a ghost fluid method) interface representation of the surface-tension-induced interfacial pressure jump condition. The sharp interface representation is achieved by temporarily reconstructing distance functions from volume fractions. We demonstrate that a flow algorithm designed to legislate force balance retains an exact balance between surface tension forces and the resulting pressure gradients. This balance holds for both continuous and sharp representations of interfacial surface tension. The algorithm design eliminates one of the elusive impediments to more accurate models of surface tension-driven flow.. the remaining of which is accurate curvature estimation. To validate our formulation, we present results for an equilibrium (static) drop in two and three dimensions having an arbitrary density jump across the interface. We find that the sharp surface tension method yields an abrupt pressure jump across the interface, whereas the continuous surface tension method results in a smoother transition. Both methods, however, yield spurious velocities of the same order, the origin of which is due solely to errors in curvature. Dynamic results are also presented to illustrate the versatility of the method. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
