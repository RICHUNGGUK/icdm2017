The principal component analysis was performed on two kinematic and two kinetic waveforms (subject-based characteristics) from level gait to identify salient portions of the waveforms for comparison between the subject cohorts. These were classified to identify the differences between post-THA and non-pathological cohorts. The primary technique exposited in the THA analysis is classification and ranking belief simplex (CaRBS). Within the analysis, from the configuration of a CaRBS model, there is discussion on the model fit and contribution of the subject-based characteristics. Where appropriate, comparisons to the CaRBS model are made with the results from a logistic regression (LR) analysis. In terms of model fit, using CaRBS, 24 out of 27 LA/PA subjects (88.89%) and 13 out of 16 NP subjects (81.25%) were correctly classified as exhibiting either post-THA or NP hip functional characteristics during level gait, combining to 86.05% classification accuracy, compared with 81.40% classification accuracy when using LR.", "paper_title": "A CaRBS analysis of hip replacement approaches and non-pathology", "paper_id": "WOS:000314564900006"}
