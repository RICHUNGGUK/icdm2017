The main idea lies in the use of the general framework of conditional multiple correspondences analysis as a tool for investigating the dependence relationship between a set of observable categorical covariates X and an assignment-to-treatment indicator variable T, in order to obtain a global measure of comparability between-groups according to their dependence structure. Then. we propose a strategy that enables one to find treatment groups, directly comparable with respect to pre-treatment characteristics, on which estimate local causal effects.
