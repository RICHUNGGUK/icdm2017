We list a few equations satisfied by the algebra 1(A) = (1(A), 0, I, i, A, V, e, 0), call NW-algebra every model of these equations, and show that, conversely, every IMV-algebra is isomorphic to the IMV-algebra 1(B) of all intervals in some MV-algebra B. We show that IMV-algebras are categorically equivalent to MV-algebras, and give a representation of free IMV-algebras. We construct Lukasiewicz interval logic, with its coNP-complete consequence relation, which we prove to be complete for I([0, ID-valuations. For any class Q of partially ordered algebras with operations that are monotone or antimonotone in each variable, we consider the generalization IQ of the MV-algebraic functor I, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for To to be a categorical equivalence. These conditions are satisfied, e.g., by all subquasivarieties of residuated lattices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
