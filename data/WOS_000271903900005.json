Additionally, science is a highly social arena. However, interpersonal collaboration and knowledge How in scientific environments are usually more restricted. Collaboration is intense among small groups of people working on specific problems within a domain, but low between groups. As user profiling has been extensively used as a basis for recommendation, personalization and matchmaking systems, a better profile identification can improve interaction levels among researchers belonging to the same domain but working in different laboratories. Profiles may be constructed in two ways: either through explicit declaration by the user or through the observation of users' actions. Many systems employ one approach to the exclusion of the other. We contend that a combined approach will yield better results, especially on scientific scenario, providing a mix of declared and inferred information. In this article, we present inference-based profiles in scientific environments (i-ProSE), an integrated system that dynamically creates and maintains scientific user profiles based both on declared information and on observed behaviour. The i-ProSE can be used to locate experts, deliver content, build communities, find collaborators for long-term projects or detect instantaneous opportunities for informal collaboration, which is presented with a short study case.", "paper_title": "i-ProSE: Inferring User Profiles in a Scientific Context", "paper_id": "WOS:000271903900005"}
