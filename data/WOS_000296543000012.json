One of the main difficulties of the analysis of these models is to handle the case when in a given state the fluid rate changes sign from positive to negative at a given fluid level. We refer to this case as zero transition. The case when this sign change is due to a discontinuity of the fluid rate function results in probability mass at the given fluid level. We show that the case when the sign change is due to a continuous finite polynomial function of the fluid rate results in a qualitatively different behaviour: no probability mass develops and different stationary equations apply. We consider this latter case of sign change, present its stationary description and propose a numerical procedure for its evaluation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
