We prove that the zero-error capacity in this case can be obtained through the solution of a dynamic programming problem. Each iteration of the dynamic programming provides lower and upper bounds on the zero-error capacity, and in the limit, the lower bound coincides with the zero-error feedback capacity. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for solving the dynamic programming problem is provided through a fixed-point equation. Analytical solutions for several examples are provided.", "paper_title": "Zero-Error Feedback Capacity of Channels With State Information Via Dynamic Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000277880200013"}
