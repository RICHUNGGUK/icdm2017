In electrical engineering, a power network requires generators and loads to be in synchronization. The increase in distributed dc power sources without sophisticated controls has made synchronization more difficult. This paper proposes a synchronous inverter designed for linking distributed power sources within a power network. The linkage inverters should have high confidential characteristics to keep the network stable. The frequency and phase synchronization between synchronous generators in power network has been acheived through power transmission systems. The synchronous inverters contribute in the development of the sophisticated power networks by providing distributed power sources that maintain synchronous operation.", "paper_title": "Enhanced entrainment of synchronous inverters for distributed power sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000251227200024"}
