In order to verify the accuracy of 3D simulation, results (Cutting forces and tool deflection) were compared with those based on the theoretical relationships, in terms of agreement with experiments. The results obtained indicate that the simulation is capable of predicting the cutting forces and tool deflection. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
