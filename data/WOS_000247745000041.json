However, they are seldom used to simulate neurons in the retina. In this study, two slightly different recurrent network models are introduced to describe two types of non-concentric ganglion cells, i.e., the impressed-by-contrast cell and the suppressed-by-contrast cell in the cat retina. By simulations, it is found that the additive recurrent network is able to describe qualitatively the-behavior of the impressed-by-contrast cell, while the other additive recurrent network with saturation rectification is able to describe qualitatively the behavior of the suppressed-by-contrast cell.
