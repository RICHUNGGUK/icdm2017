The maximum variation of energy factor (MVEF) of high-order converters exhibits particular characteristic which is different from that of second order converters. To carry out the analysis based on MVEF, boundary conditions for the high-order converters should be restudied. There are new boundary conditions that are derived by analyzing the energy factor. Through the research in this paper, it can be concluded that the MVEF can reveal the amount of energy storage and impact the efficiency of high-order converters. Experimental results have confirmed that the MVEF and efficiency are correlated. MVEF can be a preferred index for DC-DC converters including high-order converters.", "paper_title": "BOUNDARY CONDITION ANALYSIS FOR CUK, SEPIC AND ZETA CONVERTERS USING ENERGY FACTOR CONCEPT", "paper_id": "WOS:000316902600004"}
