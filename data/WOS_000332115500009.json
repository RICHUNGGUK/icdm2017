The proposed method is applicable to the reduction of mutual interference of UWB and any given narrowband (NB) systems. This pulse shape is based on frequency up-converting of the first derivative of the Gaussian pulse which has an adjustable null in power spectral density (PSD) depending on the up-converting frequency. Analytical and simulation results show that both UWB and WLAN systems have noticeable improved performance when using the proposed pulse in comparison with using conventional modulated Gaussian (MG) pulse in UWB system. The new pulse does not reduce the throughput of the UWB system and does not require modification of the NB system. The proposed transmitter circuit block diagram has been presented at the conclusion.", "paper_title": "A NEW IR-UWB PULSE FOR THE COMPATIBILITY OF IEEE802.11.a WLAN AND IR-UWB SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000332115500009"}
