Computer science and information technology are changing the innovation environment and accumulating Big Data from which a lot of knowledge is to be discovered. However, it is a rather nebulous area and there still remain several challenging problems to integrate the multi-information and rough knowledge effectively to support the process of innovation. Based on the new cross discipline Extenics, the authors have presented a collaborative innovation model in the context of Big Data. The model has two mutual paths, one to transform collected data into an information tree in a uniform basic-element format and another to discover knowledge by data mining, save the rules in a knowledge base, and then explore the innovation paths and solutions by a formularized model based on Extenics. Finally, all possible solutions are scored and selected by 3D-dependent function. The model which integrates different departments to put forward the innovation solutions is proved valuable for a user of the Big Data by a practical innovation case in management.", "paper_title": "An Extension Collaborative Innovation Model in the Context of Big Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000348378600005"}
