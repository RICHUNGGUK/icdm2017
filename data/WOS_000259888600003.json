A series of multidimensional Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models was constructed for each type of insect toxicity, and these models were evaluated by q(2) of 67-member training sets and r(2) of ten-memberr test sets. Favored models yielded r(2) values in the range of 0.77 - 088. q(2) values in the range of 0.54 - 0.62 after consideration of outliers, test set r(2) values in the range of 0.54 - 0.72, and external q(2) values in the range of 0.31 - 0.58. The structure - activity relationships for each type of insect toxicity can be partially, but not entirely, rantionalized in view of Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) LBD sequence alignments and putative contact residues relative to the known crystallized Heliothis virescens EcR LBD/By 106830 holoreceptor.
