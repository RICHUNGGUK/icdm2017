The gradient-based optimization algorithm is based on a finite element model of the plate vibrations obtained using the Mindlin plate theory coupled with analytical sensitivity analysis using the adjoint method and an iterative design update procedure based on a mathematical programming tool. We demonstrate the capability of the method by designing bi-material plates that, when subjected to harmonic excitation, either effectively suppress the overall vibration level or alternatively transport energy in predefined paths in the plates, including the realization of a ring wave device.", "paper_title": "Topological material layout in plates for vibration suppression and wave propagation control", "paper_id": "WOS:000262439900004"}
