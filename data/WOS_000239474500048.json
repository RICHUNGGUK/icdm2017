We show that the Exact Satisfiability problem of size 1 with m clauses can be solved in time 2(m)l(O(1)) and polynomial space. The same bounds hold for counting the number of solutions. As a special case, we can count the number of perfect matchings in an n-vertex graph in time 2(n)n(O(1)) and polynomial space. We also show how to count the number of perfect matchings in time O(1.732(n)) and exponential space. Using the same techniques we show how to compute Chromatic Number of an n-vertex graph in time O(2.4423(n)) and polynomial space, or time O(2.3236(n)) and exponential space.", "paper_title": "Exact algorithms for exact satisfiability and number of perfect matchings", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500048"}
