Walker, The complex Bi-conjugate Gradient solver applied to large electromagnetic scattering problems, computational costs, and cost scalings, IEEE Trans. Antennas Propagat. 45 (1997) 140-146], three Lanczos-type variants of the recent Conjugate A-Orthogonal Conjugate Residual (COCR) method of Sogabe and Zhang [T. Sogabe, S.-L. Zhang, A COCR method for solving complex symmetric linear systems, J. Comput. Appl. Math. 199 (2007) 297-303] are explored for the solution of complex nonsymmetric linear systems. The first two can be respectively considered as mathematically equivalent but numerically improved popularizing versions of the BiCR and CRS methods for complex systems presented in Sogabe's Ph.D. Dissertation. And the last one is somewhat new and is a stabilized and more smoothly converging variant of the first two in some circumstances. The presented algorithms are with the hope of obtaining smoother and, hopefully, faster convergence behavior in comparison with the CBiCG method as well as its two corresponding variants. This motivation is demonstrated by numerical experiments performed on some selective matrices borrowed from The University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection by Davis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
