This subset needs to inherently reflect the type of information contained in the entire set, while minimizing redundancy. For such purposes, clustering might seem like a natural approach. However, existing clustering methods are not ideally suited for representative selection, especially when dealing with nonmetric data, in which only a pairwise similarity measure exists. In this article we propose delta-medoids, a novel approach that can be viewed as an extension of the k-medoids algorithm and is specifically suited for sample representative selection from nonmetric data. We empirically validate delta-medoids in two domains: music analysis and motion analysis. We also show some theoretical bounds on the performance of delta-medoids and the hardness of representative selection in general.", "paper_title": "REPRESENTATIVE SELECTION IN NONMETRIC DATASETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000362345500004"}
