For speed control a three phase induction motor is modelled as a d-q model where linearity is assumed and non-idealities are ignored. Approximation of the physical characteristic gives a simulated behaviour away from the natural behaviour. This paper proposes a bond graph model of an induction motor that can incorporate the non-linearities and non-idealities thereby resembling the physical system more closely. The model is validated by applying the linearity and idealities constraints which shows that the conventional 'abc' model is a special case of the proposed generalised model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
