The impact of the Tet on the department life is significant and the management of its water quality must be largely improved and better supervised. The main purpose of the work was to develop \"rain flow\" predictive models, using Elman recurrent neural networks and based on the identification of localized rain events. These neural models allow understanding the dynamic evolution, according to rain events, of the Tet flow at a selected point and of the Perpignan WWTP (WasteWater Treatment Plant) influent flow. Their most interesting characteristic is their capability to predict big increases in river flow and in plant influent flow. The neural models have been integrated as thematic layers in a geographical information system (GIS) allowing an efficient management and update of the records used to develop the models.
