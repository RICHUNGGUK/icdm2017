The difficulties underlying the currently existing transient formulation stemming from the vector potential-scalar potential (A-V) framework are analyzed. A time-domain electric field-scalar potential (E-V) framework is then developed via equation and variable transformations. This results in better-conditioned systems that are friendly to iterative solutions at fast switching times. Numerical examples show that the proposed E-V solver renders a useful tool for addressing multidomain simulation.", "paper_title": "A Numerically Efficient Formulation for Time-Domain Electromagnetic-Semiconductor Cosimulation for Fast-Transient Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000318163800012"}
