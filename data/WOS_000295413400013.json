Traditional techniques do not scale, produce very high overheads or rely on unrealistic assumptions. In this paper, we propose a new membership algorithm (Community Of Reputable PeerS, CORPS) for Distributed Hash Tables which builds a community of reputable nodes and thus enables the implementation of pseudo-trusted services. CORPS uses a reputation-based approach to decide whether a node can be a member of the group or not. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach and evaluate how much it improves the reliability of a trusted routing service.", "paper_title": "CORPS: Building a Community of Reputable PeerS in Distributed Hash Tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000295413400013"}
