The proposed models are mainly designed for indoor applications oriented to provide guidance directly to people in danger. Only a few of them deal with outdoor scenarios as well as with providing directions to field commanders or rescue teams. Additionally, load balancing techniques for the optimal allocation of a number of entities into a number of resources are understudied creating a gap in the corresponding research. In this paper, we propose a load balancing model oriented to assist field commanders and rescue teams in a post-emergency scenario. The proposed system could be applied either for indoor or outdoor applications. The module builds on top of the solution provided for the known Santa Fe Bar Problem (SFBP). It consists of an intelligent technique aiming to distribute a number of entities into a finite number of resources. A set of predictors undertake the responsibility of estimating the load of each resource. These predictors are adopted to select the appropriate resource for each entity. A case study deals with the distribution of injured persons into a number of hospitals and presents the functionality of the proposed module. Finally, numerical results reveal computational and time requirements of our system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
