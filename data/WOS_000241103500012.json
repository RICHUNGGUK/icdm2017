Then we propose two approaches for combining various existing parsers in order to obtain better accuracy. The highest parsing accuracy reported in this paper is 85.84%, which represents 1.86% improvement compared to the best single state-of-the-art parser. To our knowledge, no better result achieved on the same data has been published yet.", "paper_title": "Combining Czech dependency parsers", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500012"}
