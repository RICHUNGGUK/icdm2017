This paper proposes a novel gradient based dictionary learning method for image recovery, which effectively integrates the popular total variation (TV) and dictionary learning technique into the same framework. Specifically, we first train dictionaries from the horizontal and vertical gradients of the image and then reconstruct the desired image using the sparse representations of both derivatives. The proposed method enables local features in the gradient images to be captured effectively, and can be viewed as an adaptive extension of the TV regularization. The results of various experiments on MR images consistently demonstrate that the proposed algorithm efficiently recovers images and presents advantages over the current leading CS reconstruction approaches.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Dictionary Learning in Sparse Gradient Domain for Image Recovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000325223300007"}
