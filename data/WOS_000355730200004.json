This study focuses on iPhone, one of the most widely used haptic devices and reviews the usability problems of five built-in iPhone applications documented in related sources. The study investigates whether these problems are actually reported during testing with novice users, which is their severity and whether testing reveals additional issues. Overall, the study confirmed the list of usability problems documented and stressed the importance of conforming to established usability principles.", "paper_title": "A usability study of iPhone built-in applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000355730200004"}
