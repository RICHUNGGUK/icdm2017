In the broadcast network lifetime problem, all nodes are sending broadcast traffic, and one asks for an assignment of transmit powers to nodes, and for sets of relay nodes so that the network lifetime is maximized. The selection of a dynamic relay set consisting of a single node (the 'master'), can be regarded as a special case, providing lower bounds to the optimal lifetime in the general setting. This paper provides a preliminary analysis of such a 'dynamic master selection' algorithm, comparing relaying to direct routing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
