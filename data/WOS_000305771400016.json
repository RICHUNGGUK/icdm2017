In real world scenarios the assumption that the inputs of an image fusion process contain only useful information, pertinent to the desired fused output, does not hold true more often than not. Thus, the image fusion problem needs to be addressed from a more complex, fusion-denoising point of view, in order to provide a fused result of greater quality. The novelty of our approach consists in defining an image geometry-driven, anisotropic fusion model, numerically expressed using an anisotropy-reinforcing discretization scheme that further increases the anisotropic behavior of the proposed fusion paradigm. The preliminary experimental analysis shows that robust anisotropic denoising can be attained in parallel with efficient image fusion, thus bringing two paramount image processing tasks into complete synergy. One immediate application of the proposed method is fusion of multifocus, noise-corrupted images. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
