Compared to the state-of-the-art, this technique requires a simpler digital block and, hence, a lower power dissipation. The proposed technique detects timing skew for each channel by means of finding zero-crossing samples with respect to a reference comparator. Simulation results show that it can effectively correct timing errors for any type of input signal up to Nyquist, and achieves a high convergence speed with a very low computational complexity.", "paper_title": "A low-complexity digital background calibration of sample-time error in time-interleaved A/D converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000322451700008"}
