The network topology is a standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the training algorithm is based on the theory of variable structure systems (VSS) and sliding mode control (SMC). The main feature of this novel procedure is the adaptability of the gain (learning rate), which is obtained from sliding mode surface so that system stability is guaranteed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
