However, a crucial step in this algorithm is how to design the bandwidth h, which controls the precision of the prediction. Unlike conventional trial and error tricks, the Particle Swarm Optimizarion (PSO) technique is proposed to design the optimal bandwidth at each prediction. According to this strategy, the optimal neighbors of the query are obtained and the predictive precision is improved. The proposed scheme can enable lazy learning algorithm to be spatial adaptation over the data density and distribution, variation of noise level. and local behavior of underlying function, etc. The effectiveness of the newly proposed strategy is numerically evaluated on two simulation examples compared with some of the state-of-art approaches.", "paper_title": "OPTIMAL BANDWIDTH DESIGN FOR LAZY LEARNING VIA PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264660900001"}
