We provide efficient algorithms that compute near-optimal prices for this problem, focusing on a commodity market, where the range of buyer budgets is small. We also show that our LP rounding based technique easily extends to a different scenario, in which the buyers want to buy all the desired goods, as long as they are within budget.
