This paper proposes the use of a value chain based approach to support the modelling and simulation of manufacturing enterprise processes. The aim is to help experts to make relevant decisions on product design and/or product manufacturing process planning. This decision tool is based on the value chain modelling, by considering the product requirements. In order to evaluate several performance indicators, a simulation of various potential value chains adapted to market demand was conducted through a Value Chains Simulator (VCS). A discrete event simulator is used to perform the simulation of these scenarios and to evaluate the value as a global performance criterion (balancing cost, quality, delivery time, services, etc.). An Analytical Hierarchy Process module supports the analysis process. The value chain model is based on activities and uses the concepts of resource consumption, while integrating the benefiting entities view point. A case study in the microelectronic field is carried out to corroborate the validity of the proposed VCS.", "paper_title": "VCS: value chains simulator, a tool for value analysis of manufacturing enterprise processes (a value-based decision support tool)", "paper_id": "WOS:000306436200042"}
