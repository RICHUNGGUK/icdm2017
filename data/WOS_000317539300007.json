The new method uses hierarchical-gradient truncation and remapping (H-GTaR) of the original partial differential equation (PDE). Our strategy reduces the original POE to a set of decoupled linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. Additionally, we introduce a remapping strategy to periodically guarantee solution accuracy for a deformation problem. The proposed scheme yields nearly an exact solution for a rigid body motion with a smooth function that possesses vanishingly small higher derivatives and calculates the gradient of the advected function in a straightforward way. We will evaluate our method in one- and two-dimensional domains and present results to several classical benchmark problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
