In order to optimize the synchronizability, we propose a method by introducing a weight matrix, which makes the synchronized states stable for the widest range of the overall coupling strength. We give a proof in mathematics and gain the exact form of the weight matrix, which is equal to L beta. Matrix L is the one that describes the optimal network and matrix beta is constructed by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the usual Laplacian matrix. This result may provide us insight into the synchronization of complex network more deeply.", "paper_title": "THE OPTIMUM OF SYNCHRONIZABILITY IN COMPLEX NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283602700005"}
