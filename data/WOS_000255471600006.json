Besides topology-independent stability and faster convergence to efficiency/fairness, it was recently shown that any stable single-link system with a symmetric Jacobian tolerates arbitrary fixed, as well as time-varying, feedback delays. Although delay-independence is an appealing characteristic, the EMKC system developed in exhibits undesirable equilibrium properties and slow convergence behavior. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new method called JetMax and show that it admits a low-overhead implementation inside routers (three additions per packet), overshoot-free transient and steady state, tunable link utilization, and delay-insensitive flow dynamics. The proposed framework also provides capacity-independent convergence time, where fairness and utilization are reached in the same number of RTT steps for a link of any bandwidth. Given a 1 mb/s, 10 gb/s, or googol (10(100)) bps link, the method converges to within 1% of the stationary state in six RTTs. We finish the paper by comparing JetMax's performance to that of existing methods in ns2 simulations and discussing its Linux implementation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
