Firstly, the two-order nonlinear dynamic model of the PEA is introduced and the hysteresis nonlinearity part is analyzed as a kind of bounded disturbance acting on the system. Then, the high order sliding mode control law is designed. Further, the finite-time astringencies of the sliding mode variables and the asymptotic astringency of tracking error variable are proved theoretically. The simulation results show the validity of the HOSMC for this kind of piezoelectric actuators with hysteresis nonlinearity.", "paper_title": "High order sliding mode and its application on the tracking control of piezoelectric systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000019"}
