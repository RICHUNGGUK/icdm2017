Firstly, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is introduced to derive an initial posterior probability by fitting the fluid attenuation inversion recovery histogram. Secondly, some grayscale and region properties are extracted from different sequences. Thirdly, grayscale and region characteristics with different weights are proposed to adjust the posterior probability. Finally, a cost function based on the posterior probability and neighborhood information is formulated and optimized via graph cut. Experiment results on a public dataset with 20 high-grade brain tumor patient images show the proposed method could achieve a dice coefficient of 78%, which is higher than the standard graph cut algorithm without a probability-adjusting step or some other cost function-based methods.", "paper_title": "Multi-Feature Guided Brain Tumor Segmentation Based on Magnetic Resonance Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000368904200024"}
