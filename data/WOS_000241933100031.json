Our solution is based on an optimization approach which utilizes neural networks (NNs) to learn the cross-layer function. Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptation scheme.", "paper_title": "A cross-layer adaptation scheme for improving IEEE 802.11e QoS by learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000241933100031"}
