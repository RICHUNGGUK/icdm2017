A method for conceptual indexing based on WordNet is used. Both documents and queries are mapped onto WordNet. Identified concepts belonging to WordNet synsets are extracted from documents and queries and those having a single sense are expanded. All runs are carried out using a conceptual indexing approach. Results prove a primacy of using queries from the title field of the topics and a slight gain of using stemming compared to the non stemming cases.", "paper_title": "Evaluating a conceptual indexing method by utilizing WordNet", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000028"}
