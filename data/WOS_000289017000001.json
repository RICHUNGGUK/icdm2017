In this paper, we study the maximum lifetime many-to-one data gathering with aggregation (MLMTODA) problem: Given locations of sensors and a base station together with available energy of each sensor, and a set of sources, find a schedule in which data should be gathered from all the sources and transmitted to the base station, such that the lifetime of the network is maximised. We propose efficient algorithms to solve the MLMTODA problem. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a good performance for the MLMTODA problem.", "paper_title": "Efficient algorithm for maximum lifetime many-to-one data aggregation in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289017000001"}
