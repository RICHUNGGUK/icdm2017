To solve the problem of security routing and ensure the right routing information, we present a novel model called DIMH to detect, isolate the malicious host and provide the integrity and authentication mechanism for routing information. Method of isolating malicious host and ensuring the right route information is that the i + 1 th malicious host is carried out by cooperation between the ith host and i + 2 th host. The model can validly detect attack from two colluding malicious hosts that cooperate to tamper with routing information. Our model guarantees that fabricated, compromised, or replayed route replies would either be rejected or never reach back the querying node. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
