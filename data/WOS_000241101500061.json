Reflecting on materials used by humanities academics, it demonstrates the complex range of aggregate types and the problems of representing this heterogeneity in the digital library interface. We demonstrate that aggregates are complex and pervasive, challenge many common assumptions and confuse the boundaries between organisational levels within the library. The challenge is amplified by concrete examples.", "paper_title": "Representing aggregate works in the digital library", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500061"}
