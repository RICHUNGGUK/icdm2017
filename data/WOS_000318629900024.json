Behavioral separation builds on notions originally introduced for behavioral type systems and separation logics, but shifts the focus from the separation of static program state properties towards the separation of dynamic usage behaviors of runtime values. Behavioral separation types specify how values may be safely used by client code, and can enforce fine-grained interference control disciplines while preserving compositionality, information hiding, and flexibility. We illustrate how our type system, even if based on a small set of general primitives, is already able to tackle fairly challenging program idioms, involving aliasing at various types, concurrency with first-class threads, manipulation of linked data structures, behavioral borrowing, and invariant-based separation.", "paper_title": "The Type Discipline of Behavioral Separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000318629900024"}
