This standard includes a prioritized slotted Aloha as a choice for medium access control. This protocol is different from the traditional version as it has integral considerations for certain priorities of users. It attempts to resolve collision by halving the probability of retransmission, lower bounded by to a minimum, in the alternate slots to follow. In this paper, we present an analytical model to compute the non-saturated throughput of this protocol in the presence of finite number of nodes. The model is validated against simulation.", "paper_title": "Modeling Slotted Aloha of WBAN in Non-Saturated Conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000338846200005"}
