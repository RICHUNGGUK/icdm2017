This paper illustrates the use of the Matlab environment to obtain the state-variable equations of LTI circuits for educational purposes. The system of equations is obtained by systematically formulating and rearranging the cut-set equations associated with the so-called proper tree. The setup developed in this paper is intended for a basic course on Linear Circuit Theory, which is mandatory in any Electrical Engineering curriculum, but it could be adapted to any other Engineering course involving first-order differential equations.
