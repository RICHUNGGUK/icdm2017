We derive the occurring condition of backward bifurcation or forward bifurcation at the disease-free equilibrium in the system. By theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, it is found (i) if a backward bifurcation occurs at the disease-free equilibrium of the system, then bistability exists regardless of the size of the capacity, and (ii) if a forward bifurcation occurs at the disease-free equilibrium of the system, then bistable endemic equilibria exist when the capacity is low. It is also shown that the range of bistability becomes smaller as the capacity increases when the capacity is smaller, otherwise unchanges for larger treatment capacity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
