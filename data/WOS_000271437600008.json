In photoacoustic imaging, these methods require interpolation in the Fourier space domain, which creates artifacts in reconstructed images. We propose a novel reconstruction algorithm that applies the one-dimensional nonuniform fast Fourier transform to photoacoustic imaging. It is shown theoretically and numerically that our algorithm avoids artifacts while preserving the computational effectiveness of Fourier reconstruction.", "paper_title": "A Reconstruction Algorithm for Photoacoustic Imaging Based on the Nonuniform FFT", "paper_id": "WOS:000271437600008"}
