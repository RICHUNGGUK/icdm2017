The element is based on the corotational method. The main interest of this approach is that different linear elements can be automatically transformed to non-linear ones. To avoid curvature locking that may occur for low order element(s). a local linear formulation based on the exact stiffness matrix is used, Five numerical applications are presented in order to assess the performance of the formulation.
