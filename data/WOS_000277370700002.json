We show that this operation is functorial over a category of domain representations with a natural choice of morphisms. We study the topological properties of the space of representable compact sets and isolate conditions under which all compact subsets of X are representable. Special attention is paid to admissible representations and representations of metric spaces.", "paper_title": "Domain representations of spaces of compact subsets", "paper_id": "WOS:000277370700002"}
