Design/methodology/approach - Unlike previous digitalization studies, which employed user data such as attitudes and behaviors as the major determinants, the present study focused on the spatial and organizational characteristics of FAs. An exploratory spatial analysis was conducted using a geographic information system to discover whether the organizational characteristics, local agriculture development, and neighboring FAs affect the organizational decision and adaption on information services. Research data from three national surveys were analyzed with a spatial regression model. Findings - Results showed that geographical neighborhood, in association with organizational characteristics, significantly affects the decision and level of organizational digitalization, while the development and characteristics of regional agriculture exert no significant influence. Practical implications - In the development of information and communication technology (ICT) diffusion policies for promoting organizational digitalization, it is important to highlight regional initiatives and complementary public efforts to guarantee an equitable access to ICT in areas with variances in economic development. In neighborhood FAs, greater development of economic and labor scales and ICT human capital also contribute to higher levels of organizational digitalization. Originality/value - Based on the study results, suggestions are provided for future research considering spatial forces in agricultural information studies and practical applications.", "paper_title": "A spatial exploration of factors affecting digitalization of farmers' associations in Taiwan", "paper_id": "WOS:000327047700003"}
