By combining the hydrodynamics and chemical species transport equations, the velocity field, air volume fraction and ferrous biooxidation rate in the column were simulated. The kinetic model proposed by Nemati and Webb [Nemati, M., & Webb, C. (1997). A kinetic model for biological oxidation of ferrous iron by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans. Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 53, 478-486] was used to simulate the biooxidation rate in the column. Gas-liquid interactions were modeled using an Eulerian model in three dimensions. The effects of inlet air velocity and initial substrate (Fe2+) concentration on the velocity field, air volume fraction and biooxidation rate of ferrous iron in the column were investigated. To validate the model, simulation was compared with the experimental data in the presence of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans in an aerated column where the superficial gas velocity was adjusted between 0 and 0.5 m/s. It was found that the initial ferrous concentration and the inlet air velocity had a pronounced effect on the ferrous biooxidation rate. The results indicated that the maximum biooxidation rate can be obtained at superficial air velocity of 0.1 m/s and initial ferrous concentration of 6.7 g/L. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
