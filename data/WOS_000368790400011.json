A practical network scenario, where multiple virtual wireless service providers (WSPs) request the VR from a unique mobile network operator (MNO) is considered. Our objective is two folds. The first is to guarantee the minimum rate requirements of the MNO and the WSPs. The second is to distribute the system rate among the MNO and the WSPs in the Pareto optimal manner. To this end, an efficient VR allocation scheme based on bargaining game theory is proposed, and the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) method is used to solve the proposed game problem. The proposed game problem is proved to be a convex optimization problem. By using standard convex optimization method, the global optimal NBS of the game is obtained in closed form. The effectiveness of the proposed VR allocation game is testified through numerical results.", "paper_title": "A bargaining game theoretic method for virtual resource allocation in LTE-based cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000368790400011"}
