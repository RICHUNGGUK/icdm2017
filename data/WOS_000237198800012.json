In contrast to abstracts, accessing and processing full-text is considerably more complex. GetItFull is a tool for downloading and pre-processing full-text journal articles. GetItFull automatically connects to a journal's Web site, downloads the journal content and performs various commonly used pre-processing steps. The output comprises a structured XML document for each article with tags identifying the various sections and journal information. The output may then be used as the basis for text mining applications or exported to a database for further processing.", "paper_title": "GetItFull - A tool for downloading and pre-processing full-text journal articles", "paper_id": "WOS:000237198800012"}
