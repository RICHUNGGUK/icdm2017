In this framework, the architecture for urban vehicular networks is presented, and based on this architecture, the IPv6 address structure for urban vehicular networks is proposed. In this framework, a vehicle is always identified by its home address and does not need to be configured with a care-of address. Based on this architecture, the pre-handover algorithm is presented. In this algorithm, the third-layer (L3) mobility handover is performed before the second-layer (L2) one. When a vehicle finishes the L3 handover but does not perform the L2 handover, the corresponding access router or border router reserves the messages destined for the vehicle. After the vehicle completes the L2 handover, the access router or border router transmits the reserved messages to the vehicle. The performance of this framework is evaluated, and the results show that this framework reduces the handover cost and delay and lowers the packet loss.
