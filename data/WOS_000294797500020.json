However, it is not suitable to be implemented directly in consumer electronics (digital TV, camera, etc.) because this method tends to produce an output with saturation effects. Therefore, Automatic Weighting Mean-separated Histogram Equalization (AWMHE) was proposed to overcome this weakness for gray-scale images in our recent work. Although AWMHE method performs well in the gray-scale images, it cannot be applied to most consumer electronic products that produce color images. This article proposes a novel enhancement scheme by using the spherical color model and the AWMHE method to improve the quality of color images. The effectiveness of the spherical color model for color contrast enhancement is verified by comparing with other state-of-the-art color models with HE and AWMHE methods. Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed enhancement scheme can generate better enhancement images than those using the state-of-the-art enhancement schemes.", "paper_title": "COLOR CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT USING AUTOMATIC WEIGHTING MEAN-SEPARATED HISTOGRAM EQUALIZATION WITH SPHERICAL COLOR MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500020"}
