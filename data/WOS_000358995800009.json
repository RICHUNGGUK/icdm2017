With time-of-arrival range measurements, the DGF algorithm estimates the mobile station position by selecting a set of measurements with relatively small NLOS (non-line-of-sight) errors, and the DGC algorithm optimizes the measurements first and then estimates the position using those optimized measurements. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can mitigate the impact of NLOS errors and effectively improve the accuracy of wireless location.", "paper_title": "Distance Geometry-based Wireless Location Algorithms in Cellular Networks with NLOS Errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000358995800009"}
