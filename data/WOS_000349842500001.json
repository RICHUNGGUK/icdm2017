The literature includes theoretical and empirical evidence favoring the improved test over its unmodified version. However, the developed methodology seems to have been overlooked by data analysts in practice, possibly because of the difficulties associated with the computation of the modified test. In this article, we describe the mdscore package to compute improved score tests in generalized linear models, given a fitted model by the glm () function in R. The package is suitable for applied statistics and simulation experiments. Examples based on real and simulated data are discussed.", "paper_title": "mdscore : An R Package to Compute Improved Score Tests in Generalized Linear Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000349842500001"}
