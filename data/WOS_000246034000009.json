This paper proposes several comparison fault models (i.e., the faults cause Compare operation fail) of TCAMs based on electrical defects, such as shorts between two circuit nodes and transistor stuck-open and stuck-on faults. Two March-like tests for detecting comparison faults are also proposed. The first March-like test requires 4N Write operations, 3N Erase operations, and 4N + 2B Compare operations to cover 100% of targeted comparison faults for an N x B-bit TCAM with Hit output only. The second March-like test requires 2N Write operations, 2N Erase operations, and 4N + 2B Compare operations to cover 100% of targeted comparison, faults for an N x B-bit TCAM with Hit and Priority Address Encoder outputs. Compared with the previous work, the proposed tests have lower time complexity for typical TCAMs; they can be used to test TCAMs with different comparator structures; and their time complexities are independent of the number or stuck-on faults. Also, they can cover delay faults in comparison circuits.", "paper_title": "Testing ternary content addressable memories with comparison faults using march-like tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034000009"}
