Those ambitious targets can only be achieved by using advanced MIMO antenna techniques as well as wide spectrum allocation, up to 100 MHz. A multiple component carrier structure has been agreed on in the 3GPP Work Item as a solution to extend the 18 MHz bandwidth of the previous LTE Release 8 up to 100 MHz. The multiple access schemes on both uplink and downlink now have to be adapted to the new spectrum configuration. Furthermore, in the link adaptation design the transmission over multiple CCs would reasonably lead to an increase of the feedback overhead. Bundling of the spatial or frequency parameters can keep the overhead low at the cost of lower throughput. In this article, we consider as a study case the LTE-A uplink, where NxDFT-spread-OFDM has been selected as the multiple access scheme. The validity of this scheme for the uplink is evaluated in terms of cubic metric, which is an indicator of the power de-rating needed at the transmitter to avoid intermodulation distortion. Furthermore, the impact of bundling the link adaptation parameters on the link performance is discussed considering both linear and turbo successive interference cancellation (SIC) receivers. Two codeword mixing stategies in the frequency and spatial domains are also proposed to boost the performance when the bundling is made per antenna or per CC, respectively. Results show that when a linear receiver is used in the base station, mixing techniques can increase spectral efficiency, thus reducing the performance gap to the no bundling case, which is the most expensive solution in terms of feedback signaling. However, when a turbo SIC receiver is used, only mixing over CCs is a valid option to achieve link performance gain.", "paper_title": "TRANSMISSION OVER MULTIPLE COMPONENT CARRIERS IN LTE-A UPLINK", "paper_id": "WOS:000294544000010"}
