The model is implemented in Matlab. The inputs that are used in this model derive from spirometry test. This model is able to study a physiologic condition, a pathologic one and the patient's follow up after drug treatment. We split our study into two parts. The first one focuses the analysis on the gas fluido dynamic inside of the respiratory pathways. The second part takes care of the pressure equilibrium in the exchange zone. We use the outputs that derive from the second subsystem to solve the Bernoulli's equation of the first part. The model was validated with data provided from \"Clinical Physiology Institute\" of CNR and G. Monasterio Foundation of Pisa. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
