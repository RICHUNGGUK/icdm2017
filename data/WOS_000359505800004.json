These matrices were called symmetric with positive coefficients (or simply SPC). A natural question appeared: What is the connection between SPC matrices and PPT matrices? Is every SPC matrix PPT? Here we show that every SPC matrix is PPT in M-2 circle times M-2. This theorem is a consequence of the fact that every density matrix in M-2 circle times M-m, with tensor rank smaller or equal to 3, is separable. Although, in M-3 circle times M-3, we present an example of SPC matrix with tensor rank 3 that is not PPT. We shall also provide a non trivial example of a family of matrices in M-k circle times M-k, in which both, the SPC and PPT properties, are equivalent. Within this family, there exists a non trivial subfamily in which the SPC property is equivalent to separability.", "paper_title": "DOES SYMMETRY IMPLY PPT PROPERTY?", "paper_id": "WOS:000359505800004"}
