We consider the optimality of ranking algorithms through minimization of the theoretical risk which combines pairwise ranking errors of ordinal categories with differential ranking costs. The extension shows that for a certain class of convex loss functions including exponential loss, the optimal ranking function can be represented as a ratio of weighted conditional probability of upper categories to lower categories, where the weights are given by the misranking costs. This result also bridges traditional ranking methods such as proportional odds model in statistics with various ranking algorithms in machine learning. Further, the analysis of multipartite ranking with different costs provides a new perspective on non-smooth listwise ranking measures such as the discounted cumulative gain and preference learning. We illustrate our findings with simulation study and real data analysis.", "paper_title": "Statistical Optimality in Multipartite Ranking and Ordinal Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000352533000014"}
