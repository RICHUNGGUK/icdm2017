Firstly, the concept of uniform (C)-integrabiliy and other new concepts like uniform absolute continuity and uniform boundedness for sequences of fuzzy-valued (C)-integrable functions are introduced and then the relations among them are discussed. As the applications of these concepts, we also present several convergence theorems for sequences of fuzzy-valued (C)-integrable functions by using uniform (C)-integrability.", "paper_title": "On the properties of sequences of fuzzy-valued Choquet integrable functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000261186600011"}
