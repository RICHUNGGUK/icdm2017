The main objective of this paper is to present a novel approach to the problem of evaluating video object tracking algorithms. It is proposed the use different types of reference information and the combination of heterogeneous metrics for the purpose of approximating the ideal error. This will enable a significant decrease of the required reference information, thus bridging the gap between metrics with different requirements concerning this type of data. As a result, evaluation frameworks can aggregate the benefits from individual approaches while overcoming their weaknesses, providing a flexible and powerful tool to assess and characterize the behavior of the tracking algorithms.
