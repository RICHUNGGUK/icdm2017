Our tool is designed according to an object-oriented paradigm and provides a rapid visualization of the objects profile from noisy far-field data in the case of both inhomogeneous and impenetrable objects. An application to microwave tomography is considered, showing that our tool can be used for both simulating hardware performances and testing the effectiveness of simulators for electromagnetic and acoustic computation.
