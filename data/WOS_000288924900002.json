We used agent-based modelling to develop a vector-based, micro-scale housing model to simulate the growth of informal settlements. A proto-type of the housing model was implemented for Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The results show that such a vector-based housing model built on three simple rules of spatial change (infilling, extension and enlargement of existing houses) can successfully simulate the housing pattern of informal settlements growth.
