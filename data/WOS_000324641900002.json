Recently, many CL-AKA protocols have been proposed. However, many of them need expensive bilinear pairings, which cannot be suitable for low-power devices such as sensors or mobile devices. To be implemented in practice, some pairing-free CL-AKA protocols have been built, however, very few of these pairing-free CL-AKA protocols can be secure in the eCK model. In this paper, we present a pairing-free CL-AKA protocol and provide a full proof of its security in the eCK model. Compared with the existing CL-AKA protocols, our protocol is more secure, practical and suitable for low-power devices.", "paper_title": "A Strongly Secure Pairing-free Certificateless Authenticated Key Agreement Protocol for Low-Power Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000324641900002"}
