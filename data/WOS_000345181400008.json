Although several efforts have been made in recent years to develop smaller and more portable devices, the features necessary for the continuous monitoring of outpatients require a less intrusive, obstructive and stigmatizing acquisition system. A useful strategy to overcome these limitations is based on adapting the monitoring system to the patient lifestyle and behavior by providing sets of different sensors that can be worn simultaneously or alternatively. This strategy offers to the patient the option of using one device or other according to his/her particular preferences. However this strategy requires a robust multi-sensor fusion methodology capable of taking maximum profit from all of the recorded information. With this aim, this study proposes two actigraphy fusion models including centralized and distributed architectures based on artificial neural networks. These novel fusion methods were tested both on synthetic datasets and real datasets, providing a parametric characterization of the models' behavior, and yielding results based on real case applications. The results obtained using both proposed fusion models exhibit good performance in terms of robustness to signal degradation, as well as a good behavior in terms of the dependence of signal quality on the number of signals fused. The distributed and centralized fusion methods reduce the mean averaged error of the original signals to 44% and 46% respectively when using simulated datasets. The proposed methods may therefore facilitate a less intrusive and more dependable way of acquiring valuable monitoring information from outpatients. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
