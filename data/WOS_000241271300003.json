In the absence of robust computational approaches for predicting ribosomal frameshifting, the success of proper annotation depends on annotators' familiarity with this phenomenon. Here we describe a novel computer tool that allows automatic discrimination of genes encoding class-I bacterial release factors, RF1, RF2 and RFH. Most usefully, this program identifies and automatically annotates +1 frameshifting in RF2 encoding genes. Comparison of ARFA performance with existing annotations of bacterial genomes revealed that only 20% of RF2 genes utilizing ribosomal frameshifting during their expression are annotated correctly.", "paper_title": "ARFA: a program for annotating bacterial release factor genes, including prediction of programmed ribosomal frameshifting", "paper_id": "WOS:000241271300003"}
