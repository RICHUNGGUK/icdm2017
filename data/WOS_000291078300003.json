Currently, Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) and System-on-Chip (SoC) designs are multi-objective in nature, requiring simultaneous fulfillment of multiple parameters. Extensive research on Design Space Exploration (DSE) problems and synthesis of an application specific processor (ASP) design have been done until now but none of the prior works have focused explicitly on integrating a fast multi-objective architecture exploration mechanism with the architectural synthesis stages to formalize the design methodology of an application specific processor in case of multiple objectives. This paper proposes a design methodology of a multi-objective application specific processor by integrating an efficient multi-objective (area occupied, execution time and power consumption) exploration approach with the architecture synthesis process, useful for portable devices and many high end applications. The formalized steps of the design methodology for the ASP guarantees the designer an error free approach to design the system with strict limitations on compound operational constraints. The results of implementation of the designed ASP using the proposed design methodology in FPGA and ASIC have also been shown. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
