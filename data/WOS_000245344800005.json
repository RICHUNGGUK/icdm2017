We show that we may decide in polynomial time if that number is finite. We give a combinatorial formula for computing the total number of affine solutions (with or without multiplicity) from which we deduce that this counting problem is #P-complete. We discuss special cases in which this formula may be computed in polynomial time: in particular. this is true for generic exponent vectors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
