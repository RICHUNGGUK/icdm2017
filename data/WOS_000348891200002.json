A broadcast network is assumed, so that only the transmit power of each node can be independently controlled, rather than each individual link. Starting with a maximally connected configuration in which all nodes transmit at full power, the proposed methods successively reduce the transmit power of a chosen node in order to remove one and only one link; nodes are greedily selected either in order to yield fastest convergence at each step, or if they have the largest degree in the network. These greedy schemes provide a good complexity-performance tradeoff with respect to full-blown global search methods. As a side benefit, improving the convergence speed also results in savings in energy consumption with respect to the maximally connected setting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
