It combines traditional split-and-merge techniques with a novel chromosome-repairing scheme to cope with constraints. Due to this combination of techniques we call our new method SMCR. In this new scheme an infeasible solution cannot only be easily transformed into a feasible one, but also be optimized. The experimental results show that the proposed SMCR has higher performance than the other GA-based methods and some non-GA-based methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
