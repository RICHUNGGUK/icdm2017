The visualization system upgrades previous methods of point-based rendering by detecting continuous surfaces and replacing them with decimated triangle meshes. High-quality visualization is retained by using render-to-texture methods to generate color textures and bump maps from original LiDAR data and applying them to the newly generated triangle meshes. This hybrid approach is able to decrease rendering times of surfaces to less than 50% with little to no difference in rendering quality. The described optimizations can be executed at run-time without interfering with user interaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
