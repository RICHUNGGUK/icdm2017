On the basis of this framework. we developed RFID middleware and in integrated information system for tracking and controlling the manufacturing process flow. A bicycle Manufacturer was used to demonstrate the prototype system. The findings of this study were that the proposed framework can improve the visibility and traceability of the manufacturing process as well as enhance process quality control and real-time production pedigree access. Using this framework, an enterprise can easily integrate an RFID-based system into its manufacturing environment to facilitate mass customization and a just-in-time production model.", "paper_title": "An RFID-Based Manufacturing Control Framework for Loosely Coupled Distributed Manufacturing System Supporting Mass Customization", "paper_id": "WOS:000262010400008"}
