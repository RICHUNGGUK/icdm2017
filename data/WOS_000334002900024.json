Such networks play an important role in several scenarios of patient monitoring, particularly those where data collection is vital for diagnosis and/or research purposes. However, despite emerging solutions, wearable sensors still depend on users' acceptance. One proposed solution to improve wearability relies on the use of smaller sensing nodes, requiring more energy-efficient networks, due to smaller room available for energy sources. In such context, smaller wireless sensor network nodes are required to work long time periods without human intervention and, at the same time, to provide appropriate levels of reliability and quality of service. Satisfaction of these two goals depends on several key factors, such as the routing protocol, the network topology, and energy efficiency. This paper offers a solution to increase the network lifetime based on a new Energy-Aware Objective Function used to design a Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks. The proposed Objective Function uses the Expected Transmission Count Metric and the Remaining Energy on each sensor node to compute the best paths to route data packets across the network. When compared with state of the art solutions, the proposed method increases the network lifetime by 21% and reduces the peaks of energy consumption by 12%. In this way, wireless sensor network nodes wearability can be improved, making them smaller and lighter, while maintaining the required performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
