After the governing equations of an NAPL dissolution system are briefly described, a combination of the finite element and finite difference methods is proposed to solve these equations. In the proposed numerical procedure, the finite difference method is used to discretize time, while the finite element method is used to discretize space. Two benchmark problems, for which either analytical results or previous solutions are available, are used to verify the proposed numerical procedure. The related simulation results from these two benchmark problems have demonstrated that the proposed numerical procedure is useful and applicable for simulating the morphological evolution of NAPL dissolution fronts in two-dimensional fluid-saturated porous media of finite domains. As an application, the proposed numerical procedure has been used to simulate morphological evolution processes for three kinds of NAPL dissolution fronts in supercritical NAPL dissolution systems. It has been recognized that: (1) if the Zhao number of an NAPL dissolution system is in the lower range of the supercritical Zhao numbers, the fundamental mode is predominant; (2) if the Zhao number is in the middle range of the supercritical Zhao numbers, the (normal) fingering mode is the predominant pattern of the NAPL dissolution front; and (3) if the Zhao number is in the higher range of the supercritical Zhao numbers, the fractal mode is predominant for the NAPL dissolution front.", "paper_title": "Computational simulation for the morphological evolution of nonaqueous phase liquid dissolution fronts in two-dimensional fluid-saturated porous media", "paper_id": "WOS:000288223900012"}
