Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the sensorimotor cortices, the system mainly consists of enhanced active segment selection, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. In addition to the original use of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, the 2D anisotropic Gaussian filter is proposed to further refine the selection of active segments. We then extract several features, including spectral power and asymmetry ratio, coherence and phase-locking value, and multiresolution fractal feature vector, for subsequent classification. Next, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select features from the combination of above-mentioned features. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification. Compared with \"without enhanced active segment selection,\" several potential features and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on MI data from two data sets for 10 subjects, the results indicate that the proposed method achieves 86.7% average classification accuracy, which is promising in BCI applications.", "paper_title": "SINGLE-TRIAL MOTOR IMAGERY CLASSIFICATION USING ASYMMETRY RATIO, PHASE RELATION, WAVELET-BASED FRACTAL, AND THEIR SELECTED COMBINATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000317626200005"}
