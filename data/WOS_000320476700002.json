We have identified two concurrent but complementary approaches for design. The first is a bottom-up approach where the design is made by aggregation of standard components. The second is a top-down approach where the design is made by successive refining of a model. This paper offers an integrated design flow for the joint generation of controls and users interfaces for reconfigurable sociotechnical systems. In accordance with our industrial feedback our approach is based on a business model called the synoptic, and on a library of standard elements. We describe the tool Anaxagore, that implements this approach and with which one can generate, in few minutes, a command and an interface for two simple input models. The results of the generation are consistent with the specifications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
