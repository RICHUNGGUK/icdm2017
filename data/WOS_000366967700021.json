Using SOA architecture and cloud computing, we build an integration and optimizing allocation cloud platform of high quality teaching resources for universities-led collaborative innovation to meet the resource requirements of universities based on the analysis of basic concept, types, core process, and evolution characteristics of university-led collaborative innovation following the inherent laws of university-led collaborative innovation, and then analyze the construction concept, logical architecture and main functions of the platform,. Finally, we provide a series of suggestions to the relevant universities and government departments to effectively promote the smooth implementation of the university-led collaborative innovation activities and the integration and optimizing allocation cloud platform of high quality teaching resources for university-led collaborative innovation.", "paper_title": "A Cloud Platform for the Integration and Optimizing Allocation of High Quality Teaching Resources based on the University-led Collaborative Innovation", "paper_id": "WOS:000366967700021"}
