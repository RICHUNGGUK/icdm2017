Such information has appealing capabilities for application to ground and aerial robots, especially for navigation and collision avoidance in urban or indoor areas. The purpose of this paper is to provide a survey of existing optical flow techniques for robotics navigation applications. Detailed comparisons are made among different optical-flow-aided navigation solutions with emphasis on the sensor hardware as well as optical flow motion models. A summary of current research status and future research directions are further discussed.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Optical Flow Techniques for Robotics Navigation Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400025"}
