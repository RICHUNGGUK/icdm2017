To design such technologies, an existing model of computer-support reflective learning was instantiated with findings from a pre-design study in one residential home. The result was a mobile device running an adapted enterprise social media app to support person-centred care. Evaluations of the device and app in two residential homes revealed that use of the app both motivated and increased different styles of care note recording, but little reflective learning was identified or reported. The results suggest the need for more comprehensive and flexible computer-based support for reflective learning about residents in their care - and new designs of this more comprehensive support are also introduced.", "paper_title": "Using mobile devices and apps to support reflective learning about older people with dementia", "paper_id": "WOS:000353723800006"}
