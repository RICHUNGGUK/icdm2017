We establish the equivalence between the generalized vector F-variational inequality and the generalized vector F-complementarity problem under certain assumptions. By considering the existence of solutions for the vector F-variational inequality with a single-valued mapping and using the continuous selection theorem, we obtain some new existence theorems of solutions for the generalized vector F-variational inequality and the generalized vector F-complementarity problem, respectively.
