From a set Of unorganized points, the proposed algorithm can construct curves that look natural to human vision. The VICUR algorithm is based oil two connectivity criteria: proximity and good continuation from the prominent Gestalt principles of perception. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of VICUR. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
