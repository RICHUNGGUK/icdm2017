The idea comes from a clear analogy between firewall rules and P systems rules: they both modify and or move objects (data packets, or symbols of an alphabet) among the regions of the system. The use of P systems for modeling packet filters, routers and firewalls gives the possibility to check - and possibly mathematically prove some security properties.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Analysis of Firewalls by (Tissue-like) P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000291700300006"}
