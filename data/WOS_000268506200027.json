Results of maximum knee flexion and extension controls with neurologically intact Subjects Suggested that the OAFs would be effective in reaching the target within small number of cycles and in reducing the error after reaching the target. Oscillating responses between cycles were also suppressed. The fuzzy controller was expected to be examined to optimize the OAFs, with more subjects including paralyzed patients for clinical application.", "paper_title": "Preliminary Tests of a Practical Fuzzy FES Controller Based on Cycle-to-Cycle Control in the Knee Flexion and Extension Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506200027"}
