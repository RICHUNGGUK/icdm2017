Large particles can enhance the small-scale vortex, so that gas-phase turbulence intensity is increased, while small particles may delay the rolling up of the gas vortex, so that gas-phase turbulence intensity is attenuated. The critical particle size range for such different effects is between 150 mu m and 200 mu m, corresponding to the Stokes number is between 88 and 157 under the present flow conditions. The PIV results show small particles can retain the gas-phase vortex structure, while large particles can break large vortex structure. The particle Stokes number is not the only judgment standard whether particles enhance or attenuate gas-phase turbulence. The CTI (Change of Turbulence Intensity) number can mark off particle modulation on turbulence in two-phase flow, but more studies are needed.", "paper_title": "Flow visualization and laser measurement on particle modulation to gas-phase turbulence", "paper_id": "WOS:000238663100019"}
