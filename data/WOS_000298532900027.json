In the model, it is assumed that depending on the distance, a certain percentage of clients go from their homes to the nearest distribution center. An application in humanitarian logistics is envisaged. For the computational solution of the resulting bi-objective two-stage stochastic program with recourse, a branch-and-cut technique, applied to a sample-average version of the problem obtained from a fixed random sample of demand vectors, is used within an epsilon-constraint algorithm. Computational results on real-world data for rural communities in Senegal show the viability of the approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
