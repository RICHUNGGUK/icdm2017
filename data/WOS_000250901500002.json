Currently existing techniques such as statecharts, interaction diagrams, activity diagrams, when applied to information systems and especially when precise specification of static and dynamic constraints is desired, appear to have some deficiencies. The paper presents obligation nets, a kind of high-level Petri net, as a technique to capture the required behavior of the system. The technique produces models that are both unambiguous and intuitive (thus easy to use). A formal semantics for obligation nets will be given in terms of colored Petri nets. Finally, examples will be given to illustrate practical uses of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Obligation nets: a rigorous object-oriented technique for modeling the behavioural semantics of information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250901500002"}
