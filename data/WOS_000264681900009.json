In this article we extend the design intent coverage methodology to hybrid specifications containing both state-machines and formal properties. We demonstrate the benefits of this extension in two domains of considerable recent interest, namely (a) the use of auxiliary state-machines in formal specifications, and (b) the use of modest sized RTL blocks in the design intent coverage analysis.", "paper_title": "Design Intent Coverage Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000264681900009"}
