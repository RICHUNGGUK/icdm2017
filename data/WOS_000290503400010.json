The ABC index provides a good model for the stability of linear and branched alkanes as well as the strain energy of cycloalkanes. In this paper, we characterize the catacondensed hexagonal systems with extreme ABC indices, and prove that the ABC index of a graph decreases when any edge is deleted. Consequently, it is also proved that the graph with n vertices and the maximum ABC index is the complete graph K(n).", "paper_title": "Extreme Atom-Bond Connectivity Index of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000290503400010"}
