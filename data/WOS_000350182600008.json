With the advent of mobile devices, users can interact with Social Media platforms anytime/anywhere, increasing the proportion of geo-located Social Media interactions and opening new doors to localized insights. This article suggests a new method built upon the industry standard Recency, Frequency and Monetary model to quantify the impact of a topic on a defined geographical location during a given period of time. We model each component with a set of metrics analyzing how users in the location actively engage with the topic and how they are exposed to the interactions in their Social Media network related to the topic. Our method implements a full fledged information extraction system consuming geo-localized Social Media interactions and generating on a regular basis the impact quantification metrics. To validate our approach, we analyze its performance in two real-world cases using geo-located tweets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
