By means of classes, an automaton can be established that determines the current and the next connections of functional states of a process. When fuzzy clustering is used, the connections in the historical data are considered but it does not find other important connections. To solve this limitation, a new method to seek the most important connections among functional states is proposed. Initially, the approach defines an initial transition degrees matrix, where all connections are taken into account. Through a proposed update step, the most important connections are obtained, which they describe the real behavior of a process. In addition, a new distance criterion is defined to improve the update step. The final transition degrees matrix is used to construct a fuzzy automaton that it is validated by human operator's experience. The approach was tested in a steam generator process. Applying three fuzzy clustering algorithms in case of study, the proposed method finds the same transition matrix. The new connections were validated by the human operator.
