Proto-tRNAs in the dimers recognize each other through anticodon pairing. The proteins produced recognize the producing dimers through binding, forming (proto) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) aggregates. Their functions were stimulated and specificities evolved through cycling. Such cycles would be among the first in the construction of living networks, and examples of processes that might be relevant for modeling cognitive networks. The protein synthesis process is considered a main drive for the living system's specific attributes of anabolic and evolutionary semi-autonomy. Structures of the anticodon dimer networks are presented. Biological data point to the encoding having been installed on the modules of dimers formed by nonself-complementary triplets. Aminoacyl-tRNA adhesion interactions integrated the dimer networks into RNP networks. Specific questions are proposed for simulation and modeling that should help in designing experimental procedures aiming at testing the model and the development of synthetic genetic codes.", "paper_title": "Mutuality in Discrete and Compositional Information: Perspectives for Synthetic Genetic Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000305213200011"}
