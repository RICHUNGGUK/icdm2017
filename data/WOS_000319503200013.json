A Nyquist stability criterion-based approach is adopted to derive the conditions for stability. Sufficient stabilisability conditions by FO [proportional integral] controllers and FO-leadlag controllers are established. In addition, robust stability of the system with these FO controllers is investigated. To illustrate the results, some examples are provided.", "paper_title": "Stabilisation of unstable FOPDT processes with a single zero by fractional-order controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000319503200013"}
