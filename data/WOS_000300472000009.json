In this work, the distance between the gate and drain contact (D-gd) has been enlarged to obtain a better maximum available gain (MAG). By using the asymmetric-layout transistor, a 0.6 dB MAG improvement is realized when Dgd changes from 60 nm to 200 mm A four-stage common-source low noise amplifier is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. A measured peak power gain of 24 dB is achieved with a power dissipation of 30 mW from a 1.2-V power supply. An 18 dB variable gain is also realized by adjusting the bias voltage. The measured 3-dB bandwidth is about 17 GHz from 51 GHz to 68 GHz, and noise figure (NF) is from 4.0 dB to 7.6 dB.", "paper_title": "A 24 dB Gain 51-68 GHz Common Source Low Noise Amplifier Using Asymmetric-Layout Transistors", "paper_id": "WOS:000300472000009"}
