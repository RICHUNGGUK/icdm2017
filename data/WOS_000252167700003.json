The core of the proofs resides in triangulation results for manifolds with boundary, not necessarily bounded. The method is based upon geometric considerations that are further augmented for 2-dimensional manifolds (i.e surfaces). In addition, we show how to apply the main results to obtain a new, geometric proof of the classical Shannon sampling theorem, and also to image analysis.", "paper_title": "Sampling and reconstruction of surfaces and higher dimensional manifolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000252167700003"}
