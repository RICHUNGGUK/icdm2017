Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is the typical statistical inference method. This paper presents a new inference method, named the random variable transformation (RVT) method, for Weibull constant-stress accelerated life tests with progressively Type-II right censoring (including ordinary Type-II right censoring). A two-parameter Weibull life distribution with a scale parameter that is a log-linear function of stress is used. RVT inference life distribution parameters and the log-linear function coefficients are provided. Exact confidence intervals for these parameters are also explored. Numerical comparisons of RVT-based estimates to MLE show that the proposed RVT inference is promising, in particular for small sample sizes.", "paper_title": "New Inference for Constant-Stress Accelerated Life Tests With Weibull Distribution and Progressively Type-II Censoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000345904800010"}
