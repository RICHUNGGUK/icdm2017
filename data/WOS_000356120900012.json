These fields were averaged along the slip lines that resulted from Prandtl's mechanism in accordance with Vanmarcke's approach. An efficient algorithm for evaluating reliability measures when the bearing capacity along kinematically admissible slip lines has been investigated. A significant improvement relative to earlier works is obtained by utilising random slip line locations. This improvement allows authors to evaluate the impact on reliability indices of incorporating changes in slip line geometry. Finally, reliability indices were evaluated for foundations of various widths by Monte Carlo simulation, and the results were compared with those obtained in earlier works. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
