The problems that have to be solved are manifold: How can existing services be integrated into a workflow that is able to accomplish a specific task? How can an optimal workflow be constructed with respect to changing resource characteristics during the optimization process? How to cope with dynamically changing or incomplete knowledge of the goal function of the optimization process? and finally: How to react to service failures during workflow execution? In this paper, we propose a method to optimize a workflow based on a heuristic A* approach that allows to react to dynamics in the environment. Changes in the Grid infrastructure and in the users' requirements can be handled during the optimization process as well as during the execution of the workflow. Our algorithm also allows the workflow to recover from failing resources during the execution phase.
