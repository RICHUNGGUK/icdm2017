The purpose of this paper is to consider a class of stochastic models in severity and risk duration reduction operations. Design/methodology/approach - A new stochastic model is formulated which is shown to be of some importance in fundamental risk management operations. The investigation of such a model is based on classical methods of characteristic functions theory. Findings - A stochastic model having the form of the product of two non-negative and independent random variables is formulated. A characterization of the distribution of such a model is established. Moreover, applications of the proposed stochastic model in risk control programs of organizations are provided. Research limitations/implications - The difficulty of evaluating the corresponding distribution function, which extends the practical applicability of the proposed stochastic model still remains. Originality/value - The formulated stochastic model consists of a strong analytical tool for investigating operations of risk control programs.", "paper_title": "Stochastic models for risk control programs of organizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000279227800007"}
