We solve the problem of taking as input a 3D model of a man-made object, and automatically generating the parts and connectors needed to build the corresponding physical object. We focus on furniture models, and we define formal grammars for IKEA cabinets and tables. We perform lexical analysis to identify the primitive parts of the 3D model. Structural analysis then gives structural information to these parts, and generates the connectors (i.e. nails, screws) needed to attach the parts together. We demonstrate our approach with arbitrary 3D models of cabinets and tables available online.", "paper_title": "Converting 3D Furniture Models to Fabricatable Parts and Connectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000297216400059"}
