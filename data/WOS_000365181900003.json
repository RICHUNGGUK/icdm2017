LBP is a gray scale invariant texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel with the value of the center pixel and considers the result as a binary number. LBP labels can be regarded as local primitives such as curved edges, spots, flat areas etc. These labels or their statistics, most commonly the histogram, can then be used for further image analysis. Due to its discriminative power and computational simplicity, the LBP methodology has already attained an established position in computer vision. LBP is also very flexible: it can be easily adapted to different types of problems and used together with other image descriptors. Since its introduction. LBP has inspired plenty of new methods, thus revealing that texture based region descriptors can be very efficient in representing different images. Nowadays, many LBP variants can be found in the literature. This article reviews 13 variants and provides a comparative analysis on two different problems (gender and texture classification) using benchmark databases. The experiments show that basic LBP provides good results and generalizes well to different problems and hence can be a good starting point when trying to find an optimal variant for a given application. The best results are obtained with BSIF (binarized statistical image features) but at the cost of higher computational time compared to basic LOP. Furthermore, experiments on combining three best performing descriptors are conducted, pointing out useful insight into their complementarity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
