The general methods for the computation of liquid and solid components are illustrated. It is shown that the component estimate may take great advantage from application of Principal Component Analysis techniques, owing to the characteristic structure of adhesion work equations. The related problem of scale multiplicity is also discussed as a consequence of the symmetries involved in the model equations of adhesion work and surface free energy. Special attention is paid to the specific cases of van Oss-Chaudhury- Good acid-base theory, Qin and Chang model, extended Drago theory.", "paper_title": "Multicomponent surface free energy theories and principal component analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000248087300016"}
