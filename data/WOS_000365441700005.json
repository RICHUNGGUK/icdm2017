Our custom-built portable USB device is able to capture multi-channel highspeed surface EMG signals from muscles and its software counterpart is capable to control common PC interface including ordinary text editors such as MS Word. At the time of the study the system utilized three parallel EMG channels to control user interfaces. The interaction was based on series of 1-of-N selections which specify rows and columns in on-screen keyboards. The selection was performed by quantification of selected muscle activity of the user. The system was further tested by a disabled person who provided input during a participatory design session. Our study has demonstrated that the system and the user interface can be used for effective text input and editing also in disabled people.", "paper_title": "Control of word processing environment using myoelectric signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000365441700005"}
