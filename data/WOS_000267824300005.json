These randomized incremental constructions (RICs) still work with imperfect randomness: the dynamic operations need only be \"locally\" random. Much attention has been given recently to inputs generated by Markov sources. These are particularly interesting to study in the framework of RICs, because Markov chains provide highly nonlocal randomness, which incapacitates virtually all known RIC technology. We generalize Mulmuley's theory of Theta-series and prove that Markov incremental constructions with bounded spectral gap are optimal within polylog factors for trape-zoidal maps, segment intersections, and convex hulls in any fixed dimension. The main contribution of this work is threefold: (i) extending the theory of abstract configuration spaces to the Markov setting; (ii) proving Clarkson-Shor-type bounds for this new model; (iii) applying the results to classical geometric problems. We hope that this work will pioneer a new approach to randomized analysis in computational geometry.", "paper_title": "Markov Incremental Constructions", "paper_id": "WOS:000267824300005"}
