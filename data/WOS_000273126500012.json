Necessary conditions for optimal impulse control are derived. A neural network structure to solve the resulting equations for optimal control is presented. Solution concepts are illustrated with example problems that exhibit increasing levels of difficulty. Two linear problems, one scalar and one vector and a benchmark nonlinear problem, the Van Der Pol oscillator, are used as case studies. Numerical results show the efficacy of the new solution process for impulse driven systems. Since the theoretical development and the design technique are free from restrictive assumptions, this technique is applicable to many problems in engineering and science. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
