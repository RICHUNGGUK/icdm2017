In this paper, we present a decision-making process that uses our proposed Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) Algorithm to solve multi-stage portfolio optimization problem. The objective function is classical return-variance function. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated by optimizing the allocation of cash and various stocks in S&P 100 index. Experiments are conducted to compare performance of the portfolios optimized by different objective functions with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (GA) in terms of efficient frontiers.", "paper_title": "Solving multi-period financial planning problem via quantum-behaved particle swarm algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300143"}
