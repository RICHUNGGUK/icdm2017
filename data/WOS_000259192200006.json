However, no mechanism or method has been standardized to accurately evaluate the amount of resources remaining on a given channel. Such an evaluation would, however, be a good asset for bandwidth-constrained applications. In multihop ad hoc networks, such evaluation becomes even more difficult. Consequently, despite the various contributions around this research topic, the estimation of the available bandwidth still represents one of the main issues in this field. In this paper, we propose an improved mechanism to estimate the available bandwidth in IEEE 802.11 -based ad hoc networks. Through simulations, we compare the accuracy of the estimation we propose to the estimation performed by other state-of-the-art QoS protocols, BIRuIT, AAC, and QoS-AODV.", "paper_title": "Bandwidth estimation for IEEE 802.11-based ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000259192200006"}
