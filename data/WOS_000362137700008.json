GEX generalizes existing approaches and provides for a highly expressive graph-based query language that supports queries ranging from keyword-based to structured ones. The GEX query answering model gracefully blends label approximation with structural relaxation, under the primary objective of delivering meaningfully approximated results only. GEX implements ad-hoc data structures that are exploited by a top-k retrieval algorithm which enhances the approximate matching of complex queries. An extensive experimental evaluation on real world datasets demonstrates the efficiency of the GEX query answering. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
