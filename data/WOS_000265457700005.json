In order to transfer signals among the circuits operating at different voltage levels specialized voltage interface circuits are required. Two novel multi-threshold voltage (multi-V-th) level converters are proposed in this paper. The new multi-V-th, level converters are compared with the previously published circuits for operation at different supply voltages. When the circuits are individually optimized for minimum power consumption, the proposed level converters offer significant power savings of up to 70% as compared to the previously published circuits. Alternatively, when the circuits are individually optimized for minimum propagation delay, the speed is enhanced by up to 78% with the proposed voltage interface circuits in a 0.18-mu m TSMC CMOS technology.", "paper_title": "Low Power and High Speed Multi Threshold Voltage Interface Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000265457700005"}
