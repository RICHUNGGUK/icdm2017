The program has deterministic and stochastic generation modes and efficiently supports various types of structural constraints. The problem of exhaustive and irredundant generation is discussed, and a new algorithm of the complete rejection of isomorphic molecular graphs is proposed. The main application of the generator is QSAR studies; however, applications in combinatorial chemistry are also possible.", "paper_title": "Generation of molecular graphs for QSAR studies: An approach based on supergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000251216500006"}
