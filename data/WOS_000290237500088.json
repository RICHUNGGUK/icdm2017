In this paper, an interactive robust data envelopment analysis (IRDEA) model is proposed to determine the input and output target values of electricity distribution companies with considering the existence perturbation in data. Target setting is implemented with the uncertain data and the decision maker (DM) can search the envelop frontier and find the targets based on his preference. In order to search the envelop frontier, the paper combine the DEA and multi-objective linear programming method such as STEM. The proposed method of this paper is capable of handling uncertainty in data and finding the target values according to the DM's preferences. To illustrate ability the proposed model, a numerical example is solved. Also, the input and output target values for some of the electricity distribution companies in Iran are reported. The results indicate that the IRDEA model is suitable for target setting based on DM's preferences and with considering uncertain data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
