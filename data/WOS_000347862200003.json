Considering the issue of anchor dependency, we use multiple anchor points in the decision-making process and employ approximate positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions as the points of reference. Selected useful properties of the approximate ideal solutions are also investigated. In contrast to the classical LINMAP methods, this paper directly generates approximate ideal solutions from the characteristics of all alternatives. Next, this work presents the concept of closeness-based indices using Minkowski distances with approximate ideal solutions to develop a new approach for determining measurements of consistency and inconsistency. Under incomplete preference information on paired comparisons of the alternatives, this paper provides a novel method that uses the concept of comprehensive closeness-based indices to measure the poorness of fit and the goodness of fit. By applying the consistency indices and inconsistency indices, this work formulates an optimization problem that can be solved for the optimal weights of the criteria and thus acquires the best compromise alternative. Additionally, this paper explores the problem of supplier selection and conducts a comparative discussion to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed interval type-2 fuzzy LINMAP method with approximate ideal solutions. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to address a marketplace decision difficulty (MPDD)-prone decision-making problem to provide additional contributions for practical implications.
