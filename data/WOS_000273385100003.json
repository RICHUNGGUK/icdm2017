In this paper we present a decision support system (DSS) to aid those Humanitarian NGOs concerned with the response to natural disasters. Such a DSS has been designed avoiding sophisticated methodologies that may exceed the infrastructural requirements and constraints of emergency management by NGOs. A data-based, two-level knowledge methodology which allows damage assessment of multiple disaster scenarios is presented in order to address that problem. Validation results show viability of our approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
