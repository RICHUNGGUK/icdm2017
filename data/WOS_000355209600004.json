The data structure, called TP-automata, suits the needs of high-performance Linked Data stream dissemination. Here, the authors use a real-world dataset generated in a Smart Building IoT Project to evaluate the system. Results show that the system can disseminate Linked Data Streams at one million triples per second with 100,000 registered user queries, which is several orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques.", "paper_title": "Matching Over Linked Data Streams in the Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000355209600004"}
