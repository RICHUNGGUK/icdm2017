There exist several algorithms for the problem, with acceptable runtimes for certain classes of graphs, but many of them are infeasible for massive graphs. We present a new exact algorithm that employs novel pruning techniques and is able to find maximum cliques in very large, sparse graphs quickly. Extensive experiments on different kinds of synthetic and real-world graphs show that our new algorithm can be orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms. We also present a heuristic that runs orders of magnitude faster than the exact algorithm while providing optimal or near-optimal solutions. We illustrate a simple application of the algorithms in developing methods for detection of overlapping communities in networks.", "paper_title": "FAST ALGORITHMS FOR THE MAXIMUM CLIQUE PROBLEM ON MASSIVE GRAPHS WITH APPLICATIONS TO OVERLAPPING COMMUNITY DETECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000359385900008"}
