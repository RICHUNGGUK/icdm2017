Here, we show that the technique can also be useful in the design of exact exponential time algorithms to solve NP-hard problems. We exemplify our findings with algorithms for the MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT SET problem, a parameterized and a counting version of d-HITTING SET and the MAXIMUM INDUCED CLUSTER SUBGRAPH problem.
