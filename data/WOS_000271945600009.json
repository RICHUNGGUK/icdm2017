In Devroye and Toussaint [1993] and Golin et al. [2002] the problem of computing the convex hull of the intersection points of n lines was considered, where the lines are chosen randomly according to two various models. In both models, linear-time algorithms were developed. Here we improve the results of Devroye and Toussaint [1993] by giving a universal algorithm for a wider range of distributions.", "paper_title": "A Linear Algorithm for Computing Convex Hulls for Random Lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000271945600009"}
