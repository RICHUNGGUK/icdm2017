From the perspective of structural holes theory, this paper studies the platformization evolution mechanism of high-tech service innovation network and the formation of different kinds of platform enterprises in this process with a simulation analysis. Results indicate that, based on the scale-free property of the high-tech service innovation network and the evolution of structural holes and so on, network evolves into platform with an approach of \"appearance and differentiation of node enterprises. modularization. module embedded. formation of system platform\"; the node with rich structural holes has more advantages to become the platform enterprise, and the node bridging large amount of structural hole is more likely to be the system platform enterprise.", "paper_title": "Platformization Mechanism and Simulation Analysis of High-tech Service Innovation Network Based on Structural Holes Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000369384200019"}
