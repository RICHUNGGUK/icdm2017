Here, it is assumed that the channel's support and coefficient realizations are both unknown, although their statistics are known. Assuming Gaussian non-zero-coefficients and noise, and focusing on the high-SNR regime, it is first shown that the ergodic noncoherent channel capacity has pre-log factor 1 - S/N for any L. It is then shown that, to communicate with arbitrarily small error probability at rates in accordance with the capacity pre-log factor, it suffices to use pilot-aided orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) with S pilots per fading block, in conjunction with an appropriate noncoherent decoder. Since the achievability result is proven using a noncoherent decoder whose complexity grows exponentially in the number of fading blocks K, a simpler decoder, based on S + 1 pilots, is also proposed. Its -achievable rate is shown to have pre-log factor equal to 1 - S + 1/N with the previously considered channel, while its achievable rate is shown to have pre-log factor 1 - S + 1/N when the support of the block-fading channel remains fixed over time.", "paper_title": "On Communication Over Unknown Sparse Frequency-Selective Block-Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000021"}
