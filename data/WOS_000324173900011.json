The framework contains the vertical throttling-based runtime thermal management (VT-RTM) scheme and the transport-layer assisted routing (TLAR) scheme. VT-RTM scheme increases the cooling speed and maintains high availability. TLAR scheme sustains the throughput of the nonstationary irregular mesh network. In our experiments, VT-RTM scheme reduces cooling time by 84% and achieves 98% network availability; the overall performance impact is around 8% of traditional schemes. TLAR scheme reduces average latency by 35 similar to 70% and improves sustainable throughput by 76%.", "paper_title": "Transport-Layer-Assisted Routing for Runtime Thermal Management of 3D NoC Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000324173900011"}
