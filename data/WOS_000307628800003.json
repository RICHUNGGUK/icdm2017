Intensive research has also been undertaken on the classification of natural and human-made structures from LIDAR data and high-resolution imagery, with the aim of constructing detailed 3D urban models. Here, a new, simplified hybrid classification algorithm is presented for efficient urban feature extraction. It can handle topographic and image data without sacrificing accuracy compared with artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. Numerical and graphical analyses are conducted to assess the importance of LIDAR height information, and this is then used to resolve classification confusion between high and low objects by applying two-height-level knowledge-based rules. A maximum likelihood classification method is used to sort input features into low/high categories, and these results are then merged. The proposed hybrid classification method revealed the utility of considering LIDAR height and demonstrated higher efficiency and equivalent or improved accuracy compared with traditional ANN/SVM methods.", "paper_title": "FUSION OF LIDAR HEIGHT DATA FOR URBAN FEATURE CLASSIFICATION USING A HYBRID METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800003"}
