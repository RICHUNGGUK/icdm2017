We consider orthogonal packings where 90 degrees rotations are allowed. The algorithms we show for these problems have asymptotic performance bounds 2.64, and 4.89, respectively. These algorithms are for the more general case in which the bounded dimensions of the bin given in the input are not necessarily equal (that is, we consider bins for which the length. the width and the height are not necessarily equal). Moreover, we show that these problems-in the general version-are as hard to approximate as the corresponding oriented version. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
