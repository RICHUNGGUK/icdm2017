The proposed delivery solution combines the benefits of periodic broadcasting and stream merging, thereby enabling scalable video delivery. Video advertisements are delivered to the clients prior to viewing the requested videos. The revenues generated from the ads are used to subsidize the price of the requested videos. The pricing is determined based on the total ad viewing time. The proposed solution includes an efficient ad allocation scheme and a new constraint-based scheduling approach. In addition, the paper investigates how targeted advertisements can be efficiently supported. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of the overall solutions and analyze and compare the effectiveness of various scheduling policies and ad allocation alternatives in terms of several metrics, including client defection probability, average number of viewed ads per client, price, channel utilization, revenue, and profit.", "paper_title": "A scalable delivery solution and a pricing model for commercial video-on-demand systems with video advertisements", "paper_id": "WOS:000344744200015"}
