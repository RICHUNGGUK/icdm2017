A type of dual problem is constructed and the duality assertions are obtained. By using the obtained duality assertions, some Farkas-type results which characterize the optimal value of the problem (P) are given. Some programming problems considered in recent literature are the special cases of the problem (P). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
