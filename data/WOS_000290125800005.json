Two plane embeddings of rooted triangulated planar graphs are defined to be equivalent if they admit an isomorphism such that the designated roots correspond to each other. Given a positive integer n, we give an O(n)-space and O(1)-time delay algorithm that generates all biconnected rooted triangulated planar graphs with at most n vertices without delivering two reflectively symmetric copies.", "paper_title": "Generation of Symmetric and Asymmetric Biconnected Rooted Triangulated Planar Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125800005"}
