The advantage of the explicit finite difference methods is easier to implement than the implicit methods. Moreover, the explicit method need lesser CPU time than the implicit schemes. Numerical results show that the proposed method is very accurate and effective.", "paper_title": "A New Fourth-Order Explicit Finite Difference Method for the Solution of Parabolic Partial Differential Equation with Nonlocal Boundary Conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000330602500014"}
