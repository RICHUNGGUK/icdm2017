This results in LCZ signal sets with huge sizes over three different alphabetic sets: finite field of size q, integer residue ring modulo q, and the subset in the complex field which consists of powers of a primitive qth root of unity. We show a connection between these sequence designs and \"completely noncyclic\" Hadamard matrices and a construction for those sequences. We also provide some open problems along this direction.", "paper_title": "A note on low-correlation zone signal sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000247606300018"}
