However, API documents often do not include enough information for developers to fully understand how to use the APIs, and searching for good code examples requires considerable effort. To address this problem, we propose a novel code example recommendation system that combines the strength of browsing documents and searching for code examples and returns API documents embedded with high-quality code example summaries mined from the Web. Our evaluation results show that our approach provides code examples with high precision and boosts programmer productivity.", "paper_title": "Enriching Documents with Examples: A Corpus Mining Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000315057000001"}
