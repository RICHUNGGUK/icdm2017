The strokes drawn by the user must not then be restricted to the drawing plane: their orientation in the 3D space is automatically determined by the system. The desired surface is reconstructed from a grid made of two groups of similar lines, that are considered co-planar. The orientation of the two sets of planes is determined by assuming that at the intersection of a representative line of each group, those two lines are perpendicular.", "paper_title": "Single-View Sketch Based Surface Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000267639600010"}
