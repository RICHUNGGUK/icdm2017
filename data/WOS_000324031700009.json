We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of different path relinking strategies, these strategies focus on two main steps: the ways of path generation and the mechanisms of solutions selection. We propose different methods to establish the path relinking algorithms in a multi-objective context. Computational results on a biobjective flow shop problem (FSP) and a statistical comparison are reported in the paper. In comparison with two versions of HBMOLS, the algorithms selecting a set of solutions located in the middle of the generated path are efficient. The behavior of these algorithms sheds light on ways to further improvements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
