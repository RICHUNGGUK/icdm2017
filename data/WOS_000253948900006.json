A gapped-factor is a factor containing a gap that is ignored during the indexation. The data structure presented is based on the suffix tree and indexes all the gapped-factors of a text with a fixed size of gap, and only those. The construction of this data structure is done online in linear time and space. Such a data structure may play an important role in various pattern matching and motif inference problems, for instance in text filtration.", "paper_title": "Indexing gapped-factors using a tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000253948900006"}
