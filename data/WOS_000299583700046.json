Inspired by mean-variance type utility functions in the financial risk management, a new class of decision functions are defined based on the weighted score function and the weighted accuracy function in the intuitionistic fuzzy setting. By choosing a suitable parameter value, the decision maker's risk attitude can be flexibly reflected by our decision function. The new method can be applied for both the exactly known and partly known criteria weight situations. For the latter case, it is only necessary to solve one linear programming problem. The developed models and algorithms are then extended to multiple criteria decision making problems with the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the practicality, flexibility and efficiency of our new algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
