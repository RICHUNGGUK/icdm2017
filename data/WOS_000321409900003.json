A basic case, where the number of clauses is decreased (i.e., c(DP upsilon(F)) < c(F)), is singular DP-reduction (sDP-reduction), where upsilon must occur in one polarity only once. For minimally unsatisfiable F is an element of MU, sDP-reduction produces another F' := DP upsilon(F) is an element of MU with the same deficiency, that is, delta(F') = delta(F); recall delta(F) = c(F) - n(F), using n(F) for the number of variables. Let sDP(F) for F is an element of MU be the set of results of complete sDP-reduction for F; so F' E sDP(F) fulfil F' E MU, are nonsingular (every literal occurs at least twice), and we have delta(F') = delta(F). We show that for F is an element of MU all complete reductions by sDP must have the same length, establishing the singularity index of F. In other words, for F', F '' is an element of sDP(F) we have n(F') = n(F ''). In general the elements of sDP(F) are not even (pairwise) isomorphic. Using the fundamental characterisation by Kleine Buning, we obtain as application of the singularity index, that we have confluence modulo isomorphism (all elements of sDP(F) are pairwise isomorphic) in case delta(F) = 2. In general we prove that we have confluence (i.e., vertical bar sDP(F)vertical bar = 1) for saturated F (i.e., F is an element of &WU). More generally, we show confluence modulo isomorphism for eventually saturated F, that is, where we have sDP(F) subset of &MU, yielding another proof for confluence modulo isomorphism in case of delta(F) = 2.
