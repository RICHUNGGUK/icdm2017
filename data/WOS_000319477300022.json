However, the data produced by these techniques have high levels of spurious and missing interactions. This study assigns a new reliably indication for each protein pairs via the new generative network model (RIGNM) where the scale-free property of the PPI network is considered to reliably identify both spurious and missing interactions in the observed high-throughput PPI network. The experimental results show that the RIGNM is more effective and interpretable than the compared methods, which demonstrate that this approach has the potential to better describe the PPI networks and drive new discoveries.", "paper_title": "Identifying Spurious Interactions and Predicting Missing Interactions in the Protein-Protein Interaction Networks via a Generative Network Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000319477300022"}
