The presented algorithm adopts the K-means algorithm to execute the clustering analyses for all customers, generates a frog population according to the result of the clustering analyses, and then proceeds to the three-phase process. In the first phase, a cluster MSFLA local search is carried out for each cluster. In the second phase, the algorithm selects good individuals through a binary tournament to construct a new population and then performs a global optimization for all customers and depots using the global MSFLA. In the third phase, a cluster adjustment is implemented for the population to generate new clusters. These procedures continue until the convergence criterion is satisfied. The experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve a high quality solution within a short runtime for the MDVRP, the MDVRP with time windows (MDVRPTW) and the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). The proposed algorithm is suitable for solving large-scale problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
