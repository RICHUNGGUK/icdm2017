The model is particularly amenable to describe delays of exposed persons to become infectious and re-infection of exposed persons. Other transitions that depend on state time include the case finding and diagnosis, increased death rate and treatment interruption. The mathematical model comprises of a set of partial differential and ordinary differential equations. Non-steady state solutions are first presented, followed by a bifurcation study of the stationary states. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
