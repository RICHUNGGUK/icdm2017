We focus on two kinds of access control models: discretionary models, based on access control lists (ACLs), and role-based access control (RBAC) models. For RBAC models, we show that we can specify several variants, including models with role hierarchies, and constraints and support for security administrator review querying.", "paper_title": "Term rewriting for access control", "paper_id": "WOS:000239572200013"}
