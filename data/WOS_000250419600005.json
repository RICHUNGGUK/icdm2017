Three interesting aspects of the whole project are described in some detail due to their intrinsic interest for the development of this kind of system. These aspects are: (1) the design of the data model and the system architecture, which is oriented to support some advanced features such as multiscale active maps; (2) the problem of designing appropriate workflows to populate the database; and (3) the design of a Web-based application to exploit the geographic database through a user-friendly interface.
