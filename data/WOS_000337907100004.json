This information supports various intelligent behaviors of a service robot in day-to-day scenarios. This paper presents a novel probability-based approach to building a location aware system. With this approach, the inconsistencies often seen in received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements are handled with a minimum of calibration. By taking off-line calibration measurement of a ZigBee sensor network, the inherent problem of signal uncertainty of to-be-localized nodes can be effectively resolved. The proposed RSSI-based algorithm allows flexible deployment of sensor nodes in various environments. The proposed algorithm has been verified in several typical environments and experiments show that the method outperforms existing algorithms. The location aware system has been integrated with an autonomous mobile robot to demonstrate the proposed on-demand robotic intruder detection system. In the experiments, three alarm sensors were employed to monitor abnormal conditions. If an intrusion was detected, the robot immediately moves to the location and transmits scene images to the user, allowing the user to respond to the situation in real time.", "paper_title": "Probability-Based Location Aware Design and On-Demand Robotic Intrusion Detection System", "paper_id": "WOS:000337907100004"}
