To analyze the vertical effect of predicates on each other and on program termination status, the predicates are fitted into a logistic lasso model. To support scalability, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to cluster the predicates according to their presence in different executions. Considering each cluster as a pseudo-predicate, a distinct lasso model is built for intermediate levels of the hierarchy. Then, we apply a majority voting technique to score the predicates according to their lasso coefficients at different levels of the hierarchy. The predicates with relatively higher scores are ranked as fault relevant predicates. To provide the context of failure, faulty sub-paths are identified as sequences of fault relevant predicates. The grouping effect of Hierarchy-Debug helps programmers to detect multiple bugs. Four case studies have been designed to evaluate the proposed approach on three well-known test suites, Space, Siemens, and Bash. The evaluations show that Hierarchy-Debug produces more precise results compared with prior fault localization techniques on the subject programs.", "paper_title": "Hierarchy-Debug: a scalable statistical technique for fault localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000338530800003"}
