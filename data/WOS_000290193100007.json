With rapid advances in Internet and computing technologies, electronic auctions have become very popular. People sell and buy a wide range of goods and services online. There is a growing need for the proper management of online auctions and for providing support to parties involved.

We demonstrate the algorithm on a number of problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
