Let G be a simple graph of order n and mu(1), mu(2),..., mu(n) be the roots of its matching polynomial. The matching energy of G is defined to be the sum of the absolute values of mu(i) (i = 1, 2,..., n). Gutman and Cvetkovic determined the tricyclic graphs on n vertices with maximal number of matchings by a computer search for small values of n and by an induction argument for the rest. Based on this result, in this paper, we characterize the graphs with the maximal value of matching energy among all tricyclic graphs, and completely determine the tricyclic graphs with the maximal matching energy. We prove our result by using Coulson-type integral formula of matching energy, which is similar as the method to comparing the energies of two quasi-order incomparable graphs.", "paper_title": "Maximal Matching Energy of Tricyclic Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000350704500009"}
