With take-off in the experiences from this concept we have developed methodologies to integrate productive engineering and engineering education. We all know that the best way to learn and understand a theory is trying to see whether you can apply the theory. Engineering is problem solving - by applying results from engineering research. Therefore it is obvious to try to combine the fundamental learning process and engineering problem solving. Recently we have developed a methodology for continuing education integrated into the daily tasks called Facilitated Work Based Learning (FWBL) - mainly based on the same way of thinking. POPBL and FWBL as well as the link between these to methodologies will be presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "From on-campus project organised problem based learning to facilitated work based learning in industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000241754200003"}
