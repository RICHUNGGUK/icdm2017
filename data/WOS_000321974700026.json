As is known, the wireless network authentication protocol can decide security for whole operating scheme and help protect rights of legal users, while there are still some flaws that prevent entire architecture from working favorably. Considering such flaws including computation overload as well as the key management burden, we propose a brand new authentication protocol to ensure secure message transmission and reduce computation overload. The proposed mechanism can be used both in the intra-domain and inter-domain, catering to the aim of decreasing management burden for the key distribution center and expediting the validation process efficiently. Furthermore, we provide the formal security analysis of BAN logic to demonstrate the applicability of the protocol.", "paper_title": "A wide-adapted bantam protocol for roaming across wireless areas", "paper_id": "WOS:000321974700026"}
