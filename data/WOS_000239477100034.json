In order to improve the effectiveness of tutorial systems in teaching higher-level skills, we present a fault-tolerant formula interpreter that aims at finding plausibly intended, formally correct specifications from student statements containing formal inaccuracies. The interpretation consists of local changes based on categorization of errors, a fault-tolerant structure building, and testing contextually-motivated alternations. The error interpretation component is intended to enhance the analysis component of a tutorial system that teaches mathematical proving skills.", "paper_title": "Handling errors in mathematical formulas", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100034"}
