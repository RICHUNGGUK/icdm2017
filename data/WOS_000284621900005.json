After an overview of the different in silico molecular design current technologies, the QSAR analysis is dealt in detail with particular emphasis in the use of topological indices as molecular descriptors. The results of the application of MT in drug design and discovery are described and finally a possible explanation is given about some of the key reasons explaining its the extraordinary performance.", "paper_title": "On the Contribution of Molecular Topology to Drug Design and Discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000284621900005"}
