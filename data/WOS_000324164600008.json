Since the geometrical accuracy is often important for industrial applications, more precise methods for processing CT volumes are required. This paper proposes a method for extracting the multi-material interfaces on CT volumes obtained by industrial CT scanners. Instead of extracting isosurfaces we detect edge-points, at which the norm of the volume gradient takes a local maximum in the gradient direction, and then interpolate the points as the material interfaces represented by the zero-level of compounded implicit functions. In order to achieve a robust material-identification, multilabel graph-cut is utilized in our method. Using edge-points, we can reduce the inaccuracy caused by CT scanning artifacts.", "paper_title": "Edge detection based multi-material interface extraction on industrial CT volumes", "paper_id": "WOS:000324164600008"}
