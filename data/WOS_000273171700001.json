Let FF(v) (respectively, FF(e)) be the set of faulty nodes (respectively, faulty links) in an n-dimensional folded hypercube FQ(n). Fu has showed that FQ(n) - FF(v) - FF(e) for n >= 3 contains a fault-free cycle of length at least 2(n) - 2 vertical bar FF(v)vertical bar if vertical bar FF(v)vertical bar + vertical bar FF(e)vertical bar <= 2n - 4 and vertical bar FFe vertical bar <= n - 1. In this paper, we further consider the constraints vertical bar FF(v)vertical bar + vertical bar FF(e)vertical bar <= 2n - 4 and vertical bar FF(e)vertical bar >= n that were not covered by Fu's result. We obtain the same lower bound of the longest fault-free cycle length, 2(n) - 2 vertical bar FF(v)vertical bar, under the constraints that (1) vertical bar FF(v)vertical bar + vertical bar FFe vertical bar <= 2n - 4 and (2) every node in F Q(n) is incident to at least two fault-free links.
