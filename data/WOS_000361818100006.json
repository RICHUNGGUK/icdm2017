It has previously been shown that exactly half of Adams-Bashforth (AB), Adams-Moulton (AM), and staggered Adams-Bashforth methods have nonzero stability ordinates. In this paper, we consider two categories of Adams predictor-corrector methods and prove that they follow a similar pattern. In particular, if is the order of the method, AB-AM methods have nonzero stability ordinate only for , and AB(1)-AM methods have nonzero stability ordinates only for p = 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, ... , and AB(p-1)-AMp methods have nonzero stability ordinates only for p = 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, ... .", "paper_title": "Stability ordinates of Adams predictor-corrector methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000361818100006"}
