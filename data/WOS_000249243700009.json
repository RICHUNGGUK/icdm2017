Blockrelated authenticating information makes the feature codes tolerant in compression processes. Besides, a block-classification method is used for classifying blocks into flat, vertical-detailed or horizontal-detailed types. With that, a useful coefficient-scan strategy is chosen for preserving and recovering block information. As the experimental results, the watermarked image can provide a PSNR higher than 40.00dB and can mark and recover the blocks which could be maliciously tampered with.", "paper_title": "A novel multipurpose image watermarking scheme based on block-relation", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243700009"}
