In general, e-Government services can be seen as innovations for citizens to adopt. This study uses the tax e-filing system (TEFS) in Taiwan as an example and investigates the determinants of citizens' adoption of such an innovative e-Government service. Three diffusion models - the external, internal, and mixed influence models - are employed to reveal whether the diffusion of the TEFS in Taiwan is affected by government promotion efforts, interactions among acquaintances, or a combination of both. Findings indicate that the influence of acquaintances is the major predictor of Taiwan's TEFS diffusion and the mixed influence model is the best fit. \"Source-Strategy Fit\" implications are proposed based on this study's findings.", "paper_title": "Does government effort or citizen word-of-mouth determine e-Government service diffusion?", "paper_id": "WOS:000278664600001"}
