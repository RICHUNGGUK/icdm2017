Abrupt motions cause conventional tracking methods to fail because they violate the motion smoothness constraint. To address this problem, we introduce the Wang-Landau sampling method and integrate it into a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based tracking framework. By employing the novel density-of-states term estimated by the Wang-Landau sampling method into the acceptance ratio of MCMC, our WLMC-based tracking method alleviates the motion smoothness constraint and robustly tracks the abrupt motions. Meanwhile, the marginal likelihood term of the acceptance ratio preserves the accuracy in tracking smooth motions. The method is then extended to obtain good performance in terms of scalability, even on a high-dimensional state space. Hence, it covers drastic changes in not only position but also scale of a target. To achieve this, we modify our method by combining it with the N-fold way algorithm and present the N-Fold Wang-Landau (NFWL)-based tracking method. The N-fold way algorithm helps estimate the density-of-states with a smaller number of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach efficiently samples the states of the target, even in a whole state space, without loss of time, and tracks the target accurately and robustly when position and scale are changing severely.", "paper_title": "Wang-Landau Monte Carlo-Based Tracking Methods for Abrupt Motions", "paper_id": "WOS:000314931000018"}
