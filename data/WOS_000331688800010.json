This paper presents a comprehensive review of over 40 years of hierarchical facility location modeling efforts. Published models are classified based on multiple characteristics including the type of flow pattern, service availability, spatial configuration, objective function, coverage, network levels, time element, parameters, facilities, capacity, and real world application. A second classification is also presented on the basis of solution methods adopted to solve various hierarchical facility location problems. The paper finally identifies the gaps in the current literature and suggests directions for future modeling efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
