The loci of solutions of the Frisch scheme and their properties axe first described in the algebraic case. In this context two main problems are analyzed: the evaluation of the maximal number of linear relations compatible with data affected by errors and the determination of the linear relation actually linking the noiseless data. Subsequently the extension of the Frisch scheme to the identification of dynamical systems is considered for both SISO and MIMO cases and the problem of its application to real processes is investigated. For this purpose suitable identification criteria and model parametrizations are described. Finally two classical identification problems are mapped into the Frisch scheme, the blind identification of FIR. channels and the identification of AR + noise models. This allows some theoretical and practical extensions.", "paper_title": "THE FRISCH SCHEME IN ALGEBRAIC AND DYNAMIC IDENTIFICATION PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261942400001"}
