It is based on the ELECTRE-like sorting analysis restricted by the localization principle, which enables high adaptability of the decision model and reduces the cognitive load imposed on the decision-makers. It lays the foundation for the introduction of three concepts that have been previously insufficiently supported by outranking methods - semiautomatic derivation of criteria weights according to the selective effects of discordance and veto thresholds, convergent group consensus seeking, and autonomous multi-agent negotiation. The interdependent principles are justified, and the methodological solutions underlying their implementation are provided.", "paper_title": "Interactive aggregation/disaggregation dichotomic sorting procedure for group decision analysis based on the threshold model", "paper_id": "WOS:000256592200001"}
