Research suggests that security countermeasures can deter misuse by increasing the perceived certainty and severity of punishment for such behavior. However, the value of generalizing this work beyond Western cultures is open to question. In our study, we examined whether national culture influenced the deterrent capabilities of security policies, security education, training, and awareness programs and computer monitoring. Using U.S. and Korean samples, we found evidence that the deterrent effect of certain security countermeasures varied between the two countries, as did the influence of age and gender. The results have implications for information security management practices in global businesses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
