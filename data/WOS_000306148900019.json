In this paper an attempt is made to show how nonlinear control-oriented model may be used to improve the performance of closed-loop control of blood glucose in diabetic patients. The nonlinear Wiener model is used as a novel modeling approach to be applied to the glucose control problem. The identified Wiener model is used in the design of a robust nonlinear sliding mode control strategy. Two configurations of the nonlinear controller are tested and compared to a controller designed with a linear model. The controllers are designed in a Smith predictor structure to reduce the effect of system time delay. To improve the meal compensation features, the controllers are provided with a simple feedforward controller to inject an insulin bolus at meal time. Different simulation scenarios have been used to evaluate the proposed controllers. The obtained results show that the new approach out-performs the linear control scheme, and regulates the glucose level within safe limits in the presence of measurement and modeling errors, meal uncertainty and patient variations.
