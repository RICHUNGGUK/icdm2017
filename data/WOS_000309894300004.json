And the basic issue of sink mobility is deciding when and where to move the sink during network operation. In this paper, we have proposed a novel energy efficient strategy for single mobile sink in event-driven sensor networks in which events occur infrequently, but continue for some time once they occur, such as fire, etc. The strategy is a heuristic geometric centre approach, and designed to respond properly to stochastic events that have uncertainty in their positions, area sizes, occurrence times and durations. As a result, energy consumption is reduced and network lifetime is improved. In the strategy, a quasi-optimal position for the sink is obtained considering distances from the sink to the sensors which are in event areas when one/more event(s) arises or terminates. And then the sink moves to the position. We compare our strategy with traditional strategies for single mobile sink by simulations. The results show that our proposed strategy improves network lifetime as well as other performances notably.", "paper_title": "An Energy Efficient Strategy for Single Mobile Sink in Event-driven Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000309894300004"}
