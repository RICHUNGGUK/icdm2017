However, the selection to neighbor parameters of graph is intractable. In this paper, we present a novel DR method called adaptive graph embedding discriminant projections (AGEDP). Compared with most existing DR methods based on graph embedding, such as marginal Fisher analysis which usually predefines the intraclass and interclass neighbor parameters, AGEDP applies all the homogeneous samples for constructing the intrinsic graph, and simultaneously selects heterogeneous samples within the neighborhood generated by the farthest homogeneous sample for constructing the penalty graph. Therefore, AGEDP not only greatly enhances the intraclass compactness and interclass separability, but also adaptively performs neighbor parameter selection which considers the fact that local manifold structure of each sample is generally different. Experiments on AR and COIL-20 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for face recognition and object categorization, and especially under the interference of occlusion, noise and poses, it is superior to other graph embedding based methods with three different classifiers: nearest neighbor classifier, sparse representation classifier and linear regression classifier.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Graph Embedding Discriminant Projections", "paper_id": "WOS:000344609300001"}
