The paper presents a new contention resolution scheme, named as adaptive parameter-based deflection routing, which can control the deflection according to the time-varying traffic load and the QoS requirements. Compared with other schemes, the simulation results show that it can improve the overall BLP and the individual BLP of each class burst, and alleviate the offset-time deficit on QoS guarantee.", "paper_title": "An adaptive parameter deflection routing to resolve contentions in OBS networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800089"}
