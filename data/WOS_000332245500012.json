The proposed ATSRFNN control system is composed of a recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) controller and an adaptive terminal sliding (ATS) controller. The RFNN controller is designed to mimic an ideal controller, and the ATS controller is designed to cope with the approximation error and external disturbance. The simulation results show the proposed ATSRFNN control system can achieve better control performance and robustness in comparison with a hierarchical fuzzy sliding-mode control system.", "paper_title": "Double inverted pendulum decoupling control by adaptive terminal sliding-mode recurrent fuzzy neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000332245500012"}
