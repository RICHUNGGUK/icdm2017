In general, it is intractable in dynamic domains that include many objects and relationships. Still, potential applications for such domains (e.g., semantic web, autonomous agents, and partial-knowledge games) encourage research beyond intractability results. In this paper we present polynomial-time algorithms for filtering belief states that are encoded as First-Order Logic (FOL) formulas. Our algorithms are exact in many cases of interest. They accept belief states in FOL without functions, permitting arbitrary arity for predicates, infinite universes of elements, and equality. They enable natural representation with explicit references to unidentified objects and partially known relationships, still maintaining tractable computation. Previous results focus on more general cases that are intractable or permit only imprecise filtering. Our algorithms guarantee that belief-state representation remains compact for STRIPS actions (among others) with unbounded-size domains. This guarantees tractable exact filtering indefinitely for those domains. The rest of our results apply to expressive modeling languages, such as partial databases and belief revision in FOL.
