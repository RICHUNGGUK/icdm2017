For the eigenvalue analysis of thin plate vibration, conventional radial basis collocation method (RBCM) leads to an over-determined system for the eigenproblems, while Hermite radial basis collocation method (HRBCM) introducing more degrees of freedom can result in a determined system. Convergence and comparison studies with analytical solutions demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. Effects on the natural frequencies and mode shapes originated from the material inhomogeneity are numerically investigated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
