We study the variant where customers may be only partially served (incomplete service) and, if beneficial, also by more than one vehicle (split deliveries). We will analyze the maximum theoretical increase of the profit due to the incomplete service and to the split deliveries. We also computationally measure such increase on a set of instances, by means of an exact algorithm on small/medium size instances and of two heuristics on instances of larger size.
