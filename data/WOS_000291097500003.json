The numerical model has been validated with experimental results of a former study, which is resembled in a particular case. Numerical simulation shows that the vorticity enhancement would increase both Nusselt number and pressure drop. Proposed trend is not constant and the pattern in which parameters change is dependent on Reynolds number. Finally, a conjugated optimization of pressure drop and the Nusselt number has been suggested based on the order of parameter changes.
