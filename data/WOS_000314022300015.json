New platforms with increasingly more features for managing big datasets are being announced almost on a weekly basis. Yet, there is currently a lack of any means of comparability among such platforms. While the performance of traditional database systems is well understood and measured by long-established institutions such as the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TCP), there is neither a clear definition of the performance of big data systems nor a generally agreed upon metric for comparing these systems. In this article, we describe a community-based effort for defining a big data benchmark. Over the past year, a Big Data Benchmarking Community has become established in order to fill this void. The effort focuses on defining an end-to-end application-layer benchmark for measuring the performance of big data applications, with the ability to easily adapt the benchmark specification to evolving challenges in the big data space. This article describes the efforts that have been undertaken thus far toward the definition of a BigData Top100 List. While highlighting the major technical as well as organizational challenges, through this article, we also solicit community input into this process.\t[Baru, Chaitanya] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego Supercomp Ctr, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bhandarkar, Milind] EMC, Greenplum, San Mateo, CA USA; [Nambiar, Raghunath] Cisco Syst Inc, San Jose, CA USA; [Poess, Meikel] Oracle Corp, Redwood City, CA USA; [Rabl, Tilmann] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada\tBaru, C (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego Supercomp Ctr, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.\tbaru@sdsc.edu\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t9\t11\t8\t10\tMARY ANN LIEBERT, INC\tNEW ROCHELLE\t140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA\t2167-6461\t2167-647X\t\tBIG DATA\tBig Data\tMAR\t2013\t1\t1\t\t\t\t\t60\t64\t\t10.1089/big.2013.1509\t\t5\tComputer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods\tComputer Science\tV42XH\tWOS:000209646000012\t27447039\t\nJ\tButler, S; Demaine, E; Graham, R; Tachi, T\t\t\t\tButler, Steve; Demaine, Erik; Graham, Ron; Tachi, Tomohiro\t\t\tCONSTRUCTING POINTS THROUGH FOLDING AND INTERSECTION\tINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY & APPLICATIONS\t\t\tEnglish\tArticle\t\t\t\t\t\tOrigami; efficient construction; invariant subsets\t\tFix an n >= 3.

Starting with the line y = 0 and the points (0, 0) and (1, 0) we determine which points in the plane can be constructed using only these two operations for n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and also consider the problem of the minimum number of steps it takes to construct such a point.\t[Butler, Steve] Iowa State Univ, Dept Math, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Demaine, Erik] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Graham, Ron] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Tachi, Tomohiro] Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Tokyo 1138654, Japan\tButler, S (reprint author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Math, Ames, IA 50011 USA.\tbutler@iastate.edu; edemaine@mit.edu; graham@ucsd.edu; tachi@idea.c.u-tokyo.ac.jo\t\t\t\t\t\t9\t0\t0\t0\t0\tWORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD\tSINGAPORE\t5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE\t0218-1959\t\t\tINT J COMPUT GEOM AP\tInt.

It is designed to process large datasets, and has been evaluated against as much as 100TB of input data spread across 832 disks in 52 nodes at a rate of 0.938TB/min. When evaluated against the annual Indy GraySort sorting benchmark, TritonSort is 66% better in absolute performance and has over six times the per-node throughput of the previous record holder. When evaluated against the 100TB Indy JouleSort benchmark, TritonSort sorted 9703 records/Joule. In this article, we describe the hardware and software architecture necessary to operate TritonSort at this level of efficiency. Through careful management of system resources to ensure cross-resource balance, we are able to sort data at approximately 80% of the disks' aggregate sequential write speed. We believe the work holds a number of lessons for balanced system design and for scale-out architectures in general. While many interesting systems are able to scale linearly with additional servers, per-server performance can lag behind per-server capacity by more than an order of magnitude. Bridging the gap between high scalability and high performance would enable either significantly less expensive systems that are able to do the same work or provide the ability to address significantly larger problem sets with the same infrastructure.\t[Rasmussen, Alexander; Porter, George; Conley, Michael; Mysore, Radhika Niranjan; Vahdat, Amin] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Madhyastha, Harsha V.] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Pucher, Alexander] Vienna Univ Technol, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Vahdat, Amin] Google Inc, Washington, DC USA\tPorter, G (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.\tgmporter@cs.ucsd.edu\t\t\tNational Science Foundation, under MRI [CNS-0923523, CSR-1116079]; Cisco Systems\tThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation, under MRI no.

Our method is based on two new concepts: virtual flash images and homogeneous pixels. Inspired by recent developments in flash photography, virtual flash images emulate photographs taken with a flash, to capture various features of rendered images without taking additional samples. Using a virtual flash image as an edge-stopping function, our method can preserve image features that were not captured well only by existing edge-stopping functions such as normals and depth values. While denoising each pixel, we consider only homogeneous pixelspixels that are statistically equivalent to each other. This makes it possible to define a stochastic error bound of our method, and this bound goes to zero as the number of ray samples goes to infinity, irrespective of denoising parameters. To highlight the benefits of our method, we apply our method to two Monte Carlo ray tracing methods, photon mapping and path tracing, with various input scenes. We demonstrate that using virtual flash images and homogeneous pixels with a standard denoising method outperforms state-of-the-art image-space denoising methods.\t[Moon, Bochang; Jun, Jong Yun; Lee, JongHyeob; Kim, Kunho; Yoon, Sung-Eui] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Seoul, South Korea; [Hachisuka, Toshiya] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA USA; [Hachisuka, Toshiya] Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark\tMoon, B (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Seoul, South Korea.\tmoonbochang@gmail.com; jjy0224@gmail.com; jhrichard@gmail.com; glen.khkim@gmail.com; toshiya@cs.au.dk; sungeui@gmail.com\tYoon, Sung-eui/C-1678-2011\t\tMCST/KOCCA/CT/RD; MKE/KEIT [KI001810035261]; MKE/MCST/IITA [2008-F-033-02]; BK; DAPA/ADD [UD110006MD]; MEST/NRF/WCU [R31-2010-000-30007-0]; KMCC; MSRA; MEST/NRF [2012-0009228]\tWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedbacks.

However, the simultaneous analysis of several mutant structures or frames of a molecular dynamics simulation may provide more realistic detail about the behavior of the sites.

An on-chip distributed model is proposed for 3-D power grids, in which the details of metal layers are considered. The distributed model is demonstrated to be essential to identifying the unique noise behavior of 3-D PDNs. A lumped model is proposed based on the distributed model. The lumped model features the connection impedance between tiers and is proven to be useful for designers to understand the global effects of 3-D PDNs. Based on the models, an analysis flow is designed for 3-D PDNs in both frequency domain and time domain. With the analysis flow, the electrical characteristics of 3-D PDNs are studied systematically for the first time. The frequency-domain analysis identifies the global and local resonance phenomena in 3-D PDNs that are distinct from those in 2-D PDNs. The physical mechanisms behind the resonance phenomena are investigated. The time-domain analysis predicts the worst-case supply noise based on distributed current constraints. The Rogue Wave\" concept is introduced to explain the spatial and temporal relations of the worst-case on-chip noise responses in 3-D PDNs.", "paper_title": "BENCHMARKING BIG DATA SYSTEMS AND THE BIGDATA TOP100 LIST", "paper_id": "WOS:000314022300015"}
