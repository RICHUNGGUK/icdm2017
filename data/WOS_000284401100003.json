This interoperability is not straightforward because of the high heterogeneity in Semantic Web technologies and, while the number of such technologies grows, affordable mechanisms for evaluating Semantic Web technology interoperability are needed to comprehend the current and future interoperability of Semantic Web technologies. This paper presents the OWL Interoperability Benchmarking, an international benchmarking activity that involved the evaluation of the interoperability of different Semantic Web technologies using OWL as the interchange language. It describes the evaluation resources used in this benchmarking activity, the OWL Lite Import Benchmark Suite and the IBSE tool, and presents how to use them for evaluating the OWL interoperability of Semantic Web technologies. Moreover, the paper offers an overview of the OWL interoperability results of the eight tools participating in the benchmarking: one ontology-based annotation tool (GATE), three ontology frameworks (Jena, KAON2, and SWI-Prolog), and four ontology development tools (Protege Frames, Protege OWL, SemTalk, and WebODE).
