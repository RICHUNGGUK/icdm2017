PSO is employed to optimize the weight values of the networks. Moreover, to improve the training efficiency principal component analysis (PCA) is used, as a reduction technique. The proposed PSO-based MLFF (PSOBMLFF) neural network develops an inverse mapping from compacted and reduced spectrum coefficients into metamorphosed accelerogram wavelet packet coefficients. In this research, to produce compatible synthetic long-period near-field ground motions with median predicted spectra, the attenuation of peak ground velocity (PGV) with the close horizontal distance (R), moment magnitude (M), and time-average shear-wave velocity from the surface to 30 m (Vs30) has been developed using nonlinear regression analysis.", "paper_title": "Generation of Near-Field Artificial Ground Motions Compatible with Median-Predicted Spectra Using PSO-Based Neural Network and Wavelet Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000308393800007"}
