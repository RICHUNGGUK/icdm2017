Three evaluation criteria are suggested for cost-sensitive filters, and their rationality is discussed. Furthermore, a principle that minimizes the error cost is described to avoid filtering an e-mail of \"Legitimate\" into \"Spam\". Comparing with other major methods, the experimental results show that our method of combining multiple filters has preferable performance when appropriate running parameters are adopted.", "paper_title": "Combining multiple email filters based on multivariate statistical analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800081"}
