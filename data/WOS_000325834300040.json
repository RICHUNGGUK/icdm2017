The capabilities of the Taylor Least Square method for calculation of spatial derivatives are evaluated by using different turbulence models. Results show that good agreement with analytical solution can be obtained when regular point distribution is used. However, numerical experiments show that using irregular point clouds within the domain may lead to inaccurate results. So an alternative approach is developed and its accuracy is investigated by solving various laminar and turbulent flows at transonic flow conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
