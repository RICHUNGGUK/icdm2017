In 2005, Tian et al., however, showed that a security manager will learn the long-term private key of a sensor after having one normal run of the protocol with the sensor. Then they proposed an improvement which solves the problem. The current paper, however, demonstrates neither protocol provides perfect forward secrecy, and presents an improved protocol in order to address this problem. Not only is the computational cost of the proposed AKE protocol less than that of both protocols, the number of steps in communication is one fewer than conventional protocols and only needs three steps.", "paper_title": "An optimizing authenticated key exchange protocol for self-organizing sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624100041"}
