The main focus has been towards achieving better performance. It is true that this goal has been attained to a certain extent, but on the other hand, it has been at the expense of increased energy consumption and consequent economic and environmental costs. As these clusters are becoming more popular and complex, reducing energy consumption in such systems has become a necessity. Several power-aware scheduling policies have been proposed for homogeneous clusters. In this work, we propose a new policy for heterogeneous clusters. Our simulation experiments show that using our proposed policy results in significant reduction in energy consumption while performing very competitively in heterogeneous clusters.
