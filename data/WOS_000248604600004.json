First, a fuzzy logic system is introduced to approximate the unknown robotic dynamics by using adaptive algorithm. Next, the effect of system uncertainties and external disturbance is removed by employing an integral sliding mode control algorithm. Consequently, a hybrid fuzzy adaptive robust controller is developed such that the resulting closed-loop robot system is stable and the trajectory tracking performance is guaranteed. The proposed controller is appropriate for the robust tracking of robotic systems with system uncertainties. The validity of the control scheme is shown by computer simulation of a two-link robotic manipulator. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
