However, most of these methods lack sufficient physical backgrounds which can cause major problems for bipeds when performing fast locomotion such as running and jumping. In order to develop a more accurate gait generation method, a thorough study of human running and jumping seems to be necessary. Most biomechanics researchers observed that human dynamics, during fast locomotion, can be modeled by a simple spring loaded inverted pendulum system. Considering this observation, a simple approach for bipedal gait generation in fast locomotion is introduced in this paper. This approach applies a nonlinear control method to synchronize the biped link-segmental dynamics with the spring-mass dynamics. This is done such that while the biped center of mass follows the trajectory of the mass-spring model, the whole biped performs the desired running/jumping process. A computer simulation is done on a three-link under-actuated biped model in order to obtain the robot joints' profiles which ensure repeatable hopping. The initial results are found to be satisfactory, and improvements are currently underway to explore and enhance the capabilities of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A novel method of gait synthesis for bipedal fast locomotion", "paper_id": "WOS:000259273300001"}
