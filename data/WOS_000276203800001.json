This paper aims to explore the complicated finger gaits planning problem and provide a method for robotic hands to autonomously generate feasible finger gaits to accomplish given tasks. Based on the hybrid automaton formulation of a popular finger gaiting primitive, finger substitution, we formulate the finger gait planning problem into a classic motion planning problem with a hybrid configuration space. Inspired by the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) techniques, we develop a finger gait planner to quickly search for a feasible manipulation strategy with finger substitution primitives. To increase the search performance of the planner, we further develop a refined sampling strategy, a novel hybrid distance and an efficient exploring strategy with the consideration of the problem's hybrid nature. Finally, we use a representative numerical example to verify the validity of our problem formulation and the performance of the RRT based finger gait planner.", "paper_title": "Sampling-based finger gaits planning for multifingered robotic hand", "paper_id": "WOS:000276203800001"}
