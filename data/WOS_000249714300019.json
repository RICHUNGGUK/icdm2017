By using estimates of certain exponential sums over rings or fields, the upper bounds of both the well-distribution measure and the order k (at least for small k) correlation measure of the resulting binary sequences are evaluated, and some lower bounds on the linear complexity profile of d-ary cyclotomic sequences and d-ary generalized cyclotomic sequences are presented. Our results indicate that such binary sequences possess \"very good\" local pseudo-randomness. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
