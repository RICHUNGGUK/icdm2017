This yields another interesting result, namely a characterization of the one-shot distillable entanglement of a bipartite pure state. This result is shown to be stronger than that obtained by specializing the one-shot hashing bound to pure states. Finally, we show how the one-shot result yields the operational interpretation of the asymptotic entanglement of assistance proved by Smolin and coworkers.", "paper_title": "General Theory of Environment-Assisted Entanglement Distillation", "paper_id": "WOS:000315120400045"}
