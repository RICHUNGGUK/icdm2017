In this paper, a key-node finite element method is proposed. First, the concept of key-node is introduced over the element level, and then the governing equations are theoretically derived and corresponding boundary conditions for shape functions of key-node finite element are prescribed. The key-node finite element method is finally established by following the procedure of conventional finite element method to numerically solve the shape functions. Including the information of micro-structures and physical details in shape functions, the key-node finite element is more efficient when preserving a high accuracy, which is validated by typical applications to elastic and elasto-plastic analyses of porous materials. It is straightforward to extend the present method to the three-dimensional case or to solving more challengeable problems such as dynamical responses with high frequencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
