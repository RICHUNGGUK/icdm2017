The visibly pushdown automata are the automata synchronized by an one state transducer whose output labels are -1, 0, 1. For each transducer, we can decide whether a pushdown automaton is synchronized. The pushdown automata synchronized by a given transducer accept languages which form an effective boolean algebra containing the regular languages and included in the deterministic real-time context-free languages.", "paper_title": "Synchronization of pushdown automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454100012"}
