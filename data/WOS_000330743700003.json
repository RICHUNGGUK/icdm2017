In this paper, we show how a more detailed interpretation of the data in the tables that were found by GUHA can be obtained using Bayesian statistical methods. Using a multinomial sampling model and Dirichlet prior, we derive posterior distributions for parameters that correspond to GUHA generalised quantifiers. Examples are presented illustrating the new Bayesian post-processing tools implemented in LISp-Miner. A statistical model for the analysis of contingency tables for data from two subpopulations is also presented.", "paper_title": "Bayesian analysis of GUHA hypotheses", "paper_id": "WOS:000330743700003"}
