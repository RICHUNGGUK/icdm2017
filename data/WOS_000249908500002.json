Classification models are built by using underlying data. In principle, the models built with more data yield better results. However, the relationship between the available data and the performance is not well understood, except that the accuracy of a classification model has diminishing improvements as a function of data size. In this paper, we present an approach for an early assessment of the extracted knowledge (classification models) in the terms of performance (accuracy), based on the amount of data used. The assessment is based on the observation of the performance on smaller sample sizes. The solution is formally defined and used in an experiment. In experiments we show the correctness and utility of the approach.", "paper_title": "Assessment of classification models with small amounts of data", "paper_id": "WOS:000249908500002"}
