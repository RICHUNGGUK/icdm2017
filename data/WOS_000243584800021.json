More specifically, attention is focused on the industrial painting of wood and the problem under investigation is formulated as a bicriteria combinatorial optimization problem. A niched Pareto genetic algorithm based approach is used to determine sets of methods, tools and technologies, applicable both in the design and in the production phase, allowing to simultaneously minimize the total cost and maximize the total pollutant emission reduction.
