We discuss two types of interconnections. One type can be achieved by using the PAN coordinator node as the bridging device and the other type is achieved by using ordinary network nodes as bridge nodes. We discuss design and performance issues of both kinds of interconnections.", "paper_title": "Analysis of cluster interconnection schemes in 802.15.4 beacon enabled networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000257021900007"}
