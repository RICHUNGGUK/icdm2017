The waiting time distribution is shown to have a regularly varying tail with index 1-beta, and the pre-factor is determined explicitly. The result is obtained by comparing the waiting time in the M/G/1 retrial queue with the waiting time in the ordinary M/G/1 queue with random order service policy.", "paper_title": "Regularly varying tail of the waiting time distribution in M/G/1 retrial queue", "paper_id": "WOS:000280578600002"}
