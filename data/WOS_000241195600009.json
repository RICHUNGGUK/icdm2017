In this model, a threshold-based call admission control (CAC) is used to limit the number of admitted calls in a cell and also to prioritize handoff calls over new calls. The transmission rates for data calls can be adjusted to accommodate more voice and/or data calls while satisfying the minimum signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)/ transmission rate requirement. Also, automatic repeat request (ARQ)-based error control is used for improved reliability of data packets. Call-level performance measures for both voice and data calls and packet-level performance measures specifically for data calls can be obtained from the analytical model. The interdependencies among call-level and packet-level QoS metrics are investigated under different CAC, rate adaptation, and error control parameter settings. To this end, the level of users' satisfaction ( or user utility) is formulated as a function of the QoS metrics and an optimization formulation is presented to obtain the local-optimal system parameters.", "paper_title": "Call-level and packet-level quality of service and user utility in rate-adaptive cellular CDMA networks: A queuing analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241195600009"}
