For battery-powered IP phone devices, the life time extension is a key concern for the market acceptance while today's 802.11 is not optimized for such an operation. In this paper, we propose a novel idle mode operation, which comprises paging, idle handoff, and delayed handoff. Under the idle mode operation, a mobile host (MH) without any active session does not need to perform handoff within a predefined paging area (PA). Only when it enters a new PA, an idle handoff is performed. The proposed idle mode allows an MH without traffic to extend its life time. We develop a new analytical model in order to comparatively evaluate our proposed scheme. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes with respect to power consumption.", "paper_title": "Idle Mode for Deep Power Save in IEEE 802.11 WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000284188700010"}
