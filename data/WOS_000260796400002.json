As a corollary to our study we obtain that a real number beta in (1, 2) is univoque and self-Sturmian if and only if the beta-expansion of 1 is of the form 1v, where v is a characteristic Sturmian sequence beginning itself in 1.", "paper_title": "A NOTE ON UNIVOQUE SELF-STURMIAN NUMBERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260796400002"}
