It is proved that the proposed neural network (NN) for solving this class of GVIs can be globally convergent, globally asymptotically stable, and globally exponentially stable under different conditions. The proposed NN can be viewed as a modified version of the general projection NN existing in the literature. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed NN.", "paper_title": "A recurrent neural network for solving a class of general variational inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000246641800003"}
