This article extends work on the PC/BC model of V1 by showing that it can also account for V1 response properties measured using the reverse correlation methodology. Reverse correlation employs an experimental procedure that is significantly different from that used in more typical neurophysiological experiments, and measures some distinctly different response properties in V1. Despite these differences PC/BC successfully accounts for the data. The current results thus provide additional support for the PC/BC model of V1 and further demonstrate that PC/BC offers a unified explanation for the seemingly diverse range of behaviours observed in primary visual cortex.", "paper_title": "Predictive coding accounts for V1 response properties recorded using reverse correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000302644100004"}
