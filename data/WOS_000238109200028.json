As an application, we obtain dramatically improved runtime bounds for two variants of the VERTEX COVER problem: In the case of CONNECTED VERTEX COVER, we take the upper bound from O*(6(k)) to O* (3.2361(k)) without large hidden factors. For TREE COVER, we show exactly the same complexity, improving vastly over the previous bound of O*((2k)(k)). In the process, faster algorithms for solving subclasses of the Steiner tree problem on graphs are investigated.", "paper_title": "Enumerate and expand: Improved algorithms for connected vertex cover and tree cover", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200028"}
