Various optimisation algorithms for solving the problem have been developed; however, due to the non-convex characteristics and large dimensionality of the problem, it is necessary to explore new methods to further improve the dispatch results and minimise the costs. This article proposes a hybrid differential evolution (DE) algorithm, namely clonal selection-based differential evolution (CSDE), to solve the problem. CSDE is an artificial intelligence technique that can be applied to complex optimisation problems which are for example nonlinear, large scale, non-convex and discontinuous. This hybrid algorithm combines the clonal selection algorithm (CSA) as the local search technique to update the best individual in the population, which enhances the diversity of the solutions and prevents premature convergence in DE. Furthermore, we investigate four mutation operations which are used in CSA as the hyper-mutation operations. Finally, an efficient solution repair method is designed for DELD to satisfy the complicated equality and inequality constraints of the power system to guarantee the feasibility of the solutions. Two benchmark power systems are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed CSDE/best/1 approach significantly outperforms nine other variants of CSDE and DE, as well as most other published methods, in terms of the quality of the solution and the convergence characteristics.", "paper_title": "Differential evolution combined with clonal selection for dynamic economic dispatch", "paper_id": "WOS:000354180000001"}
