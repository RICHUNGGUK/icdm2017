Plotkin, A structural approach to operational semantics, Technical Report DAIMI FN-19, Computer Science Department, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark, September 1981]. Subsequently, the format of SOS rules became the object of study. Using so-called Transition System Specifications (TSS's) several authors syntactically restricted the for-mat of rules and showed several useful properties about the semantics induced by any TSS adhering to the format. This has resulted in a line of research proposing several syntactical rule formats and associated meta-theorems. Properties that are guaranteed by such rule formats range from well-definedness of the operational semantics and compositionality of behavioral equivalences to security-, time- and probability-related issues. In this paper, we provide an overview of SOS rule formats and meta-theorems formulated around them. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
