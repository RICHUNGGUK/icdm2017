Primarily, this is because the operator's field of view, reaction speed, attention, and depth perception are limited, and also because the construction site is a dynamic environment. Accelerating advances in sensing and equipment control sophistication present new opportunities to address these safety problems. The research described here provides the basis for the development of obstacle-avoidance systems that use models of objects generated by rapid three-dimensional (3D) workspace modeling methods and by sophisticated equipment control capabilities. An explanation of the proposed obstacle avoidance system, together with preliminary results, is presented. Implementation of this system in practice is feasible in the near term for critical and particularly hazardous operations.", "paper_title": "Human-assisted obstacle avoidance system using 3D workspace modeling for construction equipment operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237014500004"}
