Starting from the governing equation obtained by B. Shraiman and D. Bensimon, we derive intergro-differential evolution equation of interphase dynamics. It is shown that such representation of the conformal mapping technique is convenient for computer simulations of the quasi-stationary Stefan problem. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
