The profitability of exploiting this resource is conditioned by the amount of existing biomass within urban community ecosystems. Prior research pointed out that residual biomass from Platanus hispanica and other tree species can be calculated from dendrometric parameters. In this study, two approaches have been analyzed: First, applicability of TLS was tested for residual biomass calculation from crown volume. In addition, traditional models for residual biomass prediction were developed from dendrometric parameters (tree height, crown diameter, and diameter at breast height). Next, a comparison between parameters obtained with both methodologies (standard methodologies vs TLS) was carried out. The results indicate a strong relationship (R-2 = 0.906) between crown diameters and between total tree heights (R-2 = 0.868). The crown volumes extracted from the TLS point cloud were calculated by 4 different methods: convex hull; convex hull by slices of 5 cm height in the XY plane; triangulation by XY flat sections, and voxel modeling. The highest accuracy was found when the voxel method was used for pruned biomass prediction (R-2 = 0.731). The results revealed the potential of TLS data to determine dendrometric parameters and biomass yielded from pruning guitar of urban forests. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
