To avoid additional data redundancy created by the demosaicking process, an alternative processing chain has been proposed to move the compression process before the demosaicking. Recent empirical studies have shown that the alternative chain can outperform the conventional one in terms of image quality at low compression ratios. To provide a theoretically sound basis for such conclusion, we propose analytical models for the reconstruction errors of the two processing chains. The models developed confirm the results of existing empirical studies and provide better understanding of DSC processing chains. The modeling also allows performance predictions for more advanced compression and demosaicking methods, thus providing important cues for future development in this area.", "paper_title": "Reversing demosaicking and compression in color filter array image processing: Performance analysis and modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000241391100003"}
