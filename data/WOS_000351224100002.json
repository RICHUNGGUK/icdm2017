In tropical algebra, a vector x is a solution to a polynomial , where the g (i) (x)s are tropical monomials, if the minimum in min (i) (g (i) (x)) is attained at least twice. In min-plus algebra solutions of systems of equations of the form are studied. In this paper, we consider computational problems related to tropical linear system. We show that the solvability problem (both over and ) and the problem of deciding the equivalence of two linear systems (both over and ) are equivalent under polynomial-time reductions to mean payoff games and are also equivalent to analogous problems in min-plus algebra. In particular, all these problems belong to . Thus, we provide a tight connection of computational aspects of tropical linear algebra with mean payoff games and min-plus linear algebra. On the other hand, we show that computing the dimension of the solution space of a tropical linear system and of a min-plus linear system is -complete.", "paper_title": "Complexity of Tropical and Min-plus Linear Prevarieties", "paper_id": "WOS:000351224100002"}
