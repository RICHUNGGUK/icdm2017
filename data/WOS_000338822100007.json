The central idea is that different users may find different services relevant due to different preferences and contexts. In this paper, we present a preference model that combines user preferences, user context, domain knowledge to enrich the initial user query. We use CP-nets to rank the preferences using implicit and explicit user preferences and domain knowledge. We present some algorithms for preferential matching. We have implemented the proposed model as a prototype. The initial results look promising. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
