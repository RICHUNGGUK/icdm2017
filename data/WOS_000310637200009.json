This paper explores a solution to handle such complex decision making based on a combined logic system. We provide an explanation of our reasoning system focused on the algorithms and their implementations. The reasoning system is based on a multi-valued temporal propositional logic which we use as the foundation for the implementation of simulation/prediction and query answering tools. This system is available for users to represent knowledge and to refine these systems to debug them and to try different problem solving strategies. We provide examples to illustrate how the system can be used including a problem based on a real smart environment.", "paper_title": "A SYSTEM TO REASON ABOUT UNCERTAIN AND DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310637200009"}
