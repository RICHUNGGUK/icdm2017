The circuit architecture is generic and it features high image rejection for wideband signals and good linearity. An SC implementation in 0.13 mu m CMOS suitable for an RF of 2.4 GHz and 20 MHz signal bandwidth is presented as a demonstrator. Simulation results obtained using Cadence Spectre simulation tools are included.", "paper_title": "SC filter for RF sampling and downconversion with wideband image rejection", "paper_id": "WOS:000242343500004"}
