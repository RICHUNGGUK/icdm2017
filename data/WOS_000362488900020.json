We propose to state the DFF problem as a variational problem, including a smooth but nonconvex data fidelity term and a convex nonsmooth regularization, which makes the method robust to noise and leads to more realistic depth maps. In addition, we propose to solve the nonconvex minimization problem with a linearized alternating directions method of multipliers, allowing to minimize the energy very efficiently. A numerical comparison to classical methods on simulated as well as on real data is presented.", "paper_title": "Variational Depth From Focus Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000362488900020"}
