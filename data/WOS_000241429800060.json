The autocorrelation domain is an appropriate domain for speech feature extraction due to its pole preserving and noise separation features. Therefore, we have investigated this domain for robust speech recognition. In our proposed algorithm we have tried to suppress the effect of noise before using this domain for feature extraction. This suppression is carried out by noise autocorrelation sequence estimation from the first few frames in each utterance and subtracting it from the autocorrelation sequence of noisy signal. We tested our method on the Aurora 2 noisy isolated-word task and found its performance superior to that of other autocorrelation-based methods applied to this task.
