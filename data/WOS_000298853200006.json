They are distinguished from association rules (frequent itemsets) because (1) they can be generated by the infrequent itemsets that are pruned in association rule mining, and (2) they are measured by their importance including the distance between two conceptual clusters, whereas frequent itemsets are measured only by their support. In this paper, we first design two algorithms for mining bridging rules between clusters, and then propose two non-linear metrics to measure their interestingness. We evaluate these algorithms experimentally and demonstrate that our approach is promising.", "paper_title": "Mining bridging rules between conceptual clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000298853200006"}
