In this work, we propose an algorithm which compresses the electron repulsion tensor into the tensor hypercontraction format with O (nN(2) logN) computational cost, where N is the number of orbital functions and n is the number of spatial grid points that the discretization of each orbital function has. The algorithm is based on a novel strategy of density fitting using a selection of a subset of spatial grid points to approximate the pair products of orbital functions on the whole domain.
