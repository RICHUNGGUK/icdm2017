To enable effective negotiation and cooperation between two migrating instances of a migrating workflow, communication is an important and essential means. Previous approaches, when applied in the context of mobile agent based workflow, cannot guarantee the reliability and efficiency simultaneously. In this paper, we proposed an improved communication model to solve this problem. The model implements a computation metaphor similar to the way people correspond by mail. It introduces the concept of service domains to imitate postal areas with different postal codes, and decouple mailbox with its owners to ensure reliability. In addition, the combining utilization of Address-book and friend domain list can locate a target more quickly and exactly. Original experiments show that the model not only ensures reliable communication of moving objects, but also keeps overheads at reasonably low.", "paper_title": "The communication model of migrating workflow system", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100049"}
