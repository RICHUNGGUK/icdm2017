The proposed method is based on the herein named Adaptive Census Transform that exploits adaptive support weights during the image transformation; the adaptively weighted sum of SADs is then used as the dissimilarity metric. Quality tests show that the proposed method reaches significantly better accuracy than alternative hardware-oriented approaches. To demonstrate the practical hardware feasibility, a specific architecture has been designed and its implementation has been carried out using a single FPGA chip. Such a VLSI implementation allows a frame rate up to 68 fps to be reached for 640 x 480 stereo images, using just 80,000 slices and 32 RAM blocks of a Virtex6 chip. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
