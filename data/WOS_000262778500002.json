The solution uses transistors in strong inversion and an original biasing scheme that exploits the bulk terminals of the transistor pair to accurately set the quiescent current and provide common-mode control. As a result, we avoid the use of the tail current source adopted in traditional differential stages. An implementation based on an auxiliary switched-capacitor network used in the feedback control loop is proposed and theoretically examined. Measurements on a prototype fabricated in a standard 0.35-mu m technology (with threshold voltages around 0.5 V) and powered with 1.2 V show an error in the bias current of about 15% with respect to the expected value. It was found that the obtained overall performance is comparable to that of a traditional long-tailed differential pair that uses a higher supply of 1.5 V.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Implementation of a Minimum-Supply Body-Biased CMOS Differential Amplifier Cell", "paper_id": "WOS:000262778500002"}
