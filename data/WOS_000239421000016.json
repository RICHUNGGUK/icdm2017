Most previous works assume the threshold number of collusive users. Whereas, in order to treat a more general non-threshold collusion, We first introduce a notion of a potentially collusive family. Furthermore, we develop a novel way to measure collusion-secure codes according to combinatorial properties in a natural way. Our measurement immediately implies the definition of optimal codes. We then actually illustrate an optimal code. Finally, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a code to be optimal by using a new notion of family-intersecting codes.", "paper_title": "Worst-case optimal fingerprinting codes for non-threshold collusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000239421000016"}
