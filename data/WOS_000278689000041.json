DNaseI digestion of chromatin coupled with massively parallel sequencing (digital genomic footprinting) enables the identification of protein-binding footprints with high resolution on a genome-wide scale. However, accurately inferring the locations of these footprints remains a challenging computational problem. Results: We present a dynamic Bayesian network-based approach for the identification and assignment of statistical confidence estimates to protein-binding footprints from digital genomic footprinting data. The method, DBFP, allows footprints to be identified in a probabilistic framework and outperforms our previously described algorithm in terms of precision at a fixed recall. Applied to a digital footprinting data set from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DBFP identifies 4679 statistically significant footprints within intergenic regions. These footprints are mainly located near transcription start sites and are strongly enriched for known TFBSs. Footprints containing no known motif are preferentially located proximal to other footprints, consistent with cooperative binding of these footprints. DBFP also identifies a set of statistically significant footprints in the yeast coding regions. Many of these footprints coincide with the boundaries of antisense transcripts, and the most significant footprints are enriched for binding sites of the chromatin-associated factors Abf1 and Rap1.
