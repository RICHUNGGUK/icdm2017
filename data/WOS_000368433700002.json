A variation of the algorithm is presented for polynomial matrices that computes the inverse of a nonsingular nxn matrix whose entries are polynomials of degree d over a field using (n(3)d)(1+o(1)) field operations. Both algorithms are randomized of the Las Vegas type: failure may be reported with probability at most 1/2, and if failure is not reported, then the output is certified to be correct in the same running time bound.", "paper_title": "ON THE COMPLEXITY OF INVERTING INTEGER AND POLYNOMIAL MATRICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000368433700002"}
