Growers identify the location of their production unit of interest (latitude and longitude of field) and the system automatically obtains observed weather data from the nearest available weather station, and location-specific forecast weather data from the National Weather Service - National Digital Forecast Database. The DSS uses these weather data along with crop and management information to drive disease forecasting systems and a validated mechanistic model of the disease to generate location-specific management recommendations for fungicide application. An integrated alert system allows users to receive notification of upcoming critical thresholds via e-mail or text message. This system provides producers, consultants, researchers, and educators with a tool to obtain management recommendations, evaluate disease management scenarios, explore comparative epidemiology, or function as a teaching aid. In field and computer simulation experiments, DSS-guided schedules were influenced by prevailing weather and host resistance and resulted in schedules that improved the efficiency of fungicide use and also reduced variance in disease suppression when compared to a weekly spray schedule. In situations with unfavorable weather, the DSS recommended fewer fungicide applications with no loss of disease suppression. In situations of very favorable weather, the DSS recommended more fungicide applications but with improved disease suppression. The DSS provides an interactive system that helps users maximize the efficiency of their crop protection strategy by enabling well-informed decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
