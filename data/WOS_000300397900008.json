The framework, called DRAGON (discrete-model register for Artifex-based general-purpose optical local area network simulation), is built upon the Artifex modeling platform, and it models a wide register of fiber-optic components, emulating features at multiple network layers, spanning over signal and noise power monitoring, bit error rate (BER) estimation, packet collision detection, and propagation/transmission delay emulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DRAGON by modeling a novel two-tier fault-tolerant wavelength division multiplexing local area network (WDM LAN) architecture, and we show the impact of the proposed WDM LAN architecture on the quality of service requirements of WDM traffic.", "paper_title": "Multi-Layer Simulation Design and Validation for a Two-Tier Fault-Tolerant WDM LAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000300397900008"}
