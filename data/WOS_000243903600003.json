We identify classes of control systems for which it is possible to construct equivalent (bisimilar) finite state models. These constructions are based on finite, but otherwise arbitrary, partitions of the set of inputs or outputs of a control system.", "paper_title": "Symbolic models for control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243903600003"}
