We chose Bluetooth over WiFi as the underlying wireless technology of device discovery, based on our measurement study of their operational power at different states on smartphones. eDiscovery adaptively changes the duration and interval of Bluetooth inquiry in dynamic environments, by leveraging history information of discovered peers. We implement a prototype of eDiscovery on Nokia N900 smartphones and evaluate its performance in three different environments. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct extensive performance evaluation of Bluetooth device discovery in the wild. Our experimental results demonstrate that compared with a scheme with constant inquiry duration and interval, eDiscovery can save around 44 percent energy at the expense of discovering only about 21 percent less peers. The results also show that eDiscovery performs better than other existing schemes, by discovering more peers and consuming less energy. We also verify the experimental results through extensive simulation studies in the ns-2 simulator.", "paper_title": "On the Energy Efficiency of Device Discovery in Mobile Opportunistic Networks: A Systematic Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000352569000009"}
