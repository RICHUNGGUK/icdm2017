Due to the stateless nature of the internet, it is an intricate problem to determine the source of these spoofed IP packets. This is where; we need the IP traceback mechanism i.e. identifying the true source of an IP datagram in internet. While many IP traceback techniques have been proposed, but most of the previous studies focus and offer solutions for DDoS attacks done on IPv4 environment. Significant differences exist between the IPv4 and lPv6 Networks for instance, absence of option in basic IPv6 header. Thus, the mechanisms of IP Traceback for IPv4 networks may not be applied to IPv6 networks. In this paper, we extended our previous work i.e. PPM for IPv6 and removed its drawback by using Policy Based IP Traceback (PBIT) mechanism. We also discussed problems related to previously proposed IPv4 traceback schemes and practical subtleties in implementing traceback techniques for IPv6 networks.", "paper_title": "Tracing the true source of an IPv6 datagram using policy based management system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762400027"}
