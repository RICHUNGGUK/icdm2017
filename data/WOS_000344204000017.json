The proposed method takes advantage of important properties embedded in the binary code patterns, and determines the minimum stripe width that eliminates the effects of subsurface scattering and projector defocus in the capturing stage. Moreover, errors caused by inter-reflection are detected, and corrected by an iterative approach. Our method can be applied to scenes where more than one global illumination effect appears in a scene point. The accuracy of our method is demonstrated by quantitative evaluation, and its robustness by qualitative evaluation when applying to real-world scenes with various characteristics, both of which are better than two of the currently known best methods.
