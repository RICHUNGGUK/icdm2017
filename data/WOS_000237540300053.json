However, guaranteeing the correct processing of grid applications under all circumstances is difficult and not fully addressed by existing and infrastructure. Hidden flaws in the applications including unexpected internal behaviors, dissatisfaction of real-time constraints, incompatibility in service interactions, etc may lead to subtle failures in grid systems. This work tries to enhance the trustworthiness of grid applications by investigating existing formal techniques and their extensions. A formal framework based on extensions of Pi calculus is proposed which also integrates formal techniques of model checking and bisimulation analysis to enable the reasoning of grid applications from three perspectives: data, time and behavior. In addition, both application examples and our current implementation architecture are also concluded.", "paper_title": "Ensuring secure and robust grid applications - From a formal method point of view", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300053"}
