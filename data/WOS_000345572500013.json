In our system, an input image is transformed into a layer structure that is composed of object layers and a background layer, and then the scene depth is computed from the ground region that is specified by the user using a simple boundary line. The object size and order of overlapping are automatically determined during the reposition based on the scene depth. In addition, our system enables the user to move shadows along with objects naturally by extracting the shadow mattes using only a few user-specified scribbles. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our system through applications to depth-of-field effects, fog synthesis and 3D walkthrough in an image.", "paper_title": "Object Repositioning Based on the Perspective in a Single Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000345572500013"}
