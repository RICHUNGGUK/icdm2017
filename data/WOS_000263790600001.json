We propose to use the structure tensor to simultaneously describe the geometry of all the inputs. The basic idea is that the fused image should have a structure tensor which approximates the structure tensor obtained from the multiple inputs. At the same time, the fused image should appear 'natural' and 'sharp' to a human interpreter. We therefore propose to combine the geometry merging of the inputs with perceptual enhancement and intensity correction. This is performed through a minimization functional approach which implicitly takes into account a set of human vision characteristics.", "paper_title": "Image Fusion for Enhanced Visualization: A Variational Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000263790600001"}
