We prove that if the primitive root of the smallest word of L (with respect to a lexicographic order) is prefix distinguishable in L then the centralizer of L is as simple as possible, that is, the submonoid L-star. This lets us obtain a simple proof of a known result concerning the centralizer of nonperiodic three-word languages.", "paper_title": "On the simplest centralizer of a language", "paper_id": "WOS:000239790500012"}
