For the hydrodynamical component we consider Shallow Water equations. The morphodynamical component is defined by a continuity equation, which is defined in function of the solid transport discharge. We present several deterministic models, such as Meyer-Peter & Muller, Van Rijn or Grass model.. We also present an unified definition for the solid transport discharge, and we compare with Grass model. Both components define a coupled system of equations that can be rewrite as a non-conservative hyperbolic system. To discretize it, we consider finite volume methods with or without flux limiters and high order state reconstructions. Finally we present several tests, where we observe numerically the order of the numerical schemes. Comparisons with analytical solutions and experimental data are also presented.
