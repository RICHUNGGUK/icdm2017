Mobile stations can move while receiving services, thus ongoing IP sessions may be maintained during a handover in the IEEE 802.16e. To reduce handover latency, the idea of cross-layer handover which incorporates layer 2 handover with IP layer has been devised. Various cross-layer handover schemes supporting fast handover in the IEEE 802.16e networks have been proposed. However, the problem of the conventional cross-layer fast handover schemes is that they are heavily influenced by the new address confirmation latency which is the most time-consuming procedure. In this paper, we propose an enhanced cross-layer fast handover scheme which is not susceptible to the new address confirmation latency. Detailed performance analysis is performed in terms of the signaling costs and the handover latencies to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared with the conventional ones. The results of the performance evaluation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "An enhanced cross-layer fast handover scheme for mobile IPv6 in the IEEE 802.16e networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000298297000023"}
