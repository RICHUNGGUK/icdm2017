In this article, based on an extended dynamic constraint satisfaction problem based product configuration system, a hybrid constraint satisfaction problem solving algorithm with forward checking and backjumping with fail-first heuristic is proposed. To control backtracking occurrence in this hybrid solving algorithm when new active variables are introduced into dynamic constraint satisfaction problem, a hybrid heuristic (a combination of an amended most-constrained heuristic and fail-first heuristic) is integrated with forward checking and backjumping for better solution efficiency. Experiments on both algorithms have been performed on a dynamic constraint satisfaction problem based PC configuration task.", "paper_title": "Hybrid solving algorithms for an extended dynamic constraint satisfaction problem based configuration system", "paper_id": "WOS:000309353500005"}
