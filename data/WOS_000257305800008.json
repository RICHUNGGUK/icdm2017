[T. Ogita, S.M. Rump, S. Oishi, Accurate sum and dot product, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 26 (6) (2005) 1955-1988]. They have shown their algorithms are fast in terms of measured computing time. However, due to the strong data dependence in the process of their algorithms, it is difficult to parallelize them. Similarly to their algorithms, the proposed parallel algorithms in this paper are designed to achieve the results as if computed in K-fold working precision with keeping the fastness of their algorithms. Numerical results are presented showing the performance of the proposed parallel algorithm of calculating dot product. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
