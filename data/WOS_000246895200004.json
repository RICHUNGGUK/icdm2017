The development of numerical schemes to correctly solve that system of equations finds naturally an initial step in two-dimensional scalar equation, homogeneous or with source terms. We shall first provide a complete formulation of the second-order finite volume scheme for this equation, paying special attention to the reduction of the method to first order as a particular case. The explicit first and second order in space upwind finite volume schemes are analysed to provide an understanding of the stability constraints, making emphasis in the numerical conservation and in the preservation of the positivity property of the solution when necessary in the presence of source terms. The time step requirements for stability are defined at the cell edges, related with the traditional Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition.
