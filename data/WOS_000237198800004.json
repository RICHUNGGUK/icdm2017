Even though current databases continue to update new protein-protein interactions, valuable information still remains in biomedical literature. Thus data mining techniques are required to extract the information. In this paper, we present a tree kernel-based method to mine protein-protein interactions from biomedical literature. The tree kernel is designed to consider grammatical structures for given sentences. A support vector machine classifier is combined with the tree kernel and trained on predefined interaction corpus and set of interaction patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives promising results by utilizing the structure patterns.", "paper_title": "A tree kernel-based method for protein-protein interaction mining from biomedical literature", "paper_id": "WOS:000237198800004"}
