Such soils are frequently encountered in geotechnical and environmental engineering. The methodology is elaborated using a finite element analysis of the water flow through a cylindrical cavity in the soil mass. This analysis clearly shows that the water flow through the cavity is governed by both the soil anisotropy and the slenderness ratio of the cavity. Numerical simulations allow driving a simple expression for the variation of the shape factor of anisotropic soils with the degree of anisotropy. This factor permits the determination of the soil permeability from water borehole tests. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
