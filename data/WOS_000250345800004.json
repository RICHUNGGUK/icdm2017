First, we will compare the two main methods for aiding design behaviour simulation tools and domain knowledge simulation tools-and look at their advantages and drawbacks. We will focus on tools based on knowledge because of their 'interactivity' and for their ability to represent domain knowledge and show how they can be extended to evaluate designed solutions. We will then concentrate on an aiding-design tool based on constraints and see how a solution can be evaluated using an evaluation function. As such a tool has already been developed as part of a European project to help metallurgists design and evaluate heat treatment operations, we end with the presentation of a real example.", "paper_title": "Evaluation and design: a knowledge-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000250345800004"}
