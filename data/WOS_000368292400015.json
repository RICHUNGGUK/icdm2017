Effective inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity is a prominent, clinically viable approach for the treatment of AIDS. Few non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) as drugs for AIDS. In order to enhance therapeutic options against AIDS we examined novel herbal compounds of 4-thiazolidinone and its derivatives that are known to have remarkable antiviral potency. Our molecular docking and simulation experiments have identified one such herbal molecule known as (5E)-3-(2-aminoethyl)-5-benzylidene-1, 3-thiazolidine-2,4-dione that may bind HIV-1RT with high affinity to cause noncompetitive inhibition. Results are also compared with other US FDA approved drugs. Long de novo simulations and docking study suggest that the ligand (5E)-3-(2-aminoethyl)-5-benzylidene-1, 3-thiazolidine-2,4-dione (CID: 1656714) has strong binding interactions with Asp113, Asp110, Asp185 and Asp186 amino acids, all of which belong to one or the other catalytic pockets of HIV-1RT. It is expected that these interactions could be critical in the inhibitory activity of the HIV-1RT. Therefore, this study provides an evidence for consideration of (5E)-3-(2-aminoethyl)-5-benzylidene-1, 3-thiazolidine-2,4-dione as a valuable natural molecule in the treatment and prevention of HIV-associated disorders.", "paper_title": "In-silico Studies Show Potent Inhibition of HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase Activity by a Herbal Drug", "paper_id": "WOS:000368292400015"}
