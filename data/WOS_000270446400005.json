Given the small number of replicates (typically two to three) per biological sample, methods of analysis that control the variance are desirable but in short supply. We propose a double error shrinkage (DES) method by using moving average statistics based on local-pooled error estimates which effectively control both heterogeneous error variances and correlation structures of an extremely large number of individual probes on tiling arrays. Results: Applying DES to ChIP-chip tiling array study for discovering genome-wide protein-binding sites, we identified 8400 target regions that include highly likely TFIID binding sites. About 33% of these were well matched with the known transcription starting sites on the DBTSS library, while many other newly identified sites have a high chance to be real binding sites based on a high positive predictive value of DES. We also showed the superior performance of DES compared with other commonly used methods for detecting actual protein binding sites.", "paper_title": "Double error shrinkage method for identifying protein binding sites observed by tiling arrays with limited replication", "paper_id": "WOS:000270446400005"}
