We achieve this by showing that the action of the automorphism group of a Hadamard matrix developed from a difference set induces a 2-transitive action on the rows of the matrix or is intransitive. We then use Ito's classification of Hadamard matrices with 2-transitive automorphism groups to derive a necessary condition on the order of a cocyclic Hadamard matrix developed from a difference set. This work answers a research problem posed by K.J. Horadam, and exhibits the first known infinite family of Hadamard matrices which are not cocyclic.", "paper_title": "On twin prime power Hadamard matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000208849900011"}
