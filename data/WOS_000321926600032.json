Our scheme represents each sample in the weakly labeled data set as a mid-level feature with each entry as the corresponding decision value from the classification hyperplane (referred to as the prototype hyperplane) of one Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, in which a sparse set of support vectors is selected from the unlabeled generic data set based on the learnt combination coefficients. To learn the optimal prototype hyperplanes for the extraction of mid-level features, we propose a Fisher's Linear Discriminant-like (FLD-like) objective function by maximizing the discriminability on the weakly labeled data set with a constraint enforcing sparsity on the combination coefficients of each SVM model, which is solved by using an alternating optimization method. Then, we use the recent work called Side-Information based Linear Discriminant (SILD) analysis for dimensionality reduction and a cosine similarity measure for final face verification. Comprehensive experiments on two data sets, Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and YouTube Faces, demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.", "paper_title": "Learning Prototype Hyperplanes for Face Verification in the Wild", "paper_id": "WOS:000321926600032"}
