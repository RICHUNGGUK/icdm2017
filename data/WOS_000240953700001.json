For ligand-based approach, three dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) methods, comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA), were performed. The starting geometry of efavirenz was obtained from X-ray crystallographic data. The efavirenz derivatives were constructed and fully optimized by ab-initio molecular orbital method at HF/3-21G level. Reliable QSAR models for high predictive abilities were developed. Regarding WT and K103N inhibitions, CoMFA models with r(cv)(2) = 0.651 and 0.678 and CoMSIA models with r(cv)(2) = 0.662 and 0.743 were derived, respectively. The interpretation obtained from the models highlights different structural requirements for inhibition of WT and K103N HIV-1 RT. To elucidate potential binding modes of efavirenz derivatives in the binding pocket of WT and K103N HIV-1 RT, structure-based approach based on computational docking studies of selected efavirenz compounds were performed by using GOLD and FlexX programs. The results derived from docking analysis give additional information and further probe the inhibitor-enzyme interactions. The correlation of the results obtained from 3D QSAR and docking models validate each other and lead to better understanding of the structural requirements for the activity. Therefore, these integrated results are informative to provide key features and a helpful guideline for novel compound design active against HIV-1 RT.", "paper_title": "Computer-aided molecular design of highly potent HIV-1 RT inhibitors: 3D QSAR and molecular docking studies of efavirenz derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000240953700001"}
