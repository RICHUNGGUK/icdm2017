The method is based on an algorithm for ranking pairs of disjoint simple paths by non-decreasing order of cost, that is an adaptation of a path ranking algorithm applied to a network obtained from the original one after a suitable modification of the topology. Each path in this new network corresponds to a pair of paths in the former one. Computational results are presented and analysed for randomly generated networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
