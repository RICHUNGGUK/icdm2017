The technique employed is the Transmission Line Modeling (TLM) method implemented in Shared Memory (SM) environments. The benchmarking performed reveals that the maximum speedup depends on the memory size of the problem as well as multiple hardware factors, like the disposition of CPUs, cache, or memory. A maximum speedup of 15 has been measured for the largest problem. In certain circumstances of low memory requirements, superlinear speedup is achieved using our algorithm. The model is employed to model the Earth-ionosphere cavity, thus enabling a study of the natural electromagnetic phenomena that occur in it. The algorithm allows complete 3D simulations of the cavity with a resolution of 10 km, within a reasonable timescale. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
