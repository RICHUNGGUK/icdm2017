The technology and products related to fall detection have always been in high demand within the security and the health-care industries. An effective fall detection system is required to provide urgent support and to significantly reduce the medical care costs associated with falls. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey of different systems for fall detection and their underlying algorithms. Fall detection approaches are divided into three main categories: wearable device based, ambience device based and vision based. These approaches are summarised and compared with each other and a conclusion is derived with some discussions on possible future work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
