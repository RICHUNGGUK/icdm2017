Results provided by the algorithm are highly dependent upon the step of finding corresponding pairs between the two sets of 3D data before registration. In this paper, a look up matrix is introduced in the point matching step to enhance the overall ICP performance. Convergence properties and robustness are evaluated in the presence of Gaussian and impulsive noise, and under different data set sizes. The new algorithm has been evaluated on 3D medical data. It has been applied successfully to register closed surfaces acquired using different medical imaging modalities. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
