To efficiently deliver packets in the UMTS core network, the PDP contexts (i.e., the routing information) are maintained in the volatile storage (e.g., memory) of SGSN, GGSN, and UE. The GGSN routes packets between the UMTS core network and external data networks, and thus has heavy traffic and computation loading, which may result in PDP contexts lost or corrupted, and the QoS of the UMTS network may degrade significantly. To resolve this issue, 3GPP 23.007 proposes a mechanism for GGSN failure restoration. In this mechanism, the corrupted PDP contexts can be restored through the PDP Context Activation procedure. However, this incurs extra signaling cost to the network. To reduce the network signaling cost and delay for restoration of the corrupted PDP contexts, this paper proposes an improved mechanism \"GGSN Failure Restoration\" (GFR) with different backup algorithms. The analytic models and simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate GFR.Our study indicates that the GFR mechanism can significantly reduce the cost for the PDP context restoration.", "paper_title": "An improved GGSN failure restoration mechanism for UMTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000235447400008"}
