For intuitive recognition of time-series local spatial association, we employ Moran scatterplot and extend it to QS-TiMoS (Quadrant Sequence on Time-series Moran Scatterplot) that allows for examining temporal context in local spatial association using a series of categorical variables. Based on the QS-TiMoS signature of nodes and edges, we develop the similarity measures for \"state sequence\" and \"clustering transition\" of time-series local spatial association. The similarity matrices generated from the similarity measures are then used for producing the classification maps of time-series local spatial association that present the history of changing regions in clusters. The feasibility of the proposed method is tested by a case study on the rate of land price fluctuation of 232 administrative units in Korea, 1995-2004.", "paper_title": "Classification of changing regions based on temporal context in local spatial association", "paper_id": "WOS:000241631200006"}
