The proposed algorithm keeps fast convergence speed and strong adaptability features of the particle swarm optimization. In addition, it updates an elite set to achieve multi-objective decision-making. Meanwhile, a mutation operator is adopted to make the algorithm converge to the global optimal. Simulation results show that compared to the single-objective algorithm, the proposed algorithm can obtain the optimal combination performance and take into account both the network state and the user preferences.", "paper_title": "Network Selection Algorithm for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks Based on Multi-Objective Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000310979500005"}
