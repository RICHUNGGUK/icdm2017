In terms of linear matrix inequalities, delay-dependent conditions are obtained, which guarantee the considered delayed neural network to have a unique equilibrium point, which is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical examples are given to show the less conservatism and effectiveness of the proposed stability conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
