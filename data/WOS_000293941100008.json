The RBVMS formulation and its suitability and accuracy for turbulent flow in a moving domain are presented. Particular emphasis is placed on the parallel implementation of the methodology and its scalability. Two challenging flow cases were considered: the turbulent Taylor-Couette flow and the NREL 5 MW offshore baseline wind turbine rotor at full scale. In both cases, flow quantities of interest from the simulation results compare favorably with the reference data and near-perfect linear parallel scaling is achieved. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
