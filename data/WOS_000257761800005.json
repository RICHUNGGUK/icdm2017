They often encounter difficulties when dealing with classes that have large nonlinear variability, especially when the variability is structural or due to articulation. It is well-known that shape representation based on skeletons is superior to contour based representation in such situations. However, approaches to shape similarity based on skeletons suffer from the instability of skeletons, and matching of skeleton graphs is still an open problem. Using a new skeleton pruning method, we are able to obtain stable pruned skeletons even in the presence of significant contour distortions. We also propose a new method for matching of skeleton graphs. In contrast to most existing methods, it does not require converting of skeleton graphs to trees and it does not require any graph editing. Shape classification is done with Bayesian classifier. We present excellent classification results for complete shapes.", "paper_title": "Skeleton-based shape classification using path similarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000257761800005"}
