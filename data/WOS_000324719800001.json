However, it is known that velocity signals may be noisy or even unmeasurable. Also, most existing controllers require full or partial plant physical parameters like rope length or load mass. To resolve these issues, a model-free energy exchanging and dropping-based control law is proposed to achieve output (only position/swing-angle) feedback control for overhead cranes. We synthesize a total energy function, consisting of the (generalized) crane energy and the controller energy, to render it to achieve its (local) minimum at the desired equilibrium point. The proposed control law is dynamically generated by an artificial block-spring system, which exchanges energy with the crane dynamics and then drops the energy via an elegant dropping mechanism to gradually attenuate the total energy. The corresponding stability and convergence analysis is implemented using some Lyapunov-like analysis. Simulation and experimental results suggest the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method for crane control, in terms of rapid swing suppression, efficient trolley positioning, as well as increased robustness.
