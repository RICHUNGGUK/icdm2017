Based on random fuzzy theory, a random fuzzy variable denotes a measurable function from a credibility space to a collection of random variables. Under this setting, the long-run expected reward per unit time is addressed and the theorem on random fuzzy renewal rewards is established. The utility of this research is demonstrated with a realistic application case.", "paper_title": "Modeling Random Fuzzy Renewal Reward Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000260046700021"}
