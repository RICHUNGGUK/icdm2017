This AAC system exhibits the advantages of two currently used systems: 1) usability of the communication boards and 2) natural oral communication of the electronic communicators. To improve comfort in use, robustness and versatility, the system is designed as two separate blocks linked by wireless communication via a wireless network of communication board sheets. The communication sheets, which are the interface with the user, are economical, simple to use, and scalable to adaptation of the number of symbols and the vocabulary of the individuals who use the system. The digital system (record/player system) controls the net, identifies the active sheets and the pushed symbols, and plays and records all sounds. This digital system can be easily replaced by other digital interfaces, such as computers, smartphones, or tablets, and can increase the function of the AAC with the possibility of using the Internet communication (emails and Skype, among others). The prototype has been evaluated in two special education schools, which are attended by children with severe motor disabilities with or without associated disorders and multi-deficiencies. Positive reviews from individuals who use the AAC system open the possibility of the system's use in both home and educational environments.", "paper_title": "A Wireless Augmentative and Alternative Communication System for People With Speech Disabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200096"}
