EVOLT uses a population of individuals, each of which represents a set of QoS parameters, and evolves the individuals via genetic operators such as crossover, mutation and selection for satisfying given QoS requirements. For evaluating EVOLT in real-world settings that have high-dimensional parameter and optimization objective spaces, this paper focuses on QoS optimization in safety-critical communication networks for electric power utilities. Simulation results show that EVOLT outperforms a well-known existing evolutionary algorithm for multiobjective optimization and efficiently obtains quality QoS parameters with acceptable computational costs. Moreover, EVOLT visualizes obtained QoS parameters in a self-organizing map in order to aid network administrators to intuitively understand the QoS parameters and the tradeoffs among optimization objectives.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary high-dimensional QoS optimization for safety-critical utility communication networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297243700012"}
