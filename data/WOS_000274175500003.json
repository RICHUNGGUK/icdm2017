The hybrid method is benchmarked for several one-dimensional and two-dimensional test cases The results obtained by the hybrid method show a steeper and more accurate shock profile as compared with the results obtained by the widely used Godunov scheme or by a representative flux vector splitting scheme Additional features of the proposed scheme are that it can be implemented on a non-uniform grid. study of multi-fluid problems is possible. and it is easily extendable to multi-dimensions These features have been demonstrated in this work The proposed method is therefore robust and can possibly be applied to a variety of compressible flow situations Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Soils.
