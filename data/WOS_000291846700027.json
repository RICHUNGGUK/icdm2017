However, detection-based techniques might be effective in collaboration with prevention-based techniques for securing WSNs. As a significant branch of detection-based techniques, the research of anomaly detection in wired networks and wireless ad hoc networks is already quite mature, but such solutions can be rarely applied to WSNs without any change, because WSNs are characterized by constrained resources, such as limited energy, weak computation capability, poor memory, short communication range, etc. The development of anomaly detection techniques suitable for WSNs is therefore regarded as an essential research area, which will enable WSNs to be much more secure and reliable. In this survey paper, a few of the key design principles relating to the development of anomaly detection techniques in WSNs are discussed in particular. Then, the state-of-the-art techniques of anomaly detection in WSNs are systematically introduced, according to WSNs' architectures (Hierarchical/Flat) and detection technique categories (statistical techniques, rule based, data mining, computational intelligence, game theory, graph based, and hybrid, etc.). The analyses and comparisons of the approaches that belong to a similar technique category are represented technically, followed by a brief discussion towards the potential research areas in the near future and conclusion.
