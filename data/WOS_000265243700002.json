In particular, the introduction of broadband and reliable wireless networks allows the interaction of a huge number of devices all creating a single network. On the other hand, the grid paradigm is considered as one of the most promising approach for pervasive and dynamic applications. Aim of this paper is to present a novel integrated approach between grid paradigm and wireless networks by highlighting the main advantages of their cooperation. In particular, it will be shown here how a wireless heterogeneous network can be exploited for implementing a pervasive and dynamic grid (mobile grid) and, on the other hand, a mobile grid allows the optimization of the communication infrastructure. The integrated approach can be an effective method for solving applications, such its emergency management, where a huge amount of data derived from a wireless infrastructure needs to be processed efficiently and adaptively, and the traffic flow in the wide area wireless networks needs to be coordinated and optimized.
