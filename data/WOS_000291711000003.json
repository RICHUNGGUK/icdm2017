First we study the properties of the direct translation (or \"encoding\") of generalised clause-sets into boolean clause-sets. Many combinatorial properties are preserved, and as a result we can lift fixed-parameter tractability of satisfiability in the maximal deficiency from the boolean case to the general case. Then we turn to irredundant clause-sets, which generalise minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets, and we prove basic properties. The simplest irredundant clause-sets are hitting clause-sets, and we provide characterisations and generalisations. Unsatisfiable irredundant clause-sets are the minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets, and we provide basic tools. These tools allow us to characterise the minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets of minimal deficiency. Finally we provide a new translation of generalised boolean clause-sets into boolean clause-sets, the nested translation, which preserves the conflict structure. As an application, we can generalise results for boolean clause-sets regarding the hermitian rank/defect, especially the characterisation of unsatisfiable hitting clause-sets where between every two clauses we have exactly one conflict. We conclude with a list of open problems, and a discussion of the \"generic translation scheme\".", "paper_title": "Constraint Satisfaction Problems in Clausal Form II: Minimal Unsatisfiability and Conflict Structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711000003"}
