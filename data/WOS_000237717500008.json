We prove that our encoding is fully abstract with respect to barbed bisimulation and sound with respect to barbed congruence. Our encoding demonstrates that higher-order process-passing together with mobile resources in, possibly local, named locations are sufficient to express pi-calculus name-passing. The encoding uses a novel continuation passing style to facilitate the encoding of synchronous communication.
