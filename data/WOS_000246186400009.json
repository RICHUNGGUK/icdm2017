The proposed protocol works for diverse physical parameters such as number of interfaces at each node, number of communication frequencies, and antenna beamwidth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides link layer differentiated services for wireless networks with smart antennas and explores the influence of the physical parameters and network topology on the performance of the MAC layer.", "paper_title": "Provisioning link layer proportional service differentiation in wireless networks with smart antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000246186400009"}
