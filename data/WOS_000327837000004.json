This article explores a well-established cognitive architecture CLARION and shows how its behaviour and performance capture human psychology at a detailed level. The model captures many psychological quasi-laws concerning categorisation, induction, uncertain reasoning, decision-making, and so on, which indicates human-like characteristics beyond what other models have been shown to be capable of. Thus, CLARION constitutes an advance in developing more psychologically realistic cognitive agents.", "paper_title": "Psychologically realistic cognitive agents: taking human cognition seriously", "paper_id": "WOS:000327837000004"}
