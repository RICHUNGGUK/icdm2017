We establish tight bounds for the transition complexity of Boolean operations, in the case of union the upper and lower bounds differ by a multiplicative constant two. We show that the transition complexity results for union and complementation are very different from the state complexity results for the same operations. However, for intersection, the transition complexity bounds turn out to be similar to the corresponding bounds for state complexity.", "paper_title": "Transition Complexity of Incomplete DFAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000294764900011"}
