In this paper, a modified fuzzy min-max (MFMM) clustering neural network is proposed. Its efficacy for tackling power quality monitoring tasks is demonstrated. A literature review on various clustering techniques is first presented. To evaluate the proposed MFMM model, a performance comparison study using benchmark data sets pertaining to clustering problems is conducted. The results obtained are comparable with those reported in the literature. Then, a real-world case study on power quality monitoring tasks is performed. The results are compared with those from the fuzzy c-means and k-means clustering methods. The experimental outcome positively indicates the potential of MFMM in undertaking data clustering tasks and its applicability to the power systems domain. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
