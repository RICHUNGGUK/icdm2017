Constraint satisfaction is the process of finding a solution to a set of constraints. Planning is the process of finding a sequence of actions that transfer the world from some initial state to a desired state. Scheduling is the problem of assigning a set of tasks to a set of resources subject to a set of constraints. In this paper, we introduce the main definitions and techniques of constraint satisfaction, planning and scheduling from the Artificial Intelligence point of view.", "paper_title": "Constraint satisfaction techniques in planning and scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000273788200002"}
