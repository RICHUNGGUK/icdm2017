The developed Logic wrappers (L-wrapper) have declarative semantics, and therefore: (i) their specification is decoupled from their implementation and (ii) they can be generated using inductive logic programming. We also define a convenient way for mapping L-wrappers to XSLT for efficient processing using available XSLT processing engines.", "paper_title": "L-wrappers: concepts, properties and construction - A declarative approach to data extraction from web sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000244954400006"}
