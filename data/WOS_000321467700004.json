A novel design named configurable butterfly array (CBA) is also proposed to support both the forward transform and the inverse transform in this unified architecture. Hadamard transform or 4/8-point DCT/IDCT are used in traditional video coding standards while 16/32-point DCT/IDCT are newly introduced in HEVC. The proposed architecture can support all these transform types in a unified architecture. Two levels (architecture level and block level) of hardware sharing are adopted in this design. In the architecture level, the forward transform can share the hardware resource with the inverse transform. In the block level, the hardware for smaller size transform can be recursively reused by larger size transform. The multiplications of 4 or 8-point transform are implemented with Multiplierless MCM (Multiple Constant Multiplication). In order to reduce the hardware overhead, the multiplications of 16/32 point DCT are implemented with ICM (input-muxed constant multipliers) instead of MCM or regular multipliers. The proposed design is 51% more area efficient than previous work. To the author's knowledge, this is the first published work to support both forward and inverse 4/8/16/32-point integer transform for HEVC standard in a unified architecture.", "paper_title": "A Unified Forward/Inverse Transform Architecture for Multi-Standard Video Codec Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000321467700004"}
