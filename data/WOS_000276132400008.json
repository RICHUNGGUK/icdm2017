They are the basis of many proposals aimed to solve a variety of network-related problems such as resource location, network construction, nodes sampling, etc. This interest on random walks is justified by their inherent properties. They are very simple to implement as nodes only require local information to take routing decisions. Also, random walks demand little processing power and bandwidth. Besides, they are very resilient to changes on the network topology. Here, we quantify the effectiveness of independent random walks (i.e, random walks that have statistical properties identical to the random sampling) as a search mechanism in one-hop replication networks: networks where each node knows its neighbors' identity/resources, and so it can reply to queries on their behalf. Our model focuses on estimating the expected average search time of the random walk by applying network queuing theory. To do this, we must provide first the expected average search length. This is computed by means of estimations of the expected average coverage at each step of the random walk for all random walks in all random networks with a given degree distribution. This model takes into account the revisiting effect: the fact that, as the random walk progresses, the probability of arriving to nodes already visited increases, which impacts on how the network coverage evolves. That is, we do not model the coverage as a memoryless process. Furthermore, we conduct a series of simulations to evaluate, in practice, the above mentioned metrics. Our results show a very close correlation between the analytical and the experimental results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
