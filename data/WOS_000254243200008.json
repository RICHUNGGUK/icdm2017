The methodology comprises a semiformal modeling language for design processes, complemented by a modeling procedure describing the efficient creation of design process models. The methodology inherits from some approaches developed in the domain of business process reengineering and work-flow management, but has been extended considerably to meet the requirements imposed by the creative character of design processes. Two case studies demonstrating the successful application of the procedure for design processes in different industrial settings are discussed.", "paper_title": "Design process modeling in chemical engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000254243200008"}
