A theoretical estimate for skin friction coefficient is given, which is characterized by a power law exponent. The reliability and efficiency of the proposed estimate formula are verified by numerical results with a good agreement. The estimate formula can be successfully applied to give the value of the skin friction coefficient. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
