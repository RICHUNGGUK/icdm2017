Taking two or more existing models (finite Gibbs spatial point processes) we multiply the probability densities together and renormalise to obtain a new probability density. We call the resulting model a hybrid. We discuss stochastic properties of hybrids, their statistical implications, statistical inference, computational strategies and software implementation in the R package spatstat. Hybrids are particularly useful for constructing models which exhibit interaction at different spatial scales. The methods are demonstrated on a real data set on human social interaction.
