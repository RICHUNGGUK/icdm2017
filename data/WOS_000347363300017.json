A comparison between this class and a representative class of minimum-variance reduced-bias (MVRB) EVI-estimators is further considered. The MVRB EVI-estimators are related to a direct removal of the dominant component of the bias of a classical estimator of a positive EVI, the Hill estimator, attaining as well minimal asymptotic variance. Heuristic choices for the tuning parameters p and k, the number of top order statistics used in the estimation, are put forward, and applied to simulated and real data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
