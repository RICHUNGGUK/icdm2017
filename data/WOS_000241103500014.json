In particular, the treatment of HIRC has received less attention from computational perspectives even though it is frequently found in both text and spoken languages. This paper shows that a typed feature structure grammar of HPSG (together with the semantic representations of Minimal Recursion Semantics) offers us a computationally feasible and applicable way of deep-parsing both the HIRC and HERC in the language.", "paper_title": "Parsing head internal and external relative clause constructions in Korean", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500014"}
