Then, BPN is trained to memorize the relationship among pixels of each sub-block image. Furthermore, the adaptive embedding algorithm is adopted to enhance the characters of the watermarking system. Simulation results are given which show that this scheme is practical, secure and robust.", "paper_title": "A novel blind digital watermark algorithm based on neural network and chaotic map", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000028"}
