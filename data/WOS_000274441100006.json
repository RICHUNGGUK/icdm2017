The new algorithm is designed with resource-constrained platforms in mind and explores the structure of an underlying block cipher to provide security at a small cost in terms of memory needs. Also, we show how Marvin can be used as an authentication-only function or else in an authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) scheme. We define a new AEAD proposal called LetterSoup, which is based on the mode of operation. Finally, we LFSRC analyze the security and performance of the resulting schemes.
