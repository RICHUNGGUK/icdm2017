The hybrid algorithm is formed by a basic evolutionary programming approach, mixed with a gradient-guided local search. Two different local searches procedures are tested in the paper, both specially designed to be effective in the WCTDP. Simulations on an example in the design of a magnetic circuit and comparison with several existing bio-inspired heuristics are carried out, and have shown the goodness of our algorithm.
