The FiWi access networks consist of the edge router, the Passive Optical Networks (PONs), and the wireless networks. In this environment, the edge router, which is the terminal to the core network, can have heavy congestion. To cope with this problem, we propose a Multi Point Control Protocol (MPCP)-based centralized rate control method to centrally control the traffic rate at each Home GateWay (HGW) so as to avoid congestion at the edge router. In the proposed scheme, the transmission delay due to rate control overhead can be mitigated. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified by numerical analysis and computer simulations.", "paper_title": "A MPCP-Based Centralized Rate Control Method for Mobile Stations in FiWi Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000373740000024"}
