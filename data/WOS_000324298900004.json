We first model the uncertainty in sensor networks. Then, we map information quality to the combination of sensed data error, residual energy and energy cost of sensor nodes. Moreover, the problem of IQ-aware nodes selection is induced and an energy-efficient tracking algorithm based on nodes selection is presented. Finally, a comprehensive set of simulations is presented. We conclude that the proposed tracking algorithm yields excellent tracking performance in sensor networks under uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Information quality-aware tracking in uncertain sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000324298900004"}
