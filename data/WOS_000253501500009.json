Namely, defining for each k >= 1, s(k) = inf{delta >= 0 vertical bar there exists a O(2(delta n))-time randomized algorithm for k-SAT} and, similarly. sigma(k) = inf{delta >= 0 vertical bar there exists a O(2(delta n))-time randomized algorithm for Unique k-SAT}, we show that lim(k ->infinity) s(k) = lim(k ->infinity)sigma(k). a corollary, we prove that, if Unique 3-SAT can be solved in time 2(epsilon n) for every epsilon > 0, then so can k-SAT for all k >= 3. Our main technical result is an Isolation Lemma for k-CNFs, which shows that a given satisfiable k-CNF can be efficiently probabilistically reduced to a uniquely satisfiable k-CNF, with non-trivial, albeit exponentially small, success probability.
