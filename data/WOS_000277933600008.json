The main target of these systems, to detect pedestrians in urban scenarios, implies overcoming difficulties like processing outdoor scenes from a mobile platform and searching for aspect-changing objects in cluttered environments. This makes such systems combine techniques in the state-of-the-art Computer Vision. In this paper we present a three module system based on both 2D and 3D cues. The first module uses 3D information to estimate the road plane parameters and thus select a coherent set of regions of interest (ROIs) to be further analyzed. The second module uses Real AdaBoost and a combined set of Haar wavelets and edge orientation histograms to classify the incoming ROIs as pedestrian or non-pedestrian. The final module loops again with the 3D cue in order to verify the classified ROIs and with the 2D in order to refine the final results. According to the results, the integration of the proposed techniques gives rise to a promising system. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
