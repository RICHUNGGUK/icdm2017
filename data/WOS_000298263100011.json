Observations, from parametric study for the CDOS based Lange coupler, are provided to aid in the design process. A functional linked artificial neural network has been used to determine the dimensions of the CDOS. Electromagnetic simulations have been validated with experimental results obtained from fabricated prototypes. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
