In short, PSMs provide a solid foundation for creating a semantic layer supporting planetary-scale networks Moreover, within a world-scale network where billions services are used and created by billions of parties in ad hoc dynamic fashion we believe that PSM-based mechanisms provide the only viable approach to dealing the sheer scale systematically. Our current experiments in this area are based upon a generic ontology for describing Web services derived from earlier work on PSMs. We outline how platforms based on our ontology can support large-scale networked interactivity in three main areas. Within a large European project we are able to map business level process descriptions to semantic Web service descriptions, to enable business experts to manage and use enterprise processes running in corporate information technology systems. Although highly successful, Web service-based applications predominately run behind corporate firewalls and are far less pervasive on the general Web. Within a second large European project we are extending our semantic service work using the principles underlying the Web and Web 2.0 to transform the Web from a Web of data to one where services are managed and used at large scale. Significant initiatives are now underway in North America, Asia, and Europe to design a new Internet using a \"clean-slate\" approach to fulfill the demands created by new modes of use and the additional 3 billion users linked to mobile phones Out investigations within the European-based Future Internet program indicate that a significant opportunity exists for our PSM-derived work to address the key challenges currently identified scalability, trust, interoperability, pervasive Usability and mobility We outline one PSM-derived approach as an exemplar", "paper_title": "Problem solving methods in a global networked acre", "paper_id": "WOS:000271131600005"}
