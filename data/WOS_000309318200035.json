The time-delay pattern is quite general and including fast time-varyings. It is assumed that the time delay belongs to a given interval, but the derivative of a time-varying delay be less than 1 is removed, or the delay function is not necessary to be differentiable. By constructing a set of improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals combined with a known integral inequality, new delay-dependent exponential stability criteria with explicitly exponential convergence rate are established in terms of LMIs (linear matrix inequalities). The stability criteria are less conservative than the existing results in the literatures. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the results. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
