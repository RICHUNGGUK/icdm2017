Currently, many researchers used the method based on protein sequences in function classification, sub-cellular location, structure and functional site prediction, including some machine-learning methods. The purpose of this article, is to find a new way of sequence analysis, but more simple and effective. Results: According to the nature of 64 genetic codes, we propose a simple and intuitive 2D graphical expression of protein sequences. And based on this expression we give a new Euclidean-distance method to compute the distance of different sequences for the analysis of sequence similarity. This approach contains more sequence information. A typical phylogenetic tree constructed based on this method proved the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we use this sequence-similarity-analysis method to predict protein sub-cellular localization, in the two datasets commonly used. The results show that the method is reasonable.", "paper_title": "A Novel method for similarity analysis and protein sub-cellular localization prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000283665000005"}
