Typically, such an adaptation is performed by dynamically adding or removing components. In these type of adaptations, components are often added to or removed from multiple processes in the system. As a result, during adaptation, the system may consist of both changed and unchanged processes, causing old and new components to overlap. This overlapping of components during adaptation may induce cross-component communication, which may lead to behavior during adaptation that is unpredictable and/or undesirable. In this paper, we discuss an approach to model and verify overlap adaptation. We use the transitional-invariant lattice and the transitional-faultspan lattice to verify the correctness of adaptation in the absence and the presence of faults, respectively. We also discuss a framework to support implementation of overlap adaptation.
