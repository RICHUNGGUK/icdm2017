Central to the success of SCILHS is development of innovative 'apps' to improve PCOR research methods and capacitate point of care functions such as consent, enrollment, randomization, and outreach for patient-reported outcomes. SCILHS adapts and extends an existing national research network formed on an advanced IT infrastructure built with open source, free, modular components.", "paper_title": "Scalable Collaborative Infrastructure for a Learning Healthcare System (SCILHS): Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000337660600011"}
