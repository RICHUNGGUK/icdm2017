Palette re-indexing could improve the compression of color-indexed images, but it is still complicated and consumes extra time. Making use of the topology-preserving property of self-organizing Kohonen feature map, we can generate a fairly good color index table to achieve both high image quality and high compression, without re-indexing. Promising experiment results will be presented.", "paper_title": "Effective palette indexing for image compression using self-organization of Kohonen feature map", "paper_id": "WOS:000239774800003"}
