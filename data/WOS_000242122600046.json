Specifically, we relate representative measures of this kind of texture with its presence degree. To obtain these \"presence degrees\", we collect assessments from polls filled by human subjects, performing an aggregation of these assessments by means of OWA operators. Using this collected data, and some statistics as reference set, the membership function corresponding to the fuzzy set \"coarseness\" is modelled.", "paper_title": "Modelling coarseness in texture images by means of fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600046"}
