To overcome drawbacks in the existing hypercube structure, we present an exchanged folded hypercube (EFH) structure, which is an improvement of the exchanged hypercube. Compared with the existing hypercube structures, EFH shows better performance in terms of many metrics such as smaller diameter, lower cost factor, and constant node degree. In this paper, we first introduce the structure of an EFH; then, we propose a routing algorithm and a load-balancing algorithm for EFHs. Finally, we analyze the fault tolerance characteristics of EFHs including fault diameter and the cost effectiveness factor.
