In the article, we provide a comprehensive overview of techniques for capacity improvement and QoS provisioning in the IEEE 802.11 protocol family. These techniques represent the R&D efforts both in the research community and the IEEE 802.11 Working Groups. Specifically, we summarize the operations of IEEE 802.11 legacy as well as its extension, introduce several protocol modeling techniques, and categorize the various approaches to improve protocol capacity, to provide QoS (by either devising new MAC protocol components or fine-tuning protocol parameters in IEEE 802.11), and to judiciously arbitrate radio resources (e.g., transmission rate and power). To demonstrate how to adapt QoS provisioning in newly emerging areas, we use the wireless mesh network as an example, discuss the role IEEE 802.11 plays in such a network, and outline research issues that arise.
