The method is based on an active contour approach and a multi-scale gradient map resulting from the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT). The method is automated and does not require any pith localization. It is also quite robust to some defect structures such as branch prints, cracks, knots or mold. We applied the method to process entire Abies alba wood slices (aged from 10 to 50 years) from bark to pith, which amounted to about 200 tree-rings. Our automatic delineation method performed accurately compared to the manual expert measurements with a mean F-score of 0.91 for the quality of delineation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
