We construct the maximal and the minimal infinite smooth words, with respect to the lexicographical order. The naive algorithm generating them is improved by using a reduction of the De Bruijn graph of their factors. We also study their Lyndon factorizations. Finally, we show that the minimal smooth word over the alphabet {1, 3} belongs to the orbit of the Fibonacci word.", "paper_title": "Properties of the extremal infinite smooth words", "paper_id": "WOS:000253284200004"}
