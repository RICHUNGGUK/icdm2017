In this work, the problem of wrinkling is solved by directly minimizing the total potential energy of the structure. The numerical solution is carried out by the means of an iterative method such as the conjugate gradient algorithm. Although the proposed approach is theoretically equivalent to the traditional finite element method, it proves to be an attractive alternative which is particularly efficient for thin wrinkled structures.
