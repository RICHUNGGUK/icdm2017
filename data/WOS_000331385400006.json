The efficacy of the proposed method is investigated and validated in the determination of glucose from near-infrared spectra of a mixture composed of urea, triacetin and glucose. In this paper, the DBP filtering was implemented as a pre-processing technique in the frequency domain as a Gaussian band pass filter and in the time domain as a Chebyshev filter. The grid-search optimization method was used to optimize the filter parameters. The results demonstrate that utilization of the optimized DBP filters as a pre-processing technique improved the performance of the predictive models.
