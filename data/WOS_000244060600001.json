This model is derived by quantifying relevant attributes of operating systems, including intrinsic technical factors and time-dependent environmental factors. We use this model to understand past evolution and learn to predict future evolution, not only of individual operating systems, but also of operating systems features. We combine the insights gained from this study with insights gained from other similar empirical experiments to attempt to derive evolutionary laws for software technology trends.
