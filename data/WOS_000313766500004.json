Kinodynamics (KD), defines the system state at any given time as the result of a kinematic state in the recent past, physically simulated over a short time window to the present. MD is a well suited kinematic approximation to animated characters and other dynamic systems with dominant kinematic motion and short-lived dynamics. Given a dynamic system, we first choose an appropriate kinodynamic window size based on accelerations in the kinematic trajectory and the physical properties of the system. We then present an inverse kinodynamics W(D) algorithm, where a kinodynamic system can precisely attain a set of animator constraints at specified times. Our approach solves the IKD problem iteratively, and is able to handle full pose or end effector constraints at both position and velocity level, as well as multiple constraints in close temporal proximity. Our approach can also be used to solve position and velocity constraints on passive systems attached to kinematically driven bodies. We describe both manual and automatic procedures for selecting the kinodynamic window size necessary to approximate the dynamic trajectory to a given accuracy. We demonstrate the convergence properties of our MD approach, and give details of a typical work flow example that an animator would use to create an animation with our system. We show IKD to be a compelling approach to the direct kinematic control of character, with secondary dynamics via examples of skeletal dynamics and facial animation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
