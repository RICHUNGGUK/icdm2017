The current state-of-the-art benchmark, the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD), minimizes bias by including decoys from a library of synthetically feasible molecules that are physically similar yet chemically dissimilar to the active ligands. We show that by ignoring synthetic feasibility, we can compile a benchmark that is comparable to the DUD and less biased with respect to physical similarity.", "paper_title": "Virtual Decoy Sets for Molecular Docking Benchmarks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287685700002"}
