We describe a two-stage approach to solve the resulting complex and numerically difficult nonconvex mixedinteger nonlinear feasibility problem. The first phase consists of four distinct algorithms applying mixedinteger linear, mixedinteger nonlinear, nonlinear, and methods for complementarity constraints to compute possible settings for the discrete decisions. The second phase employs a precise continuous nonlinear programming model of the gas network. Using this setup, we are able to compute high-quality solutions to real-world industrial instances that are significantly larger than networks that have appeared in the mathematical programming literature before.", "paper_title": "Validation of nominations in gas network optimization: models, methods, and solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000345371800002"}
