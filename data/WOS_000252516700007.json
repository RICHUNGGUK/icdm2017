The proposed framework is Lyapunov based and unlike standard neural network (NN) controllers guaranteeing ultimate boundedness, the framework guarantees partial asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, that is, asymptotic stability with respect to part of the closed-loop system states associated with the system plant states. The neuroadaptive controllers are constructed without requiring explicit knowledge of the, system dynamics other than the assumption that the plant dynamics are continuously differentiable and that the approximation error of uncertain system nonlinearities lie in a small gain-type norm bounded conic sector. This allows us to merge robust control synthesis tools with NN adaptive control tools to guarantee system stability. Finally, two illustrative numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Neural network adaptive control for a class of nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems with asymptotic stability guarantees", "paper_id": "WOS:000252516700007"}
