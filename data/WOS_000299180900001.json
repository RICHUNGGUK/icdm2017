This paper discusses the semidefinite representability conditions for convex sets of the form S(D)(f) = {x is an element of D : f (x) >= 0}. Here, D = {x is an element of R(n) : g(1)(x) >= 0, ..., g(m)(x) >= 0} is a convex domain defined by some \"nice\" concave polynomials g(i)(x) (they satisfy certain concavity certificates), and f(x) is a polynomial or rational function. When f(x) is concave over D, we prove that S(D)(f) has some explicit semidefinite representations under certain conditions called preordering concavity or q-module concavity, which are based on the Positivstellensatz certificates for the first order concavity criteria: f (u) + del f (u)(T) (x - u) - f (x) >= 0, for all x, u is an element of D. When f(x) is a polynomial or rational function having singularities on the boundary of S(D)(f), a perspective transformation is introduced to find some explicit semidefinite representations for S(D)(f) under certain conditions. In the special case n = 2, if the Laurent expansion of f(x) around one singular point has only two consecutive homogeneous parts, we show that S(D)(f) always admits an explicitly constructible semidefinite representation.", "paper_title": "First order conditions for semidefinite representations of convex sets defined by rational or singular polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000299180900001"}
