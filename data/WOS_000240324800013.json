To provide the desired level of service reliability, the RMS can assign the same subtasks to several independent resources for parallel execution. Some subtasks cannot be executed until they have received input data, which can be the result of other subtasks. This imposes precedence constraints on the order of subtask execution. The service reliability & performance indices are introduced,and a fast numerical algorithm for their evaluation given any subtask distribution is suggested. Illustrative examples are presented.", "paper_title": "Reliability and performance of star topology grid service with precedence constraints on subtask execution", "paper_id": "WOS:000240324800013"}
