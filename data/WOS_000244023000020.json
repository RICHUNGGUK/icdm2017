This study quantitatively analyzes correlations of success antecedents to success measures and ranks them in order of importance by using the formulas advocated in prior research. Results indicate there is no one dominant success antecedent across all success measures and sub-types of MSS. Rather, the importance of a success antecedent depends on the type of success measure and the type of system. Therefore, the implication is that when organizations implement systems, they must prioritize the outcome that they want to focus on and pay attention to the corresponding success antecedent. The findings also provide information and guidelines for the selection of factors to be investigated in future research on MSS implementation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
