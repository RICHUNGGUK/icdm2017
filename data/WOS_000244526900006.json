Based on satisfactory control and estimation theory, a passive fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed for a class of uncertain linear discrete-time systems in this article. Manipulating linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, robust fault-tolerant state-feedback controllers are designed which take the possible actuator faults and sensor faults into consideration, respectively. The closed-loop systems are guaranteed by the designed controllers to meet the required constraints on regional pole index phi(q, r), steady-state variance matrix X index and control-cost function V-2(u) index simultaneously. Then, whether possible faults occur or not, the closed-loop systems would maintain the three desirable performance indices accordingly. Meanwhile, the consistency of the performance indices mentioned earlier is also discussed for fault-tolerant control.", "paper_title": "Robust satisfactory fault-tolerant control of uncertain linear discrete-time systems: an LMI approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000244526900006"}
