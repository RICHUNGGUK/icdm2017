This paper studies a sub-category of the scheduling problem which focuses on scheduling a periodic task on multiple periodic resources where none of these resources have sufficient capacity to support the task. Instead of splitting the task into sub-tasks, which is not always practical in real systems, we integrate resources together to jointly support the task. First, we develop a method to integrate two fixed but arbitrary pattern periodic resources into an equivalent periodic resource. Second, for two periodic resources with unknown but fixed resource occurrence patterns, we give the lower and upper bounds of the available time provided by an integrated periodic resource within a period. Third, we present theoretical and empirical analysis on the schedulability of a non-splittable periodic task on two periodic resources and their integrated periodic resource. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
