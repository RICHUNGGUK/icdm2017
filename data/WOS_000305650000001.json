A distributed routing and spectrum allocation algorithm with cooperation (DRSAC-W) in cognitive wireless mesh networks is proposed in this paper. In order to show the decrease of the average end-to-end delay with cooperation in DRSAC-W, a distributed routing and spectrum allocation algorithm without cooperation (DRSAC-WO) is proposed in this paper. Minimizing the average end-to-end delay is the objective of DRSAC-W and DRSAC-WO. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm DRSAC-W with cooperation can alleviate the high delay due to the heterogeneity of available channels of different nodes and achieve low average end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "Distributed Routing and Spectrum Allocation Algorithm with Cooperation in Cognitive Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000305650000001"}
