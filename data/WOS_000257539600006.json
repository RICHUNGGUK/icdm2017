The desired extended energy range can be covered, in principle, by performing a Wang-Landau recursion for the density of states followed by a multicanonical simulation with fixed weights. But in the conventional approach one loses the advantage due to cluster algorithms. We show that a cluster version of the Wang-Landau recursion together with a subsequent multibondic simulation improves for 2D and 3D Ising models the efficacy of the conventional approach by power laws in the lattice size. By using finite-size scaling theory for suitably adapting the extended energy range to the system size, in our simulations real gains in CPU time reach two orders of magnitude. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
