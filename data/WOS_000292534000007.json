Presently, only a few alpha 2-AR subtype selective compounds are known. Using homology modeling and ligand docking, the present study analyzes the similarities and differences between binding sites, and between extracellular loops of the three subtypes of alpha 2-ARs. Several alpha 2-AR subtype selective ligands were docked into the active sites of the three a2-AR subtypes, key interactions between ligands and receptors were mapped, and the predicted results were compared with the available experimental data. Binding site analysis reveals a strong identity between important amino acid residues in each receptor, the very few differences being the key toward modulating selectivity of alpha 2-AR ligands. The observed differences between binding site residues provide an excellent starting point for virtual screening of chemical databases, in order to identify potentially selective ligands for alpha 2-ARs.
