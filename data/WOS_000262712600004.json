Such a perspective is becoming increasingly important: new computing paradigins based on the natural computational properties of the world are being created, scientific questions are being answered using computational ideas, and philosophical debates oil the nature of computation are being formed. This paper discusses how computing education might react to these developments, goes on to discuss how these ideas can help to define computer science as a discipline, and reflects on our experience at Kent in teaching these subjects.", "paper_title": "Teaching Natural Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000262712600004"}
