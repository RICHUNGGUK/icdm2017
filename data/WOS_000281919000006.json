Ultra High-Speed Mobile Information and Communication (UMIC) is one of the research clusters established under the excellence initiative of the German government. Within UMIC, research is being carried out on next generation mobile applications. Based on experiences of developing a set of advanced mobile applications for communities of practice within the scenario Virtual Campfire, the framework for mobile multimedia management is concerned with mobile multimedia semantics, with multimedia metadata, with multimedia context management, with ontology models, and with multimedia uncertainty management. Results are evaluated on a mobile multimedia community testbed MobSOS. We aim at creation, annotation, adaptation, sharing, and consumption of mobile multimedia data in professional communities with heterogeneous and varying needs.", "paper_title": "Mobile multimedia management for Virtual Campfire - the German excellence research cluster UMIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000281919000006"}
