A permutation of Z(n) is a sequence of n distinct elements of Z(n). Addition and subtraction of two permutations is defined element-wise. In this paper we consider two extremal problems on permutations of Z(n), namely, the maximum size of a collection of permutations such that the sum of any two distinct permutations in the collection is again a permutation, and the maximum size of a collection of permutations such that no sum of two distinct permutations in the collection is a permutation. Let the sizes be denoted by s (n) and t (n) respectively. The case when n is even is trivial in both the cases, with s (n) = 1 and t (n) = n!. For n odd, we prove (n phi(n))/2(k) <= s(n) <= n!.2(-)(n-1)/2/((n-1)/2)! and 2 (n-1)/2 . (n-1/2)! <= t (n) <= 2(k) . (n-1)!/phi(n), where k is the number of distinct prime divisors of n and phi is the Euler's totient function.", "paper_title": "On Additive Combinatorics of Permutations of Z(n)", "paper_id": "WOS:000342624300003"}
