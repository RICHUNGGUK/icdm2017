Design/methodology/approach - A definition is provided. The paper uses a survey methodology, exploring relevant cybernetic and contemporary technological concepts. An operational software mechanism (The Insight Engine) is discussed that enables the bridging of transdisciplinary concepts by a user in the service of accretive research - Recombinant Informatics. Findings - Many cybernetic concepts are relevant to contemporary research into cognition and Neosentience research. More study needs to be undertaken related to historical BCL projects in terms of articulating relevance to contemporary research. Research limitations/implications - Future research seeks to extend the computational functionality of \"The insight engine\", as well as uncover relevant BCL/cybernetic materials. Practical implications - The software is unique in the field and already there is interest in its use by differing research communities including the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, and at Stanford, research under Ian Hodder. Social implications - The Insight Engine has potential to be used as a multi-perspective tool for many different fields enabling different forms of distributed, transdisciplinary team-based research. Originality/value - This text is valuable to researchers interested in new forms of interface, augmentation of thought and learning via computational approaches; and the development of bridges between novel research areas, including contemporary, historical BCL, and other cybernetic inquiry.", "paper_title": "A multi-perspective approach to knowledge production", "paper_id": "WOS:000347782600016"}
