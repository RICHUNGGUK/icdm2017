While several accurate and efficient methods for the tridiagonal eigenproblem exist, their corresponding implementations usually target urn-processors or large distributed memory systems. Our new eigensolver MR3-SMP is instead specifically designed for multi-core and many-core general purpose processors, which today have effectively replaced uni-processors. We show that in most cases MR3-SMP is faster and achieves better speedups than state-of-the-art eigensolvers for uni-processors and distributed-memory systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
