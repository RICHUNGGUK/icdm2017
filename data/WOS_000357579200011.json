Assessing the system effectiveness is based on analyzing the log files to track the studying time, the number of connections, and earned game bonus points. This study is based on an example of the online application for practical foreign language speaking skills training between random users, which select the role of a teacher or a student on their own. The main features of the developed system include pre-defined synchronized teaching and learning materials displayed for both participants, along with user motivation by means of gamification. The actual percentage of successful connects between specifically unmotivated and unfamiliar with each other users was measured. The obtained result can be used for gauging the developed system success and the proposed teaching methodology in general.", "paper_title": "Study of Gamification Effectiveness in Online e-Learning Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000357579200011"}
