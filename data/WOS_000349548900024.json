Many interesting approaches have been studied in order to cope with this growth, but most require major redesigns of current network architectures as well as large-scale hardware redeployments. Recently, the Big File Protocol (BFP), a network protocol designed to efficiently handle large file transactions, was proposed to provide improvements over traditional IP protocols (TCP/UDP) in terms of bandwidth utilization and end-to-end delay. This paper presents an integration strategy for BFP within the currently deployed optical transport network (OTN) transport infrastructure relying as much as possible on current hardware and functions, thereby minimizing the deployment impact. Simulation results show capacity utilization improvement of more than 40% relative to TCP.", "paper_title": "Big File Protocol for OTN and Ethernet Transport Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000349548900024"}
