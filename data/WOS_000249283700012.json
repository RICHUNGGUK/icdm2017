It is shown that Reed's Conjecture, which concerns all upper bound to the chromatic number, holds for some special classes of graphs; future approaches are briefly outlined. Another strengthening of Brooks' well-known upper bound is sketched. Details about the internal derivation strategies of the program and tools offered to the users are presented, as Jar as needed for an understanding of the subsequent sketch of a problem-solving process. For readers particularly interested in the software system further hints on its implementation, technical data, and the availability of the program are compiled in the last chapter.", "paper_title": "A knowledge-based system for graph theory, demonstrated by partial proofs for graph-colouring problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249283700012"}
