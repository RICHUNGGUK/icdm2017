To this direction, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is currently standardizing the Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) framework of UMTS. In this paper, we present an overview of the MBMS multicast mode of UMTS. We analytically present the multicast mode of the MBMS and analyze its performance in terms of packet delivery cost under various network topologies, cell types, and multicast users' distributions. Furthermore, for the evaluation of the scheme, we consider different transport channels for the transmission of the multicast data over the UMTS Terrestrial Radio-Access Network (UTRAN) interfaces. Finally, we propose a scheme for the efficient radio bearer selection that minimizes total packet delivery cost.
