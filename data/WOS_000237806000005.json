A two-layer structure, consisting of supervisory planning (SP) and operation planning (OP), is identified to separate the generic process data from those machine-specific ones. Within DPP, function blocks are used for data encapsulation, machining parameter optimization, process monitoring, scheduling integration, and CNC control. From SP to OP, a function block evolves from meta function block, through object function block, to execution function block. The detailed design of a meta function block is depicted in this paper. A function block designer has been developed to help process planners de. ne basic function block types and generate composite function block networks. It is expected that the function block-enabled DPP approach and the associated algorithms can largely improve the dynamism of process plans as well as the flexibility and productivity of job shop operations in a changing environment.", "paper_title": "Embedding machining features in function blocks for distributed process planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000237806000005"}
