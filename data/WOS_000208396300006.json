The framework supports a spatial programming model based on a topographical approach to modelling space that enables systems to independently define and use potentially overlapping spatial context in a consistent manner and in contrast to topological approaches, in which geographical relationships between objects are described explicitly. This approach is supported by an extensible data model that implicitly captures the relationships between information provided by separate underlying systems and facilitates the incremental construction of global smart spaces since the underlying systems to be incorporated are largely decoupled. The framework has been evaluated using a prototype that integrates legacy systems and context-aware services for multi-modal urban journey planning and for visualising traffic congestion.
