However, contemporary MOGs do not; really support ubiquity in the sense that a seamless service across heterogeneous hardware platforms is not provided. This paper presents the architecture of the cross-platform online game, which provides a service to users from heterogeneous platforms and is equipped with a situation-aware capability for enabling the users to seamlessly move between heterogeneous platforms. The experimental results through the prototype implementations show the feasibility of the situation-aware cross-platform game.", "paper_title": "A SITUATION-AWARE CROSS-PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE FOR UBIQUITOUS GAME", "paper_id": "WOS:000273224600003"}
