The number of every text feature in the source code of a module is counted and used as data for training detection models. In this paper, we prepared a naive Bayes classifier and a logistic regression model as detection models. To show the effectiveness of our approaches, we conducted experiments with five open source projects and compared them with a well-known metrics set, thereby achieving higher detection results. The results imply that large-scale text features are useful in constructing practical detection models, and measuring sophisticated metrics is not always necessary for detecting fault-prone modules.", "paper_title": "Fault-prone module detection using large-scale text features based on spam filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000275705900002"}
