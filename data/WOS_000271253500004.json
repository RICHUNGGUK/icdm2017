A set of sign language-based gestures, architectural hand signs (AHS), has been developed. AHS is performed on the left hand to define various \"components of architecture\", while \"location, size and shape\" information is defined by the motion of Marker-Pen on the right hand. The hand gestures and motions are recognized by the system and then transferred into 3D curves and surfaces correspondingly. This paper demonstrates the hand gesture-aided architectural modeling method with some case studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
