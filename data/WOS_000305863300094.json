Of all users of transport systems, pedestrians are the most vulnerable in crashes as they are unprotected. This paper deals with an autonomous intelligent emergency system designed to avoid collisions with pedestrians. The system consists of a fuzzy controller based on the time-to-collision estimate - obtained via a vision-based system - and the wheel-locking probability - obtained via the vehicle's CAN bus - that generates a safe braking action. The system has been tested in a real car - a convertible Citroen C3 Pluriel - equipped with an automated electro-hydraulic braking system capable of working in parallel with the vehicle's original braking circuit. The system is used as a last resort in the case that an unexpected pedestrian is in the lane and all the warnings have failed to produce a response from the driver. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
