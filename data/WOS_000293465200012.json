In this paper, we investigate a simple transceiver structure for single-carrier MIMO systems, in which the cyclic-delay time-reversal space-time block code (CDTR-STBC) is employed at the transmitter, and the frequency-domain decision-feedback equalization (FD-DFE) is used at the receiver. We separate the transmit antennas into two groups, and then, encode the groups by STBC and cyclically delay the data streams within each group. Such processing can mitigate the impact of error-propagation and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss when FD-DFE is employed, in which SNR is defined as the ratio of the received signal power over the noise power at each receive antenna. To support our proposal, this paper also provides the performance analysis of FD-DFE. It is shown that the proposed scheme can achieve full diversity and full transmission rate for a MIMO system employing arbitrary antennas. Therefore, it has considerable performance improvement over the existing schemes.", "paper_title": "Cyclic-delay time-reversal space-time block codes for single-carrier transmission with frequency-domain decision-feedback equalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000293465200012"}
