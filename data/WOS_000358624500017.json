These problems were introduced by Kucherov et al. (SPIRE) [8], they proposed indexes occupying O (n logn) bits with query times O (p + output) and O (p + log logn + output) for Problem (i) and Problem (ii) respectively. The query time for Problem (ii) is later improved to optimal O(p + output) by Gawrychowski et al. (SPIRE) [6]. In this paper, we describe succinct indexes of nlog sigma + o(nlog sigma) + O(n) bits space with near-optimal query times i.e., O(p + log logn + output) for both, these problems.
