We argue that exploiting semantic techniques in mobility data management can bring valuable benefits to many domains characterized by the mobility of users and moving. objects in general, such as traffic management, urban dynamics analysis, ambient assisted living, emergency management, m-health, etc. We present the state-of-the-art in the domain of management of semantic locations and trajectories, and outline research challenges that need to be investigated to enable a full-fledged and intelligent semantic management of moving objects and location-based services that support smarter mobility. We propose a distributed framework for the semantic enrichment and management of mobility data and analyze the potential deployment and exploitation of such a framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
