Naturally, we can assume that an image is modeled as the sum of smooth, edge, and texture components. To obtain a high quality recovered image, appropriate regularizations for each individual component are required. In this paper, we propose a novel image recovery technique which performs decomposition and recovery simultaneously. We formulate image recovery as a nonsmooth convex optimization problem and design an iterative scheme based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for approximating its global minimizer efficiently. Experimental results reveal that the proposed image recovery technique outperforms a state-of-the-art method.", "paper_title": "Image Recovery by Decomposition with Component-Wise Regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146100045"}
