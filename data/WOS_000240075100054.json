In the method, the support vectors (SVs) appeared in the decision function of SVM are replaced with some feature vectors (FVs) which are selected from support vectors by FVS method. Since it is a subset of SVs set, the size of FVs set is normally smaller than that of the SVs set, therefore the decision process of SVM is speeded up. Experiments on 12 datasets of IDA show that the number of SVs can be reduced from 20% to 99% with only a slight increase on the error rate of SVM by the proposed method. The trade-off between the generalization ability of obtained SVM and the speedup ability of the proposed method can be easily controlled by one parameter.", "paper_title": "A speedup method for SVM decision", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100054"}
