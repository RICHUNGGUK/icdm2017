The source and target meshes are semantically similar but their geometries may be different. We assume that the segmentation of the source mesh and the skeleton correspondence between the meshes are provided. Our method first establishes the skeleton-boundary correspondence and then performs the boundary transfer procedure. The skeleton-boundary correspondence is useful for computing approximately the target boundaries. The boundary transfer procedure aims to produce the segment boundaries of the target mesh such that their geometric details are consistent to the ones of the corresponding source segment boundaries. We have applied our method for various models and compared with the state-of-the-art techniques. Our method computes segment boundaries of the target mesh which are similar to the ones of the source mesh.", "paper_title": "A Skeleton-Based Approach for Consistent Segmentation Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000339464800007"}
