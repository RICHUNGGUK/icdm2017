The random deletion channel takes n symbols from a q-ary alphabet, and each symbol is deleted independently with probability p. Taking advantage of recent improvements on the results of Luby and Mitzenmacher for verification-based decoding by Shokrollahi and Wang, we show bow to design for any epsilon > 0 and sufficiently large n and q deletion codes with the following properties: the rate is (1 - p)(1 - epsilon), the failure probability is n(O(1/epsilon 2))/q, and the computational complexity for encoding and decoding is n(O(1/epsilon 2)) log q. We also extend these schemes to obtain the same results even if the undeleted symbols are also transposed arbitrarily, and if a sufficiently small number of random symbols are inserted.", "paper_title": "Polynomial time low-density parity-check codes with rates very close to the capacity of the q-ary random deletion channel for large q", "paper_id": "WOS:000242503300022"}
