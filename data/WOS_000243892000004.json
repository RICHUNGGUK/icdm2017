The class of jump nonlinear systems considered is described by a fuzzy model composed of two levels: A crisp level which represents the jumps and a fuzzy level which represents the system nonlinearities. Considering the approximation error between the fuzzy model and the jump nonlinear system as norm-bounded uncertainties, we develop a systematic technique based on a coupled Lyapunov function to obtain A robust stochastic fuzzy controller which guarantees the L-2 gain of the closed-loop system in respect to external inputs to be equal to or less than a prescribed value. A simulation example on an industrial power plant operating in a cogeneration scheme is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed stabilizing controller in reducing oscillations as well as maintaining a desired operation condition in the presence of fluctuations in the local load.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity fuzzy control approach for a class of Markovian jump nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243892000004"}
