The extracted sources indicated neural activities that might be generated in the central nervous system. Four patients with essential tremor were tested in a set of movement tasks. Subjects wore a data glove that measured finger movements of the hand. The experimental data were then fed to a convolutive-mixture model, which revealed sources that imbibed in them the tremor frequency components of 2-8 Hz. Time-frequency analysis of these sources might be of potential help to clinicians to devise tasks that can manifest visible tremor from patients.", "paper_title": "Extraction of Sources of Tremor in Hand Movements of Patients With Movement Disorders", "paper_id": "WOS:000262429100007"}
