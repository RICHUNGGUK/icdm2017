The presented system synthesizes Czech sentences from Czech tectogrammatical trees supplied by the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0 (PDT 2.0). Linguistically relevant phenomena including valency, diathesis, condensation, agreement, word order, punctuation and vocalization have been studied and implemented in Perl using software tools shipped with PDT 2.0. BLEU score metric is used for the evaluation of the generated sentences.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of Czech sentences from tectogrammatical trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500028"}
