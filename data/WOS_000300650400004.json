Its intuitive design and numerous productivity features motivate chemical researchers and students to record their data electronically. The data are stored in a highly structured form that offers substantial benefits over laboratory notebooks written on paper with regard to data retrieval, data mining, and exchange of results.", "paper_title": "Electronic Laboratory Notebook: The Academic Point of View", "paper_id": "WOS:000300650400004"}
