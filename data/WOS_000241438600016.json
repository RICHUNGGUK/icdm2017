Overbooking is necessary to alleviate the detrimental effects of no-shows that are experienced by healthcare providers. Compared with traditional simple deterministic overbooking approaches, SMOM is unique since it considers the probability distributions of no-shows and walk-ins to obtain the optimal solution. Usually, healthcare providers would only have no-show data based on their current practices, so the authors provide a method to extrapolate the conditional probability to estimate what happens when overbooking occurs. SMOM is then compared with two alternative strategies: the base case of no overbooking and the naive statistical overbooking approach (NSOA) that simply adds the mean number of no-shows minus the mean number of walk-ins to the number of appointments to accept. It is shown using data collected for 59 physicians in a medical clinic that SMOM compared with the base case can increase profits by 43.72% on average whereas NSOA improves profits by 29.66% on average. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate SMOM is robust under a diversity of healthcare environments and cost structures.", "paper_title": "A stochastic mathematical appointment overbooking model for healthcare providers to improve profits", "paper_id": "WOS:000241438600016"}
