Thus, several organisations have implemented analytics and business intelligence (BI) for Big Data solutions. To effectively foster the acceptance and usage of BI, this study examines how the motivational factors of both expectancy theory and social exchange theory (SET) affect managers' willingness to utilise BI. A survey of 271 managers supports the proposed model. The results show that intangible rewards of expectancy theory significantly influence the intention to read information (IRI) through the desire to make good decisions. Benefit factors (organisational rewards, reputation, and reciprocity) of SET are significantly associated with the desire to exchange reports (DER). The IRI significantly directly and indirectly influences the intention to create reports through the DER. Given the empirical findings, this study provides theoretical and managerial insights for organisations.", "paper_title": "Exploring managers' intention to use business intelligence: the role of motivations", "paper_id": "WOS:000348571000006"}
