To be accessible by clients, such VEEs need either a public IPv4 or a public IPv6 address. However, the pool of available public IPv4 addresses is nearly depleted and the low rate of adoption of IPv6 precludes its use. Therefore, what is needed is a way to share precious IPv4 public addresses among a large pool of VEEs. Our insight is that if an IP address is assigned at the time of a client DNS request for the VEE's name, it is possible to share a single public IP address amongst a set of VEEs whose workloads are not network intensive, such as those hosting personal servers or performing data analytics. We investigate several approaches to multiplexing a pool of global IP addresses among a large number of VEEs, and design a system that overcomes the limitations of current approaches. We perform a qualitative and quantitative comparison of these solutions. We find that upon receiving a DNS request from a client, our solution has a latency as low as 1 ms to allocate a public IP address to a VEE, while keeping the size of the required IP address pool close to the minimum possible.", "paper_title": "IP Address Multiplexing for VEEs", "paper_id": "WOS:000334996900006"}
