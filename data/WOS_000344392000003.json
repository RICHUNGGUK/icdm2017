The n-times iteration of this construction results in a PCA that represents any n-iterated limiting partial recursive function, and the inductive limit of the PCAs over all n is a PCA that represents any arithmetical partial function. Kleene's realizability interpretation over the former PCA interprets the logical principles of double negation elimination for Sigma(0)(n)-formulae, and over the latter PCA, it interprets Peano's arithmetic (PA for short). A hierarchy of logical systems between Heyting's arithmetic (HA for short) and PA is used to discuss the prenex normal form theorem, relativised independence-of-premise schemes, and the statement 'PA is an unbounded extension of HA'.", "paper_title": "Realizability interpretation of PA by iterated limiting PCA", "paper_id": "WOS:000344392000003"}
