This serious weakness of DCT is analyzed theoretically and then demonstrated practically. As an instance, a novel attack algorithm is proposed to acquire the sketch information from the encrypted data without any pre-knowledge of the encryption algorithm. Thereafter, to solve this problem, a full inter-block shuffle (FIBF) approach is developed and it can be employed to improve the encryption security in all DCT based algorithms, such as JPEG, MPEG and H.26x.", "paper_title": "Visual information encryption in frequency domain: Risk and enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900024"}
