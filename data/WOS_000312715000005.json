In this paper, we present a long-tail distribution based multiscale-multivariate autoregressive hyperspectral detector to handle such region targets. We establish a multiscale-multiband autoregresive model (MMAM) to characterize the inter-band, the spatial and the band-spatial correlation in hyperspectral data simultaneously and have the corresponding multiscale-multiband likelihood ratio (MMLR) test. Due to the long tail property of MMAM noise, we treat the statistical characteristics of MMAM noise as multivariate t distribution. Then, alternating projection involving fixed-point iteration and gradient based searching (APFPGS) are utilized to fit this statistical distribution. Experimental results on the real hyperspectral imagery recorded with A series of Environmental Probe System (EPS-A) show that our approach has better performance in hyperspectral region target detection than the other four detectors.", "paper_title": "Long-tail distribution based multiscale-multiband autoregressive detection for hyperspectral imagery", "paper_id": "WOS:000312715000005"}
