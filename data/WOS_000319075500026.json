We provide a cloud service that browses the stacks of problem solution resources produced in the software process (SP for short) by organizing them into a structured Resource Space according to domain topics. Efforts are made to provide the cloud service with the ability of automatic construction of the SP problem-solving Resource Space, including extracting domain topics from document resources with the TDDF algorithm, transforming the topics into several categories to form the logic Resource Space, and deploying the Resource Space in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P for short) network. We also expect to achieve the online service evolution such as adjusting the resource pool and refining the Resource Space Model (RSM for short) by continuously understanding and adapting to its surroundings. Empirical cases are finally presented. Our investigation promotes the adaptability of cloud services to their changing environment.", "paper_title": "Cloud service: automatic construction and evolution of software process problem-solving resource space", "paper_id": "WOS:000319075500026"}
