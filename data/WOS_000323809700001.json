This research proposes a configurable model which is reusable, fast-prototyping, and extendable to support real-time visualization of the erection process. The developed model of the crane is divided into three modules which can be reconfigured for different erection tasks. Each module is defined using multiple rigid bodies and the joint constraints of multibody dynamics. The proposed modeling method can also be easily adapted to existing physics engines. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method, we observed the processes involved in a common erection activity and compared this with the visualization results obtained using proposed method. We also simulated a cooperative cranes scenario taken from an actual construction project to demonstrate its usability. We found that the proposed modeling method was easily able to visualize various erection activities with different cranes and configurations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
