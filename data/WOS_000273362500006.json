The nature of the application raised ethical issues for testing in a clinical environment and standard evaluation techniques could not easily be applied. The system was therefore evaluated by clinicians in a multi-tasking environment with a simulated set of patient scenarios. Measures of suitability and wearability were applied. The results were encouraging and the system was deemed suitable for further evaluation in the clinical setting, subject to ethical approval.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of a wearable computer system for telemonitoring in a critical environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000273362500006"}
