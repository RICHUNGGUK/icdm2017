In this paper, we studied the stopping distance and stopping redundancy of Finite Geometry LDPC (FG-LDPC) codes, and derived an upper bound of the stopping redundancy of FG-LDPC codes. It is shown from the bound that the stopping redundancy of the codes is less than the code length. Therefore, FG-LDPC codes give a good trade-off between the performance and complexity and hence are a very good choice for practical applications.", "paper_title": "On the stopping distance and stopping redundancy of Finite Geometry LDPC codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300039"}
