It solves two problems of nonuniformity of spatial resolution and spherical polar coordinates singularity. For the first problem, we derive a Laplacian operator and a class of differential corner detectors that can handle spatial inhomogeneities in omnidirectional panoramic images using differential schemes. To solve the second problem, we use an overset grid system on the sphere called the Yin-Yang grid. This is realized based on the property that each of the modified Laplacian operator and corner detector is invariant with respect to coordinate transformation between the two spherical polar coordinate systems associated with the Yin-Yang grid system.
