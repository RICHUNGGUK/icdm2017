However, the circumstances which facilitate problem solving and creative idea generation by analogy are not well understood and most analogies are not developed by applying a formal design-by-analogy methodology. Furthermore, most software tools which aid in finding and/or explaining analogies are based on manually assembled databases, which require a large amount of interactive work to be constructed and maintained. This paper examines the use of automatically distilled product characteristics, called Product Aspects, as a way to automatically and systematically identify candidate products for design-by-analogy. Case studies illustrate this idea generation methodology for three different target products. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
