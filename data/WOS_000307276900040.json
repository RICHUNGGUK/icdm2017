The study shows that the open conformation of HDAC8 may be preferred by ligands with flexible surface binding groups, as such a conformation allows the ligands to minimize their exposure to solvent upon binding. This observation allowed us to rationalize the excellent potency of pyrazole-based inhibitors compared to that of isoxazole-based inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Insights from comprehensive multiple receptor docking to HDAC8", "paper_id": "WOS:000307276900040"}
