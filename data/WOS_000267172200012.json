In this game, we have an edge weighted undirected network G(V . E) and n selfish players where player i wants to choose a low cost path from source vertex s(i) to destination vertex t(i). The cost of each edge is equally split among players who pass it. The price of stability is defined as the ratio of the cost of the best Nash equilibrium to that of the optimal solution. We present an O (log n/log log n) upper bound on price of stability for the single sink case, i.e., t(i) = t for all i. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
