In this paper, we present a low-power and high-performance H.264/AVC intra-frame encoder. We propose several novel approaches to alleviate the performance bottleneck caused by the long data dependency loop among 4 4 luma blocks, integrate an efficient CABAC entropy encoder, and apply a clock-gating technique to reduce power consumption. Synthesized into a TSMC 0.13 mu m CMOS cell library, our design requires 265.3 K gates at 114 MHz and consumes 23.56 mW to encode 1080pHD (1920 1088) video sequences at 30 frames per second (fps). It also delivers the same video quality as the H.264/AVC reference software. Compared with all state-of-the-art designs, our design has a lower working frequency and achieves both better bit-rate saving and lower power consumption.", "paper_title": "A Low-Power High-Performance H.264/AVC Intra-Frame Encoder for 1080pHD Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000290998700001"}
