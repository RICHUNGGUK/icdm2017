The MAF problem on two binary phylogenetic trees has been studied extensively in the literature. In this paper, we present a group of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for the MAF problem on multiple (i.e., two or more) binary phylogenetic trees. Our techniques work fine for the problem for both rooted trees and unrooted trees. The computational complexity of our algorithms is comparable with that of the known algorithms for two trees, and is independent of the number of phylogenetic trees for which a maximum agreement forest is constructed.
