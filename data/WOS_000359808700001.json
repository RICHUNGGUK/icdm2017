We consider this issue from the perspective of service, which is defined as the integral of the time-varying instantaneous channel capacity. With large-scale fading assumption, it will be shown that the total service of each base station is inversely proportional to the velocity of the train. Besides, we find that if the ratio of the service provided by a base station in its service region to its total service is given, the base station interval (i.e., the distance between two adjacent base stations) is a constant regardless of the velocity of the train. On the other hand, if a certain amount of service is required, the interval will increase with the velocity of the train. The aforementioned results apply not only to simple curve rails, like line rail and arc rail, but also to any irregular curve rail, provided that the train is traveling at a constant velocity. Furthermore, the new developed results are applied to analyze the on-off transmission strategy of base stations.
