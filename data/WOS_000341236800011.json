It is based on the assumptions that: (1) cloud computing will comprise an increasing fraction of the application workload offered to an Internet, and (2) that access to cloud computing resources will demand new architectural features from a network. Features that we have identified include dependability, security, flexibility and extensibility, the entirety of which constitute resilience. NEBULA provides resilient networking services using ultra-reliable routers, an extensible control plane and use of multiple paths upon which arbitrary policies may be enforced. We report on a prototype system, Zodiac, that incorporates these latter two features.", "paper_title": "A Brief Overview of the NEBULA Future Internet Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000341236800011"}
