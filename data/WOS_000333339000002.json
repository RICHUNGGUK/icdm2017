However, level set based segmentation methods are only able to capture edge structures which contain the first two types of segments. In this work, we propose an extension to the level set based image segmentation method in order to detect free endpoint structures. By generalizing the curve representation used in Chan and Vese (Trans. Image Proces. 10(2):266-277, 2001; Int. J. Comput. Vis. 50(3):271-293, 2002) to also include free endpoint structures, we are able to segment a larger class of edge types. Since our model is formulated using the level set framework, the curve evolution inherits useful properties such as the ability to change its topology by splitting and merging. The numerical method is provided as well as experimental results on both synthetic and real images.", "paper_title": "Active Contours with Free Endpoints", "paper_id": "WOS:000333339000002"}
