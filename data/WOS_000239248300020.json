The transition states of eight molecules were fully optimized at the ab initio HF/3-21G and density functional B3LYP/3-21G levels with Gaussian 98. The activation energies were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G(3df,2p)//B3LYP/3-21G level. We found the theoretical evaluation to be consistent with the experimental data. At the best case, an enantiomeric excess of up to 95% for (R)-2-scyclohexen-1-ol was achieved with (-)-N, N-diisopinocampheyl lithium amide.", "paper_title": "An experimental and theoretical study of the enantioselective deprotonation of cyclohexene oxide with isopinocampheyl-based chiral lithium amides", "paper_id": "WOS:000239248300020"}
