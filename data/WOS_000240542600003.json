These systems may be quite successful for some limited applications, but are very inflexible, since these systems only have fixed display regions. This paper integrates steerable projectors whose beam can be moved under computer control onto a wall-size display system to strengthen its display ability. With the steerable projectors, the integrated display system, named Flexible Display, provide an extendable display region. This consists of a large-scale display region and several movable display regions, such that the integrated display system has great potential in the area of human-computer interaction and information visualization. This paper applies the Flexible Display to a virtual museum application to give the users fluent navigation experience. For the application, the Flexible Display provides the following functions: 1) intensity and resolution enhancement of sub-region of display wall, 2) information augmentation, and 3) \"stepping user interfaces\" for its viewers interacting with display wall.", "paper_title": "A flexible display by integrating a wall-size display and steerable projectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600003"}
