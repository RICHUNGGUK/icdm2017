Firstly, a sufficient condition for semi-discrete finite difference schemes to have independent dispersion and dissipation is derived. This condition enables a novel approach to separately optimize the dissipation and dispersion properties of finite difference schemes and a class of schemes with minimized dispersion and controllable dissipation is thus obtained. Secondly, for the purpose of shock-capturing, one of these schemes is used as the linear part of the WENO scheme with symmetrical stencils to constructed an improved WENO scheme. At last, the improved WENO scheme is blended with its linear counterpart to form a new hybrid scheme for practical applications. The proposed scheme is accurate, flexible and robust. The accuracy and resolution of the proposed scheme are tested by the solutions of several benchmark test cases. The performance of this scheme is further demonstrated by its application in the direct numerical simulation of compressible turbulent channel flow between isothermal walls. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
