Erten and Kobourov [C. Erten, S.G. Kobourov, Simultaneous embedding of a planar graph and its dual on the grid, Theory Computer Systems 38 (2005) 313-327] provided a linear time algorithm on simultaneous straight-line grid embedding of a 3-connected planar graph and its dual such that all the vertices are placed on grid points and each edge is drawn as one straight-line segment except for one which is drawn using two segments. Their drawing size is (2n - 2) x (2n - 2), where n is the total number of vertices in the graph and its dual. They raised an open question on whether there is a large class of planar graphs that allows this simultaneous straight-line grid embedding on a smaller grid. We answer this open question by giving a linear time simultaneous straight-line grid embedding algorithm for a 3-connected planar graph and its dual on a grid of size (n - 1) x n.
