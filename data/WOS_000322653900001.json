To deploy more service applications, the WSN must solve the internetworking problem (difference in speed, protocol stack, beacon collision etc.). In this study, we propose a redundant-path scheme based on a multichannel WSN for an efficient interworking among the heterogeneous networks. We evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme through a real-world simulation, and the results show an improvement in data throughput, packet delay, and beacon loss ratio.", "paper_title": "Redundant-Path Scheme for Efficient Interworking between a Wireless Sensor Network and the Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000322653900001"}
