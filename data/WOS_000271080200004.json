This permits the use of relaxation in the overall recursion relation that is not possible with previous formulations, resulting in accelerated convergence for slowly converging problems. Weighted least squares is introduced as a backward operator in an integral way that enhances the method. Means are described for determining starting points that assist the synthesis algorithm in avoiding so-called traps. The results obtained for a diverse selection of applications of the method are discussed. These demonstrate the effects on convergence of the use of relaxation, different pattern sampling angle selection schemes, and different starting point selection schemes.
