It has potential application in virtual reality, immersive, advanced visualization, and 3D television systems. However, due to imperfect depth maps and the illumination difference between reference images, annoying artifacts appear in the rendering image. To generate high-quality intermediate virtual viewpoint image, this paper proposes a novel virtual view rendering method based on DIBR. The proposed method consists of four main parts: luminance compensation based on histogram matching, isolated depth pixel removing, 3D warping with depth-based pixel interpolation, and background-based hole filling. Experimental results show that our method can obtain high-quality virtual view images and achieve satisfactory subjective visual effects.", "paper_title": "View generation with DIBR for 3D display system", "paper_id": "WOS:000361819200022"}
