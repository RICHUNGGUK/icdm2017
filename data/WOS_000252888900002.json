Conventional reconstruction algorithms, such as filtered backprojection, require many projections to obtain high quality reconstructions. If the object of interest is known in advance to consist of only a few different materials, corresponding to known image intensities, the use of this prior knowledge in the reconstruction procedure can dramatically reduce the number of required projections. In previous work we proposed a network flow algorithm for reconstructing a binary image defined on a lattice from its projections. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for the reconstruction of binary images that do not have an intrinsic lattice structure and are defined on a continuous domain, from a small number of their projections. Our algorithm relies on the fact that the problem of reconstructing an image from only two projections can be formulated as a network flow problem in a graph. We derive this formulation for parallel beam and fan beam tomography and show how it can be used to compute binary reconstructions from more than two projections. Our algorithm is capable of computing high quality reconstructions from very few projections. We evaluate its performance on both simulated and real experimental projection data and compare it to other reconstruction algorithms.", "paper_title": "A network flow algorithm for reconstructing binary images from continuous X-rays", "paper_id": "WOS:000252888900002"}
