Second, we apply them to search global minima of a continuous function, respectively. Meanwhile, the time evolution figures of the corresponding most positive Lyapunov exponent are given. Third, 10-city traveling salesman problem (TSP) is given to make a comparison between them. Finally we Conclude that the novel wavelet chaotic neural network is more valid.", "paper_title": "Wavelet chaotic neural networks and their application to optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000057"}
