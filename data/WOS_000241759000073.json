Impulsive controller is designed to attenuate effect of switching impulse. The RBF neural network is used to compensate adaptively for the unknown nonlinear part of switched impulsive systems, and the approximation error of RBF neural network is introduced to the adaptive law in order to improve the tracking attenuation quality of the switched impulsive systems. Under all admissible switching law, impulsive controller and adaptive neural network feedback controller can guarantee asymptotic stability of tracking error and improve disturbance attenuation level of tracking error for the overall switched impulsive system.", "paper_title": "H-infinity neural networks control for uncertain nonlinear switched impulsive systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000073"}
