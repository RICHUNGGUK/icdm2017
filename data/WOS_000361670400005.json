Nearly everybody has an intuitive understanding of what robustness means, but there is no proper way how to measure robustness of integrated circuits already during the design phase. Therefore, a general cross-layer robustness model and methods to quantitatively measure robustness are presented. Moreover, these methods are refined to predict the robustness against degradation of digital circuits due to aging effects.", "paper_title": "A Cross-Layer Approach to Measure the Robustness of Integrated Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000361670400005"}
