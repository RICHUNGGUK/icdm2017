Recent studies involving the non-invasive diagnosis of melanoma indicate that the concentrations of the two main classes of melanin present in the human skin, eumelanin and pheomelanin, can potentially be used in the computation of relevant features to differentiate these lesions. So, we describe how these features can be estimated using only standard camera images. Moreover, we demonstrate that using these features in conjunction with features based on the well known ABCD rule, it is possible to achieve 100% of sensitivity and more than 99% accuracy in melanocytic skin lesion discrimination, which is a highly desirable characteristic in a prescreening system.
