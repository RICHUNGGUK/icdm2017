An X-torus network is an enhancement of torus network by adding some crossing links. Hence, the distant nodes can be reached by using these links with fewer hops compared to the torus network. Comparisons with some popular networks such as 2D mesh, 2D torus and E-torus show that X-torus has shorter diameter, shorter average distance and larger bisection width. It also retains advantages such as symmetric structure, constant degree and scalability of the torus network. A simple distributed routing algorithm for X-torus network is also proposed, which identifies shortest path with only the address of the source and destination. In all, X-torus network is potentially an attractive interconnection network topology.", "paper_title": "X-torus: A variation of torus topology with lower diameter and larger bisection width", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900016"}
