Contrary to a natural expectation that these two types of equations should have incomparable expressive power, it is shown that equations with symmetric difference can express every recursive set by their unique solutions, every recursively enumerable set by their least solutions and every co-recursively-enumerable set by their greatest solutions. The solution existence problem is Pi(1)-complete, the existence of a unique, a least or a greatest solution is Pi(2)-complete, while the existence of finitely many solutions is Sigma(3)-complete.", "paper_title": "Language equations with symmetric difference", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200030"}
