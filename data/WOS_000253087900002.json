The method is based upon hybrid functions approximations. The properties of hybrid functions consisting of block-pulse functions and Legendre polynomials are presented. The operational matrices of integration and product are then utilized to reduce the solution of time-varying singular bilinear systems to the solution of algebraic equations. Illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the technique.", "paper_title": "Analysis of time-varying singular bilinear systems by hybrid functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000253087900002"}
