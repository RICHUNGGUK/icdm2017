Recently, remarkable progress has been made in bounding the expected optimization time of a simple evolutionary algorithm, called (1+1) EA, on the class of linear functions. We improve the previously best known bound in this setting from (1.39 + o(1))en ln n to en ln n + O(n) in expectation and with high probability, which is tight up to lower-order terms. Moreover, upper and lower bounds for arbitrary mutation probabilities p are derived, which imply expected polynomial optimization time as long as p = O((ln n)/n) and p = Omega(n(-C)) for a constant C > 0, and which are tight if p = c/n for a constant c > 0. As a consequence, the standard mutation probability p = 1/n is optimal for all linear functions, and the (1+1) EA is found to be an optimal mutation-based algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm turns out to be surprisingly robust since the large neighbourhood explored by the mutation operator does not disrupt the search.", "paper_title": "Tight Bounds on the Optimization Time of a Randomized Search Heuristic on Linear Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000314296400007"}
