Recently, a standalone prototype for virtual reality (VR)-based training in neonatal decision-making, called Virtual Delivery Room (VIDERO) was developed. This prototype enables a simple and time-efficient simulation of the arbitrary postnatal critical situations. The purpose behind this paper is twofold: to outline the role of trainee's immersion into VIDERO environment and to addresses the need for assessment and upgrading of training scenarios. In particular, the distributed services enabling fine-tuning of both virtual patient's behavioral model and trainee's interventions through the practice and user interactions in shared VE are described.
