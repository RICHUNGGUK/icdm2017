It comprises two wireless search technologies for the detection and localization of trapped or buried unconscious victims and auxiliary assisting technologies. Victims can be localized through their cellular phone (GSM) if it is active, but it might be out of order. Results detecting inactive phones are presented. However, with this technology a victim without cellular phone cannot be detected. In this case, a ground-penetrating, continuous wave radar can be used that is as well presented. A channel model for estimating signal disturbances in debris between victim and receiving antenna is proposed that aims at improving the accuracy of these technologies. Furthermore, the I-LOV system assists decision-makers by a mobile IT-system called FRIEDAA that allows gathering, processing, and representation of relevant information such as search results and personnel locations in real time. Therefore, infrastructure and inertial sensor based personal localization systems are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
