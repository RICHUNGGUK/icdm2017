Although the PLC effect increases the channel utilization, it results in an unfair channel access among the wireless nodes. In this paper, we propose a PLC-aware media access control (MAC) algorithm that employs the average waiting time as a common control reference. It enables the nodes to converge to a fair channel access by changing one of the IEEE 802.11 enhanced distributed channel access parameters: contention window, arbitration interframe space, or transmission opportunity. We then find multiple control references that meet the fair channel access constraint and obtain the near-optimal reference that maximizes the overall throughput. Through ns-2 simulations and real in-door experiments using the universal software radio peripheral platform, we evaluate the fairness and throughput performance of the PLC-aware MAC algorithm.", "paper_title": "Physical layer capture aware MAC for WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000316200400009"}
