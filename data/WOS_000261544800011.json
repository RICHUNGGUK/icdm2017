Applying the property of order statistics due to Malmquist, we can transform any conventional Type-II right censored sample of size r out of n from a uniform distribution to a complete sample of size r from a uniform distribution. This result is used to develop the proposed goodness-of-fit test procedure. The simulation studies reveal that the proposed approach provides as good or better overall power than the method of Michael & Schucany.", "paper_title": "A New Method for Goodness-of-Fit Testing Based on Type-II Right Censored Samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000261544800011"}
