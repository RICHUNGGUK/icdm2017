On the one hand, the framework allows us to control the shapes of the mesh triangles by applying simple averaging operations; on the other hand we can control the Hausdorff distance to some reference geometry by minimizing a quadratic energy. Due to the simplicity of this setup, the framework is efficient and easy to implement, yet it also constitutes an effective and versatile tool with a variety of possible applications. In particular, we use it to reduce the texture distortion in animated mesh sequences, to improve the results of cross-parameterizations, and to minimize the distance between meshes and their remeshes.", "paper_title": "Mesh massage - A versatile mesh optimization framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000257384800033"}
