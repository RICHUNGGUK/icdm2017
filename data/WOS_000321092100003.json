Our technique reconstructs 3D velocity vectors from registered multiple standard 3D colour Doppler views, each of which contains a 1D projection of the blood velocity. Reconstruction is based on a scalable patch-wise Least Mean Squares approach, and a continuous velocity field is achieved by using a B-spline grid. We carry out a sensitivity analysis of clinically relevant parameters which affect the accuracy of the reconstruction, including the impact of noise, view angles and registration errors, using simulated data. A realistic simulation framework is achieved by a novel noise model to represent variations in colour Doppler images based on multiscale additive Gaussian noise. Simulations show that, if the Target Registration Error <2.5 mm, view angles are >20 degrees and the standard deviation of noise in the input data is <10 cm/s, the reconstructed velocity field presents visually plausible flow patterns and mean error in flow rate is approximately 10% compared to 2D + t Flow MAI. These results are verified by reconstructing 3D velocity on three healthy volunteers. The technique is applied to reconstruct 3D flow on three paediatric patients showing promising results for clinical application. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
