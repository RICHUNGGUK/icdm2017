We show that the question whether a second-order generalized quantifier Q(1) is definable in terms of another quantifier Q(2), the base logic being monadic second-order logic, reduces to the question if a quantifier Q(1)(star) is definable in FO(Q(2)(star), <, +, x) for certain first-order quantifiers Q(1)(star) and Q(2)(star). We use our characterization to show new definability and non-definability results for second-order generalized quantifiers. We also show that the monadic second-order majority quantifier Mose(1) is not definable in second-order logic. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
