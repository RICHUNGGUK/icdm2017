The idle power dissipation is reduced to 800 nW by using a novel output voltage detector (OVD) which is insensitive to temperature variation and process deviation. Furthermore, a constant on-time (COT)-based hysteretic burst mode controller with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is developed to ensure high power efficiency for a wide input voltage range. After startup, the input voltage can be set as low as 30 mV. The whole system is designed and fabricated in SMIC 0.18 mu m CMOS process, the end-to-end power efficiency of this converter can reach 49% at 350 mV input voltage and 65% at 750 mV input voltage.", "paper_title": "ULTRA-LOW POWER BOOST CONVERTER WITH CONSTANT ON-TIME-BASED MPPT FOR ENERGY HARVESTING APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000332115500012"}
