However, current solutions are proposed respectively on one of these two aspects. By integrating E-connection into extended fuzzy description logics (EFDLs), this paper proposes a novel logical approach distributed EFDLs (DEFDLs) to couple both fuzzy and distributed features within description logics. In DEFDLs, cut links are introduced to describe fuzzy relations among various fuzzy areas, hence connecting distributed EFDLs knowledge bases to construct a global DEFDLs knowledge base. We make a primitive discussion about reasoning issues within DEFDLs, where some current fuzzy reasoning technique can be reused in restricted DEFDLs knowledge bases.", "paper_title": "A distributed and fuzzy extension of description logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000079"}
