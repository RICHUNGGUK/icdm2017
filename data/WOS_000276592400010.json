In this paper, we present a methodology to determine a set of 'core classes' by using a range of techniques to reach consensus across several different clustering algorithms, and to ascertain the key characteristics of these classes. We apply the methodology to immunohistochemical data from breast cancer patients. In doing so, we identify six core classes, of which several may be novel sub-groups not previously emphasised in literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
