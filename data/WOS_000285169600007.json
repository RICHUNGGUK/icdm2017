Our analysis is based on whatever limited collection of preferences we may assert between attribute collections. In this paper we introduce three methods to assess the robustness of our selected decision. Two of these use the metric generated by the weights of the boundary linear utility. The third applies directly to the space of trade-off parameters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
