This allows the traditional power grid to become more reliable, resilient, and efficient. Despite such a widespread deployment, it is still not clear which communication technology solutions are the best fit to support grid applications. This is because different smart grid applications have different network requirements - in terms of data payloads, sampling rates, latency and reliability. Based on a variety of smart grid use cases and selected standards, this paper compiles information about different communication network requirements for different smart grid applications, ranging from those used in a Home Area Network (HAN), Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) and Wide-Area Network (WAN). Communication technologies used to support implementation of selected smart grid projects are also discussed. This paper is expected to serve as a comprehensive database of technology requirements and best practices for use by communication engineers when designing a smart grid network.
