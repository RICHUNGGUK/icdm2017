Although there are algorithms for computing the upper entropy for the particular cases of credal sets associated to belief functions and probability intervals, there is none for a more general model. In this paper, we shall present an algorithm to obtain the upper entropy for order-2 capacities. Our algorithm is an extension of the one presented for belief functions, and proofs of correctness are provided. By using a counterexample, we shall also prove that this algorithm is not valid for general lower probabilities as it computes a value which is strictly greater than the maximum of entropy.", "paper_title": "An algorithm to compute the upper entropy for order-2 capacities", "paper_id": "WOS:000237295000001"}
