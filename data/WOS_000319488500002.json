The basic idea of this approach is to adopt two components of Hadoop, HBase and MapReduce, to manage web services. In HBase, we establish an HBase table based on request interface, and design a non-functional property index mechanism based on qualify of service tree to discover web services. In MapReduce, we employ it to search optimal web services to satisfy users' complex web service composition requirement. Experimental results show that our proposed approach can efficiently perform web service discovery and composition for larger scale web service management.", "paper_title": "A Hadoop-based approach for efficient web service management", "paper_id": "WOS:000319488500002"}
