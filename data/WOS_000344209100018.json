In this paper, an Atanassov's interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy outranking choice method is presented to solve MCGDM problems. We first propose an entropy measure for Atanassov's interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (AIVIFS) and establish an entropy weight model, which is then used to determine the objective criteria weights of the alternatives, and then we extend the Electre I method to take account of the decision makers' Atanassov's interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number (AIVIFN) assessment information. Based on a graphical representation of the outranking relations, a superiority index and a. global superiority index are defined, and then used to choose an optimal alternative or the best non-inferior alternative(s) in the group decision making process. Finally, we give an illustration of the proposed method using a practical supplier selection example, and then compare this method with other current methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
