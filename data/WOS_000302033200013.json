By means of simulation studies, this novel method is compared to another locally-adaptive estimation technique for multidimensional functional data, based on free-knot regression splines. This comparison shows that the proposed method is particularly attractive when the curves to be estimated present strongly localized features. The multidimensional wavelet estimation method is thus applied to multi-lead electrocardiogram records, where strongly localized features are indeed expected. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
