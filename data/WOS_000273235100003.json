The kinematic control concept presented in the paper is the Vector Field Orientation (VFO) feedback approach with a nonlinear feed-forward skid-slip influence compensation scheme. The VFO control law guarantees asymptotic convergence of the position tracking error to zero in spite of the disturbing influence of skid-slip phenomena. The paper includes a control law design description, stability and convergence analysis of a closed-loop system, and practical verification of the proposed control concept. The experimental results illustrate control quality obtained on a laboratory setup equipped with vision feedback, where the Kalman filter algorithm was used in order to practically estimate skid-slip components.", "paper_title": "TRAJECTORY TRACKING FOR A MOBILE ROBOT WITH SKID-SLIP COMPENSATION IN THE VECTOR-FIELD-ORIENTATION CONTROL SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000273235100003"}
