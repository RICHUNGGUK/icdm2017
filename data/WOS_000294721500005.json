But UDP can not represent the nonlinear space well because it is a linear method in nature. Kernel methods can otherwise discover the nonlinear structure of the images. To improve the performance of UDP, kernel UDP (a nonlinear vision of UDP) is proposed for face feature extraction and face recognition via kernel tricks in this paper. We formulate the kernel UDP theory and develop a two-stage method to extract kernel UDP features: namely weighted Kernel PCA plus UDP. The experimental results on the FERET and ORL databases show that the proposed kernel UDP is effective.", "paper_title": "Face Recognition Using Kernel UDP", "paper_id": "WOS:000294721500005"}
