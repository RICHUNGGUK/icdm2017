The implementation is based on the Finite-Difference Time-Domain method for transient analysis, and the Finite Element Method for electrostatics. Both methods share the same core and are optimized for CPU and GPU computing. To illustrate its running, FEM method is applied for solving Laplace's equation analyzing the relation between surface curvature and electrostatic potential of a long cylindrical conductor, whereas FDTD is applied for analyzing Thin Film Filters at optical wavelengths. Furthermore, a comparison of the performance of both CPU and GPU versions is analyzed as a function of the grid size simulation. This approach allows the study of a wide range of electromagnetic problems taking advantage of the benefits of each numerical method and the computing power of the modern CPUs and GPUs.", "paper_title": "Development of a unified FDTD-FEM library for electromagnetic analysis with CPU and GPU computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000316408500004"}
