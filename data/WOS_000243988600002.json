Thus, providing segmented masks for moving objects is suggested. Several researchers have employed automatic segmentation methods to produce moving object masks. Based on these masks, they used a reliability-based blending strategy to generate sprites. Since perfect segmentation is impossible, some ghost-like shadows will appear in the generated sprite. To treat this problem, in this paper, an intelligent blending strategy without needing segmentation masks is proposed. It is based on the fact that for each point in the generated sprite, the corresponding pixels in most frames belong to background and only few belong to moving objects. A counting schema is provided to make only background points participate in average blending. The experimental result shows that the visual quality of the generated sprite using the proposed blending strategy is close to that using manually segmented masks and is better than that generated by Lu-Gao-Wu method. No ghostlike shadows are produced. Furthermore, a uniform feature point extraction method is proposed to increase the precision of global motion estimation, the effectiveness of this part is presented by showing the comparison results with other existing method.", "paper_title": "A high visual quality sprite generator using intelligent blending without segmentation masks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243988600002"}
