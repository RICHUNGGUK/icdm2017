The details for the derivation of difference relations at boundaries to generate accurate and stable solutions are also given. To assess the numerical accuracy, two linear prototype test problems with known exact solution are used. The two-dimensional planar and cylindrical lock-exchange flow configurations are used to conduct the numerical experiments for the Boussinesq equations. Quantitative measures for the two linear prototype test problems and comparison of the results of this work with the published results for the planar lock-exchange flow indicates the validity and accuracy of the three-point fourth-order compact scheme for numerical solution of two-dimensional incompressible Boussinesq equations. In addition, the study of using different high-order numerical boundary conditions for the implementation of the no-penetration boundary condition for the density at no-slip walls is considered. It is shown that the numerical solution is sensitive to the choice of difference relation for the density at boundaries and using an inappropriate difference relation leads to spurious numerical solution.
