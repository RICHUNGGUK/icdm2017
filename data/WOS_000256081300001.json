The wavelet packet transform (WPT) is exploited to decompose the four-class motion EMG signals to the non-overlapped sub-bands and the energy characteristic of each sub-band is adopted to form the original feature set. In order to reduce the computation complexity, the RST is utilized to get the reduction feature set without compromising classification accuracy. In the feature reduction phase, cluster separation index (CSI) is introduced to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. In the sequel, the Fuzzy LS-SVM is constructed for the multi-class classification task. The RST-based feature selection is independent of the classifier design. Consequently the classification performance will vary with different classifiers. We make the comparison between the proposed classification scheme and the commonly used classification scheme, such as the combination of the principal component analysis (PCA)-based feature selection and the neural network (NN) classifier. The results of comparative experiments show that the diverse motions can be identified with high accuracy by the proposed scheme. Compared with other feature extraction and selection algorithms and classifiers, superior performance of the proposed classification scheme illustrates the potential of the SVM techniques combined with WPT and RST in EMG motion classification.", "paper_title": "Joint application of rough set-based feature reduction and Fuzzy LS-SVM classifier in motion classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000256081300001"}
