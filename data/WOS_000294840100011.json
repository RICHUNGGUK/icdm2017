We prove that Bosbach states, Riec. an states and state-morphisms are equivalent on linearly ordered IMTL-algebras. Furthermore, we investigate the existence of states on finite linearly ordered IMTL-algebra and prove that if L is locally finite, then L has a state if and only if L is an MV-algebra, and that if L is peculiar and H(L) boolean OR {0; 1} is a subalgebra of L, then L has a state if and only if ord(n) = vertical bar H(L)vertical bar + 1, where H(L) = {x is an element of L vertical bar ord(x) < infinity, ord((sic)x) <infinity; n = max H(L).", "paper_title": "States on finite linearly ordered IMTL-algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000294840100011"}
