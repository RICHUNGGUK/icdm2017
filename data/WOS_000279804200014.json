The user only needs to authenticate to one of the IdPs and the SP is given an overall level of assurance (LoA) about the authenticity of the user and his/her attributes. The model employs a new component called a Linking Service (LS), which is a trusted third party under the control of the user, whose purpose is to link together the different IdP accounts that hold a user's attributes, along with their respective LoAs. There are several possible interaction models for communications between the IdPs, the SP, LSs and the user, and each is described. The model is underpinned with a fully specified trust model, which also describes the implications when participants do not fully trust each other as required. Finally, the paper describes how the model has been implemented by mapping onto existing standard protocols based on SAMLv2. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
