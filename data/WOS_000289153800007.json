The bath noise can be separated in an adiabatic (low-frequency) and in a quantum (high-frequency) part. We point out the qualitative different effects on quantum nonlocal correlations induced by adiabatic and quantum noise. A quantitative analysis is performed for typical noise figures in Josephson systems. Finally we compare, for this system, the dynamics of nonlocal correlations and of entanglement.", "paper_title": "DECAY OF NONLOCALITY DUE TO ADIABATIC AND QUANTUM NOISE IN THE SOLID STATE", "paper_id": "WOS:000289153800007"}
