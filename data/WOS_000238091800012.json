The 1.5-approximation algorithm for sorting permutation by transpositions has time complexity O(n(3/2) root logn). By the permutation tree, we can improve this algorithm to achieve time complexity O(nlogn). We can also improve the algorithm for sorting permutation by block interchanges to make its time complexity from O(n(2)) down to O(nlogn).", "paper_title": "Faster algorithms for sorting by transpositions and sorting by block-interchanges", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800012"}
