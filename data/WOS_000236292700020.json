To work efficiently in this environment, the capabilities to simplify the portions of an assembly and to reset it to the original resolution should be added to the current CAD systems. Thus operators realizing multi-resolution on B-rep were proposed in previous work. This paper illustrates a prototype multi-resolution system to integrate the proposed operators and its applications. The multi-resolution system can be used in similarity comparisons to reduce the calculation load and to get the full comparison result in the overall shape. Then the features recognized with this system can be used in more detailed comparisons. This system also can be used conceptually to solve security problems in collaborative design.", "paper_title": "Modeling in multi-resolution and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000236292700020"}
