The analysis contains both plain Impulse Radio UWB (IR-UWB) and Transmitted Reference UWB (TR-UWB) systems as a source of interference. The supposed victim is a narrowband BPSK system with a band-pass filter. The effect of pulse-based UWB systems is analyzed in terms of bit error rate. The analysis is given in terms of the specific combinations of pulse repetition frequency and center frequency of the narrowband bandpass filter. In those situations, the UWB interference cannot be modeled as a Gaussian noise. It also manifests situations in which the victim is under the severest or the slightest interference from TR-UWB. According to its result, the analysis is validated via simulation.", "paper_title": "Analysis on IR/TR-UWB Interference against Narrowband Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078600007"}
