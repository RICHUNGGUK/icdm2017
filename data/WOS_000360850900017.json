Au and Pt atoms were described with the double-zeta valence basis set Los Alamos National Laboratory 2-double-z (LanL2DZ), whereas the standard 6-311++ G(d, p) basis set was employed for the C and O atoms. Our theoretical model showed that (1) after coordination to Au and Au-Pt cluster, O-2 and CO are apparently activated, and Mulliken charges show that the gold atoms in the active sites of Au11 are negatively charged; (2) Au-Pt clusters with 11 atoms can effectively catalyze the oxidation of CO by O-2; (3) Au-11 exhibits good catalytic performance for the oxidation of CO; (4) oxidation of CO occurs preferably on the Au-Pt active sites in Pt-doped clusters, and the single-center mechanisms are more favorable energetically than the two-center mechanisms; (5) after adsorption, an O-2 molecule oxidates two CO molecules via stepwise mechanisms; and (6) the catalytic processes are highly exothermic.", "paper_title": "Catalytic mechanisms of Au-11 and Au11-nPtn (n=1-2) clusters: a DFT investigation on the oxidation of CO by O-2", "paper_id": "WOS:000360850900017"}
