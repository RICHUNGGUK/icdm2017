The proposed algorithm uses a learning automaton to specify the acceptance/rejection of incoming new calls. It is shown that the given adaptive algorithm converges to an equilibrium point which is also optimal for uniform fractional channel policy. To study the performance of the proposed call admission policy, the computer simulations are conducted. The simulation results show that the level of QoS is satisfied by the proposed algorithm and the performance of given algorithm is very close to the performance of uniform fractional guard channel policy which needs to know all parameters of input traffic. The simulation results also confirm the analysis of the steady-state behaviour.", "paper_title": "A learning automata-based adaptive uniform fractional guard channel algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000350868400006"}
