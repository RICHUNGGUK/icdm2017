The MOED procedure is a natural approach for facing multiobjective problems where several requirements and specifications need to be fulfilled. An algorithm based on the differential evolution technique and spherical pruning is used for this purpose. To evaluate the methodology, a multivariable control benchmark is used. The obtained results validate the MOED procedure as a practical and useful technique for parametric controller tuning in multivariable processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
