For the purpose of bridging business modelling in build-time and application configuration in runtime seamlessly, a Conceptual Ontology-based Resource meta-Model (CORM) is proposed. Firstly, a resource meta-model is built as a referred model to describe business elements and relationships. Then, by means of ontology, these business elements are transformed into IT service-oriented components such as SOAP services, REST-ful services and BPEL files. Referring to Model-View-Controller pattern, these service components are then configured in a runtime supported environment. Next, a state space defined by a resource array is built as the control mechanism to realize a completed IT system. Finally, a CORM-based supported Platform is built to support business modelling, service transformation and system configuration. The research indicates a new approach to develop and implement enterprise information systems in a more flexible and configurable way.", "paper_title": "A Conceptual Ontology-based Resource Meta-Model towards Business-driven Information System Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000313207000008"}
