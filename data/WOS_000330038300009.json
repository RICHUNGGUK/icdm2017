It is shown that any mixed-integer quadratic program with linear constraints can be reduced to the minimisation of a linear function over a face of a set in the family. Some fundamental properties of the convex sets are derived, along with connections to some other well-studied convex sets. Several classes of valid and facet-inducing inequalities are also derived.", "paper_title": "Unbounded convex sets for non-convex mixed-integer quadratic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000330038300009"}
