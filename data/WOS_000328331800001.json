This technique uses a microring resonator made of nonlinear fibre optics to generate the desired results, which are applicable to Internet security and quantum network cryptography. A modified add/drop interferometer system called PANDA is proposed, which consists of a centred ring resonator connected to smaller ring resonators on the left side. To form the multifunction operations of the PANDA systemfor instance, to control, tune and amplifyan additional Gaussian pulse is introduced into the add port of the system. The optical tweezers generated by the dark soliton propagating inside the PANDA ring resonator system are in the form of potential wells. Potential well output can be connected to the quantum signal processing system, which consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter is used to generate high-capacity quantum codes within the system, whereas the receiver detects encoded signals known as quantum bits. Therefore, an entangled photon pair can be generated and propagated via an optical communication link such as a time division multiple access system. Here, narrower potential wells with a full-width half-maximum of 3.58 and 9.57nm are generated at the through and drop ports of the PANDA ring resonator system, respectively, where the amplification of the signals occurs during propagation inside the system.
