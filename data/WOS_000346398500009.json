Furthermore, the regression coefficient values are expressed in the atom-coloring method. That is, the fragments and atoms are colored by the signs and values of the regression coefficients. Both computational and medicinal chemists make cooperatively molecular design using the common language of chemical structures and atom colors. In this paper, we examined the possibility of the clear chemical interpretation using the human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters inhibitory data set. The full data set was generated using the pair-wise kernel regression method. The generated score matrix was analyzed by the ECFP_6 fingerprints and the z-scales derived from the chemical structures and the amino acid residues in the active sites of human ABC transporters. The result of atom-coloring for predictive chemical parts of an inhibitor was examined by the human ABCB1 transporter homology model based on the mouse X-ray crystal structure. It was well matched to strong hydrophobic sites within the active site. The originality of this paper has two folds: the regression coefficients in the OLPLS model are expressed by the atom-coloring method and the chemical interpretation for inhibitors is rigorously validated by the human ABC transporter homology model.
