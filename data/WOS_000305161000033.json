Moreover, this paper proposes a robust adaptive control (RAC) system for brushless DC (BLDC) motors using a fuzzy CMAC (FCMAC). The proposed RAC system is composed of an FCMAC and a robust controller. The FCMAC is developed to serve as the main controller and the robust controller is designed to attenuate the effect of the approximation error between the FCMAC and an ideal controller. The developed RAC system is implemented in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip to control a BLDC motor in a real-time mode. Using an FPGA to implement an FCMAC for real-time control systems is also a novel approach. For comparison, an adaptive CMAC-based supervisory control, a robust adaptive fuzzy control and the proposed RAC are employed to control a BLDC motor. The experimental results verify that the proposed RAC can achieve better tracking performance than the other control methods.", "paper_title": "FPGA-BASED ROBUST ADAPTIVE CONTROL OF BLDC MOTORS USING FUZZY CEREBELLAR MODAL ARTICULATION CONTROLLER", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161000033"}
