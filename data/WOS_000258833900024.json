In the real world of SCM, however, there are normally several echelons which need to be integrated into inventory management. This paper presents a hybrid intelligent algorithm, based on the push SCM, which uses a fuzzy neural network and a genetic algorithm to forecast the rate of demand, determine the material planning and select the optimal supplier. We test the proposed algorithm in a case study conducted in Iran. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
