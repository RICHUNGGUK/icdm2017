Their architecture and representation formalisms are the groundwork of today's systems. The knowledge is usually derived from expertise in specific areas and has to be validated according to a different methodology than is used in conventional systems because the knowledge is symbolic. This paper describes the design, definition and evaluation of a knowledge-based system using the CommonKADS (CKADS) methodology to formally represent contextual information for the Appear platform. We also evaluate the context-aware information system from the user's point of view using a U2E system and also validate it through a simulated example in a realistic environment: an airport domain, which is a significant step towards formally building KBS applications.
