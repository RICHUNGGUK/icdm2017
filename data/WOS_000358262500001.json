Under fairly general assumptions, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis, where all parameters required for the execution of the methods depend only on the underlying infinite-dimensional problem, but not on a concrete discretization. Under certain assumptions on the rates for the involved low-rank approximations and basis expansions, we can also give bounds on the computational complexity of the iteration as a function of the prescribed target error. Our theoretical findings are illustrated and supported by computational experiments. These demonstrate that problems in very high dimensions can be treated with controlled solution accuracy.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Near-Optimal Rank Tensor Approximation for High-Dimensional Operator Equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000358262500001"}
