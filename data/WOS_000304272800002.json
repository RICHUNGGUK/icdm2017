The sample space of a composition is the simplex, and the sample space of two compositions, a bicomposition, is a Cartesian product of two simplices. We present a way of generating random variates from a bicompositional Dirichlet distribution defined on the Cartesian product of two simplices using the rejection method. We derive a general solution for finding a dominating density function and a rejection constant and also compare this solution to using a uniform dominating density function. Finally, some examples of generated bicompositional random variates, with varying number of components, are presented.", "paper_title": "Generating random variates from a bicompositional Dirichlet distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000304272800002"}
