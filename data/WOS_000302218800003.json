This paper outlines the development of a microscopic sign management simulation that facilitates predicting an agency's level of compliance with the standards and determining the cost of compliance. Using the Arena simulation software, the authors built a model in which each sign was represented as a separate entity and moved through a network of submodels replicating the management and environmental processes experienced annually. The simulation includes submodels for sign damage, inspection, replacement, and deterioration that are modifiable by key input parameters. The simulation model produces several key estimates on an annual basis for the purpose of comparing different sign management scenarios. The resulting model was validated and used to evaluate a scenario representing management conditions in North Carolina. However, the authors designed the model to be applicable to the needs of most highway agencies. The development of the model reported in this study further revealed the intricacies and dependencies involved in sign management. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000126.
