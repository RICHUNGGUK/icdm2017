We first investigate the problem's structural properties and derive analytically the optimal joint stocking and pricing decisions. We then explore the difference between the optimal decisions under the VaR formulation and the classical expected profit-maximization model. Finally, we reveal an interesting analytical relationship between the inventory service level and the VaR measure.
