In this algorithm, the TXOP Duration for each Traffic Stream (TS) is determined by the number (N) of packets to be transmitted during a TXOP duration, which is found by analyzing M/D-N/1/N x iota queueing system where the delay bound of the TS is iota times the Service Interval having D length. Numerical results show that the number of admitted TSs with guaranteed loss probability by new method is greater than the number of admitted TSs by other known schemes.", "paper_title": "An admission control and TXOP duration of VBR traffics in IEEE 802.11e HCCA with guaranteed delay and loss", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762400017"}
