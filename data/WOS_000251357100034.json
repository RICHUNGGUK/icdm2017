The majority of the previous work was rooted at the use of a single image-to-image mapping termed planar homography for representing the imaged scene. However, the mapping is applicable only to cases where the imaged scene is either a single planar surface, or very distant from the cameras, or imaged under a pure rotation of the camera, and that greatly limits the range of applications of the mosaicking methods. This paper presents a novel mosaicking solution for scenes that are polyhedral (thus consisting of multiple surfaces) and that are pictured possibly in closed range of the camera. The solution has two major advantages. First, it requires only a few correspondences over the entire scene, not correspondences over every surface patch in it to work. Second, it conquers a seemingly impossible task-warping image data of surfaces that are visible in only one of the input images, which we refer to as the singly visible surfaces, to another viewpoint to constitute the mosaic there. We also provide a detail analysis of what determines whether a singly visible surface could be mosaicked or not. Experimental results on real image data are presented to illustrate the performance of the method. (C) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
