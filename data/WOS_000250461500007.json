The oscillation frequencies are 5.2 and 3.3 GHz. These circuits have been produced using CMOS/SOI technology, with body voltage to control power consumption and phase noise performance. A new architecture for multi-standard applications is proposed. Five standards are covered by these structures: GSM (900 MHz), GPS (1.5 GHz), DCS (1.8 GHz), Bluetooth (2.45 GHz) and 802.11 a (5.8 GHz). The tuning range can vary from 2.45 to 5.8 GHz for the first VCO and from 850 MHz to 1.9 GHz for the second by using frequency divider. The main idea is to use only two MOS varactors to cover the entire frequency span. The first one is needed to get the matched frequency variation and the second to adjust the oscillation frequency. Such VCOs can be made thanks to CMOS/SOI technology advantages, high-Q passives and body voltage biasing that allow current change and power dissipation in the VCO core. These circuits were produced with a view to producing a single VCO covering all these standards. Switched resonators were therefore studied. At a frequency offset of 100 kHz, the single side band phase noise measurements were -89 and -93 dBc/Hz at 5.2 and 3.6 GHz respectively.", "paper_title": "Fully integrated dual-band VCOs with power controlled by body voltage in 130 nm CMOS/SOI for multi-standard applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000250461500007"}
