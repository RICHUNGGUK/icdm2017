Integrated monitoring, analysis, and control methodologies can reduce this by up to 30%. However, the adoption of monitoring and control systems for building management and control applications is hampered by the unavailability of appropriate tool environments. In this paper a model-driven holistic system architecture integrating IT systems at design, construction, and operation stages of buildings is presented to provide optimized building operations. The main aim is to create a holistic environment for wireless embedded monitoring and control systems to increase the efficiency of the overall system development process and to exploit their potential for reduction of building energy consumption. To reach this objective, new methods, tools, and hardware covering integrated design, energy simulation models, and data warehouse technologies are introduced. The developed system, which is explained in this work, is applied in a residential building of the Turkish Prime Ministry Housing Development Administration in Istanbul, Turkey, and the results are elaborated to improve current building conditions.", "paper_title": "Integrated System Platform for Energy Efficient Building Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000344004300004"}
