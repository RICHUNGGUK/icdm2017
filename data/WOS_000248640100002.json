The validity of this full-band k - p-method is discussed as well as the convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors with respect to basis set and k-mesh, with applications to the semiconductor ZnO and the metal Al. Moreover, the accuracy of the FPLAPW + k - p-method for computing the band structure and the dielectric function is demonstrated for the more complex materials YBa2Cu3O7 and poly(paraphenylene). For these structures, the full-band k - p-approach reduces the computational time by as much as 90%.
