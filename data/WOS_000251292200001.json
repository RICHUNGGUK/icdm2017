The conventional matrix-implicit Krylov subspace technique with the block-diagonal (BD) preconditioner has made it possible to compute the steady-state responses of large-scale circuits. However, not all HB problems, particularly strongly nonlinear circuit problems, can be solved reliably or efficiently using the standard BD-preconditioning technique. In this paper, hierarchical HB methods are proposed wherein robust preconditioning is provided via solution of a set of approximate linearized HB problems of progressively smaller size across multiple levels of the problem hierarchy. These subproblems are constructed using the same matrix-implicit formulation to retain the memory efficiency of Krylov subspace methods. Moreover, the number of allocated Krylov subspace matrix solvers, hence the memory usage, is significantly reduced via a recently introduced solver-sharing technique. The efficiency of our hierarchical preconditioning technique is further improved by adopting a one-step correction to the standard BD preconditioner and a multigrid-motivated iterative scheme. It has been shown that the proposed approaches can achieve up to 10 x runtime speedup over the popular BID preconditioner and robust convergence even for strongly nonlinear circuits for which the BD preconditioner fails to converge.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical hannonic-balance methods for frequency-domain analog-circuit analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000251292200001"}
