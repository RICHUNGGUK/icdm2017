While short-circuit evaluations may occur in program executions, treating predicates as atomic units ignores this fact, masking out various types of useful statistics on dynamic program behavior. In this paper. we differentiate the short-circuit evaluations of individual predicates on individual program statements, producing one set of evaluation sequences per predicate. We then investigate experimentally the effectiveness of using these sequences to locate faults by comparing existing predicate-based techniques with and without such differentiation. We use both the Siemens program suite and four real-life UNIX utility programs as our subjects. The experimental results show that the proposed use of short-circuit evaluations can, on average, improve predicate-based statistical fault-localization techniques while incurring relatively small performance overhead.
