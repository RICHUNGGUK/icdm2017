The formulation of the SIS is based on ideas developed in the context of indicator-based risk modeling for concrete structures subject to corrosion and geographical information system based risk modeling concerning large-scale risk management. The term risk management here refers in particular to the process of condition assessment and optimization of the inspection and repair activities. The SIS facilitates the storage and handling of all relevant information to the risk management. The probabilistic modeling utilized in the condition assessment takes basis in a Bayesian hierarchical modeling philosophy. It facilitates the updating of risks as well as optimizing inspection plans whenever new information about the condition of the structure becomes available. In the SIS, the various data of relevance for the risk management can be visualized in three dimensions. This feature and the other functionalities of the SIS are illustrated in an example considering the Danish Faro bridges.", "paper_title": "Risk Management of Large RC Structures within Spatial Information System", "paper_id": "WOS:000304902800001"}
