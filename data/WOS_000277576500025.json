In terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, some improved delay-dependent conditions are presented to ensure the considered system to be regular, impulse free and exponentially stable via an augmented Lyapunov functional and tighter integral inequalities. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and the benefits of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "DELAY-DEPENDENT ROBUST EXPONENTIAL STABILITY OF UNCERTAIN SINGULAR SYSTEMS WITH TIME DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500025"}
