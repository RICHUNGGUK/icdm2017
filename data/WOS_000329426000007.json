In this system framework, the fractal-specific characteristic of inter-enterprise machining quality control function was analysed, and the model of inter-enterprise machining quality control was constructed by the nature of fractal structures. Furthermore, the goal-driven strategy of inter-enterprise quality control and the dynamic organisation strategy of inter-enterprise quality improvement were constructed by the characteristic analysis on this model. In addition, the architecture of inter-enterprise machining quality control based on fractal was established by means of Web service. Finally, a case study for application was presented. The result showed that the proposed method was available, and could provide guidance for quality control and support for product reliability in inter-enterprise machining processes.", "paper_title": "A system framework of inter-enterprise machining quality control based on fractal theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000329426000007"}
