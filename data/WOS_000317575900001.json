Numerous approaches have been proposed for the optimization of either mass or heat exchange networks. Since the process usage of mass and heat is typically intertwined, it is important to account for such interactions. The objective of this paper is to introduce a systematic method for the simultaneous synthesis of combined mass-and heat-exchange networks (CMAHENs). The proposed method is based on a novel approach that incorporates the mass pinch technology (MPT) for mass exchange networks (MENs) synthesis and the pseudo-T-H diagram approach (PTHDA) for the heat exchange networks (HENs) synthesis. New bypass streams are included in the structural representation of the problem to expand the search space. A combined optimization approach is applied to minimize the total annualized cost of the CMAHEN. Finally, two cases are solved to illustrate the application of the proposed method.
