In this paper, we propose an algorithm in which the size of working set is reduced to one in order to obtain a faster training speed. Instead of the complex heuristic criteria, the random order for selecting the elements into the working set is adopted. The proposed algorithm shows a better performance in linear SVM training, especially in the large-scale scenario.", "paper_title": "The coordinate descent method with stochastic optimization for linear support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000319769300002"}
