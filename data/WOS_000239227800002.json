Although they have been widely applied to solve combinatorial optimization problems, there are also extensions that work with continuous variables. In this paper [this paper is an extended version of delaOssa et al. Initial approaches to the application of islands-based parellel EDAs in continuous domains, in: Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPP 2005 Workshops), Oslo, 2005, pp. 580-587] we focus on the solution of the latter by means of island models. Besides evaluating the performance of traditional island models when applied to EDAs, our main goal consists in achieving some insight about the behavior and benefits of the migration of probability models that this framework allow.
