It is very hard to identify AKAPs peptides binding to PKA due to the high sequence diversity of AKAPs. Results: We propose a hierarchical and efficient approach, which combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, free energy calculations, virtual mutagenesis (VM) and bioinformatics analyses, to predict peptides binding to the PKA RII alpha regulatory subunit in the human proteome systematically. Our approach successfully retrieved 15 out of 18 documented RII alpha-binding peptides. Literature curation supported that many newly predicted peptides might be true AKAPs. Here, we present the first systematic search for AKAP peptides in the human proteome, which is useful to further experimental identification of AKAPs and functional analysis of their biological roles.", "paper_title": "Prediction of peptides binding to the PKA RII alpha subunit using a hierarchical strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000291752600060"}
