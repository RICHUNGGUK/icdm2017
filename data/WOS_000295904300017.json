From a more practical standpoint, pattern formation problems provide a first step towards more complicated cooperative tasks. In this paper, we investigate the nearest-and-farthest neighboring rule in continuous time, a distributed strategy for a group of anonymous homogeneous point agents to achieve a regular generalized Reuleaux polygon (a circle or a Reuleaux polygon). The algorithm results in a mathematical model of switched system, in which measurement uncertainties of the agents are also taken into account. We prove the global convergence of distributed point agents to the circumference of a regular generalized Reuleaux polygon with a desired diameter and predict the effect of parameter choices on the precise geometric pattern.", "paper_title": "REACH GENERALIZED REULEAUX POLYGON FORMATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000295904300017"}
