Eight standard datasets including five classification and three function-approximation datasets are utilized to benchmark the performance of the proposed method. For verification, the results are compared with some of the most well-known evolutionary trainers: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Evolution Strategy (ES), and Population-based Incremental Learning (PBIL). The statistical results prove the GWO algorithm is able to provide very competitive results in terms of improved local optima avoidance. The results also demonstrate a high level of accuracy in classification and approximation of the proposed trainer.", "paper_title": "How effective is the Grey Wolf optimizer in training multi-layer perceptrons", "paper_id": "WOS:000355619500010"}
