Among the case study results are that one ATCA crate can provide a computation capability equivalent to hundreds of commodity PCs for Hades online particle track reconstruction and Cherenkov ring recognition.", "paper_title": "A High-End Reconfigurable Computation Platform for Nuclear and Particle Physics Experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000288053300006"}
