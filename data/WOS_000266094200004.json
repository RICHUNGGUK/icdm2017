The method adopts fuzzy c-means clustering to identify the structure. Based on clustering, the original input/output space is divided into several subspaces and submodels are identified by least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). Then, a regression model is constructed by combining these submodels with a weighted mechanism. Furthermore we adopt the method to identify a class of inverse systems with immeasurable state variables. In the process of identification, an allied inverse system is constructed to obtain enough information for modeling. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method can identify the nonlinear allied inverse system effectively and provides satisfactory accuracy and good generalization.", "paper_title": "A weighted LS-SVM approach for the identification of a class of nonlinear inverse systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000266094200004"}
