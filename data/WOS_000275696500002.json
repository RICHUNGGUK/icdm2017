The main problem with these systems lies in those items for which we have little information and which cause incorrect predictions. One accredited solution involves using the items' content information to improve these recommendations, but this cannot be applied in situations where the content information is unavailable. In this paper we present a novel idea to deal with this problem, using only the available users' ratings. The objective is to use all possible information in the dataset to improve recommendations made with little information. For this purpose we will use what we call second-hand information: in the recommendation process, when a similar user has not rated the target item, we will guess his/her preferences using the information available. This idea is independent from the RS used and, in order to test it, we will employ two different collaborative RS. The results obtained confirm the soundness of our proposal.", "paper_title": "Using second-hand information in collaborative recommender systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000275696500002"}
