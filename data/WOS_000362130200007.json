In order to fulfill the bandwidth demands from end users, a dynamic architecture is proposed with co-existence of LTE, WiMax and UWB technologies. Hybrid wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and a time division multiplexing (TDM) based optical access network offer reconfigurable provision. This enhances the ability to allocate different wavelengths to different optical networking units (ONUS) on demand. In addition, two different channel routing modules (CRMs) are introduced in order to address the cost effectiveness and energy efficiency issues of the proposed network. Take-up rate adaptive-mode operation and traffic-adaptive power management are utilized to optimize the benefits of low investment cost with energy efficiency. Up to 26% power consumption reduction is achieved at the time of minimum traffic conditions while 10% consumption is achieved at the time of maximum traffic conditions. Besides, 23% energy saving can be achieved compared to conventional systems in fully operated stage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
