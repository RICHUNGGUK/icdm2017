However, engineers usually rely on experience when determining set-up orientation and often cannot finish complex surfaces in one set-up. In this paper, a rational evaluation method for workpiece orientation and configuration of machine tool before tool path planning is proposed to increase the efficiency and reliability of process planning. By incorporating the visibility cone into workspace analysis, a software module is constructed in this research for optimum workpiece orientation and configuration of machine tool. First, the configurations of three-, four- and five-axis machine tools were synthesised, and the workspace was then analysed using form-shaping function. Both position vector and normal vector of each point along the u and v directions in the machining surface were employed to calculate the visibility range as the point of the visibility cone. In 3-axis machining, all normal vectors of the surface were projected on a unit sphere. All normal vectors were ensured to be within the visibility range of the ball-mill cutter as the workpiece set-up orientation changed. In 4-axis machining, the intersection between the visibility cone of each point and the workspace was obtained by changing the set-up orientation. In 5-axis machining, according to different workspaces of 5-axis machine tools, the visibility range of the machining surface was determined to yield the intersection between the visibility cone and the workspace by changing the workpiece orientation. The proposed method for evaluating manufacturability has been demonstrated to generate optimum workpiece set-up orientation and the suitable configuration of machine tools. Tool interference with workpiece surface can be avoided, which can help improve the planning of tool path.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of workpiece orientation and configuration of multi-axis machine tool using visibility cone analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000279839700004"}
