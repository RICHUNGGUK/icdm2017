Firstly, by exploiting a new Lyapunov function and using the convexity property of the matrix inequality, new criteria is derived for the H, performance analysis of the filtering-error systems, which can lead to much less conservative analysis results. Secondly, based on the obtained conditions, the gain of filter can be obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the merit of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "H-infinity FILTERING FOR MARKOVIAN JUMP SYSTEMS WITH TIME-VARYING DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600022"}
