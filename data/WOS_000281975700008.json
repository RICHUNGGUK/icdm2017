The purpose of this paper is to perform an optimal design of a PMDM using specific power as objective function. In the design procedure performed on the PMDM, genetic algorithm (GA), as an optimisation tool is used. Design/methodology/approach - The created optimal design programme genetic algorithm for optimal design of electrical machines is using the GA as an optimisation tool. According to the design characteristics of PMDM, some of the parameters are chosen to be constant and some variable. A comparative analysis of both motor models based on the values of some specific parameters is performed. Findings - From the comparative data analysis of both motor models, it can be concluded that the main objective of the optimisation is realised, and that is achieved by a reduction of the total weight of the motor, as well as the increase of the torque, as a result of which the specific power is increased. Originality/value - An optimisation technique based on GAs has been developed and applied to the design of a PMDM. According to the results investigated above, it can be concluded that the GA is a very suitable tool for design optimisation of PMDM and electromagnetic devices in general. The quality of the GA optimised model has been proved through the data analysis of the prototype and optimised solution. At the end, the quality of the GA solution has been again proved by comparative analysis of the two motor models using FEM as a performance analysis tool.", "paper_title": "Specific power as objective function in GA optimal design of permanent magnet disc motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000281975700008"}
