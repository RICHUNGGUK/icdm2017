In this paper, a new variant of supplier selection problem named life cycle supplier selection of CoPS (LSS&CoPS) problem is addressed. There are three kinds of choices for a manufacturer to complete a CoPS: self-made, purchasing the finished component and outsourcing. Different selection not only results in difference of procurement cost of CoPS, but also results in reliability changing after it delivered to customer which greatly influences the operating cost in CoPS's lifecycle. However, the minimizing of two objectives is mutually conflicted. This paper presents a bi-objective LSS&CoPS model which considering operating stage of CoPS to balance the procurement cost and operating cost. Moreover, a hybridization of Pareto genetic algorithm (PGA) with multi-intersection and similarity crossover (MSC) strategy is proposed to solve the bi-objective problem. Also, a dual-chromosome is used to represent the variable-length chromosome. Finally, a cement equipment supplier optimal in a cement equipment enterprise is provided. Example indicates that the procurement cost and operating cost have been optimized, yields a Pareto optimal solution of supplier schema for project managers to make-decision and decrease the life cycle cost of CoPS. Additionally, the results show that the proposed approach is more preferably in Pareto optimal solution searching. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
