Sound and complete inference systems for spider diagrams have been developed and it is known that they are equivalent in expressive power to monadic first-order logic with equality, MFOL[=]. In this paper, we further characterize their expressiveness by articulating a link between them and formal languages. First, we establish that spider diagrams define precisely the languages that are finite unions of languages of the form K(sic)Gamma(*), where K is a finite commutative language and Gamma is a finite et of letters. We note that it was previously established that spider diagrams define commutative star-free languages. As a corollary, all languages of the form K(sic)Gamma(*) are commutative star-free languages. We further demonstrate that every commutative star-free language is also such a finite union. In summary, we establish that spider diagrams define precisely: (a) languages definable in MFOL[=], (b) the commutative star-free regular languages, and (c) finite unions of the form K(sic)F-*, as just described.
