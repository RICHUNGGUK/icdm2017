When the main factor number in PLS calibration model was 6, the correlation coefficients of PLS calibration samples and prediction ones were all 0.9999 and the relative standard deviations were 0.69% and 1.10%, respectively, which showed good robustness and predictability. Combining drug circulation dissolution system with the PLS calibration model, dissolution of Baicalin in raw material drug and solid dispersion were obtained at different times. The results indicated that the dissolution property of Baicalin in solid dispersion (especially at the early time) had been significantly improved. The accumulated dissolution of Baicalin in the solid dispersion at 45 min reached nearly 40%, increasing by 15% compared with raw material drug (about 25%). The aforementioned PLS model associated with drug circulation dissolution system provided a simple, accurate and on-line support for dissolution determination of drug, especially at the early time of rapid dissolution.
