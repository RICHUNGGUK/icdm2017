Moreover, in some situations, there are several correlated quality characteristics, which can be modeled as a set of linear functions of one explanatory variable. We refer to this as multivariate simple linear profiles structure. In this paper, we propose the use of three control chart schemes for Phase II monitoring of multivariate simple linear profiles. The statistical performance of the proposed methods is evaluated in term of average run length criterion and reveals that the control chart schemes are effective in detecting shifts in the process parameters. In addition, the applicability of the proposed methods is illustrated using a real case of calibration application. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
