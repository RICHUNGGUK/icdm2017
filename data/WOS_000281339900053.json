It cannot leak any information of the shared secret by any combination of the n share images except for all of images. The shared secret image can be revealed by printing the share images on transparencies and stacking the transparencies directly, so that the human visual system can recognize the shared secret image without using any devices. The visual secrets sharing scheme for multiple secrets (called VSSM scheme) is intended to encrypt more than one secret image into the same quantity of share images to increase the encryption capacity compared with the original VSS scheme. However, all presented VSSM schemes utilize a pre-defined pattern book with pixel expansion to encrypt secret images into share images. In general, it leads to at least 2x times pixel expansion on the share images by any one of the VSSM schemes. Thus, the pixel expansion problem becomes more serious for sharing multiple secrets. This is neither a practical nor the best solution for increasing the number of secret sharing images. In this paper, we propose a novel VSSM scheme that can share two binary secret images on two rectangular share images with no pixel expansion. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only has no pixel expansion, but also has an excellent recovery quality for the secret images. As our best knowledge, this is the first approach that can share multiple visual secret images without pixel expansion. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
