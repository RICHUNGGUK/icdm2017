However, this unique professional knowledge often lies in the dispatcher's mind. Therefore, this study aims to transform a train dispatcher's expertise into a useful knowledge rule. The fuzzy Petri Net approach is adopted to formulate the decision rules of train dispatchers in case of abnormality as the basis for future development of a dispatching decision support system. The dispatching decision rules, factors, and possible options when perturbation happens are collected via expert interviews and literature reviews. This study discusses the abnormal scenarios, including centralized traffic control system failure, automatic train protection failure, and locomotive failure. A case study of a line section of Taiwan's railway network is implemented and the empirical result could be used as a reference in railway dispatching in case of abnormality.
