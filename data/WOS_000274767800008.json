REAP was developed by the IETF SHIM6 Working Group as part of its multihoming solution. The behavior of REAP is governed by a small number of parameters: three timers, a simple characterization of the application traffic, and the communication delay. The key figure of merit of REAP performance is the time to recover from a path failure as seen by the upper layers, figure that cannot be trivially obtained, despite the apparent simplicity of this reachability protocol. In this paper we provide upper bounds for the recovery time of REAP for different deployment scenarios, applying these analytical results to two interesting case studies. TCP and VoIP traffic.
