The proposed workflow consists of searching for models that match production history from a large set of prior structural model realizations. This prior set represents the reservoir structural uncertainty because of interpretation uncertainty on seismic sections. To make such a search effective, we introduce a parameter space defined with a \"similarity distance\" for accommodating this large set of realizations. The inverse solutions are found using a stochastic search method. Realistic reservoir examples are presented to prove the applicability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Dynamic data integration for structural modeling: model screening approach using a distance-based model parameterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000253212200007"}
