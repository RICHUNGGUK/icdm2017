We use a discontinuous Galerkin spectral element approximation with an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian mapping and derive the exact upwind numerical fluxes to model the physics of wave reflection and transmission at jumps in material properties. Spectral accuracy is obtained by placing moving material interfaces at element boundaries and solving the appropriate Riemann problem. We present numerical examples showing the performance of the method for plane wave reflection and transmission at dielectric and acoustic interfaces. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
