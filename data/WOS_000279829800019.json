Hence, image inpainting which aims to restore the damaged images visual plausibly has received considerable attentions in recent years. In this paper, a novel and fast inpainting algorithm is proposed to remove large image object from the original image and then reconstruct the missing areas. In the proposed method, the original image is firstly decomposed through the wavelet transformation. Then, the structure information of source region is used to determine the filling order. Thirdly, the coefficients of the missing patches are replaced by those coefficients of the optimal filling patches that are obtained by a matching pursuit strategy. Finally, the inpainted image is reconstructed through the inverse wavelet transformation. Experimental results on several testing images demonstrate that the proposed method can greatly speed up the inpainting process and efficiently reconstruct various large object missing cases even in complex background.", "paper_title": "WAVELET-BASED FAST IMAGE INPAINTING FOR LARGE SCALE MISSING REGIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279829800019"}
