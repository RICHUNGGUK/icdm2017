We follow a split-merge technique in character segmentation. In this process, a Chinese text line is first pre-segmented into a sequence of radicals, which are then merged according to a cost function combining both recognition confidence and contextual cost. Two strategies are also proposed for implementation: bi-gram based merging and lexicon driven merging. In the former one, we generate a set of merging paths which are then evaluated by Viterbi algorithm. The radicals' best merging method is given by the path with the highest score. In the latter strategy, a lexicon is preset and compared with the radicals to determine both radicals' merging and candidate character selection. Experiments show that contextual information plays a crucial role in Chinese character segmentation and could obviously improve the segmentation and recognition results.", "paper_title": "Context driven Chinese string segmentation and recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100013"}
