In this paper, we develop an analytical framework that focuses on the relationship between the extent of TML adoption and students' return from a higher education degree. This framework is used to derive hypotheses about how adoption levels should vary based on the institutional and student characteristics of a university. Using an extensive data set for the 2000-2001 academic year, our empirical work supports hypotheses concerning the importance of the quality and location of institutions as well as students' time value on the TML adoption decision. Specifically, we find that TML is used more in lower-ranked universities, in states with high population densities, and at the graduate than the undergraduate level. These results provide insights on the kind of institutions and program offerings that stand to gain the most from adopting TML.
