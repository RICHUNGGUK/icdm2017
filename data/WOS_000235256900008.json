Introducing regularity in allowed structures reduced difficulties of its reconfiguration problems. Several locomotion patterns in various structures were designed systematically using a CPG controller model and GA optimization. Then they were verified by experimentation. Results showed a feasible scenario of operation with multiple M-TRAN modules, which is presented herein, including metamorphosis of a regular structure, generation of walkers from the structure, walker locomotion, and reassembling of walkers to the structure.
