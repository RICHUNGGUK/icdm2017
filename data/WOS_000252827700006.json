The suggested control approach is based on open-loop optimization using a genealogical decision tree (GDT), and can be used in solving both tracking control and regulation problems. The idea behind GDT consists of associating Gaussian distributions to both the norms of the control actions and the tracking errors. This stochastic search model can be interpreted as a simple genetic particle evolution model with a natural birth and death interpretation. A numerical example dealing with the control of a rigid two-link robot manipulator illustrates the feasibility and the performance of this control algorithm.", "paper_title": "Trajectory tracking control based on a genealogical decision tree controller for robot manipulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000252827700006"}
