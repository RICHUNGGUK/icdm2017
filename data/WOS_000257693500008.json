The meta-heuristic method of ant colony optimization is a method of obtaining best/optimal solution, to NP-hard optimization problems. Hence, in this paper, we present, an ant colony system (ACS) for an effective search of the best/optimal routing of demands under a dynamic environment. Our simulation results show that this methodology is successful in finding the best/optimal routing of demands in a SONET ring. Three strategies A CS with only ranking, A CS with only MMAS, and ACS with both ranking and MMAS are considered. A comparison of these strategies are presented to show the performance of each strategy.", "paper_title": "Ant colony optimization for SONET ring loading problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000257693500008"}
