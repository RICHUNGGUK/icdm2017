Technology acceptance research shows that user evaluations (i.e., beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes) are key drivers of adoption and use. This article first presents evidence from the literature suggesting that the link between user evaluations of DSSs and actual performance may be weak, or sometimes even negative. The authors then present two empirical studies in which they found a serious disconnect between user evaluations and actual performance. If user evaluations do not accurately reflect performance, then this may lead to harmful neglect of performance-enhancing DSSs. The article concludes with a discussion of interventions that may alleviate this problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
