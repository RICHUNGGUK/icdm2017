We find that successful secondary sharing goes far beyond the detection of spectrum holes. Large-scale commercial success requires that secondary systems are scalable so that a large number of users can be served in an economically viable fashion. Our key finding is that secondary spectrum use is not an attractive method for most of the commercially interesting scenarios, from neither a business nor technical perspective. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the likely commercial \"sweet spot\" for secondary sharing in the lower frequency bands is short-range indoor communications. We also find that regulation does not currently present a significant barrier in Europe or the United States.", "paper_title": "ON THE SCALABILITY OF COGNITIVE RADIO: ASSESSING THE COMMERCIAL VIABILITY OF SECONDARY SPECTRUM ACCESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000318518300006"}
