Multiple sensing devices can be used cooperatively and collaboratively to capture events or monitor space more effectively than a single sensing device. The realm of applications envisioned for sensor networks is diverse including military, aerospace, industrial, commercial, environmental, and health monitoring. Typical examples include: traffic monitoring of vehicles, cross-border infiltration detection and assessment, military reconnaissance and surveillance, target tracking, habitat monitoring, and structure monitoring, to name a few. Most of the applications envisioned with sensor networks demand highly reliable, accurate, and fault-tolerant data acquisition process. In this paper, we focus on innovative approaches to deal with multivariable, multispace problem domains (data integrity, energy-efficiency, and fault-tolerant framework) in wireless sensor networks and present novel ideas that have practical implementation in developing power-aware software components for designing robust networks of sensing devices.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Aggregation and Intelligent Monitoring and Control in Fault-Tolerant Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000207465700006"}
