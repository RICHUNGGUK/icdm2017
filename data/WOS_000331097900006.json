However, the existing load balancing schemes based on VM migration have serious influence on the fault-tolerant level of the services in the data center, and thus the reliability of the services cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, a novel guaranteeing fault-tolerant requirement load balancing scheme (GFTLBS) is proposed. GFTLBS migrates the VMs to balance the load without violating the fault-tolerant requirement of all services. The simulation results show that the scheme can guarantee the fault-tolerant requirements of all services while keeping the load balance.", "paper_title": "Guaranteeing Fault-Tolerant Requirement Load Balancing Scheme Based on VM Migration", "paper_id": "WOS:000331097900006"}
