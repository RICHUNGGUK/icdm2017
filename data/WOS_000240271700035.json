In this paper we address the problem of gathering sensed data to the sink of a sensor network minimizing the time to complete the process. We present optimal time data gathering algorithms for any type of topology of a sensor network. Our results improve on existing approximation algorithms. We approach the gathering problem by obtaining optimal solutions to the collision-free paths coloring problem.", "paper_title": "Optimally fast data gathering in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700035"}
