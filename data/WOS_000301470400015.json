The proposed generator is based on a nonlinear circuit, which shows chaotic behavior. The bit sequence, produced by the chaotic generator, is converted to a sequence of planned positions, which satisfies the requirements for unpredictability and fast scanning of the entire terrain. The nonlinear circuit and the trajectory-planner are described thoroughly. Simulation tests confirm that with the proposed path planning generator better results can be obtained with regard to previous works. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
