The algorithm can precisely estimate the image registration parameter by excluding aliased frequency domain of the low-resolution images and killing the center part of the magnitude spectrum. In order to compute the shifts and the rotation angle, we set up the polar coordinates in the center of the image. By computing the frequency function of the rotation angle by integrating over radial lines, the algorithm converts the two-dimension correlation to one-dimension correlation. And then, the POCS method is used to reconstruct high-resolution image from these aliased image sequences. As a result, we find that the reconstruction algorithm has the same precision of image registration as the spatial image registration and good effect of super-resolution image reconstruction.", "paper_title": "POCS super-resolution sequence image reconstruction based on image registration excluded aliased frequency domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300155"}
