In the physics field, these methods have provided remarkable numerical solutions to problems considered analytically intractable. The solution of the Schrodinger equation in semiconductor heterostructures is a good example. However, many of these numerical schemes are cumbersome to implement for nonexperts in numerical computing. With this reason as motivation, a novel method simple enough to implement yet powerful enough to solve Schrodinger equation in semiconductor devices with high accuracy is presented herein.
