While there are many soft constraint solving formalisms, even distributed ones, as yet there seems to be no concurrent programming framework where soft constraints can be handled. In this article we show how the classical concurrent constraint (cc) programming framework can work with soft constraints, and we also propose an extension of cc languages which can use soft constraints to prune and direct the search for a solution. We believe that this new programming paradigm, called soft cc (scc), can be also very useful in many Web-related scenarios. In fact, the language level allows Web agents to express their interaction and negotiation protocols, and also to post their requests in terms of preferences, and the underlying soft constraint solver can find an agreement among the agents even if their requests are incompatible.", "paper_title": "Soft concurrent constraint programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000244030700004"}
