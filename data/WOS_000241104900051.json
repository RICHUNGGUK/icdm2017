Whereas most existing work on web information fusion has focused on multiple document summarization, this paper presents a novel approach for discovering associations between images and text segments, which subsequently can be used to support cross-media web content summarization. Specifically, we employ a similarity-based multilingual retrieval model and adopt a vague transformation technique for measuring the information similarity between visual features and textual features. The experimental results on a terrorist domain document set suggest that combining visual and textual features provides a promising approach to image and text fusion.", "paper_title": "Discovering image-text associations for cross-media web information fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000241104900051"}
