Today 3D NoCs are quite irregular, especially those with heterogeneous layers. In this paper, we present a routing algorithm targeting 3D networks-on-chip (NoCs) with incomplete sets of vertical links between adjacent layers. The routing algorithm tolerates multiple link and node failures, in the case of absence of NoC partitioning. In addition, it deals with congestion. The routing algorithm for 3D NoCs preserves the deadlock-free propriety of the chosen 2D routing algorithms. It is also scalable and supports a local reconfiguration that complements the reconfiguration of the 2D routing algorithms in case of failures of nodes or links. The algorithm incurs a small overhead in terms of exchanged messages for reconfiguration and does not introduce significant additional complexity in the routers. Theoretical analysis of the 3D routing algorithm is provided and validated by simulations for different traffic loads and failure rates. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
