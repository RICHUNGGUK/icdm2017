This paper has two purposes. Based on a qualitative case study conducted at a Swedish automotive company it describes the process of cost estimation in a real-life setting focusing on inhibitors to accurate cost estimates. Second, the results of this study are compared with four other studies with a similar purpose of concluding that a company-specific investigation of cost estimation inhibitors might give more actionable input to the activity of cost estimation process improvement than a more general investigation.
