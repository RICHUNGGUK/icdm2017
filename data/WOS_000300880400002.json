Numerous message-oriented architectures and service discovery protocols have been proposed to support service management in pervasive systems. Nevertheless, few researches have been done to improve the reliability of pervasive systems. This paper attempts to propose a reliable service management framework by formally defining a message-oriented service application model and protocols that facilitate autonomous composition, failure detection, and recovery of services. Proposed approaches are realized by constructing a developer's toolkit that enables rapid-prototyping of services. We evaluate the proposed approach by first proving the reliability property and then conducting experiments on recovery rate and performance. The results show that the recovery rate can be greatly improved by the proposed approach. Furthermore, the services developed by using the proposed approach are capable of integrating heterogeneous software/hardware, and can be deployed in dissimilar sites with little efforts.", "paper_title": "Toward Reliable Service Management in Message-Oriented Pervasive Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300880400002"}
