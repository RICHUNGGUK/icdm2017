This study combines information theory and Fitts' Law to propose the concept of Information Mass (M(info)) and through the test of the C(info) and D(info) toward the M(info) of Chinese characters, the subjects are surveyed for measuring the complexity and difficulty of 218 selected Chinese characters. The results indicate that there is no significant discrepancy in the Cif,, of genders. The result of regression analysis indicates that the correlation coefficient of logarithm value of M(info) and C(info) is 0.684 and RSQ equals to 0.468. On the other hand, the Paired-Samples T-test shows the discrepancy of the D(info) on Chinese characters between and among different groups. Overall, the M(info) threshold value to recognize the D(info) on Chinese characters between male and female subjects reaches to 0.017; among it, the M(info) threshold value for male and female high school students is 0.06; for male and female university students is 0.01. The average value of D(info) between genders found in regression analysis indicates the correlation coefficient of M(info) and D(info) is 0.861 and RSQ is 0.741. From results of this study, subjects are shown to have closer relations between M(info) and D(info) than that of M(info) and C(info). In the other words, the concept to apply M(info). gives reasonable explanation to the difficulty of Chinese characters and the model of linear regression serves the function for the reference of educational learning and design.
