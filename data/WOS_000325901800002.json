Line buffers allow nonpermutation flowshop scheduling and job sequences to be changed on different machines. A mixed-integer linear programming model for nonpermutation flowshop scheduling and the buffer requirement along with manufacturing implication is proposed. Ant colony optimization based heuristic is evaluated against Taillard's (1993) well-known flowshop benchmark instances, with 20 to 500 jobs to be processed on 5 to 20 machines (stages). Computation experiments show that the proposed algorithm is incumbent to the state-of-the-art ant colony optimization for flowshop with higher job to machine ratios, using the makespan as the optimization criterion.", "paper_title": "Nonpermutation flow line scheduling by ant colony optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000325901800002"}
