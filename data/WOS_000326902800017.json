Numerical modelling tools, including standard bi-dimensional (2D) free surface flow models, are applied in a wide variety of flood risk practical studies straight from the purpose for which they had originally been designed. This study focuses on possibilities, performances and limits of the use of standard modelling tools for high resolution runoff simulations over an industrial site. Two categories of runoff scenarios are tested over this industrial site test case, with three modelling tools relying on different numerical schemes. Simulated water depth evolutions are found to be comparable between modelling tools, nevertheless, the possibilities of these modelling tools' optimal use with a highly refined topographical resolution for runoff scenarios are revealed to be unequal. Used indicators for computation reliability checks do not point out major inconsistencies in calculation under critical models' optimisation. Indeed, emphasis is placed on restrictive aspects to achieve with standard modelling tools a balance between computational stability, swift and precise in high resolution runoff modelling.", "paper_title": "Performance assessment of modelling tools for high resolution runoff simulation over an industrial site", "paper_id": "WOS:000326902800017"}
