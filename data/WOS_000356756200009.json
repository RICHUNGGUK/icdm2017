For such case, the network topology needs to scale effectively. In this paper, we propose a new scalable topology for kilo-core-oriented processors named CSquare, a cluster-formed structure, in which each cluster is a variation of the butterfly-tree. For each cluster, the routers adopt parallel-level structure to obtain efficient global connections. With the global interconnections between clusters, the topology scale can be extended at a much faster rate than with only one cluster. For such characters, we propose a deadlock-free routing algorithm for CSquare, called GNCA. Compared with 2D-Mesh and Torus, CSquare employs fewer routers and links. The simulation results indicate that CSquare greatly improves the average latency and throughput under various traffic patterns and consumes less power and area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
