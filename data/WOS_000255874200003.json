It has been proven in the literature that, for any integer l, 4 <= l <= 2(n), a cycle of length l can be embedded with dilation 1 in an n-dimensional twisted cube, n >= 3. We obtain a stronger result of embedding of cycles with edge-pancyclic. We prove that, for any integer l, 4 <= l <= 2(n), and a given edge (x,y) in an n-dimensional twisted cube, n >= 3, a cycle C of length l can be embedded with dilation 1 in the n-dimensional twisted cube such that (x,y) is in C in the twisted cube. Based on the proof of the edge-pancyclicity of twisted cubes, we further provide an O(l log l + n(2) + nl) algorithm to find a cycle C of length l that contains (u,v) in TQ(n) for any (u,v) is an element of E(T Q (n)) and any integer l with 4 <= l <= 2(n).", "paper_title": "Embedding of cycles in twisted cubes with edge-pancyclic", "paper_id": "WOS:000255874200003"}
