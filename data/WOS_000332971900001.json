According to the dynamic localization failure of mobile robots in indoor network blind areas, an autonomous-dynamic localization system which dynamically chooses beacon node and establishes grids is proposed in this paper. This method applies received signal strength indication (RSSI) for distance measurement. Furthermore, the proposed grid-based improved maximum likelihood estimation (GIMLE) fulfills the localization. Finally, the localization error correction is implemented by Kalman filter. The approach combines the classical Kalman filter with the other localization algorithms. The purpose is to smooth and optimize the results of the algorithms, in order to improve the localization accuracy. In particular, in network blind spots, the Kalman filter provides better performance than the other algorithms listed in the paper. Experimental results show the accuracy, adaptivity, and robustness of the dynamic self-localization of mobile robots.", "paper_title": "Grid-Based Improved Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Dynamic Localization of Mobile Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000332971900001"}
