We propose that student appropriation of mobile technology transforms classrooms, regardless of structural format, into online environments where students engage, network, and restructure in-class learning. Such activities may be facilitated by faculty and intentional interventions, but is principally driven and organically defined by students. This study represents a first step in identifying and understanding this trend, we refer to as a hybrid shift, in which student use of mobile technology restructures traditional face-to-face classes by adding a vibrant, and organic, supplemental learning component. Data informing this research were drawn from qualitative responses from 620 students in Korea and the U.S. Findings from textual analysis evidence student appropriation of technology for academic purposes, their desire for more supportive structures and instructional practices, as well as teaching and learning implications stemming from this practice. While further research into this occurrence is needed, this study was intended as a preliminary step at identifying the phenomenon to frame and guide continued work. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
