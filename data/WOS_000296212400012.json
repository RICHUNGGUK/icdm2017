The ability of emerging various solutions for a problem and the existence of a supervisor to guide this variety to become close to the goal, are the two main properties of a problem solver. In this paper, a chaotic neural network which uses chaotic nodes with the logistic map as activation functions is designed to make the ability of emerging various solutions and an NDRAM is considered as a supervisor to guide these various solutions. The proposed chaotic neural network has better performance in comparison with Hopfield, NDRAM, and L. Zhao et al. ChNN. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
