The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of the percentage of defective units on the ordering policy. Two different scenarios are presented for joint replenishment problem: (1) without price discount and (2) with price discount. For each scenario, the total expected cost per unit time is derived and algorithms are presented to determine the family cycle length and the integer number of intervals that the replenishment quantity of each item will last. Numerical examples are presented and the results are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
