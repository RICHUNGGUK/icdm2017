Though SC methods have been successfully applied to a large number of challenging clustering scenarios, it is noteworthy that they will fail when there are significant intersections among different clusters. In this paper, based on the analysis that SC methods are able to work well when the affinity values of the points belonging to different clusters are relatively low, we propose a new method, called spectral multi-manifold clustering (SMMC), which is able to handle intersections. In our model, the data are assumed to lie on or close to multiple smooth low-dimensional manifolds, where some data manifolds are separated but some are intersecting. Then, local geometric information of the sampled data is incorporated to construct a suitable affinity matrix. Finally, spectral method is applied to this affinity matrix to group the data. Extensive experiments on synthetic as well as real datasets demonstrate the promising performance of SMMC.", "paper_title": "Spectral Clustering on Multiple Manifolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000293442800013"}
