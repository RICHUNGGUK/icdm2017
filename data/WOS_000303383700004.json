These devices are connected by a wireless network. Parallel processing in the distributed mobile DSP system can provide high computing performance. Due to the fact that most of the mobile devices are battery based, the lifetime of mobile DSP system depends on both the battery behavior and the energy consumption characteristics of tasks. In this paper, we present a systematic system model for task scheduling in mobile DSP system equipped with Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) processors and energy harvesting techniques. We propose the three-phase algorithms to obtain task schedules with shorter total execution time while satisfying the system lifetime constraints. The simulations with randomly generated Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) show that our proposed algorithms generate the optimal schedules that can satisfy lifetime constraints.", "paper_title": "Three-Phase Algorithms for Task Scheduling in Distributed Mobile DSP System with Lifetime Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000303383700004"}
