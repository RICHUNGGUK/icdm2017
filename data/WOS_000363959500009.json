On the other hand, Burkov showed in 1988 that the eightfold tilings do not admit weak local rules, and Le showed the same for the 12-fold tilings (unpublished). We here show that this is actually the case for all the 4p-fold tilings.", "paper_title": "No Weak Local Rules for the 4p-Fold Tilings", "paper_id": "WOS:000363959500009"}
