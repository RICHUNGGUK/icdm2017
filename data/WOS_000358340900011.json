To solve this problem, the paper builds an evaluation model of user interest based on resource multi-attributes, proposes a modified Pearson-Compatibility multi-attribute group decision-making algorithm, and introduces an algorithm to solve the recommendation problem of k-neighbor similar users. This study addresses the issues on preference differences of similar users, incomplete values, and advanced converge of the algorithm, and realizes multi-attribute collaborative filtering. The algorithm is proved to be effective by an experiment of collaborative recommendation among multi-users in a virtual environment. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a high accuracy on predicting target users' attribute preferences and has a strong anti-interference ability on deviation and incomplete values.", "paper_title": "Multi-attribute Collaborative Filtering Recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000358340900011"}
