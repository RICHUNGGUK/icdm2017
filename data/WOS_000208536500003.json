Taking as an input an audio-visual video sequence of the user's face, the MCM generates a facial animation, in which the prosody and the facial expressions of emotions can either be reproduced or amplified. The user can thus simulate an emotion and see almost instantly the animation it produced, like with a regular mirror. In addition, the MCM also enables to amplify the emotions of selected parts of the input video sequence, leaving other parts unchanged. It therefore constitutes a novel approach to the design of very expressive facial animation, as the affective content of the animation can be modified by post-processing operations.", "paper_title": "SYNTHESIS OF EXPRESSIVE FACIAL ANIMATIONS: A MULTIMODAL CARICATURAL MIRROR", "paper_id": "WOS:000208536500003"}
