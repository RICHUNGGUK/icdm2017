Again the individual and relative impacts of various noise sources will determine what types of remedial steps can be taken. This paper proposes the concept of analyzing the impacts of multiple concurrent noise sources in a circuit network, and applies blind source separation (BSS) technique to analyze the characteristics of this compound noise effect in analog integrated circuits. The proposed algorithm can effectively extracts the time characteristics of individual noise sources from observed noises at circuit nodes. The estimated noise sources can aid in timing and spectral analysis and yield better design techniques.", "paper_title": "Noise separation in analog integrated circuits using independent component analysis technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000254263000006"}
