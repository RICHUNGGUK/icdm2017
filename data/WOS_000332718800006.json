A weighted sum formed objective function is developed by taking into consideration the input and output mean compliances. The weighting factors are set based on the information that is obtained from the previous iteration and automatically updated with each optimization iteration step. Shape sensitivity analysis is addressed. Some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A multi-objective method of hinge-free compliant mechanism optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000332718800006"}
