Indeed, we consider algebraic semantics for expansions of logics of continuous t-norms with a set of truth-constants {(r) over bar vertical bar r is an element of C}, for a suitable countable C subset of [0, 1], and provide a full description of completeness results when (i) the t-norm is a finite ordinal sum of Lukasiewicz, Godel and Product components, (ii) the set of truth-constants covers all the unit interval in the sense that each component of the t-norm contains at least one value of C different from the bounds of the component, and (iii) the truth-constants in Lukasiewicz components behave as rational numbers.
