R-ELDMA aims to determine suitable rules in a TFC and identify suitable and unsuitable groups for chromosome selection. To this end, the proposed R-ELDMA entails both structure and parameter learning. In structure learning, the proposed R-ELDMA adopts our previous research - the self-adaptive method (SAM) - to determine the suitability of TFC models with different fuzzy rules. In parameter learning, the data-mining based selection strategy (DSS), which proposes association rules, is used. More specifically, DSS not only determines suitable groups for chromosomes selection but also identifies unsuitable groups to be avoided selecting chromosomes to construct a TFC. Illustrative examples are presented to show the performance and applicability of the proposed R-ELDMA. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B. V.
