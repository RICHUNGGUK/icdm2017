Firstly, all topologically different types of such curves are enumerated. Secondly, an algebraic method is presented for determining the topological type of the non-degenerate intersection curve of two given ring tori. The method works by analyzing the real roots of two univariate quartic polynomials constructed from the two tori. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.
