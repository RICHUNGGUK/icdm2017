Given the measuring difficulty under the current industrial conditions, a hybrid method, which combines community finding (CF) of a complex network with case-based reasoning (CBR) is proposed in this study. The CF method with a new evaluation criterion for the vertex combination degree is designed to select the typical cases from the constructed communities, and a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) based strategy with multi-similarity threshold is proposed in the case retrieval process. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a number of comparative simulations by using the real-world data coming from a copper-molybdenum concentration plant are carried out, and the results indicate that the proposed method can provide a good measure quality for the industrial application.
