Structures are generated by constructing a set of optimal dual graph topologies which are subsequently optimised using a carbon interatomic potential. Combining this approach with a GUI featuring 3D rendering capabilities allows for the rapid inspection Of physically sensible structures which can be used as input for molecular simulation.
