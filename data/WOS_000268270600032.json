The system must be capable of interacting with a dynamic and uncertain battle world in a real-time manner. In siege situation, it is assumed that the enemy troops are advancing toward friendly side in different directions and the defence resources are limited and nonrenewable at a single platform. Thus, resource allocation problem in a real-time manner is an important and vital component of battle management until coming of auxiliary forces. This paper addresses the design of a fuzzy system as an efficient toot for real-time decision-making in order to optimize the defense resource allocation in engagement. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
