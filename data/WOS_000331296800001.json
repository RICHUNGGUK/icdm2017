Self-navigation can help reduce artefacts by estimating motion from the acquired data to enable motion correction. Popular self-navigation techniques rely on the availability of a fully-sampled motion-free reference to register the motion corrupted data with. In the proposed technique, rigid motion parameters are derived using the inherent correlation between radial segments in k-space. The registration is performed exclusively in k-space using the Phase Correlation Method, a popular registration technique in computer vision. Robust and accurate registration has been carried out from radial segments composed of as few as 32 profiles. Successful self-navigation has been performed on 2-D dynamic brain scans corrupted with continuous motion for six volunteers. Retrospective motion correction using the derived self-navigation parameters resulted in significant improvement of image quality compared to the conventional sliding window. This work also demonstrates the benefits of using a bit-reversed ordering scheme to limit undesirable effects specific to retrospective motion correction on radial trajectories. This method provides a fast and efficient mean of measuring rigid motion directly in k-space from dynamic radial data under continuous motion.", "paper_title": "Retrospective Rigid Motion Correction in k-Space for Segmented Radial MRI", "paper_id": "WOS:000331296800001"}
