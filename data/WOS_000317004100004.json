The purpose is to build an algorithm suitable for elliptic and convective models. The subdomain approximated solution relies on the incomplete lower-upper factorization. The algebraic coupling between the coarse grid and the Schwarz preconditioner is discussed. The deflation method and the balancing domain decomposition method are studied for introducing the coarse-grid correction as a preconditioner. Standard coarse grids are built with the characteristic or indicator functions of the subdomains. The building of a set of smooth basis functions (analogous to smoothed-aggregation methods) is considered. A first test problem is the Poisson problem with a discontinuous coefficient. The two options are compared for the standpoint of coarse-grid consistency and for the gain in scalability of the global Schwarz iteration. The advectiondiffusion model is then considered as a second test problem. Extensions to compressible flows (together with incompressible flows for comparison) are then proposed. Parallel applications are presented and their performance measured.
