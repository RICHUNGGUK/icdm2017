The architecture organizes cells in a multi-tier fashion, with different tiers covering areas with different radii lengths. Proposed optimization algorithm splits cells to improve network capacity in congested areas and merges cells when the demand is low. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed model considered three distinct objectives: minimization of the number of base stations used, maximization of the number of users served, and minimization of network energy consumption. The combination of the first two objectives was also evaluated. Three algorithms based on linear relaxation techniques are introduced for rapid computation of the near-optimum solutions. The proposed architecture is shown to lead to network infrastructures that save costs and energy and yet provide service to a large number of users.", "paper_title": "Radio Resource Allocation and Green Operation for Mobile Access Networks Based on Radio-over-Fiber", "paper_id": "WOS:000333092700014"}
