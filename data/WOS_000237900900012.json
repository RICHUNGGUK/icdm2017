The triangular antiferromagnetic Ising (TAI) model possesses an intrinsic geometrical frustration and a large degeneracy of ground state which may affect the equilibrium and non-equilibrium critical behaviors. The S = 1/2 TAI has no phase transition at a finite temperature, but it was suggested that the S = 3/2 TAI has the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT)-type phase transition at a finite temperature. We employ a finite size scaling approach for the correlation function from the short-time dynamics of the S = 1/2, 3/2 TAI to calculate the values of the static critical exponent eta and the dynamic exponent z. For the S = 1/2 TAI, our dynamic scaling analysis provides eta = 0.498 +/- 0.006 and z = 2.278 +/- 0.020 at T = 0, agreeing with the previous results. For the S = 3/2 TAI, after identifying a KT-transition temperature T-KT = 0.51 +/- 0.01, we find the temperature-dependent eta ranging from 0.301 +/- 0.008 at T-KT = 0.51 to 0.224 +/- 0.016 at T = 0 along the KT-line whereas the value of z = 2.20 +/- 0.06 is constant for T <= T-KT. It is shown that the spin S = 3/2 TAI model and the two-dimensional XY model, sharing the KT-type phase transition, exhibit similar static critical and coarsening dynamics behavior. For both the S = 1/2, 3/2 TAI, the value of z (eta) is compatible with (larger than) that of the Ising model at T-c and the XY model for T <= T-KT in two-dimension. Our results imply that although the quasi-long-range order disappears with eta(XY) = 0 in the two-dimensional XY model at T = 0, the S = 3/2 TAI still maintains it with eta(TAI) = 0.224 due to the effect of a frustration and a high degeneracy of ground state.", "paper_title": "Critical coarsening dynamics of spin S=1/2, 3/2 antiferromagnetic Ising model on triangular lattice", "paper_id": "WOS:000237900900012"}
