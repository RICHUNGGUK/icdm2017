Based on a virtual leader approach, combined with an extended local potential field, the method is universal applicable by driving the vehicle's auto pilot. The solution is verified, using a group of UAVs based on a simplified small scale helicopter, which is simulated in MATLAB (TM)/Simulink (TM). As necessary for helicopters, the potential field approach is realized in 3D including obstacle and collision avoidance. The collision avoidance strategy could be used separately for the sense and avoid problem. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
