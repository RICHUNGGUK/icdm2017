Existing video annotation methods put the focus on either the analysis of low-level features or simple semantic concepts, and they cannot reduce the gap between low-level features and high-level concepts. In this paper, we propose an innovative method for semantic video annotation through integrated mining of visual features, speech features, and frequent semantic patterns existing in the video. The proposed method mainly consists of two main phases: 1) Construction of four kinds of predictive annotation models, namely speech-association, visual-association, visual-sequential, and statistical models from annotated videos. 2) Fusion of these models for annotating un-annotated videos automatically. The main advantage of the proposed method lies in that all visual features, speech features, and semantic patterns are considered simultaneously. Moreover, the utilization of high-level rules can effectively complement the insufficiency of statistics-based methods in dealing with complex and broad keyword identification in video annotation. Through empirical evaluation on NIST TRECVID video datasets, the proposed approach is shown to enhance the performance of annotation substantially in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure.", "paper_title": "Integrated mining of visual features, speech features, and frequent patterns for semantic video annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252576700010"}
