There have been many efforts to improve the performance of the XML filtering system by utilizing XML schema information. In this paper, we design and implement an XML stream filtering system, SFilter, which uses DTD or XML schema information for improving the performance. We propose the simplification and two kinds of optimization, one is static and the other is dynamic optimization. The Simplification and static optimization transform the XPath queries to make automata as an index structure for the filtering. The dynamic optimization are done in runtime at the filtering time. We developed five kinds of static optimization and two kinds of dynamic optimization. We present the novel filtering algorithm for the resulting transformed XPath queries and runtime optimizing. The experimental result shows that our system filters the XML streams efficiently.", "paper_title": "Schema-aware XPath filtering on XML document streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000266141500001"}
