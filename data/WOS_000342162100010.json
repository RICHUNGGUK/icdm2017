A key problem to harness the potential of NC-CC is how to put sessions into different groups, and assign a relay node for each group. In this paper, we study this joint grouping and relay node selection problem for NC-CC. We provide a formal proof of NP-hardness for this problem. Due to NP-hardness, we propose a distributed and online algorithm and show that it offers near-optimal solution to this problem. The key idea in this algorithm is to have each neighboring relay node of a new session calculate the best local group that it can offer and advertise this information; and then to have the source node of the new session select the best local group to join among all offers. We show that our distributed algorithm has polynomial time complexity. Using extensive numerical results, we show that our distributed algorithm adapts well to online network dynamics.", "paper_title": "Joint Optimization of Session Grouping and Relay Node Selection for Network-Coded Cooperative Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000342162100010"}
