Study of this problem has attracted great attention from both researchers and practitioners. Many algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a new method, error-adaptive pruning method, to maintain frequency more accurately. We also propose a method called fractionization to record time information together with the frequency information. Using these two methods, we design three algorithms for finding frequent items and top-k frequent items. Experimental results show these methods are effective in terms of improving the maintenance accuracy.", "paper_title": "Error-adaptive and time-aware maintenance of frequency counts over data streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700041"}
