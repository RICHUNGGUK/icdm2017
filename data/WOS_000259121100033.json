Firstly, disassembly feasibility information graph (DFIG) is presented to describe the product disassembly sequence and operation information. Then, disassembly sequence planning problem is mapped onto the DFIG as an optimal path-searching problem. Based on this idea, a genetic algorithm is provided to find out feasible and optimal disassembly solutions efficiently. Finally, a case study, which is used to illustrate the performance of proposed method, is presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
