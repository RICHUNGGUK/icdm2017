To fabricate such components, a hybrid layered manufacturing process was proposed and applies spraying, engraving, and refinishing technologies, among which the spraying step is the key technology for generating a coating of hybrid materials with their required volume fractions in every unit volume. To manufacture such a coating, it is important to study the spraying characteristics. This paper intends to establish the behavior model of plasma spraying, to implement the virtual manufacturing according to the behavior model, to analyze the volume fraction error of material constituents and to optimize the related technological parameters to eliminate the volume fraction error, thus providing the reliable basis for future real manufacturing.
