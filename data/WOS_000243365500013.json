The need to perform extensive reservoir studies for either uncertainty assessment or optimal exploitation plans brings up demands of computing power and data management in a more pervasive way. This work focuses on high performance numerical methods, tools and grid-enabled middleware systems for scalable and data-driven computations for multiphysics simulation and decision-making processes in integrated multiphase flow applications. The proposed suite of tools and systems consists of (1) a scalable reservoir simulator, (2) novel stochastic optimization algorithms, (3) decentralized autonomic grid middleware tools, and (4) middleware systems for large-scale data storage, querying, and retrieval. The aforementioned components offer enormous potential for performing data-driven studies and efficient execution of complex, large-scale reservoir models in a collaborative environment.", "paper_title": "Models, methods and middleware for grid-enabled multiphysics oil reservoir management", "paper_id": "WOS:000243365500013"}
