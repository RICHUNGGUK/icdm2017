In order to solve these two problems, Nash bargaining game DEA model is applied to supplier evaluation in present paper. However, there is a non-uniqueness problem with Nash bargaining game efficiency of supplier in existing Nash bargaining game DEA model. The existing Nash bargaining game DEA model is improved in present paper on this issue, then the improved model is applied to the third party logistics service provider evaluation. The result of supplier evaluation based on the improved model is more persuasive compared with the existing research achievement, owing to adopting common weights in evaluation, and the game between suppliers being taken account.
