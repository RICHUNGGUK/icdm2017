These codes generalize the theta-codes as introduced by D. Boucher, F. Ulmer, W. Geiselmann [2]. We construct generic and control matrices for these codes. As a particular case the (sigma, delta)-W-code associated to a Wedderburn polynomial are defined and we show that their control matrices are given by generalized Vandermonde matrices. All the Wedderburn polynomials of F-q[t; theta] are described and their control matrices are presented. A key role will be played by the pseudo-linear transformations.", "paper_title": "(sigma, delta)-CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000326231000005"}
