When integrating the data to build the integrated repository it is possible to make use of the temporal characteristics of the data sources to improve the whole integration process and the quality of the integrated data, which support the organization's decision-making tasks. In this work the usage of an Ordered Weighted Averaging-based operator is presented as the best option when the data sources refer to similar facts but the data on each data source is expressed with different temporal characteristics. This is a common issue in Information Systems development.", "paper_title": "Integration of Similar Evolving Data Sources for Supporting Decision Making Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276947100003"}
