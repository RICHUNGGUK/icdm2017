It eliminates the need of resistor ladders for reference voltages generation which requires substantial power consumption. The key to TIQ comparators design is to generate 2 '' - 1 different sized TIQ comparators for an n-bit A/D converter. This paper presents a highly efficient TIQ comparator design methodology based on an analytical model as well as SPICE simulation experimental model. One can find any sets of TIQ comparators efficiently using the proposed method. A 6-bit TIQ A/D converter has been designed in a 0.18 mu m standard CMOS technology using the proposed method, and compared to the previous measured results in order to verify the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Highly Efficient Comparator Design Automation for TIQ Flash A/D Converter", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800002"}
