The modeling task has been incorporated by the use of concrete durability model 'DuCOM' developed by our research group at University of Tokyo as a finite element computational platform on which the effect of oxygen on corrosion in relation to water/cement ratio, concrete cover, chloride concentration and various environmental humidity conditions is analyzed in both space and time domains. The developed comprehensive model involving a variety of materials and environmental variables will help in profound understanding of oxygen controlled corrosion reactions in reinforced concrete structures based on primary scientific laws and principles.
