Thus new methods are needed to improve the medical image compression performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient coding algorithm called OSS (Optimal Subband Shift) scheme based on the RB-IWT (Reversible Biorthogonal Integer Wavelet Transform). In the new scheme, the original image is first decomposed by the RB-IWT. Then, the image coefficients of every sub-band are multiplied by the powers of two. Finally, the SPECK coding is applied. Experimental results show that the OSS scheme does not only provide the PSNR performance better than SPECK using the original RB-IWT without the subband shift, but also has the low coding complexity. So this idea is valuable for future research in medical image coding and its applications.", "paper_title": "Embedded reversible medical image compression using Integer Wavelet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300076"}
