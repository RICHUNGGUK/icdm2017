The main difference of this paper from previous works in literature is that the time delay can be unbounded and non-differential. Moreover, the pinning control problem of such neural networks is also investigated. Some sufficient criteria for synchronization are given by means of the linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, numerical simulations are also given to show the validity of the obtained criteria. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
