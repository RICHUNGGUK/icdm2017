A new DEA model for handling crisp data using fuzzy concept is proposed. The model which is equivalent to a traditional DEA model is then extended to incorporate situations whereby some inputs, in a fuzzy sense, are almost discretionary variables. With this relationship, a new perspective of viewing and exploring other DEA models is now made possible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
