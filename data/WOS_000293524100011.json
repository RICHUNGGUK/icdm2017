We outline an Integer Linear Programming formulation whose relaxed version can be minimized globally in polynomial time. Because of the high number of optimization variables, the key algorithmic challenge lies in efficiently solving the linear program. We present a performance analysis of several Linear Programming algorithms on our problem. Furthermore, we introduce a multiresolution strategy which allows the matching of higher resolution models.", "paper_title": "Large-Scale Integer Linear Programming for Orientation Preserving 3D Shape Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000293524100011"}
