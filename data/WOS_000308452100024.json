Interactive information systems, introduced in this paper, play the important role in this modeling. Moreover, the proposed approach opens a new research direction in rough set theory. In this approach, partial information about the environment used for the approximation of concepts is changing dynamically in a network of interacting information systems contrary to static information systems typically used in rough set theory so far. In particular, we illustrate the use of such information systems for representation of actions or plans, their (changing in time) pre and post conditions. These information systems create a starting point for perception modeling, i.e., modeling of the process of understanding of sensory measurements. We also propose interactive grammars as a tool for modeling interactive computations in perception based computing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
