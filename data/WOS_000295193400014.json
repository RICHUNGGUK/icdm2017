The aim of this paper is to propose a discrete version of this method to determine a schedule that minimizes sum of the linear earliness and quadratic tardiness in the hybrid flowshops scheduling problem with simultaneously considering effects of sequence-dependent setup times and limited waiting time. In other word we assume that the waiting time for each job between two consecutive stages cannot be greater than a given upper bound. Also for this problem, a mixed integer program is formulated. Computational results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms for problems with different structures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
