We use Navier-Stokes equations as a case study to show our ideas and methods. Students are allowed to interact with one another and engage in realistic collaborative exercises. The resulting technology is a testbed that reflects the benefits of a schoolhouse for training and education, especially for scientific abstract concepts, yet does not have the physical limitation that instructors, students and resources be collocated both spatially and temporally. Our innovative use of computational steering and interactive visualization allows students to visualize and manipulate the physical process, and understand the abstract concept through entertainment.
