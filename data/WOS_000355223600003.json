We consider a transparent optical network operating in the nonlinear transmission regime and using the latest software adapted coherent optical techniques. We separate the problem into one of routing, modulation adaption and channel assignment, followed by channel spectral assignment, and launch power allocation. It is shown, for three test networks, that the launch power allocation and channel spectral assignment can improve the transmission SNR margin over the fixed modulation, fixed power, fully loaded link worst case by approximately 3-4 dB. This increase in SNR margin can be utilized through modulation format adaption to increase the overall network throughput. This paper highlights that increased gains in network throughput can be achieved in nonlinear impaired networks when individual transmitter spectral assignment and launch power are optimized to minimize the nonlinear interference.", "paper_title": "Routing, modulation, spectrum and launch power assignment to maximize the traffic throughput of a nonlinear optical mesh network", "paper_id": "WOS:000355223600003"}
