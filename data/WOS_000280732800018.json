Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts the calculation method of variable specific heat, taking the variation of gas-oil ratios and discharge pressure into account, and establishes a nonlinear dynamic simulative model of biaxial gas turbine considering about the inertia of volume based on MATLAB/SIMULINK. Findings - The simulation result, compared with test data, shows that this simulative model is more accurate to reflect the system's dynamic characteristics. Research limitations/implications - The hot inertial has not been taken into account. Meanwhile, the quantity of data is less, so this paper adopts interpolation method. Practical implications - It is used to simulate calculation of gas turbines. Originality/value - This paper adopts the calculation method of variable specific heat, considering the effect of the gas-oil ratio variation and the discharge pressure variation (the total pressure of discharge duct) on the system.", "paper_title": "Research on performance simulative models of gas turbines", "paper_id": "WOS:000280732800018"}
