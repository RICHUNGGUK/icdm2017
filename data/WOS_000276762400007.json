It is shown that an optimal solution sampling can be derived using appropriate norms of the Navier-Stokes residuals. Then the classical Galerkin approach is derived in the context of a residual minimization method that is similar to variational multiscale modeling. Finally, calibration techniques are reviewed and applied to the computation of unsteady aerodynamic forces. Examples pertaining to both non-actuated and actuated flows are shown.
