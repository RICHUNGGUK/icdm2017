Ground delay programs are air traffic flow management initiatives put in place when airport arrival demand is expected to exceed arrival capacity for an extended length of time, e.g. 4 h. Most of the problems we study can be modeled as assignment problems, where flights are assigned to arrival slots. In the context we analyze, however, these problems have important special structure, which allows us to develop special solution properties. In particular, solutions are measured both in terms of efficiency (delay minimization) and equity (delay distribution). We show that the theory of majorization provides a powerful tool in addressing solution equity. We consider problems with flight deletions and develop special solution properties and parametric methods. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
