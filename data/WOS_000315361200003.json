We show that each vertex in such a game has a value (i.e., an equilibrium probability), and we classify the conditions under which optimal strategies exist. Further, we show how to compute epsilon-optimal strategies in finite games and provide detailed complexity estimations. Moreover, we show how to compute epsilon-optimal strategies in infinite games with finite branching and bounded rates where the bound as well as the successors of a given state are effectively computable. Finally, we show how to compute optimal strategies in finite uniform games. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
