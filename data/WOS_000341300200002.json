The aim of this paper is to develop some techniques for group decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy preference information. Based on the multiplicative consistency of intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation, three algorithms are proposed for intuitionistic fuzzy group decision making. In the case that the decision makers act as separate individuals, the priority vector of each decision maker can be derived directly from the individual intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation, after which an overall priority vector is obtained by synthesizing those individual priorities together. As for the scenario that the decision makers act as one individual, two different algorithms based on the multiplicative consistency are proposed to deal with this case. The main idea of the former procedure is firstly constructing a social intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation, while that of the later is building a fractional programming model. Some practical examples are given to demonstrate the developed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Some Algorithms for Group Decision Making with Intuitionistic Fuzzy Preference Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000341300200002"}
