The EUREF guidelines propose to do this daily using the AAPMtg18-QC pattern. In this paper we report our initial results with the use of an alternative, recently developed, dynamic pattern (\"MoniQA\") and a scoring scheme. As soon as the observers are familiar with the procedure, the measurements are very stable and we could not observe big variations in the quality of the monitor. In order to control the intrinsic quality of the monitor, the number of quality control checks could thus be reduced. The global working condition (such as the ambient light level) is controlled as well with the proposed procedure and this may be of great interest, especially during the start-up of digital mammography (screening) units: it is very informative to trace the influences of different light sources (such as (occasional) viewing boxes).", "paper_title": "Initial results of the daily quality control of medical screen devices using a dynamic pattern in a digital mammography environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900056"}
