We show that a succinct representation of the binary relation permits much better results, while using less space than traditional methods. We apply our results not only to conjunctive queries on binary relations, but also to queries on semi-structured documents such as XML documents or file-system indexes, using a variant of an adaptive algorithm used to solve conjunctive queries on binary relations.
