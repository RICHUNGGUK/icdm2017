Previously determined reaction mechanisms were explored by more detailed insight into changes of electronic properties using omega B97XD functional and MP2 method with 6-311++G(2df,2pd) basis set and CCSD/6-31(+)G(d,p) approach. The dependences of all examined properties on reaction coordinate give more detailed understanding of the hydration process.", "paper_title": "Exploration of various electronic properties along the reaction coordinate for hydration of Pt(II) and Ru(II) complexes; the CCSD, MPx, and DFT computational study", "paper_id": "WOS:000328205700012"}
