The new algorithm uses the stochastic ranking constraint-handling technique, realizs local search using clonal proliferation and clonal selection, and global search using clonal deletion. The experimental results on ten benchmark problems show, compared with the (mu, lambda) evolutionary strategies adopting stochastic ranking technique and dynamic penalty function method, ICSCES has the ability of significantly improving the search performance both in convergence speed and precision.", "paper_title": "Immune clonal selection evolutionary strategy for constrained optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500070"}
