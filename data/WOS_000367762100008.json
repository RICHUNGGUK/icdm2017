For the verification purposes, one is usually interested only in the sequences of interactions fair I/O automata offer to their environment. These sequences are called fair traces. The usual approach to the verification consists in proving fair trace inclusion between fair I/O automata. This paper presents a simple approach to the specification of fair traces and shows how to establish a fair trace inclusion relation for a pair of fair 110 automata by using the temporal logic of actions.", "paper_title": "Specifying and Verifying External Behaviour of Fair Input/Output Automata by Using the Temporal Logic of Actions", "paper_id": "WOS:000367762100008"}
