This algorithm is based on the current-carrying definition of backbone and carried out on the predetermined spanning cluster, which is assumed to be a resistor network. The scaling exponents so obtained for backbone mass, red bonds, and conductivity are in very good agreement with some existing results. The perfectly balanced bonds in 3D backbone structures are predicted first time to be 0.00179 +/- 0.00009 and 0.00604 +/- 0.00008 of the backbone mass for bond and site percolations, respectively.", "paper_title": "PRECISE DETERMINATION OF BACKBONE STRUCTURE AND CONDUCTIVITY OF 3D PERCOLATION NETWORKS BY THE DIRECT ELECTRIFYING ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000264633600007"}
