In our work, finding the transitions between consecutive movement primitives is treated as multiclass classification problem. We show how the goal parameters of linear attractor movement primitives can be learned from manually segmented and labeled demonstrations and how the observed movement primitive order can help to improve the movement reproduction. The improvement is achieved by restricting the classification result to the currently activated movement primitive and its possible successors in a graph representation of the sequence, which is also learned from the demonstrations. The approach is validated with three experiments using a Barrett WAM robot. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
