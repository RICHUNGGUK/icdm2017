The technique is based on the decomposition of the kinematic fields into a component related to the deformation of the solid portion of the element and one related to the rigid-body motion due to a displacement discontinuity. This decomposition simplifies the incorporation of discontinuity interfaces and provides a suitable framework to account for non-uniform discontinuity modes. The present publication addresses two families of finite element formulations: displacement-based and stress hybrid finite element. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
