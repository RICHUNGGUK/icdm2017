Real-time performance and high recognition rates are of crucial importance to these applications. In this brief, we propose a novel method for real-time keypoint recognition using restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). RBMs are generative models that can learn probability distributions of many different types of data including labeled and unlabeled data sets. Due to the inherent noise of the training data sets, we use an RBM to model statistical distributions of the training data. Furthermore, the learned RBM can be used as a competitive classifier to recognize the keypoints in real-time during the tracking stage, thus making it advantageous to be employed in applications that require real-time performance. Experiments have been conducted under a variety of conditions to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Keypoint Recognition Using Restricted Boltzmann Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000344089300015"}
