The efficient mapping of streaming parallelism to today's multicore systems is, however, highly dependent on the program and underlying architecture. We address this by developing a portable and automatic compiler-based approach to partitioning streaming programs using machine learning. Our technique predicts the ideal partition structure for a given streaming application using prior knowledge learned offline. Using the predictor we rapidly search the program space (without executing any code) to generate and select a good partition. We applied this technique to standard StreamIt applications and compared against existing approaches. On a 4-core platform, our approach achieves 60% of the best performance found by iteratively compiling and executing over 3000 different partitions per program. We obtain, on average, a 1.90x speedup over the already tuned partitioning scheme of the StreamIt compiler. When compared against a state-of-the-art analytical, model-based approach, we achieve, on average, a 1.77x performance improvement. By porting our approach to an 8-core platform, we are able to obtain 1.8x improvement over the StreamIt default scheme, demonstrating the portability of our approach.", "paper_title": "Using Machine Learning to Partition Streaming Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000324488500011"}
