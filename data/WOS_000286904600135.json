While E-brokerages have become a significant sector of E-commerce, theory and guidelines for matching the multi-attribute exchange in E-brokerage are sparse. This paper presents an approach to optimize the matching of one-shot multi-attribute exchanges with quantity discounts. Firstly, based on the conception and definition of matching degree and quantity discount, a multi-objective optimization model is proposed to maximize the matching degree and trade volume. This model belongs to a class of multi-objective nonlinear transportation problems and cannot be solved effectively by conventional methods, especially when large-scale problems are involved. Hence, secondly, a novel hybrid multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithm named multi-objective simulated annealing genetic algorithm (MOSAGA) has been developed to solve the proposed model. Finally, the computational results and analyses of some numerical problems are given to illustrate the application and performance of the proposed model and algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
