Our findings showed that this real-time interactive aerial view (both small and large) during the encoding and retrieval of spatial information seems to led to a greater sense of presence. It is argued that the use of this aerial view, which provides a real-time allocentric viewpoint-dependent spatial representation, would ease the translation of a stored allocentric representation into an egocentric one, and this process, consequently, would help individuals to feel present in space.", "paper_title": "Being Present In Space: The Role Of Allocentric And Egocentric Reference Frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000375005900013"}
