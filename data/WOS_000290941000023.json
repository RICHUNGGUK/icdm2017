The sender applies NC technique to combine the lost packets of different terminals, so that multiple terminals can recover their lost packets via per transmission from the sender. The proposed algorithm combines the advantage of FEC scheme and NC based ARQ scheme so as to maximize not only wireless throughput but also video quality for broadcast communication. Simulation results show that our algorithm significantly improves both wireless throughput efficiency and video quality, compared with ARQ and HARQ schemes.", "paper_title": "A network coding based hybrid ARQ algorithm for wireless video broadcast", "paper_id": "WOS:000290941000023"}
