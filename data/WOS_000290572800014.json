Such time varying effects are normally not considered in the design or retrofit of heat exchangers networks. In this paper, the importance of taking into account such effects is demonstrated, by means of a case study. An existing industrial PHT network is simulated using a dynamic, distributed mathematical model for shell-and-tube heat exchangers undergoing crude oil fouling. To systematically assess the impact of fouling at the network level, several key performance indicators are proposed and used to analyse three retrofit options aimed at maximising overall heat recovery. Simulation results show that network designs that maximise energy recovery at steady state are not the best when fouling occurs. It is concluded that a proper retrofit design must include consideration of time varying fouling effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
