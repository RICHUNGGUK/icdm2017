As a pre-processing procedure, the adaptive morphological filter cleans an ECG signal to prepare it for further analysis. The noiseless ECG signal is embedded within a two-dimensional phase space to form a binary image and the identification of the feature waveforms is carried out based on the information presented by the image. The classification of the feature waveforms is implemented by an adaptive clustering technique according to the geometric information represented by the image in the phase space. Simulation studies on ECG records from the MIT-BIH and BIDMC databases have demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
