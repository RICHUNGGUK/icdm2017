To formulate a web warehouse, a four-layer web warehouse architecture for decision support is firstly proposed. According to the layered web warehouse framework architecture, an extraction-fusion-mapping-loading (EFML) process model for web warehouse construction is then constructed. In the web warehouse process model, a series of web services including wrapper service, mediation service, ontology service and mapping service are used. Particularly, two kinds of mediators are introduced to fuse the heterogeneous web information. Finally, a simple case study is presented to illustrate the construction process of web warehouse.
