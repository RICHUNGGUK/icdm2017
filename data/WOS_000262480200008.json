The algorithm works with a global matching stereo model based on an energy-minimization framework. The global energy contains two terms, the data term and the smoothness term. The data term is first approximated by a color-weighted correlation, then refined in occluded and low-texture areas in a repeated application of a hierarchical loopy belief propagation algorithm. The experimental results are evaluated on the Middlebury data sets, showing that our algorithm is the top performer among all the algorithms listed there.", "paper_title": "Stereo Matching with Color-Weighted Correlation, Hierarchical Belief Propagation, and Occlusion Handling", "paper_id": "WOS:000262480200008"}
