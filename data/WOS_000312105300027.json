GWASTools brings the interactive capability and extensive statistical libraries of R to GWAS. Data are stored in NetCDF format to accommodate extremely large datasets that cannot fit within R's memory limits. The documentation includes instructions for converting data from multiple formats, including variants called from sequencing. GWASTools provides a convenient interface for linking genotypes and intensity data with sample and single nucleotide polymorphism annotation. Availability and implementation: GWASTools is implemented in R and is available from Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org). An extensive vignette detailing a recommended work flow is included.", "paper_title": "GWASTools: an R/Bioconductor package for quality control and analysis of genome-wide association studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000312105300027"}
