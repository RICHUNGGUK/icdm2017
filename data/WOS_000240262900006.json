Since the body pose (and configuration) can be estimated by partial components of the silhouette, a robust statistical method is applied to extract useful information from these components. In this method a Gaussian Process model is used to create each sub-manifold corresponding to the component of input data in advance. A sub-manifold voting strategy is then applied to infer the pose structure based on these sub-manifolds. Experiments show that our approach has a great ability to estimate human poses from polluted silhouettes with small computational burden.", "paper_title": "Human pose estimation from polluted silhouettes using sub-manifold voting strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900006"}
