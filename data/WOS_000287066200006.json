Our framework is composed of non-deterministic semantic structures and distance-based considerations. This combination leads to a variety of entailment relations that can be used for reasoning about non-deterministic phenomena and are inconsistency-tolerant. We investigate the basic properties of these entailments, as well as some of their computational aspects, and demonstrate their usefulness in the context of model-based diagnostic systems.
