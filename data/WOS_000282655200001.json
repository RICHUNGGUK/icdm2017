The mosquito population was modeled using an individual-based approach. The model consists of agents representing A. aegypti mosquitoes, human beings, some mammals and objects found in urban environments such as walls and water containers. We describe the model which was implemented by multi-agent systems in the Repast framework. Simulations were performed and the results were compared with those obtained in a biological experiment, and data obtained from a local Zoonozes control center. Comparisons between real and simulated data showed high correlation indices. We simulated cases to study whether or not an artificial trap can be effectively used as an active based population control measure. We studied how the number of traps and their localization can affect the population dynamics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
