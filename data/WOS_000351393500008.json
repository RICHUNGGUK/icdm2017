The information sharing in such a system is very inflexible, as all peer parties access the same set of data exported by a party, while the party may want to authorize different peer parties to access different portions of its information. We propose a novel query evaluation scheme that supports differentiated access control with decentralized query processing. A new efficient join method, named split-join, along with other safe join methods is adopted in the query planning algorithm. The generated query execution reduces the communication cost by pushing partial query computation to data sources in a safe way. The proofs of the correctness and safety of the algorithm are presented. The evaluation demonstrates that the scheme significantly saves the communication cost in a variety of circumstances and settings while enforcing autonomous and differentiated information sharing effectively.", "paper_title": "Enforcement of Autonomous Authorizations in Collaborative Distributed Query Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351393500008"}
