The proposed implementation of the algorithm is very regular. Further, its realization depends on a design parameter, that permits different tradeoffs between speed and area to be chosen. For example, we can fix this parameter to obtain a feasible SN with n inputs and 0(log(n)) elaboration time with a reasonable multiplicative constant. Comparisons with previous works show that under some metrics for a wide range of values of n we obtain the best results. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
