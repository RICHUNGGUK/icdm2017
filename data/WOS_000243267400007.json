When some doubts may arise, then an explicit calculation of this capacity must be carried out. This paper presents a theoretical model for the calculation of plastic rotation, considering the influence of the main factors. Some results are presented on the basis of the model, and conclusions are drawn. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
