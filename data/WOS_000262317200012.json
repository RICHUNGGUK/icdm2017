We start with a highly optimized implementation of interference testing between two stationary ellipsoids based on an algebraic condition described in terms of the signs of roots of the characteristic equation of two ellipsoids. Then, we derive a time-dependent characteristic equation for two moving ellipsoids, which enables us to develop an efficient algorithm for computing the time intervals in which two moving ellipsoids collide. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with practical examples.", "paper_title": "Continuous Collision Detection for Ellipsoids", "paper_id": "WOS:000262317200012"}
