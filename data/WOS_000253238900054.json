This tool integrates modules that dynamically capture user models, determine lists of activities that can provide more utility to a user given the past experience of the system with similar users, and generates plans that can be executed by the user. This system is intended to work in portable devices (mobile phones, PDAs, etc.,) with internet connection. In this paper, we describe the architecture, the knowledge model that is shared among components using an ontology, and the three components of the tool: user module, case-based module and planning module.
