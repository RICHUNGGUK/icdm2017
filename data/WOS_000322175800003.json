This work on conceptual design uses a family of representations called structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. The SBF family ranges from behavior-function models of abstract design patterns to drawing-shape-SBF models that couple SBF models with visuospatial knowledge of technological systems. Development of SBF modeling is an instance of cognitively oriented artificial intelligence research that seeks to understand human cognition and build intelligent agents for addressing complex tasks such as design. This paper first traces the development of SBF modeling as our perspective on design evolved from that of problem solving to that of memory and learning. Next, the development of SBF modeling as a case study is used to abstract some of the core principles of an artificial intelligence methodology for functional modeling. Finally, some implications of the artificial intelligence methodology for different meanings of function are examined.", "paper_title": "A 30-year case study and 15 principles: Implications of an artificial intelligence methodology for functional modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000322175800003"}
