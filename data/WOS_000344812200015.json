However, drivers often have different perceptions about the traffic state on different road sections, since their expectations on traffic state vary more or less from each other on different road sections. In particular, under the vehicle networking, out of considerations for safety and other relevant factors, requirements for the correlation and coordination of running vehicles have also raised significantly. Therefore, it is necessary to take driver's perception about the driving conditions of certain road sections into consideration to adjust the release of traffic state. This paper has provided a comprehensive traffic state evaluation model linked with driver's perception under the vehicle networking. The authors first establish an ANFIS model based on the T-S model and then conduct statistical analysis on drivers' perceptions about certain traffic state. At last, the authors use the results of statistical analysis as regulatory factors to amend the parameters input through ANFIS. Through simulation, this paper has demonstrated that the model established has a high rate of convergence, a high identification precision and the generalization ability to conduct researches on the identification of traffic state.", "paper_title": "Research on the comprehensive traffic state evaluation model linked with drivers' perception under the vehicle networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000344812200015"}
