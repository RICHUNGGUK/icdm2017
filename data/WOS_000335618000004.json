If created in careful accordance to design principles, multimedia can serve as a tool to improve preservice teacher knowledge in this domain. The present experimental study investigated a multimedia-based intervention, which pairs a modeling video with a Content Acquisition Podcast (i.e., video plus CAP), to teach preservice teachers (n = 101) about an effective vocabulary intervention for students at risk for or with learning disabilities. Preservice teachers were randomly assigned to either watch a video plus CAP or read a practitioner-friendly reading on vocabulary instruction. Those who watched the video plus CAP significantly outperformed the comparison group on a posttest and maintenance test of knowledge.
