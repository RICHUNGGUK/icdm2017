In solving this problem, we obtain the insight from the pattern drafting theory in the clothing field. We abstract the drafting process into a computer module, which takes the garment type and primary body sizes then produces the draft as the output. Then the problem is reduced to find out the garment type and primary body sizes. We find that information by analyzing the silhouette of the garment with respect to the mannequin. The method works robustly and produces practically usable virtual clothes that can be used for the graphical coordination.
