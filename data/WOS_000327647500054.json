In this paper, we present a new affinity model for spectral segmentation based on midlevel cues. In contrast to most existing methods that operate directly on low-level cues, we first oversegment the image into superpixel images and then integrate the geodesic line edge and intensity cue to form the similarity matrix W so that it more accurately describes the similarity between data. The geodesic line edge could avoid strong boundary and represent the true boundary between two superpixels while the mean red green blue vector could describe the intensity of superpixels better. As far as we know, this is a totally new kind of affinity model to represent superpixels. Based on this model, we use the spectral clustering in the superpixel level and then achieve the image segmentation in the pixel level. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs steadily and well on various natural images. The evaluation comparisons also prove that our method achieves comparable accuracy and significantly performs better than most state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Spectral Segmentation via Midlevel Cues Integrating Geodesic and Intensity", "paper_id": "WOS:000327647500054"}
