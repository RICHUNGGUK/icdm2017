Among other contributions that this work intends to bring to natural language processing research, the use of a more biologically plausible connectionist architecture and training for automatic summarization is emphasized. The choice relies on the expectation that it may bring an increase in computational efficiency when compared to the sa-called biologically implausible algorithms.", "paper_title": "SAB(IO): A BIOLOGICALLY PLAUSIBLE CONNECTIONIST APPROACH TO AUTOMATIC TEXT SUMMARIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000260173300003"}
