We present a sequential quantile forecasting model based on the combination of a set of elementary nearest neighbor-type predictors called \"experts\" and show its consistency under a minimum of conditions. Our approach builds on the methodology developed in recent years for prediction of individual sequences and exploits the quantile structure as a minimizer of the so-called pinball loss function. We perform an in-depth analysis of real-world data sets and show that this nonparametric strategy generally outperforms standard quantile prediction methods.", "paper_title": "Sequential Quantile Prediction of Time Series", "paper_id": "WOS:000287657200031"}
