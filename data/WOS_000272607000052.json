First, a centralized control that needs the state measurements of all subsystems is designed. Then a decentralized control using the local state measurements is obtained by adding a control component aimed at compensating for the interconnections. Finally, an adaptive output-feedback decentralized control based on an RFNN is designed. In design of such controller, no separated state estimator is needed, since the controller dynamics is embedded in the recurrent network. Practical tracking is established by invoking Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulation and experimental results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed control law.
