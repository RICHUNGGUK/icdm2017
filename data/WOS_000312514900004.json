We propose a solution to describe a complete set of structural constraints for a particular business object in all its use cases. To implement our solution we use XML Schema (XSD), de facto standard for description of web service message structure. We propose XSD extensions that realize two distinct and complementary approaches. Measurements have shown that by using our extensions the average complexity of real world schemas (XSD documents) comparing to expressional equivalent alternatives is smaller by similar to 29%.
