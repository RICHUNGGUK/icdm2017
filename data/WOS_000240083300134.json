Based on DM algorithm, this paper presents an improved deadline-based algorithm, Deadline Monotonic with Urgent Message Considered (DMUMC), for FF control network message scheduling. The main idea of DMUMC is that deadline of urgent aperiodic message, such as alarms, was taken into account when establishing BAT. The simulation results show that DMUMC algorithm significantly reduces response time of urgent aperiodic message by adjusting service time of low priority periodic message with large deadline, and improves timeliness and message schedulability of FF control network, compared with traditional methods that didn't consider the issue of aperiodic message.", "paper_title": "An improved deadline-based message scheduling algorithm for real-time control network", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300134"}
