Network nodes frequently employ directional antennas to improve spatial throughput. In such networks, between two nodes, it is of interest to compute a path with a channel assignment for the links Such that the path and link bandwidths are the same. This is achieved when any two consecutive links are assigned different channels, termed as \"Channel-Discontinuity-Constraint\" (CDC). CDC-paths are also useful in TDMA systems, where, preferably, consecutive links are assigned different time-slots. In the first part of this paper, we develop a t-spanner for CDC-paths using spatial properties; a sub-network containing 0(n10) links, for any 0 > 0, such that CDC-paths increase in cost by at most a factor t = (1 2 sin(0/2))(-2). We propose a novel distributed algorithm to compute the spanner using an expected number of 0(n log n) fixed-size messages. In the second part, we present a distributed algorithm to find minimum-cost CDC-paths between two nodes using 0(n(2)) fixed-size messages, by developing an extension of Edmonds' algorithm for minimum-cost perfect matching. In a centralized implementation, our algorithm runs in 0(n(2)) time improving the previous best algorithm which requires 0(n(3)) running time. Moreover, this running time improves to 0(n/0) when used in conjunction with the spanner developed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
