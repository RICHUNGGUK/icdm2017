Thus, it involves new needs for enhanced decision support. An efficient situation awareness system has to quickly detect and identify suspicious boats. The efficiency of such a system relies on a reliable sensor fusion since a coastguard uses sensors to achieve his mission. We present an innovative approach based on multi-agent negotiation to fuse classifiers, benefiting from the efficiency of existing classification tools and from the flexibility and reliability of a multi-agent system to exploit distributed data across dispersed sources. We developed a first prototype using a basic negotiation protocol in order to validate the feasibility and the interest of our approach. The results obtained are promising and encourage us to continue on this way.", "paper_title": "Enhanced maritime situation awareness with negotiator agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000237044300002"}
