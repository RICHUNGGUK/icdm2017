Knowledge discovery in databases is a process of discovering knowledge along with its validity, novelty, and potentiality. Various genetic-based feature selection algorithms with their pros and cons are discussed in this article. Rule (a kind of high-level representation of knowledge) discovery from databases, posed as single and multiobjective problems is a difficult optimization problem. Here, we present a review of some of the genetic-based classification rule discovery methods based on fidelity criterion. The intractable nature of fuzzy rule mining using single and multiobjective genetic algorithms reported in the literatures is reviewed. An extensive list of relevant and useful references are given for further research.
