A design method for a robust controller, based on Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT), has been presented in this paper. For a two-area power system, the simulation results show that the system response with the proposed QFT controller exhibits transient response beyond PI controllers. It is also shown that the transient response of the tie line power can also be improved.", "paper_title": "Decentralized robust load-frequency control of power system based on quantitative feedback theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000292016500001"}
