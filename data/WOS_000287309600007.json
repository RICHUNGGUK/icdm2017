This network is based on an aptamer-fused short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against a single mRNA encoding both a EGFP reporter gene and the repressor tTR-KRAB, which, in turn, represses transcription of the shRNA. The activity of the shRNA can be controlled by an inducer molecule (theophylline) which prevents the aptamer-fused shRNA to be properly processed. Repression of the tTR-KRAB can be relieved by treatment with doxycyline. This reciprocal negative feedback loop can exhibit a bistable response, as shown through the mathematical analysis performed here. Specifically, the network can be controlled to induce sustained expression of a shRNA, or the reporter gene, with a transient input of two different inducer molecules.", "paper_title": "Design and Construction of a Versatile Synthetic Network for Bistable Gene Expression in Mammalian Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000287309600007"}
