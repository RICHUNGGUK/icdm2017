We use the Lovasz local lemma to show the following two results about colourings ? of the edges of the complete graph Kn. If for each vertex v of Kn the colouring ? assigns each colour to at most (n - 2)/(22.4?2) edges emanating from v, then there is a copy of G in Kn which is properly edge-coloured by ?. This improves on a result of Alon, Jiang, Miller, and Pritikin [Random Struct. Algorithms 23(4), 409433, 2003]. On the other hand, if ? assigns each colour to at most n/(51?2) edges of Kn, then there is a copy of G in Kn such that each edge of G receives a different colour from ?. This proves a conjecture of Frieze and Krivelevich [Electron. J. Comb. 15(1), R59, 2008]. Our proofs rely on a framework developed by Lu and Szekely [Electron. J. Comb. 14(1), R63, 2007] for applying the local lemma to random injections. In order to improve the constants in our results we use a version of the local lemma due to Bissacot, Fernandez, Procacci, and Scoppola [preprint, arXiv:0910.1824]. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
