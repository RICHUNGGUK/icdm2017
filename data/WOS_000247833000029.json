There is great concern about it within the face recognition community. We point out that optimizing the Fisher index in linear discriminant analysis does not necessarily give the best performance for a face recognition system. We propose a new regularization scheme. The proposed method is evaluated using the Olivetti Research Laboratory database, the Yale database, and the Feret database.", "paper_title": "Face recognition by regularized discriminant analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000247833000029"}
