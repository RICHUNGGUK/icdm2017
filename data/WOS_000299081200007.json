A backbone-k-coloring of (G,H) is a mapping f: V(G)->{1,2,aEuro broken vertical bar,k} such that |f(u)-f(v)|a parts per thousand yen2 if uvaE(H) and |f(u)-f(v)|a parts per thousand yen1 if uvaE(G)\\E(H). The backbone chromatic number of (G,H) is the smallest integer k such that (G,H) has a backbone-k-coloring. In this paper, we characterize the backbone chromatic number of Halin graphs G=Ta(a)C with respect to given spanning trees T. Also we study the backbone coloring for other special graphs such as complete graphs, wheels, graphs with small maximum average degree, graphs with maximum degree 3, etc.", "paper_title": "On backbone coloring of graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000299081200007"}
