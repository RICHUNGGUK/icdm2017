Most of the relevance feedback approaches limit the utilization of the user's feedback to a single search session, performing a short-term learning. In this paper we present a novel approach for short and long term learning, based on the definition of an adaptive similarity metric and of a high level representation of the images. For short-term learning, the relevant and non-relevant information given by the user during the feedback process is employed to create a positive and a negative subspace of the feature space. For long-term learning, the feedback history of all the users is exploited to create and update a representation of the images which is adopted for improving retrieval performance and progressively reducing the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantic concepts. The experimental results prove that the proposed method outperforms many other state of art methods in the short-term learning, and demonstrate the efficacy of the representation adopted for the long-term learning.", "paper_title": "Mixture of KL subspaces for relevance feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000253522600005"}
