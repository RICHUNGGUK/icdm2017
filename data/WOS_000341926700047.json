In the proposed framework, bat algorithm, as a new optimization algorithm, is employed to explore the problem search space globally. In addition, a newly introduced adaptive modification method is developed to improve the variety of the bat population when increasing the convergence speed simultaneously. This modification is constructed based on the roulette wheel mechanism in conjunction with the crossover and mutation operators from the genetic algorithm. At the end of paper, the superiority of the proposed framework is examined using the IEEE 10-unit and 40-unit test systems.", "paper_title": "An intelligent approach based on bat algorithm for solving economic dispatch with practical constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000341926700047"}
