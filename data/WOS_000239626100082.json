In this virtual environment, all e-learning resources and web services are bound via service encapsulation, and a special collaboration service layer undertakes the robust collaborative learning, moreover, the agents and mobile agents are applied to autonomous collaboration, and to management persistency of the virtual world. As for collaboration, the Locking Service, Context Awareness Service, etc are introduced to maintain efficiency of collaboration activities; two agents of learning roles are responsible for actual learning interactions, and the Session Agent has the ability of migrating among hosts to finish learning goals as well as maximize resource utilization. The GT4.0, JADE and a WS proxy are used to implement all functions. The result suggests it will be a more scalable and robust collaborative learning architecture.", "paper_title": "Towards an Agent-based robust Collaborative Virtual Environment for E-learning in the service grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100082"}
