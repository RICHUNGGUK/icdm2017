Among cloud computing services, most consumers use cloud storage services that provide mass storage. This is because these services give them various additional functions as well as storage. It is easy to access cloud storage services using smartphones. With increasing utilization, it is possible for malicious users to abuse cloud storage services. Therefore, a study on digital forensic investigation of cloud storage services is necessary. This paper proposes new procedure for investigating and analyzing the artifacts of all accessible devices, such as Windows system, Mac system, iPhone, and Android smartphone. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
