In an attempt to apply 3D-HoVAIF into QSAR studies on antimalarial activities of 32 artemisinin derivatives, the resulting Genetic Algorithm-Partial Least Square (GA-PLS) model is confirmed to be stable and predictable by both modeling validation and methodological contrast. For external test set, the 3D-HoVAIF model has correlation coefficient (q(ext)(2)) and Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) of 0.751 and 0.372, respectively.", "paper_title": "Applying novel three-dimensional holographic vector of atomic interaction field to QSAR studies of artemisinin derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000253731900008"}
