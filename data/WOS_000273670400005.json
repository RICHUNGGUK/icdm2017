As compared with the conventional IB-LBM where the force density is computed explicitly by Hook's law or the direct forcing method and the non-slip condition is only approximately satisfied, in the present work, the force density term is considered as the velocity correction which is determined by enforcing the non-slip condition at the boundary. The lift and drag forces on the moving object can be easily calculated via the velocity correction on the boundary points. The capability of the present method for moving objects is well demonstrated through its application to simulate flows around a moving circular cylinder, a rotationally oscillating cylinder, and an elliptic flapping wing. Furthermore, the simulation of flows around a flapping flexible airfoil is carried out to exhibit the ability of the present method for implementing the elastic boundary condition. It was found that under certain conditions, the flapping flexible airfoil can generate larger propulsive force than the flapping rigid airfoil.
