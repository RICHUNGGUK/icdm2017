A Finite Element joint model to study such structures is validated modelling eight concrete panel tests. The most important feature of this model is that it has been validated with experimental tests on concrete panels which were specifically designed to fail in shear. Interface elements are used to reproduce the non linear behaviour of the joint and parameters deduced from the tests are used to define the constitutive law of these elements. This joint model is of great importance because it will permit the development of a structural model that faithfully reproduces the behaviour of these structures under combined flexure and shear and the study of its global behaviour after the opening of the joints. Interesting conclusions about the behaviour of the dry joints, about the contribution of the different mechanisms transferring shear (friction and cohesion) and about the shear stress distribution in the joint have been reached.", "paper_title": "Towards a model of dry shear keyed joints: modelling of panel tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000311128700003"}
