The conditions for the existence of cycles of lengths 4, 6, 8, and 10 in Tanner (3, 5) QC LDPC codes of length 5p are expressed in terms of polynomial equations in a 15th root of unity of the prime field F(p). By checking the existence of solutions for these equations over F(p), the girths of Tanner (3, 5) QC LDPC codes are derived.", "paper_title": "On the girth of Tanner (3,5) quasi-cyclic LDPC codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000236714000036"}
