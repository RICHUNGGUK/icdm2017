It is preferable for mesh routers to dynamically switch channels according to the accurate estimation of co-channel interference level in the neighborhood. Most developed interference estimation schemes, however, do not consider the impact of interface switching. Furthermore, the interference in wireless networks has been extensively considered as an all-or-nothing event. In this paper, we develop a weighted interference estimation scheme (WIES) for interface-switching WMN. WIES takes a new version of multi-interface conflict graph that considers the impacts of frequent interface switching as the interference relationship estimation scheme. Besides, WIES uses a weight to estimate the interference level between links. The weight utilizes two empirical functions to denote the impacts of the relative distance and characteristics of traffic loads in WMN. Extensive NS2 simulations show that WIES achieves significant performance improvements, especially when the interference level of the network is high. We also validate that the interference level of networks is affected by several system parameters such as the number of available channels and the ratio between interference range and transmission range.
