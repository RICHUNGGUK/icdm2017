These techniques use the physical point spread function (PSF) of cameras as the building block of the mathematical frames in the fusion process. Cameras producing the low-resolution images are allowed to be different, and thereby possess different PSFs. Fused image reconstructions are carried out by a dimension invariance principle and by a set of iterative reconstruction algorithms. These frame fundamental approaches are also seen to be robust to realistic fusion problems from inhomogeneous image measurements (taken at different space or time or by different cameras), which is one of the main focuses of this paper. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through both simulated and realistic examples. The results are quite encouraging.", "paper_title": "Frame Fundamental High-Resolution Image Fusion from Inhomogeneous Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000307896800015"}
