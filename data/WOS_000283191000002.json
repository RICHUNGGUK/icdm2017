The coding scheme distinguishes between identity links, predicative relations, and discourse deixis. Inter-annotator agreement on the link types is 85-89% above chance, and we provide an analysis of the sources of disagreement. The resulting corpora make it possible to train and test learning-based algorithms for automatic coreference resolution, as well as to carry out bottom-up linguistic descriptions of coreference relations as they occur in real data.", "paper_title": "AnCora-CO: Coreferentially annotated corpora for Spanish and Catalan", "paper_id": "WOS:000283191000002"}
