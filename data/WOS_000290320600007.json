They provide evidence of the past and enable archaeologists to obtain qualified conclusion. Nowadays, many artifacts are scanned by 3D scanners. While convenient in many aspects, the 3D representation is often unsuitable for further analysis, due to flaws in the scanning process or defects in the original artifacts. We propose a new approach for automatic processing of scanned artifacts. It is based on the definition of a new direction field on surfaces (a normalized vector field), termed the prominent field. The prominent field is oriented with respect to the prominent feature curves of the surface. We demonstrate the applicability of the prominent field in two applications. The first is surface enhancement of archaeological artifacts, which helps enhance eroded features and remove scanning noise. The second is artificial coloring that can replace manual artifact illustration in archaeological reports.", "paper_title": "Prominent Field for Shape Processing and Analysis of Archaeological Artifacts", "paper_id": "WOS:000290320600007"}
