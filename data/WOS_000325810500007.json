Our aim is to construct an optimum replacement policy for the components of the system by minimizing total number of replacements or total replacement cost. We represent the problem with dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). We prove that under the existence of a predetermined threshold reliability, performing replacements at periods when the system reliability just falls below the threshold assures optimum replacement times. Four component selection approaches and their cost focused versions are proposed to choose the component to replace and are tested on a complex dynamic problem. Their performances are analyzed under various threshold and cost levels.", "paper_title": "Replacement policies for a complex system with unobservable components using dynamic Bayesian networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325810500007"}
