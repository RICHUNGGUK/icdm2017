Therefore, a particularly customized stochastic Runge-Kutta method is introduced. Order conditions for convergence with order 1.0 in the mean-square sense are calculated and coefficients for some schemes are presented. The proposed schemes are stiffly accurate and applicable to nonlinear stochastic differential-algebraic equations. As an advantage they do not require the calculation of any pseudo-inverses or projectors. Further, the mean-square stability of the proposed schemes is analyzed and simulation results are presented bringing out their good performance.", "paper_title": "A Runge-Kutta method for index 1 stochastic differential-algebraic equations with scalar noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000305405200010"}
