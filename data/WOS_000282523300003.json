Although various reported classification schemes show impressive performance, most existing gene selection methods are suboptimal and are not well-matched to the unique characteristics of the multicategory classification problem. Matched design of the gene selection method and a committee classifier is needed for identifying a small set of gene markers that achieve accurate multicategory classification while being both statistically reproducible and biologically plausible. We report a simpler and yet more accurate strategy than previous works for multicategory classification of heterogeneous diseases. Our method selects the union of one-versus-everyone (OVE) phenotypic up-regulated genes (PUGs) and matches this gene selection with a one-versus-rest support vector machine (OVRSVM). Our approach provides even-handed gene resources for discriminating both neighboring and well-separated classes. Consistent with the OVRSVM structure, we evaluated the fold changes of OVE gene expressions and found that only a small number of high-ranked genes were required to achieve superior accuracy for multicategory classification. We tested the proposed PUG-OVRSVM method on six real microarray gene expression data sets (five public benchmarks and one in-house data set) and two simulation data sets, observing significantly improved performance with lower error rates, fewer marker genes, and higher performance sustainability, as compared to several widely-adopted gene selection and classification methods.
