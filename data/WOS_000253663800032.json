This paper focuses on overcoming these obstacles. We introduce an automated system for property valuation that combines artificial neural network models with a geographic information system, and both tools have shown their potential usefulness in the field of economic research. The artificial neural network models used in this work are the multilayer perceptron, the radial basis function, and Kohonen's maps. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
