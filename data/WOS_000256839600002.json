The results of this work reveal that the literature on hydrogen energy grows exponentially with all annual growth rate of about 18% for the last decade. Most of document type is in the form of journal articles or meeting abstracts, constituting 90.17% of the total literature and English is the predominant language (94.66%). USA, Japan and China are the three biggest contributing countries on hydrogen energy literature publishing, 25.8%, 14.9%, 7.7%, respectively. The Chinese Academy of Sciences in China is the largest contributor publishing 308 papers. The journal literature on hydrogen energy does not confirm the typical S-shape for the Bradford-Zipf plot, but five core journals, i.e. International Journal of hydrogen Energy, Journal of Power Source, Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Solid State Ionics, and Electrochimica Act, contributing about 41% can be identified. Journals with highly cited articles and most highly cited articles are also identified, in which the most highly cited article receives more than 1,000 citations.", "paper_title": "A bibliometric analysis of hydrogen energy literature, 1965-2005", "paper_id": "WOS:000256839600002"}
