The structures use an unstable generator based on Bennet's doubler to bias another similar generator, or just to bias one or two variable capacitors, which form the main generator. Their action is similar to electric generators based on electrets, but they are purely based on variable capacitances. Theoretical analyses and experimental results are presented.", "paper_title": "Electrostatic energy harvesting using capacitive generators without control circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000360664400007"}
