The classical Savage-Hutter model for gravity driven shallow water flows is derived from incompressible Euler equations. Here, we generalize this model by adding an upper compressible layer. We obtain a model of shallow water type, that admits an entropy dissipation inequality, preserves the steady state of a lake at rest and gives an approximation of the free surface compressible-incompressible Euler equations.
