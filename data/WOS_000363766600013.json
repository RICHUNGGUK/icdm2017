Nowadays, maturity of virtualization technology has made a fuss of provisioning IT services to maximize profits, scalability and QoS. This pioneer solution facilitates deployment of datacenter applications and grid and Cloud computing services; however, there are challenges. It is necessary to investigate a trade-off among overall system performance and revenue and to ensure service-level agreement of submitted workloads. Although a growing body of literature has investigated virtualization overhead and virtual machines interference, there is still lack of accurate performance evaluation of virtualized systems. In this paper, we present in-depth performance measurements to evaluate a Xen-based virtualized Web server. Regarding this experimental study; we support our approach by queuing network modeling. Based on these quantitative and qualitative analyses, we present the results that are important for performance evaluation of consolidated workloads on Xen hypervisor. First, demands of both CPU intensive and disk intensive workloads on CPU and disk are independent from the submitted rate to unprivileged domain when dedicated core(s) are pinned to virtual machines. Second, request response time not only depends on processing time at unprivileged domain but also pertains to amount of flipped pages at Domain0. Finally, results show that the proposed modeling methodology performs well to predict the QoS parameters in both para-virtualized and hardware virtual machine modes by knowing the request content size.
