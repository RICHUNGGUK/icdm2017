In this paper, we focus on investigating methods for multi-objective decision making when the preference information set includes incomparable natural language terms. A logical algebraic structure of lattice implication algebra is then applied to represent both comparable and incomparable information simultaneously. We present a model for multi-objective decision making in Which the preference information set is a kind of linguistic-valued lattice implication algebras. And we extend the model to deal with the multi-objective decision making when the preference information set is a generalized linguistic-valued lattice. In these cases, decision makers can supply lattice information on their preference and weights of the individual objectives.", "paper_title": "A linguistic lattice-valued approach for fuzzy multi-objective decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000256265400003"}
