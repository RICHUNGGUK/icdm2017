We apply a fuzzy logic system (FLS) to coordinate physical layer and data link layer. We demonstrate that type-2 fuzzy membership function (MF), i.e., the Gaussian MFs with uncertain variance is most appropriate to model BER and MAC layer service time. Two FLSs and one neural network: a singleton type-1 FLS, an interval type-2 FLS and back-prop neural network (NN) are designed to predict the packet transmission delay based on the BER and MAC layer service time. Simulation results show that the interval type-2 FLS performs much better than the type-1 FLS in transmission delay prediction. And FLSs performs better than back-prop NN. We use the forecasted transmission delay to adjust the transmission power, and it shows that the interval type-2 FLS performs much better than a type-1 FLS, and FLSs are performs better than back-prop NN in terms of energy consumption, average delay and throughput. Besides, we obtain the performance bound based on the actual transmission delay.", "paper_title": "Cross-layer design for mobile ad hoc networks using interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257292400005"}
