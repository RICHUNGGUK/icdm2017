It is often unclear what penalty if any, is imposed by the half-duplex constraint on the DMT of such networks. We study two classes of networks; the first class, called KPP(I) networks, is the class of networks with the relays organized in K parallel paths between the source and the destination. While we assume that there is no direct source-destination path, the K relaying paths can interfere with each other. The second class, termed as layered networks, is comprised of relays organized in layers, where links exist only between adjacent layers. We present a communication scheme based on static schedules and amplify-and-forward relaying for these networks. We also show that for KPP(I) networks with K >= 3, the proposed schemes can achieve full-duplex DMT performance, thus demonstrating that there is no performance hit on the DMT due to the half-duplex constraint. We also show that, for layered networks, a linear DMT of d(max)(1 - r)(+) between the maximum diversity d(max) and the maximum MG, r(max) = 1 is achievable. We adapt existing DMT optimal coding schemes to these networks, thus specifying the end-to-end communication strategy explicitly.", "paper_title": "DMT of Parallel-Path and Layered Networks Under the Half-Duplex Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000320709800041"}
