This requires translating concepts of the automotive domain to the safety domain. We automate such a translation between the automotive architecture description language EAST-ADL2 and the safety analysis tool HiP-HOPS by using model transformations and by leveraging the advantages of different model transformation techniques. Through this integration, the analysis can be conducted early in the development process, when the system can be redesigned to fulfill safety goals with relatively low effort and cost.", "paper_title": "Integrating Safety Analysis into the Model-based Development Toolchain of Automotive Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277056500014"}
