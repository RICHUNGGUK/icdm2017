In a common scenario, the Residential Gateway offers services with different characteristics. Some services belong to profiles of a user and thus these services have a mobile behavior. As a consequence, these profile-related and thus user-specific services are configured via a Smart Card. The Smart Card serves as a medium easy to transport but it added more features to the scenario like the possibility of cryptographic services, secure payments for example for pay-per-view or environment's customization. The core of this work has been carried out in order to achieve an integration between two existing technologies: OSGi (Open Service Gateway Initiative) and Java Card.", "paper_title": "Smart Cards and Residential Gateways: Improving OSGi services with Java Cards", "paper_id": "WOS:000237245000006"}
