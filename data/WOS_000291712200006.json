The fictitious crack based analytical model was used together with the stress degradation law in cracked zone to predict crack growth of plain concrete beams under flexural cyclic load. Then, under cyclic load, the chloride diffusion, in the steady state and one dimensional regime, through the tension zone of the plain concrete beam, in which microcracks were formed by a large number of cycles, was simulated with assumptions of continuously straight crack and uniform-size crack. The numerical analysis in terms of the chloride diffusion coefficient, D-tot, normalized D-tot, crack width and crack length was issued as a function of the load cycle, N, and load level, SR. The nonlinear model as regarding with the chloride diffusion coefficient in tension zone and the load level was proposed. According to this model, the chloride diffusion increases with increasing load level. The predictions using model fit well with experimental data when we adopted suitable crack density and tortuosity parameter.", "paper_title": "Prediction of chloride diffusion coefficient of concrete under flexural cyclic load", "paper_id": "WOS:000291712200006"}
