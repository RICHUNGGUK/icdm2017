A well-known composition theorem states that if both the REM and the DEM have a high enough level of security (i.e. security against chosen-ciphertext attacks), then so does the hybrid PKE scheme. It is not known if these strong security requirements on the REM and DEM are also necessary, nor if such general composition theorems exist for weaker levels of security. Using six different security notions for KEMs, 10 for DEMs, and six for PKE schemes, we completely characterize in this work which combinations lead to a secure hybrid PKE scheme (by proving a composition theorem) and which do not (by providing counterexamples). Furthermore, as an independent result, we revisit and extend prior work on the relations among security notions for KEMs and DEMs. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.", "paper_title": "Some (in)sufficient conditions for secure hybrid encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000282307000001"}
