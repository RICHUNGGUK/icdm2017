In this context, an increasing number of organizations are focusing on communities of practice (CoPs) orientated knowledge management (KM) studies and the links between KM and organizational business strategy. This link is an important determinant of organizational performance. While KM business strategy (linked to organization business strategy) is important, knowledge sharing behavior of knowledge workers is a critical enabler of effective knowledge management and organizational performance. That is, organizations invest resources in creating CoPs for competitive advantage and lack of suitable candidates will result in loss of momentum and less knowledge sharing in CoPs and there by underutilizing the resources. The aim of this research is to identify the personality traits to portrait the features of knowledge workers suitable for CoPs oriented KM and business strategy. Four KM business strategies have been established in this paper in light of organization performance orientation and KM implementation mode and traits of knowledge workers are mapped to different business strategies. The most significant personality traits of knowledge sharing behavior have been analyzed to determine the suitable traits for different type business strategies. Thus contributions of this paper include (a) defining a model which links four business strategies with CoPs orientated KM model and knowledge sharing behavior model (based on revised Five Factor Model); (b) mapping of personality traits of knowledge workers with four business strategies; (c) providing a guideline to knowledge based organizations for seamless integration of business strategy with CoPs oriented KM and compatible knowledge workers and d) more effective utilization of organizational resources to facilitate improvement in organizational performance.", "paper_title": "Mapping knowledge sharing traits to business strategy in knowledge based organisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000330590600004"}
