What is the minimum number of edges in an H-free r-uniform hypergraph with chromatic number greater than k? We investigate this question for various X Our results include the following: An (r, l)-system is an r-uniform hypergraph with every two edges sharing at most l vertices. For k sufficiently large, there is an (r, l)-system with chromatic number greater than k and number of edges at most c(k(r-1) log k)(l/(l-1)), where c = 2(100(r)(l)(2)/l!)(1/(l-1))(10(r-1)/l-1)(l/(l-1)). This improves on the previous best bounds of Kostochka et al. (Random Structures Algorithms 19 (2001), 87-98). The upper bound is sharp apart from the constant c as shown in (Random Structures Algorithms 19 (2001) 87-98). The minimum number of edges in an r-uniform hypergraph with independent neighborhoods and chromatic number greater than k is of order k(r+1/(r-1)) log(O(1)) k as k -> infinity. This generalizes (aside from logarithmic factors) a result of Gimbel and Thomassen (Discrete Mathematics 219 (2000), 275-277) for triangle-free graphs. Let T be an r-uniform hypertree of t edges. Then every T-free r-uniform hypergraph has chromatic number at most 2(r - 1)(t - 1) + 1. This generalizes the well-known fact that every T-free graph has chromatic number at most t. Several open problems and conjectures are also posed. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
