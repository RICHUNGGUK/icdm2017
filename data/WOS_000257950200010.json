The proposed algorithm only requires the approximate function values and the approximate subgradients of the involved function instead of the exact ones at some points, which makes the algorithm easier to implement. In addition to that, the conditions imposed on the auxiliary functions are weaker than the preexisting results: convex is enough, not necessarily strongly convex. We also prove the weak convergence of the proposed algorithm under some conditions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
