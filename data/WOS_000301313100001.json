A central challenge for cooperating group members lies in obtaining a common understanding of the elements of the workspace and maintaining awareness of the other members' actions, as well as one's own, during the group work process. The aim of the experimental study presented here was to investigate if adding audio cues in a haptic and visual interface makes collaboration between a sighted and a blindfolded person more efficient. Results showed that task performance was significantly faster in the audio, haptic and visual feedback condition compared to the haptic and visual feedback condition. One special focus was also to study how participants utilize the auditory and haptic force feedback in order to obtain a common understanding of the workspace and to maintain an awareness of the group members' actions. Results from a qualitative analysis showed that the auditory and haptic feedback was used in a number of important ways to support the group members' action awareness and in the participants' grounding process.
