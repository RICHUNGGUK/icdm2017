Traditionally, engineering practice involves repeated iterations of shape design (i.e., shaping and modeling of material properties), simulation of the physical field, evaluation of the result, and re-design. In this paper, we propose a specific interpretation of the algebraic-topological formulation of field problems, which is conceptually simple, physically sound, computational effective and comprehensive. In the proposed approach, physical information is attached to an adaptive, full-dimensional decomposition of the domain of interest. Giving preeminence to the cells of highest dimension allows us to generate the geometry and to simulate the physics simultaneously. We will also demonstrate that our formulation removes artificial constraints on the shape of discrete elements and unifies commonly unrelated methods in a single computational framework. This framework, by using an efficient graph-representation of the domain of interest, unifies several geometric and physical finite formulations, and supports local progressive refinement (and coarsening) effected only where and when required.
