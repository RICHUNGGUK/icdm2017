The hierarchical system can be decomposed into multiple application groups, which can be further decomposed into multiple applications. At the top of the hierarchy, the global controller controls the gross allocation of resources to the groups. At the next level down, the group controller coordinates the local deployments of all applications that consume the local allocation of resources. At the lowest level, the local controllers adjust the local resource usages to optimize the utility of single application. The hierarchical control system considers all applications and coordinates all layers of grid architecture upon any changes. According to different time granularity, we adopt a different control scheme. The global control considers all applications and coordinates three layers of grid architecture in response to large system changes at coarse time granularity, while local control adapts a single application to small changes at fine granularity. This paper adopts utility-driven cross layer optimization for grid applications to find a system wide optimization and solves the cross-layer optimization by using pricing based decomposition. A set of hierarchical utility functions is used to measure the performance of the grid system that follows the system, group and application hierarchy. This paper uses total utility to measure the overall quality of grid system. The experiments are conducted to test the performance of the hierarchical control algorithms.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical control policy for dynamic resource management in grid virtual organization", "paper_id": "WOS:000269060200002"}
