By combining a number of different Lyapunov functionals with S-procedure, some useful criteria of global asymptotic stability and global exponential stability for the continuous-time DSNNMs (CDSNNMs) and discrete-time DSNNMs (DDSNNMs) are derived, whose conditions are formulated as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Based on the stability analysis, some state-feedback control laws for the DSNNM with input and output are designed to stabilize the closed-loop systems. Most RNNs and neurocontrol nonlinear systems with (or without) time delays can be transformed into the DSNNMs; to be stability-analyzed or stabilization-synthesized in a unified way. In this paper, the DSNNMs are applied to analyzing the stability of the continuous-time and discrete-time RNNs with or without time delays, and synthesizing the state-feedback controllers for the chaotic neural-network-system and discrete-time nonlinear system. It turns out that the DSNNM makes the stability conditions of the RNNs easily verified, and provides a new idea for the synthesis of the controllers for the nonlinear systems.", "paper_title": "Delayed standard neural network models for control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249279400009"}
