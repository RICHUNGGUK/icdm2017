We propose a progressive integer linear programming algorithm to solve the guarding points that can visibility cover the entire shape; we also develop a constrained region growing scheme seeded on these guarding points to get the star decomposition. We demonstrate this guarding/decomposition framework can benefit graphics tasks such as shape interpolation and shape matching/retrieval.", "paper_title": "Computing 3D Shape Guarding and Star Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000296915400024"}
