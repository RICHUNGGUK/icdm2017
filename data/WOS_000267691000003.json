In order to solve channel assignment problems in WMN, connectivity of the communication network and the interferences between the links of the network are two most important points to be considered carefully. This paper presents a new method based on the idea of balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) for assigning the channels and routing in WMN. With this method, the communication network of WMN is at least 2-connected and the total interference in the system is as small as possible.
