This paper analyzes the operational specifications of the WADO service and extends its access capability to the whole DICOM hierarchy (patient, study, series, and object). The proposed Web Access to DICOM Archives (WADA) service, as opposed to WADO, also includes an extrainternal query mechanism and support of medical reports submission. A pilot implementation of WADA as software components and their integration into a three-tier architecture are also presented. Advanced security mechanisms are augmented to ensure communication encryption, user identification, and access restriction to data according to user roles. The proposed service is a simple approach, and can be embedded in any system managing medical images and reports. WADA can also be integrated into the Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing-Imaging (XDS-I) standard, which is considered to be the most likely future standard for medical imaging exchange.", "paper_title": "WADA Service: An Extension of DICOM WADO Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000262429100015"}
