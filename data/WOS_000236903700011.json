CRM, a recent marketing paradigm, pursues long-term relationship with profitable customers. It can be a starting point of relationship management to understand and measure the true value of customers since marketing management as a whole is to be deployed toward the targeted customers and profitable customers, to foster customers' full profit potential. Corporate success depends on an organization's ability to build and maintain loyal and valued customer relationships. Therefore, it is essential to build refined strategies for customers based on their value. In this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing customer value and segmenting customers based on their value. After segmenting customers based on their value, strategies building according to customer segment will be illustrated through a case study on a wireless telecommunication company.
