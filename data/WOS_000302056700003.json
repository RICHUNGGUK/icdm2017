The statistics of these tests are quotients of linear combinations of independent chi-squares, which may be non-central. When the observations are collected under non-standardized conditions, the non-centrality parameters may be random. The generalized F distributions are given by infinite sums. In this study, we show that there is an excellent control of the truncations errors for those sums. The case in which the non-centrality parameters have Gamma distributions is singled out.", "paper_title": "Control of the truncation errors for generalized F distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000302056700003"}
