The bibliography is focused on the progress made during the last decade 2000-2009. For the sake of completeness, a few papers published in 1999, and non-cited in Artalejo (1999) [7], have also been included. To keep the length manageable we have excluded conference proceedings, theses, unpublished reports, and works in languages other than English. The bibliography is structured in the following way: Section 1 lists the recent specific book (Artalejo and Gomez-Corral (2008)) [1] and other monographs including any chapter or section devoted to retrial queues. Section 2 lists survey papers and bibliographic works. Section 3 lists papers published in scientific journals. Section 4 includes a few forthcoming papers already in press. The author hopes that this bibliography could be of help to anyone contemplating research on retrial queues. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
