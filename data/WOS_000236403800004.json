Attention is paid to the models that take into account the saturation effects and is useful in the calculations of electromagnetic forces. Design/methodology/approach - A circuit model and a field-circuit model (FCM) are considered. The FCM includes finite element (FE) formulation for the axisymmetric electromagnetic field, equations which define the connections of windings and converter elements, and expressions that describe the control system. The FE method is used to determine the parameters of the circuit model. In order to simplify the circuit model, saturation effects caused by armature reaction are ignored. The electromagnetic force calculation is based on the virtual work principle and uses an approximate expression for the derivative of system co-energy. The results obtained for the proposed models have been compared. Findings - The proposed FE method of force calculation conforms with the applied method of movement simulation. For the rotor position when the cogging force is equal to zero the calculated cogging force is \"almost\" zero within seven-decimal-place accuracy. The effects of armature reaction on the performance of a TLPMM machine are similar to those which occur in a classical DC machine; in particular the demagnetising effect caused by saturation is observed. Originality/value - The paper shows the influence of the saturation effects on the electromagnetic force of a TLPMM. In the case of \"strong saturation\", the classical circuit model may be inappropriate for engineering calculations.", "paper_title": "Finite element analysis of saturation effects in a tubular linear permanent magnet machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000236403800004"}
