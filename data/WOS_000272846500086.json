In the paper, a conceptual framework is put forward and briefly discussed. A multi-agent hybrid system integrating multiple software agents, simulation, knowledge bases and fuzzy logic for international marketing decision making is then presented. Furthermore, the evaluation procedure and findings on the system's usefulness are reported. Through evaluation studies with eight managers, we show how the multi-agent hybrid approach is effective in supporting the decision making process and improving its outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
