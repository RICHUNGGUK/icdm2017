Traditional handwriting recognition systems are limited because they require a specific or expensive input device, such as pen, tablet, or touch panel. Recently, cameras have gradually become standard components in many computer-based products. Therefore, a fingertip and camera combination provides a flexible and convenient input device. This proposed system combines fingertip detection, trajectory feature extraction, and character recognition. First, fingertip moving trajectories are tracked and recoded. Then, the stroke features are extracted from the trajectories as features. Finally, the proposed system adopts the HCRF model to recognize handwritten characters. Experimental results show that the proposed novel input system is feasible and effective.
