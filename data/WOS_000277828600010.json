We observe the connection between discrete copulas and the empirical copulas, and then we propose a statistic that indicates when an empirical copula is associative and obtain its main statistical properties under independence. We also obtained asymptotic results of the proposed statistic. Finally, we study the associativity statistic under different copulas and we include sonic final remarks about associativity of samples.", "paper_title": "STATISTICAL ASPECTS OF ASSOCIATIVITY FOR COPULAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277828600010"}
