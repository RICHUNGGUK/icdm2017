However. the problem of insufficient and uncertain information is often encountered in practice and makes evaluation complex. Therefore, this study develops the concepts of grey number and integrates them into the grey clustering technique to establish an improved evaluation model. An illustrative example of pavement condition evaluation has been adopted to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model is effective and robust, and quite good for real-world applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
