We shall propose efficient algorithms for solving this problem and its variants. Moreover, as an application of the composition problem, those algorithms are applied to solve the P-constrained secure set problem, which is a variation of the secure set problem introduced in [5], on trees. A P-constrained secure set problem is to find a minimum secure set containing a set of vertical bar P vertical bar predetermined vertices.", "paper_title": "A New Subclass of Integer Linear Programming Problems and Its Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000310385000013"}
