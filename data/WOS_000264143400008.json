The trends are organized into three major types of prognostic models: failure data models, stressor models, and degradation models. Methods in each of these categories are presented and examples are given. Additionally, three particular computational prognostic approaches are considered; these are Markov chain-based models, general path models, and shock models. A Bayesian technique is then presented which integrates the prognostic types by incorporate prior reliability knowledge into the prognostic models. Finally, the article also discusses the usage of diagnostic/prognostic predictions for optimal control.", "paper_title": "CURRENT COMPUTATIONAL TRENDS IN EQUIPMENT PROGNOSTICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264143400008"}
