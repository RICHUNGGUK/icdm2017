Using these CPM{P, N} methods in a shooting procedure, eigenvalues of the boundary value problem are obtained to very high precision. Some recent advances allowed the generalization of the CPM{P, N} methods to systems of coupled Schrodinger equations. Also for these generalised CPM{P, N} methods a shooting procedure can be formulated, solving the multichannel bound state problem.", "paper_title": "Piecewise constant perturbation methods for the multichannel Schrodinger equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500097"}
