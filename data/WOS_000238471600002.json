The starting point is any algorithm for computing the exact likelihood of a Gaussian VARMA time series. Our algorithm also provides the parameter estimates and their standard errors. The small sample properties of our algorithm were studied by Monte Carlo methods. Examples with real data are provided. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
