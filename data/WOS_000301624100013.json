The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal changes in the structure and complexity of heart rate variability (HRV) and QT interval variability during the second half of normal gestation. We analysed 30-min high-resolution ECGs recorded monthly in 32 pregnant women, starting from the 20th week of gestation. Heart rate and QT variability were quantified using multiscale entropy (MSE) and detrended fluctuation analyses (DFA). DFA of HRV showed significantly higher scaling exponents towards the end of gestation (p < 0.0001). MSE analysis showed a significant decrease in sample entropy of HRV with progressing gestation on scales 1-4 (p < 0.05). MSE analysis and DFA of QT interval time series revealed structures significantly different from those of HRV with no significant alteration during the second half of gestation. In conclusion, pregnancy is associated with increases in long-term correlations and regularity of HRV, but it does not affect QT variability. The structure of QT time series is significantly different from that of RR time series, despite its close physiological dependence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
