Thus, managers may have problems accurately arranging tasks and evaluating costs. In order to facilitate collaboration management in multitasking environments, we propose a workflow-aware attention tracking framework that integrates the concept of attention with workflow models. We first design the meta-model of workflow-aware attention tracking. We further derive seven rules for attention tracking in multitasking collaboration using Object Constraint Language. Based on the rules and meta-model, we develop a procedure for attention rule verification, and present an architecture for workflow-aware attention tracking systems. This research contributes to workflow management by adding attention awareness for collaboration management in multitasking environments.", "paper_title": "Workflow-aware attention tracking to enhance collaboration management", "paper_id": "WOS:000365415000006"}
