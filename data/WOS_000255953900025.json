(x)overdot(t) + Sigma(m)(k=1) r(k)(t) integral(t)(-infinity) f(k)(x(s)) d(s)R(k)(t, s) = 0. The results are applied to logistic, Lasota-Wazewska and Nicholson's blowflies equations with a distributed delay. In addition, the \"Mean Value Theorem\" is proved which claims that a solution of (1) also satisfies the linear equation with a variable concentrated delay.
