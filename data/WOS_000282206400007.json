Existing mechanisms either use a static channel assignment or a centralized process intensive system that assigns channels to individual nodes. These are not effective in a dynamic environment with multiple flows that are active at different time instants. The protocol proposed in this work (Lattice routing) manages channels of the radios for the different nodes in the network using information about current channel conditions and adapts itself to varying traffic patterns in order to efficiently use the multiple channels. Further the protocol uses multipathing, a key mechanism that is found to alleviate bottlenecks present in single path routes in such an environment. Results indicate that Lattice routing consistently outperforms it closest competitor ((MCR) Kyasanur and Vaidya (2006) [1]) across a large number of experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
