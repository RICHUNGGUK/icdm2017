Both these algorithms improve the best previously known approximation factor for the corresponding problem, and our soft-capacitated facility location algorithm achieves the integrality gap of the standard linear programming relaxation of the problem. Furthermore, we will show, using a result of Thorup, that our algorithms can be implemented in quasi-linear time.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithms for metric facility location problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240043700006"}
