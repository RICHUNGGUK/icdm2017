Design/methodology/approach - A general setting of thermodynamics using differential geometry is used and it is shown how the Poynting identity fits in. Findings - A general method of defining the energy storage and dissipation in a general media is stated. Research limitations/implications - It appears that the definition of the energy stored in a dispersive media is not a state variable and depends on the history of the field variation. Practical implications - If an electromagnetic model has to be coupled to a mechanical or thermal one, the associated forces and/or heat dissipations may not be clearly defined if one merely knows the electromagnetic constitutive relations. Originality/value - It proposes a very general setting for the thermodynamic of electrodynamic media.", "paper_title": "On the definition of energy in general electromagnetic media", "paper_id": "WOS:000236403800005"}
