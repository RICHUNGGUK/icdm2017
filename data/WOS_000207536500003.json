In this material discovered in 2005, the electron transport is ballistic at room temperature and is described by a quantum relativistic-like Dirac equation rather than by the Schrodinger equation. Also, graphene has a Young modulus of 1.5 TPa. Due to these unique properties. graphene is considered to be a very promising material for high frequency nanoelectronic devices such as oscillators and switches. In this paper, we will show that a single graphene barrier acts as a switch with a very high on-or ratio and displays a significant differential negative resistance at frequencies beyond 1THz. Also, we will show that graphene can be used in a very efficient RF-NEMS switch for microwave applications.", "paper_title": "Graphene - A One-Atom-Thick Material for Microwave Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000207536500003"}
