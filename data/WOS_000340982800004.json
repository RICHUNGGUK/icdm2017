However, the SVM performance strongly depends on the adequate calibration of its parameters. In this work we proposed a hybrid multi-objective architecture which combines meta-learning (ML) with multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms for the SVM parameter selection problem. Given an input problem, the proposed architecture uses a ML technique to suggest an initial Pareto front of SVM configurations based on previous similar learning problems; the suggested Pareto front is then refined by a multi-objective optimization algorithm. In this combination, solutions provided by ML are possibly located in good regions in the search space. Hence, using a reduced number of successful candidates, the search process would converge faster and be less expensive. In the performed experiments, the proposed solution was compared to traditional multi-objective algorithms with random initialization, obtaining Pareto fronts with higher quality on a set of 100 classification problems.
