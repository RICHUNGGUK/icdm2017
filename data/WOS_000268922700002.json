However, the localizing of the address block should be done before the OCR recognition process. The location step is veri crucial as if has a great impact on the global performance of the system. Actually, a good localizing step leads to a better recognition rate. The limit of current methods depends on molecular linear architectures used for address block localization. Their performances depend on each independent module performance. He are presenting in this paper a new approach for ABL based on the hierarchical graph coloring and oil the pyramidal data organization. This new approach presents the advantage to guarantee a good coherence between different modules and that reduces both the computation time, and the rejection rate. The proposed method gives a very satisfying rate of 98% of good locations on a set of 7.50 envelope images.", "paper_title": "Robust Approach of Address Block Localization in Business Mail by Graph Coloring", "paper_id": "WOS:000268922700002"}
