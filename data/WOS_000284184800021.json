In some practical applications, accurate continuum wave functions need to be calculated at extremely low energies, large radial distances and/or large angular momentum number. Here we provide such a code, which can generate accurate hydrogenic continuum wave functions and corresponding Coulomb phase shifts at a wide range of parameters. Without any essential restrict to angular momentum number, the present code is able to give reliable results at the electron energy range vertical bar 10(-3),10(3)vertical bar eV for radial distances of vertical bar 10(-2), 10(4)vertical bar a.u. We also find the present code is very efficient, which should find numerous applications in many fields such as strong field physics.", "paper_title": "An accurate Fortran code for computing hydrogenic continuum wave functions at a wide range of parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000284184800021"}
