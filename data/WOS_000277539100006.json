Design/methodology/approach - This entire paper is based on the idea of the infinitesimals so that some of the well-developed concepts and methods of calculus can be adequately employed to address some of the local properties of spinning yoyos. Findings - The concepts of potential energies and yoyo potentials of both particle yoyos and general systemic yoyos are introduced and investigated. Originality/value - This work is expected to pave the necessary ground for further deepened studies along the idea of rotational kinetic energies and rotational momentums.", "paper_title": "Potentials and potential energies of systemic yoyos", "paper_id": "WOS:000277539100006"}
