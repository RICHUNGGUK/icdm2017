The virtualisation introduces advantages such as on-demand customised resource provision, easy management and support for multiple Operating Systems, etc. However, this technology also results in a performance loss due to the additional virtualisation layer. To help application developers study the performance issues on virtualised multicore machines, we developed a tool framework with a set of performance tools that collect the runtime performance data and demonstrate the different runtime application behaviour on both the physical machine and the virtual machine within a single view. We applied the tool framework to analyse a number of benchmark applications and conducted optimisations based on the analysis discovery. The initial experimental results show a significant performance gain.", "paper_title": "A framework for comparative performance study on virtualised machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000347629700002"}
