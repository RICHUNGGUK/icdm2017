However, SPA cannot distinguish point addition from point subtraction. The attacker still requires an exhaustive search to recover the private key when it is recoded in NAF or recoded by the 2-bit sliding window method. The average Hamming weight of an n-bit NAF recoded scalar is n/3, and an exhaustive search among the 2(n)/3 candidates is required. This paper shows that in a left-to-right NAF recoded or a left-to-right 2-bit sliding window manipulated scalar the relative position of nonzero bits will reveal their values. Our analysis skill reduces the number of candidates of the scalar from the naive search of 2(n/3) to 2(2n/9) and 2(0.19n) respectively for the cases of NAF and sliding window method.", "paper_title": "On the Computational Sequence of Scalar Multiplication with Left-to-Right Recoded NAF and Sliding Window Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000285489200013"}
