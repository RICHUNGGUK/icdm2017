We address the privacy issue of decentralized cloud storage system using threshold cryptography. Once the user uploads his data and deletes the local copy, he might lost the full control of the data. The major challenges of designing this cloud storage system are to provide a better privacy guarantee and ensure the integrity of data at untrusted servers in distributed cloud storage system. To achieve this goal, we propose a threshold encryption scheme and integrate it with a secure decentralized erasure code to form a secure cloud storage system, where the user generates a secret parameter participated in system encryption and decryption of plaintext blocks in the combine process. So our systems can prevent cloud storage servers from modifying data by providing remote data check and meets the requirements of data robustness, confidentiality and integrity.", "paper_title": "A secure remote data integrity checking cloud storage system from threshold encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000351242100008"}
