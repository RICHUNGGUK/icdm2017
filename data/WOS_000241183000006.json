As a special case, the linear complexity of the ternary Sidel'nikov sequence is presented. It turns out that the linear complexity of a ternary Sidel'nikov sequence with the symbol k(0) not equal 1 at the (p(m) - 1)/2-th position is nearly close to the period of the sequence, while that with k(0) = 1 shows much lower value.", "paper_title": "Linear complexity over F(p) of ternary Sidel'nikov sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000006"}
