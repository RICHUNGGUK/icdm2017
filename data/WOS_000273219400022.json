For instance this occurs when the operation subject to mutual exclusion requires massive use of a shared resource. We introduce a scalable soft mutual exclusion algorithm, based on token passing: one distinguished feature of our algorithm is that instead of introducing an overlay topology we adopt a random walk approach. The consistency of our proposal is evaluated by simulation, and we exemplify its use in the coordination of large data transfers in a backbone based network. This algorithm is studied in the frame of the CoreGRID Institute of Grid Information, Resource and Workflow Monitoring Services, in cooperation with the FORTH Institute, in Greece.
