Under the condition of 2(p-1) not equivalent to 1 (mod p(2)), we present exact values of the linear complexity by defining cyclotomic classes modulo p(n) for all 1 <= n <= r. The linear complexity is very close to the period and is of desired value for cryptographic purpose. We also present a lower bound on the linear complexity for the case of 2(p-1) equivalent to 1 (mod p(2)). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
