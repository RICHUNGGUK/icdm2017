Consequently, developers face the challenge of selecting adequate performance models that best fit their design goals and level of system knowledge. In this research, we present a classification that enables users to select a set of easy-to-use and reliable analytical models for quality performance prediction. These models, which target the general-purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU)-based systems, are categorized into two primary analytical classes: subjective-analytical and objective-analytical. The subjective-analytical models predict the computation and communication components of an application by describing the system using minimum qualitative relations among the system parameters; whereas the objective-analytical models predict these components by measuring pertinent hardware events using micro-benchmarks. We categorize, enhance, and characterize the existing analytical models for GPGPU computations, network-level, and inter-connect communications to facilitate fast and reliable application performance prediction. We also explore a suitable combination of the aforementioned analytical classes, the hybrid approach, for high-quality performance prediction and report prediction accuracy up to 95 % for several tested GPGPU cluster configurations. The research aims to ultimately provide a collection of easy-to-select analytical models that promote straightforward and accurate performance prediction prior to large-scale implementation.", "paper_title": "Subjective versus objective: classifying analytical models for productive heterogeneous performance prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000347701000008"}
