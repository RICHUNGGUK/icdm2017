They design and contract reclamation projects to restore mined land to original contour, use or condition. Part of this process involves mining engineers responding to requests for funding to reclaim certain areas. The state will consider reclaiming these areas if past mining resulted in safety and environmental hazards to exist on the site. Mining engineers use outdated maps and cumbersome methods to investigate past mining history. The GIS AML inventory was designed to streamline the investigations process. By incorporating multiple layers of data related to the investigations process within ArcGIS, investigations can be performed in a more-timely and cost-effective manner. This article presents the design and utilisation of the GIS AML inventory.", "paper_title": "From Mylar to map documents: GIS AML inventory for abandoned coal mine investigations", "paper_id": "WOS:000355665100004"}
