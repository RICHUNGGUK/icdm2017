This new formulation allows analyzing the scalability of parallel systems under either balanced or unbalanced workloads. Finally, the validity of this new metric is evaluated using some synthetic benchmarks. The experimental results allow assessing the importance of considering the unbalanced workloads while analyzing the scalability of parallel systems.", "paper_title": "Analyzing scalability of parallel systems with unbalanced workload", "paper_id": "WOS:000316408500012"}
