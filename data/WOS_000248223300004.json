However, most of the previously developed closed pattern mining algorithms work under the candidate maintenance-andtest paradigm, which is inherently costly in both runtime and space usage when the support threshold is low or the patterns become long. In this paper, we present BIDE, an efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed sequences without candidate maintenance. It adopts a novel sequence closure checking scheme called BI-Directional Extension and prunes the search space more deeply compared to the previous algorithms by using the BackScan pruning method. A thorough performance study with both sparse and dense, real, and synthetic data sets has demonstrated that BIDE significantly outperforms the previous algorithm: It consumes an order(s) of magnitude less memory and can be more than an order of magnitude faster. It is also linearly scalable in terms of database size.", "paper_title": "Frequent closed sequence mining without candidate maintenance", "paper_id": "WOS:000248223300004"}
