In order to tackle the problem complexity, decomposition techniques based on duality and information flows between a master and a set of subproblems are widely applied. In this sense, ontologies improve information sharing and communication in enterprises and can even represent holistic mathematical models facilitating the use of analytic tools and providing higher flexibility for model building. In this work, we exploit this ontologies' capability to address the optimal integration of planning and scheduling using a Lagrangian decomposition approach. Scheduling/planning sub-problems are created for each facility/supply chain entity and their dual solution information is shared by means of the ontological framework. Two case studies based on a STN representation of supply chain planning and scheduling models are presented to emphasize the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.
