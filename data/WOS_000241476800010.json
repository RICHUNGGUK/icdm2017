While some models support either positive or negative authorizations, hybrid models take advantage of both authorizations simultaneously. However, resolving authorization conflicts is quite a challenge in such models due to the existence of sophisticated hierarchies and diversity of types of resolution strategies. There are works that have addressed conflict resolution for tree-structured subject hierarchies. Yet, no widespread framework has been proposed for graph-based structures. A widespread resolution framework ought to provide several resolution strategies and to support sophisticated structures. Our attempt is to define such a framework. In particular, our framework resolves conflicts for subject hierarchies that form directed acyclic graphs. It also unites major resolution policies in a novel way by which thirty-two combined strategies are simultaneously expressed. We also provide parametric algorithms to support the strategies and to justify the framework with our analysis and experiments.", "paper_title": "Hybrid authorizations and conflict resolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000241476800010"}
