The rotation invariance is achieved by aligning the direction of maximum variation of intensity gradient (defined as principal texture direction) along the reference axis. The principal direction is determined using eigen value analysis of gradient image. Wavelet transform based techniques are applied on the rotated image. The independent representation of textural energies along various directions enhances the retrieval performance over the existing rotation invariant wavelet based techniques which achieve rotation invariance by averaging the direction sensitive components. Extensive experiments on Brodatz database support this postulate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
