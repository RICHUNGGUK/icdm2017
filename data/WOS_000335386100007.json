Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging social networks to mitigate Sybil attacks. However, the existing approaches suffer from one or more drawbacks, including bootstrapping from either only known benign or known Sybil nodes, failing to tolerate noise in their prior knowledge about known benign or Sybil nodes, and not being scalable. In this paper, we aim to overcome these drawbacks. Toward this goal, we introduce SybilBelief, a semi-supervised learning framework, to detect Sybil nodes. SybilBelief takes a social network of the nodes in the system, a small set of known benign nodes, and, optionally, a small set of known Sybils as input. Then, SybilBelief propagates the label information from the known benign and/or Sybil nodes to the remaining nodes in the system. We evaluate SybilBelief using both synthetic and real-world social network topologies. We show that SybilBelief is able to accurately identify Sybil nodes with low false positive rates and low false negative rates. SybilBelief is resilient to noise in our prior knowledge about known benign and Sybil nodes. Moreover, SybilBelief performs orders of magnitudes better than existing Sybil classification mechanisms and significantly better than existing Sybil ranking mechanisms.", "paper_title": "SybilBelief: A Semi-Supervised Learning Approach for Structure-Based Sybil Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000335386100007"}
