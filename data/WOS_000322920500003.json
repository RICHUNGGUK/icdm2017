Under certain continuity assumptions, we prove the existence of optimal paths, and we show that the optimal value function is lower-semicontinuous. We present an exact solution algorithm, which computes both the optimal value function and the corresponding optimal paths. This algorithm is based on a Dijkstra-like interpretation of a decreasing order of time algorithm, which allows the generalization of this method to a heuristic search algorithm. Moreover, we present an approximation procedure for the computation of the optimal value function and the corresponding optimal paths in a time-dependent first-in first-out (FIFO) network. This method allows for the iterative construction of paths of monotone decreasing cost, starting from a path that is computable in polynomial time. We prove the correctness and termination of both algorithms.
