However, the presented considerations can be assumed as a general neural speed control of the drive with a fast enough electromagnetic torque control loop of an electrical machine. This is justified by analogy with a design process independent of the parameters of a specific drive system and its electromagnetic torque control loop. Four types of neuro-controllers and training methods are analyzed: Adaptive Linear Neuron with Delta Rule, Multi-Layer Perceptrons Neural Network with the Backpropagation method, Feedforward Network with Adaptive Interaction adaptation and Radial Basis Function Neural Network with gradient algorithm, applied as speed controllers. Two main problematic issues related to neural controllers trained on-line are discussed: initial parameters selection for a neural network and determination of learning factors used in adaptation algorithms. Simulations are confirmed in experiment tests, using dSPACE1103 card. All the tested neurocontrollers are compared to a classical PI solution with one state variable used in the feedback loop of the analyzed drive system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
