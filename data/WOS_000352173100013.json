By using the quadratic convex combination method, the reciprocal convex combination approach, some generalized Jensen integral inequalities, and the free-weight matrix method, several novel sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point of the considered networks. The proposed results, which do not require the differentiability of the activation functions, can be easily checked via Matlab software. Finally, three numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and less conservativeness of our theoretical results over existing literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
