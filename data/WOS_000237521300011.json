In this work, the notion of \"reduced convex hull\" is employed and supported by a set of new theoretical results. These results allow existing geometric algorithms to be directly and practically applied to solve not only separable, but also nonseparable classification problems both accurately and efficiently. As a practical application of the new theoretical results, a known geometric algorithm has been employed and transformed accordingly to solve nonseparable problems successfully.", "paper_title": "A geometric approach to support vector machine (SVM) classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000237521300011"}
