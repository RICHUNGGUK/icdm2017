Although RFID-based procedure is more efficient than traditional process, patient's information may be attacked (or stolen) during the data transmission period. This will cause inappropriate medication use and medical errors. In this paper, we introduce a robust RFID-based e-Health system which strengthens the system security and protects the patient's privacy as well. In addition, our e-Health system can provide better efficiency of outpatient clinic procedure and emergency care procedure in hospital environment.", "paper_title": "Secure e-Health System on Passive RFID: Outpatient Clinic and Emergency Care", "paper_id": "WOS:000328756100001"}
