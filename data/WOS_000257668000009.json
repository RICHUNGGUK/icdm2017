An alternative method to Wright's modification of simple exponential smoothing based on the corresponding ARIMA process is suggested. Exponential smoothing of order m for irregular data is derived. A similar method using a DLS (discounted least squares) estimation of polynomial trend of order m is derived as well. Maximum likelihood parameters estimation for forecasting methods in irregular time series is suggested. The suggested methods are compared with the existing ones in a simulation numerical study.", "paper_title": "Exponential smoothing for irregular time series", "paper_id": "WOS:000257668000009"}
