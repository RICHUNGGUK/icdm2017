Then, a shape model is reconstructed by the warp function algorithm. Finally, a realistic face model is created through texture mapping with registration method such as affine transform. Results show that the models we reconstruct are comparatively realistic, and they can be used for face recognition or computer animation. The computation speed is also satisfying.", "paper_title": "Automatic 3D face model reconstruction using one image", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900025"}
