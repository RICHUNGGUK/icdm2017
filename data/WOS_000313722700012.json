This PA is driven by the filtered digitally modulated signals. To improve the accuracy of the calculations, the cyclosationarity of the input signal is considered. Moreover, closed-form expressions for the 1-dB compression and saturation points are extracted as a function of the PA model parameters, higher order statistics of the input signal, and the transfer function of the pulse shaping filter. In addition, an analytical expression for the adjacent channel power (ACP) and a closed-form expression of the ACP ratio are derived. This is followed by investigation of the effect of the PA nonlinearity on the performance of receiver. Simulation studies are carried out to verify the accuracy of the derived expressions. Excellent agreement between the analytical and simulation results is achieved.", "paper_title": "Accurate analysis of spectral regrowth of nonlinear power amplifier driven by cyclostationary modulated signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000313722700012"}
