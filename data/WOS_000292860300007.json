The simple Mohr-Coulomb model is used to represent the soil behaviour. The polyethylene bag is represented by a linear-elastic-perfect-plastic model. The soil-bag interface is modelled with contact constraints. The main purpose of the numerical analysis is to validate the anticipated performance of soilbags under various loading conditions and hence the effectiveness of soilbags as a method of ground improvement.
