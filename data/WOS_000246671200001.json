In this paper, we present a novel watermarking scheme which allows to insert and reliably detect multiple watermarks sequentially embedded into a digital image. The proposed method, based on elementary linear algebra, is asymmetric, secure under projection attack and robust against distortion due to basic operations such as storage, transmission, format conversion, etc.", "paper_title": "Digital image tracing by sequential multiple watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000246671200001"}
