It has been known for decades that A(16, 7) = A(17, 8) = 36 or 37, that is, that the size of optimal 3-error-correcting binary codes of length 16 is either 36 or 37. By a recursive classification via subcodes and a clique search in the final stage, it is shown that the size of optimal such codes is 36.", "paper_title": "On the Size of Optimal Three-Error-Correcting Binary Codes of Length 16", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000036"}
