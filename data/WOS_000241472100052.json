In this paper, the probabilistic relationships between concepts and their attribute values are first computed from the statistical analysis of language data. Secondly, a computational model of the metaphor understanding process is constructed, including dynamic interaction among attribute values. Finally, a psychological experiment is conducted to examine the psychological validity of the model.", "paper_title": "A neural network model of metaphor understanding with dynamic interaction based on a statistical language analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100052"}
