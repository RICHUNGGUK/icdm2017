Works reported in literature use support metric-based sensor association rules which employ the occurrence frequency of patterns as criteria. However, consideration of the binary frequency of a pattern is not a sufficient indicator for finding meaningful patterns because it only reflects the number of epochs which contain that pattern in the dataset. The share measure of sensorsets could discover useful knowledge about trigger values associated with a sensor. Here, we propose a new type of behavioral pattern called share-frequent sensor patterns (SFSPs) by considering the non-binary frequency values of sensors in epochs. SFSPs can find a correlation among a set of sensors and hence can improve the performance of WSNs in a resource management process. In this paper, a share-frequent sensor pattern tree (ShrFSP-tree) has been proposed to facilitate a pattern growth mining technique to discover SFSPs from WSN data. We also present a parallel and distributed method where the ShrFSP-tree is enhanced into PShrFSP-tree and its performance is investigated for both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Results show that our method is time and memory efficient in finding SFSPs than the existing most efficient algorithms.", "paper_title": "Share-Frequent Sensor Patterns Mining from Wireless Sensor Network Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000364853900021"}
