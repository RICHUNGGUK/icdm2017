Among these, radio map based technologies (also referred as fingerprinting technologies) are attractive due to high accuracy and easy deployment. However, these technologies have not been extensively applied on real environment for two fatal limitations. First, it is hard to localize multiple objects. When the number of target objects is unknown, constructing a radio map of multiple objects is almost impossible. Second, environment changes will generate different multipath signals and severely disturb the RSS measurement, making laborious retraining inevitable. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Line-of-sight radio map matching, which only reserves the LOS signal among nodes. It leverages frequency diversity to eliminate the multipath behavior, making RSS more reliable than before. We implement our system MODLoc based on TelosB sensor nodes and commercial 802.11 NICs with Channel State Information (CSI) as well. Through extensive experiments, it shows that the accuracy does not decrease when localizing multiple targets in a dynamic environment. Our work outperforms the traditional methods by about 60 percent. More importantly, no calibration is required in such environment. Furthermore, our approach presents attractive flexibility, making it more appropriate for general RF-based localization studies than just the radio map based localization.", "paper_title": "MODLoc: Localizing Multiple Objects in Dynamic Indoor Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000343904400019"}
