Particularly glasses-based 3-D technology facilities are increasingly becoming affordable to our daily lives. Considering health issues raised by 3-D video technologies, to the best of our knowledge, most of the pilot studies are practiced in a highly-controlled laboratory environment only. In this paper, we present NeuroGlasses, a nonintrusive wearable physiological signal monitoring system to facilitate health analysis and diagnosis of 3-D video watchers. The NeuroGlasses system acquires health-related signals by physiological sensors and provides feedbacks of health-related features. Moreover, the NeuroGlasses system employs signal-specific reconstruction and feature extraction to compensate the distortion of signals caused by variation of the placement of the sensors. We also propose a server-based NeuroGlasses infrastructure where physiological features can be extracted for real-time response or collected on the server side for long term analysis and diagnosis. Through an on-campus pilot study, the experimental results show that NeuroGlasses system can effectively provide physiological information for healthcare purpose. Furthermore, it approves that 3-D vision technology has a significant impact on the physiological signals, such as EEG, which potentially leads to neural diseases.", "paper_title": "NeuroGlasses: A Neural Sensing Healthcare System for 3-D Vision Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000304158600003"}
