Using a computational model of a cardiac muscle cell, we modeled calcium (Ca2+) wave dynamics in a cardiac myocyte with controlled spatial dimensions. The modeled myocyte was replicated in vitro when primary neonate rat ventricular myocytes were cultured on micropatterned substrates. The myocytes remodel to conform to the two dimensional boundary conditions and assume the shape of the printed extracellular matrix island. Mechanical perturbation of the myocyte with an atomic force microscope results in calcium-induced calcium release from intracellular stores and the propagation of a Ca2+ wave, as indicated by high speed video microscopy using fluorescent indicators of intracellular Ca2+. Analysis and comparison of the measured wavefront dynamics with those simulated in the computer model reveal that the engineered myocyte behaves as predicted by the model. These results are important because they represent the use of computer modeling, computer-aided design, and physiological experiments to design and validate the performance of engineered cells. The ability to successfully engineer biological cells and tissues for assays or therapeutic implants will require design algorithms and tools for quality and regulatory assurance.", "paper_title": "Engineering design of a cardiac myocyte", "paper_id": "WOS:000244983100003"}
