ANLAGIS can be applied to both pattern recognition and learning control problems. Another interesting contribution of this paper is the distinction between presynaptic and post-synaptic learning in artificial neural networks. Tc illustrate the capabilities of ANLAGIS some experiments on knowledge discovery in data mining and machine learning are presented. The main, novel contribution of ANLAGIS is the incorporation of Learning Automata Theory within its structure; the paper includes also a novel learning scheme for stochastic learning automata.
