From a digital mesostructure and by a lattice approach, the diffusivity of mortar can be predicted. Simulations are compared with experimental results from literature and are discussed for mono-sized and multi-sized particle packing with and without interfacial transition zones (ITZ). It was found that the shape of aggregate has a significant effect on the diffusivity of mortar, and for oblate ellipsoids, the shape effect is most pronounced comparing to prolate ellipsoids and polyhedrons.
