To address the issue, a Delphi study was conducted to explore the underlying dimensions of software similarities. Inputs gathered from 20 experienced Information Systems instructors show that Computer Software Similarity is a multi-dimensional construct made up of interface similarity, function similarity, and syntax similarity. Each dimension consists of software attributes that users perceive to be transferable in learning new applications. A field study was carried out to test the impact of the construct. Results from a survey on students' learning two software applications confirm the expectation that Computer Software Similarity facilitates the students' skills transfer between the applications. These studies provide a basis to better design training programs for improved training performance.", "paper_title": "Exploring the Dimensions and Effects of Computer Software Similarities in Computer Skills Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000299852000003"}
