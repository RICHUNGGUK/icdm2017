However, since the VMF cannot identify thin lines during the denoising process, many thin lines may be removed out as noise. This serious problem can be solved by a newly proposed filter that uses a noise detector to find these thin lines and then keep them unchanged. In this new approach, the noise detection scheme applied on a current processed pixel is realized through counting the close pixels in its eight neighbor positions and the expanded window to see whether the current pixel is corrupted by impulse noise. Based on the previous outputs, our algorithm can increase the performance in detecting and canceling the impulse noise. Extensive experiments indicate that this approach can be used to remove the impulse noise from a color image without distorting the useful information.", "paper_title": "Improved switching based filter for protecting thin lines of color images", "paper_id": "WOS:000275537700004"}
