The algorithm is motivated by multiple scale asymptotic analysis of the master partial differential (Navier-Stokes-like) equations and comprises coupled equation sets for the fine- and coarse-scale dynamics. A primary virtue of the resulting multiscale formulation is that dynamical teleconnections between the fine and coarse scales are explicitly identified and computed, enabling fewer fine-scale domains than coarse-scale grid points to be used. Quantitative comparisons between the multiscale simulations and direct numerical simulations of the master partial differential equations are made. Good agreement is demonstrated in the appropriate parameter regime at a cost that is orders of magnitude less than that required for brute-force simulations using the single-scale algorithm. Several novel multiscale physical interactions are identified, highlighting the utility of the algorithm and the potential importance of spatiotemporal modulation of the convective flow on the mean dynamics.
