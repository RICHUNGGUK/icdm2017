Machine to machine (M2M) technology, as the most prevalent application form of Internet of Things now, is widely used in various fields, among which smart home takes on tremendous market potential in virtue of its intimate relationship with human life. This paper endeavors to propose the smart home and security system, an M2M application system based on wireless networks, by combining wireless sensor network, mobile communication network, and the Internet together and briefly introduces the architecture, function, interface, identity addressing, and security mechanism of this system.
