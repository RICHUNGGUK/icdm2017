The AORCMAC is a nonlinear adaptive system with simple computation, good generalization capability and fast learning property. Therefore, the WIP can stand upright when it moves to a designed position stably. In the proposed control system, an AORCMAC is used to copy an ideal backstepping control, and a robust H (a) controller is designed to attenuate the effect of the residual approximation errors and external disturbances with desired attenuation level. Moreover, the all adaptation laws of the RIBTC system are derived based on the Lyapunov stability analysis, the Taylor linearization technique and H (a) control theory, so that the stability of the closed-loop system and H (a) tracking performance can be guaranteed. The proposed control scheme is practical and efficacious for WIPs by simulation results.", "paper_title": "Robust intelligent backstepping tracking control for wheeled inverted pendulum", "paper_id": "WOS:000294840100012"}
