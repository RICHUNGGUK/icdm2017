In this study, private companies are assumed to have a degree of control over highway sections on which they perform maintenance and rehabilitation and capacity expansion activities. The private investors recover the cost of construction by levying tolls. The public agency is assumed to maintain the rest of the network with the objective of minimizing total system generalized cost. The bi-directional impact of roadway utilization on deterioration and deterioration on utilization is modeled in this study. The model accounts for route choice of users and all users are assumed to choose routes that have equal and minimal experienced generalized cost. The nonconvex and discontinuous multi-objective mathematical program is solved using nondominant sorting genetic algorithm-II and the pareto-optimal trade-off surface between the profit of the private company and the total system cost is generated. Computational runs are conducted to demonstrate the suitability and flexibility of the developed framework in modeling various policy decisions such as the presence of noncompete clauses.", "paper_title": "Design and Management Strategies for Mixed Public Private Transportation Networks: A Meta-Heuristic Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000264081700003"}
