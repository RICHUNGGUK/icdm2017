In an article in Communications almost two decades ago 111, I advocated building software systems by composing concurrent objects, or actors. Actors reflect several key characteristics. For example, they are distributed, autonomous objects that interact by sending each other messages. They have unique names that are not tied to their current location, thus facilitating mobility. And new actors may be dynamically created, thus allowing new services to be added to a system. With the growth of P2P computing, Web services, networks of embedded computers, and multicore architectures, programming using the actor model is inevitable; witness the increasing use of programming languages (such as Erlang, E, SALSA, Scala, and Ptolemy) and the various implementations of software agents.", "paper_title": "Computing in pervasive cyberspace", "paper_id": "WOS:000251994700022"}
