In this work, we propose a novel scheme, so called DRONEE, that dramatically ameliorates energy efficiency for uplink transmissions, while achieving near-optimal throughput and high fairness levels in cellular networks. Our proposal consists in a novel two-tier uplink forwarding scheme in which users cooperate by forming clusters of dual-radio mobiles for hybrid wireless networks. The impact of our proposal is threefold: (i) energy efficiency is boosted by allowing mobiles to relay the cellular traffic through intra-cluster ad hoc communications, which leads to reduction of power-hungry cellular transmissions; (ii) cellular capacity is augmented by scheduling uplink transmissions from mobiles with the best channel; (iii) almost perfect fairness is achieved by allowing users to share the cellular resources within their cluster. We corroborate the practical relevance of our proposal by providing a first-order discussion on the implementability of DRONEE using LTE and WiFi Direct. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
