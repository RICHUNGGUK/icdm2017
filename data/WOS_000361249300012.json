However, only brief overviews of this important field have so far been provided within the literature. This work presents a systematic and comprehensive review of papers published over the last two decades and highlights possible future directions within this field. This review can be useful for researchers and engineers interested in water and energy integration within process water networks using systematic methods based on pinch analysis, mathematical programming, and their combination. We believe that this research field will continue to be active in the near future due to the importance of simultaneous optimisation of process, water and energy integration for achieving profitability and sustainability within process industries.
