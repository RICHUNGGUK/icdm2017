The variable inductance can be tuned by shielding the magnetic flux, which uses a metal plate above the inductor. The metal plate can be moved using a MEMS actuator. At the present time, the MEMS actuator has not been implemented yet. In this paper, we present a feasibility study on the proposed LNA using the variable inductor. The proposed LNA uses two variable inductors for input and output impedance matching-tuning. The LNA achieves a power gain (PG) of over 10 dB at a tuning range of 1.6-3.2 GHz.", "paper_title": "Tunable CMOS LNA Using a Variable Inductor for a Reconfigurable RF Circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701000008"}
