Semantic or linguistic knowledge on urban development is expressed as fuzzy rules, based on which fuzzy inference is applied to determine the urban development potential for each pixel. A defuzzification process converts the development potential to the required neighbourhood development level, which is taken by cellular automata as initial approximation for its transition rules. Such approximations are updated through spatial calibration over townships and temporal calibration with multi-temporal satellite images. Assessment of the modelling results is based on three evaluation measures: fitness and Type I and Type II errors. The approach is applied to model the growth of the city of Indianapolis, Indiana over a period of 30 years from 1973 to 2003. A fitness level of 100 +/- 20% with 30% average errors can be achieved for 80% of the townships in urban-growth prediction.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy inference guided cellular automata urban-growth modelling using multi-temporal satellite images", "paper_id": "WOS:000262822500005"}
