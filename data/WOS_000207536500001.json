Amongst the different types of SOI devices proposed, one clearly stands out: the multigate field-effect transistor (multigate FET). This device has a general \"wire-like\" shape. Multigate FETs are commonly referred to as \"multi(ple)-gate transistors\", \"Fin-FETs\", \"tri(ple)-gate transistors\", \"GAA transistors\", etc. This Paper describes the reasons for evolving from single-gate to multi-gate structures. It also describes some issues in ultra-small devices, such as doping fluctuation effects and quantum confinement effect.", "paper_title": "The New Generation of SOI MOSFETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000207536500001"}
