The key advantage lies in that both the secret and cover images can be accurately reconstructed during decryption. This paper proposes a high capacity data hiding scheme integrated in reversible secret sharing. In secret sharing, some extra confidential data are also hidden in camouflage images by means of a double module mechanism. As a multilevel histogram shifting strategy is employed, a high capacity can be achieved. In the decoder, not only the cover and secret images but also the confidential data can be perfectly recovered. The confidential data can be some affiliated information of the secret image or for validity authentication. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "HIGH CAPACITY DATA HIDING IN REVERSIBLE SECRET SHARING", "paper_id": "WOS:000296939300022"}
