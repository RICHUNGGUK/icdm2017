Some problems of strength and ductility, like insufficient shear strength, pull-out of rebars, local mechanisms, etc., could characterize their structural behaviour. The above mentioned topics lead to a number of problems in the evaluation of the seismic behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) frames. Therefore the assessment of existing RC structures requires advanced tools. A refined model and numerical procedure for the non-linear analysis of reinforced concrete frames is presented. The current version of the model proposed is capable of describing the non-linear behaviour of underdesigned reinforced concrete frames including brittle modes of failure. Selected results of an experimental-theoretical comparison are presented to show the capabilities of this model. The results show the capacity of the model of describing both the global behaviour and the local deformation at service and ultimate state. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
