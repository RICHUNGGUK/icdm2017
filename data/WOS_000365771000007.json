Existing fingerprint reconstruction methods either cannot generate visually plausible or realistic fingerprint images, or suffer from the occurrence of false minutiae in the reconstructed fingerprint images. In this paper, we analyze the underlying reason of false minutiae generated by state-of-the-art amplitude modulation-frequency modulation (AM-FM)-based methods. Furthermore, we propose an improved approach by devising a better way to cope with the branch cuts (or discontinuities) in the fingerprint ridge orientation fields, and by introducing an effective scheme to remove false minutiae from the reconstructed fingerprint images. Compared with previous AM-FM based methods, the proposed method gets rid of block effects and successfully reduces the number of false minutiae. Theoretic proofs are provided with respect to the effectiveness of the proposed method for fingerprints with multiple singular points. The proposed method has also been evaluated on public fingerprint databases. The results demonstrate that it is superior to the existing methods in reconstructing realistic fingerprint images with fewer false minutiae.", "paper_title": "An Improved AM-FM-Based Approach for Reconstructing Fingerprints from Minutiae", "paper_id": "WOS:000365771000007"}
