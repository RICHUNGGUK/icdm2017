However, the attempts to integrate immersive environments in everyday educational practice are hampered by the difficulties that these environments pose to teachers willing to set them up within the already demanding ecology of technological resources present in the classroom. GLUEPS-AR is a system aimed to help teachers deploy and enact learning designs that make use of web technologies (Virtual Learning Environments and Web 2.0 tools), as well as immersive environments such as virtual globes (e.g. Google Earth) used as 3DVW, and general-purpose mobile AR apps. This paper presents the evaluation of the support provided by GLUEPS-AR for teachers that want to appropriate immersive environments in their everyday practice with an affordable orchestration effort. The evaluation followed an interpretive research perspective, and it was carried out in the context of an authentic learning situation about advertising, conducted at a university undergraduate course for pre-service teachers. The results of the evaluation showed that GLUEPS-AR effectively supported the teacher in seamlessly embedding 3DVWs and AR in her practice.", "paper_title": "City Ads: Embedding Virtual Worlds and Augmented Reality in Everyday Educational Practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000347734300005"}
