Nevertheless, the introduction of high bit rate optical services with strict tolerance to signal quality would have a serious impact on the overall network performance since in this circumstance, a request can be blocked due to unacceptable signal quality of potential routes. Chromatic dispersion tolerance, for example, is reduced by the square of the bit rate. By extending the typical application of parametric wavelength converter in solving a wavelength continuity problem, this paper aims to enhance chromatic dispersion management through an improved wavelength conversion algorithm. Consequently, significant improvement in network performance has been demonstrated through reduction in the dispersion effect when the proposed engineering rule is included in the conversion process.", "paper_title": "Network Performance Improvement of All-Optical Networks Through an Algorithmic Based Dispersion Management Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000304304400004"}
