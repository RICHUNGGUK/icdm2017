The networks utilize the knowledge base extracted from a set of data to perform search and adaptation. The performances of the two networks are assessed using benchmark problems, with the results analyzed and discussed. The effects of the network parameters are evaluated through a parametric study. The applicability of the networks is also demonstrated using a real fault detection and diagnosis task in a power generation plant. The experimental results consistently indicate the usefulness of the proposed evolutionary FAM-based networks in yielding good classification performances with parsimonious network structures.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary Fuzzy ARTMAP Neural Networks and their Applications to Fault Detection and Diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000278096200004"}
