However, why customers participate in co-creation activities on these firm-initiated social media sites have received insufficient academic attention. Based on the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, this study develops a model to theorize how site characteristics improve customers' co-creation experiences and subsequently affect their intention to participate in co-creation in the future. The results indicate that future participation intention is determined by customer learning value, social integrative value, and hedonic value experiences, which are influenced by perceived task-relevant and affection-relevant cues.
