Then, we introduce an optimisation approach for the whole process. The grouping method presented is based on the maximisation of a measure that represents the perceptual decision. The whole strategy takes profit from a hierarchical clustering to find a maximum of the proposed criterion. The algorithm has been used to segment real images as well as multispectral images achieving very accurate results on this task.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised image segmentation using a hierarchical clustering selection process", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100088"}
