A web-based virtual online classroom is designed and developed based on learning theories and streaming media technologies. And it is composed of two parts: instructional communicating environment (ICE) and collaborative learning environment (CLE). ICE provides learners with learning materials, lecture videos, and interactive environment etc. CLE supports active learning by providing the environment with learning tools, learning materials and contextual discussion for learners. The environments are designed with event-based synchronous strategies and e-learning technologies standards. Different users have different ideas about the use of learning tools in the virtual classroom. According to the questionnaire, teachers are accustomed to communicating and teaching face to face. They hope they could be able to control the teaching and learning process and observe learners behaviors like in the traditional classroom. Learners love to use such tools as chat-room, BBS, etc., to control their learning pace. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
