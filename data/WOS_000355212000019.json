Instead of using passive inductors that are untunable and unscalable with technologies, gain compensation here is optimized via a tunable and current-reusable active inductor (AI). This AI incorporates a positive-feedback impedance converter with only two MOSFETs and one MOS varactor. Together with the use of: 1) negative Miller capacitors to optimize the pole-zero composition and 2) tunable resistive source degeneration to adjust the low-frequency losses, the analog equalizer recovers an eye-opening rate of minimally 30% up to 10 Gb/s over a pair of 60-cm FR4 microtrip traces. The data Pk-to-Pk jitter is <24 ps, and the RMS jitter is <4 ps, over a number of pseudorandom bit sequence patterns (2(7)-1, 2(15)-1, and 2(31)-1).", "paper_title": "A Highly-Scalable Analog Equalizer Using a Tunable and Current-Reusable Active Inductor for 10-Gb/sI/O Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000355212000019"}
