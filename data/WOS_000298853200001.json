Some of the possible real world problems such as partial observability of the environment, nondeterministic effects of web services and service execution failures are solved through a dynamic planning approach. The proposed approach is based on a novel AI planner that is designed for working in highly dynamic environments under time constraints, namely Simplanner. World altering service calls are done according to the WS-Coordination and WS-Business Activity web service transaction specifications in order to physically recover from failure situations and prevent the undesired side effects of the aborted web service composition efforts.", "paper_title": "Dynamic planning approach to automated web service composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000298853200001"}
