FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) technology is applied to obtain chaotic sequence in this paper. Based on the design of a digital integrator and quantification circuit, we get Lorenz chaotic output sequence by DSP Builder tool. This design method may improve arithmetic precision according to the need of the system and resource efficiency. Experiment shows the output sequence of the designed system has good self-correlation. This method can be applied to other continuous chaotic systems and may be applied to chaotic system for information security and secrecy communication field.", "paper_title": "Designing of chaotic system output sequence circuit based on FPGA and its applications in network encryption card", "paper_id": "WOS:000244974000018"}
