As part of this sophisticated SHM system, 48 temperature sensors have been deployed at 12 cross-sections of the reinforced concrete inner structure of the GIST to provide on-line monitoring via a wireless data transmission system. In this paper, the differential temperature profiles in the reinforced concrete inner structure of the GTST, which are mainly caused by solar radiation, are recognized from the monitoring data with the purpose of understanding the temperature-induced structural internal forces and deformations. After a careful examination of the pre-classified temperature measurement data obtained under sunny days and non-sunny days, common characteristic of the daily temperature variation is observed from the data acquired in sunny days. Making use of 60-day temperature measurement data obtained in sunny days, statistical patterns of the daily rising temperature and daily descending temperature are synthesized, and temperature distribution models of the reinforced concrete inner structure of the GTST are formulated using linear regression analysis. The developed monitoring-based temperature distribution models will serve as a reliable input for numerical prediction of the temperature-induced deformations and provide a robust basis to facilitate the design and construction of similar structures in consideration of thermal effects.", "paper_title": "Modeling of temperature distribution in a reinforced concrete supertall structure based on structural health monitoring data", "paper_id": "WOS:000291712200003"}
