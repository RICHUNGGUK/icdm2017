The observations of the cooperative secondary users (SUs) whose statistics fall into the censoring interval are processed by SR system in the proposed scheme. The hard fusion and the soft fusion for the censoring cooperative spectrum sensing scheme are analyzed respectively. Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that the proposed censoring cooperative spectrum sensing scheme has the same detection performance as and lower computational complexity than the method that each cooperative SU performs spectrum sensing using SR-based energy detection, and its detection performance is superior to that of the conventional method that all the cooperative SUs perform spectrum sensing using energy detection in hard fusion. In soft fusion, the proposed censoring cooperative spectrum sensing based on equal gain combination can achieve the optimal sensing performance approximately.", "paper_title": "Cooperative spectrum sensing based on stochastic resonance in cognitive radio networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330681500006"}
