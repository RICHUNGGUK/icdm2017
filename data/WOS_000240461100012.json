The goal is to determine values of model parameters that provide the best fit to measured data, generally based on some type of least-squares or maximum likelihood criterion. Usually, this requires the solution of a non-linear and frequently non-convex optimization problem. In this paper we describe a user-friendly, computationally efficient parallel implementation of the Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (SCEM-UA) global optimization algorithm for stochastic estimation of parameters in environmental models. Our parallel implementation takes better advantage of the computational power of a distributed computer system. Three case studies of increasing complexity demonstrate that parallel parameter estimation results in a considerable time savings when compared with traditional sequential optimization runs. The proposed method therefore provides an ideal means to solve complex optimization problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
