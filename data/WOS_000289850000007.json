The morphological parser is a state-of-the-art finite-state transducer-based implementation of Turkish morphology. The disambiguator is based on the averaged perceptron algorithm and has the best accuracy reported for Turkish in the literature. The text corpus has been compiled from the web and contains about 500 million tokens. This is the largest Turkish web corpus published.", "paper_title": "Resources for Turkish morphological processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000289850000007"}
