The proposed method of solution draws on the recent work of Miyoshi and Kusano, in the context of adiabatic MHD, where an approximate solution to the Riemann problem is sought in terms of an average constant velocity and total pressure across the Riemann fan. This allows the formation of four intermediate states enclosed by two outermost fast discontinuities and separated by two rotational waves and an entropy mode. In the present work, a corresponding derivation for the isothermal MHD equations is presented. It is found that the absence of the entropy mode leads to a different formulation which is based on a three-state representation rather than four. Numerical tests in one and two dimensions demonstrate that the new solver is robust and comparable in accuracy to the more expensive linearized solver of Roe, although considerably faster.
