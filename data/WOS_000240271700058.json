In this paper we study a particular instance of sense of direction, called a chordal sense of direction (CSD). In special, we analyze the class of k-regular graphs that admit a CSD with exactly k labels (a minimal CSD). We prove that connected graphs in this class are Hamiltonian and that the class is equivalent to that of circulant graphs, presenting an efficient (polynomial-time) way of recognizing it when the graphs' degree k is fixed.", "paper_title": "Minimal chordal sense of direction and circulant graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700058"}
