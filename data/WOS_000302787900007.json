In this paper, the study is concentrated on the latter solution, where a structure-free modelling paradigm is proposed. It does not rely on a fixed structure and can combine various modelling techniques in 'symbiosis' using a 'master fuzzy system'. This approach is shown to be able to include the advantages of different modelling techniques altogether by requiring less training and by minimising the efforts relating optimisation of the final structure. The proposed approach is then successfully applied to the industrial problems of predicting machining induced residual stresses for aerospace alloy components as well as modelling the mechanical properties of heat-treated alloy steels, both representing complex, non-linear and multi-dimensional environments.
