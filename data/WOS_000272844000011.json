In this paper, we focus on multiphase segmentation with a new regularization term that yields an unsupervised segmentation model. We propose a functional that automatically chooses a favorable number of phases as it segments the image. The primary driving force of the segmentation is the intensity fitting term while a phase scale measure complements the regularization term. We propose a fast, yet simple, brute-force numerical algorithm and present experimental results showing the robustness and stability of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Unsupervised Multiphase Segmentation: A Phase Balancing Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000272844000011"}
