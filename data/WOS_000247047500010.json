A pre-requisite for the provision of an effective service is to ensure quality of service (QoS) during the concurrent execution of requests and system or network failures. This paper presents a new transaction management approach for the provision of mobile services which is based on advanced transaction models and fuzzy selection criteria. It employs a novel QoS consensus moderation approach in order to select preferred mobile services from among various alternatives, thus providing multiple pathways to the completion of mobile service transactions. Unlike traditional transaction management schemes, the proposed approach takes into account QoS attributes in the commit process of mobile service transactions. The proposed approach is implemented as a prototype tool and evaluated through a number of experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively selects mobile services and significantly increases the throughput (i.e. commit rate) of mobile service transactions.
