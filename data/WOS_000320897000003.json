It is found that mild variation of eta barely changes the drop shape and terminal velocity while keeping the other non-dimensional parameters fixed, whereas lambda, N-f and Eo significantly affect the drop dynamics. With the increase of lambda, N-f or Eo, the drop becomes either more dimpled or more crescent. The flow details inside and around the drop are also investigated. A recirculation zone is observed for small lambda or large Eo, and it becomes larger with the decrease of lambda and increase of Eo. In addition, the qualitative and quantitative relationships between Fr, the non-dimensional terminal velocity of the drop, and lambda, N-f and Eo are proposed based on the simulation results.
