The boundary layer effect and thin body effect are dealt with. The completely analytical integral formulas are suitable for the linear and non-isoparametric quadratic elements. The present algorithm applies the analytical formulas to treat nearly singular integrals. The potentials and fluxes at the interior points very close to boundary are evaluated. The unknown potentials and fluxes at boundary nodes for thin body problems with the thickness-to-length ratios from IE-I to IE-8 are accurately calculated by the present algorithm. Numerical examples on heat conduction demonstrate that the present algorithm can effectively handle nearly singular integrals occurring in boundary layer effect and thin body effect in BEM. Furthermore, the present linear BEM is especially accurate and efficient for the numerical analysis of thin body problems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
