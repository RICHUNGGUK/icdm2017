The robust nonlinear controller is designed by combining the nonlinear PD (NPD) control with the robust dynamics compensation. The NPD control is used to eliminate the trajectory disturbances, unmodeled dynamics and nonlinear friction, and the robust control is used to restrain the model uncertainties of the parallel manipulator. The proposed controller is proven to guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system by the Lyapunov theory. The trajectory tracking experiment with the robust nonlinear controller is implemented on an actual planar 2-DOF parallel manipulator with redundant actuation. The experimental results are compared with the augmented PD (APD) controller, and the proposed controller shows much better trajectory tracking accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
