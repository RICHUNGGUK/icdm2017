We next integrate the proposed detection algorithm with an interacting multiple-model method and multiple filter bank approach to provide an effective solution for tracking multiple single-pixel nonmaneuvering and maneuvering targets. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we establish the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach. Based on exhaustive empirical study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in tracking multiple single-pixel targets in a sequence of infrared images with clutter and occlusion due. to moving clouds in airborne applications.", "paper_title": "Wavelet-based detection and its application to tracking in an IR sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000250395300017"}
