The proposed scheme can reduce the test application time and minimize the amount of compressed test data, which reduces the size of data memory in ATE and the time needed to transfer test data. A decoder design is also presented. Experimental results on ISCAS benchmark circuits show that the compressed data produced by our method are much smaller than previous methods.", "paper_title": "Test data compression for minimum test application time", "paper_id": "WOS:000250993900016"}
