For this purpose, our research will be carried out in three stages. The first, based on previous studies in this area, will determine those aspects that influence reusability. The second will define a set of metrics that measure those aspects using metadata. The third will propose different methods of aggregation in order to obtain a single resulting value and evaluate the efficiency of the model by analyzing a significant set of learning objects obtained from the eLera and Merlot repositories. The results obtained suggest that the proposed indicator could provide useful information when searching for learning objects in repositories. This reusability measurement could constitute an indicator of quality, which would allow search results to be ordered, with those with the greatest possibility of being reused taking priority. Furthermore, the proposed reusability indicator could be calculated automatically or in an assisted way if metadata elements satisfy the minimum quality requisites identified.", "paper_title": "Metrics-based evaluation of learning object reusability", "paper_id": "WOS:000286465500006"}
