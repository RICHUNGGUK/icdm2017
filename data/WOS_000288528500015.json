Furthermore, it can be shown that the approximation solution converges in probability to the true optimal estimate for the case 1 < p <= 2 and the approximation solution converges almost surely to the true optimal estimate for the case p > 2. In addition, some numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the main convergence results.", "paper_title": "L-p (p > 1) Convergence results for Particle Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000288528500015"}
