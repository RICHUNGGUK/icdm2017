The study was performed using different theory levels for predicting the vibrational data of isolated dicationic alpha,omega-diamines and their hydrochloride forms, with and without the explicit account of the interactions with the chloride counterions. Different sets of correction factors were determined for each theory level considering the four smallest elements for the alpha,omega-diamines series, while their transferability and reliability was evaluated considering the larger elements of the series. The theory level simplification was also evaluated and was found to neither compromise the vibrational frequencies estimates nor the magnitude and accuracy of the pre- defined scaling factors. This suggests that transferability of the correction factors is possible not only for different diamines but also between different levels of theory with the averaged group correction factor,.g a, being the best choice to account for the effects of the N- H center dot center dot center dot Cl interactions. The possibility of simplifying the theory level without compromising efficiency and accuracy is additionally of utmost importance. This computational approach can constitute a valuable tool in the future for studying the hydrochloride forms of larger and more complex diamine systems.", "paper_title": "On the correction of calculated vibrational frequencies for the effects of the counterions - alpha,omega-diamine dihydrochlorides", "paper_id": "WOS:000362411800017"}
