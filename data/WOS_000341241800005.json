Energy absorption inside the cornea is modeled using the Beer-Lambert law that is incorporated as an exponentially decaying heat source. The hyperbolic and parabolic bioheat models of the tissue were solved by exploiting the mathematical analogy between thermal and electrical systems, by using robust circuit simulation program called Hspice to get the solutions of simultaneous RLC and RC transmission line networks. This method can be used to rapidly calculate the temperature in laser-irradiated tissue at time and space domain. It is found that internal energy gained from the irradiated field results in a rapid rise of temperature in the cornea surface during the early heating period, while the hyperbolic wave model predicts a higher temperature rise than the classical heat diffusion model. In addition, this paper investigates and examines the effect of some critical parameters such as relaxation time, convection coefficient, radiation, tear evaporation and variable thermal conductivity of cornea. Accordingly, it is found that a better accordance between hyperbolic and parabolic models will be achieved by time.", "paper_title": "Modeling of ultrashort pulsed laser irradiation in the cornea based on parabolic and hyperbolic heat equations using electrical analogy", "paper_id": "WOS:000341241800005"}
