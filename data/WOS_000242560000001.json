In this work, we offer to create concurrent virtual channels over same physical channel by synchronizing the transmit/receive switching of senders and receivers and allow parallel data transfer. Each virtual channel is used by a transmitter/receiver pair and all virtual channels within 2-hop network utilize the medium by distributed coordination and avoid inter virtual channel interference. Simulation result shows that proposed scheme removes the obstruction to participate in parallel transmission for some neighboring nodes of sender and receiver and improves the network performance.", "paper_title": "Enhanced multimedia and real-time stream throughput in wireless ad-hoc LAN using distributed virtual channel based MAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000242560000001"}
