In this paper, the notion of fuzzy soft lattice is defined and some related properties are derived, which extends the notion of a fuzzy lattice to include the algebraic structures of soft sets. Then the lattice structure of fuzzy soft lattices are discussed. At last, the concept of fuzzy soft ideal over a lattice is presented and the lattice structures of fuzzy soft ideal over a lattice are discussed.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Soft Sets and Fuzzy Soft Lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000311119400011"}
