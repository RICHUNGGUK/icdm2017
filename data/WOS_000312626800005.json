Although chemometric techniques like parallel factor analysis and multivariate curve resolution can help to purify spectra and improve correlations with reference compounds, file incompatibilities between GC-MS acquisition software and modeling software prevent the modeled spectra from being easily compared to spectra in reference libraries. In this paper we present an enhancement to OpenChrom, an open-source software for chromatography and mass spectrometry, which implements the automated cross-matching of modeled spectra to NIST08 and NIST11 mass spectral databases. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated using a complex environmental dataset consisting of non-methane volatile organic compound emissions sampled on an Australian poultry farm.
