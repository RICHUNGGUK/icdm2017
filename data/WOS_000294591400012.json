The Gutman index S(G) is defined as S(G) = Sigma(u,v is an element of V(G)) d(G)(u)d(G)(v)d(u v) where d(G)(u) is the degree of u, d(u v) is the distance between u and v and the summation goes over all pairs of vertices in G. In this paper, we determine that among all bicyclic graphs of order n, the graph formed from two triangles linked by a path has maximal Gutman index.", "paper_title": "The Maximal Gutman Index of Bicyclic Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000294591400012"}
