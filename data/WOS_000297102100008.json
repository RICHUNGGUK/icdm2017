In most of cases these courses include the work in the laboratory with the aim to provide students not only with the theoretical background but also with some practical experience. The article presents an approach of achieving this using the originally developed VSDS environment. The background and motivation leading towards the development of the VSDS environment are first given. Then, the VSDS environment features are briefly described. Finally, the use of the VSDS environment in laboratories for the courses in the logical design of digital systems, the computer architecture and organisation and the design of computer systems is presented.
