Through a combination of these processes, CA-PCA can extract features appropriate for classification. Our theoretical analysis aims to clarify the role of these processes and to provide an explanation on how CA-PCA can extract good features. Experimental results for various datasets are provided in order to show the validity of the proposed method for real problems. The effect of parameters on the quality of extracted features is also investigated and the rules Of thumb for determining the appropriate Parameters are provided. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
