The use of smartphones and wireless data networks is becoming widespread in both rich and poor countries, outpacing the adoption of other Information and Communications Technologies, such as wired communications and personal computers. Specially, mobile telephony is already providing a toolkit to fight the digital divide in poor countries since they are used to getting information and services about agriculture, health, and education among other areas. Many studies and experiences state the usefulness of mobile phones in the area of education in order to help achieve universal primary education. But most of these experiences have serious limitations that affect their long-term sustainability. In this line, the current paper provides a set of guidelines to define more sustainable and long-term viable mobile-learning projects and shows its applications to an m-learning project: the Moodbile project.", "paper_title": "M-Learning Projects Sustainability: Guidelines to Address It", "paper_id": "WOS:000209590100002"}
