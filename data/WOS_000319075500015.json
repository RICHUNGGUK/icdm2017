This study puts forward six widely used case-based reasoning (CBR) methods with optimized weights derived from the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method to estimate the software effort. Meanwhile, four combination methods are adopted to assemble the results of independent CBR methods. The experiments are carried out using two datasets of software projects from Desharnais dataset and Miyazaki dataset. Experimental results show that different CBR methods can get the best results in different parameters settings, and there is not a best method for the software effort estimation among the six different CBR methods. Currently, combination methods proposed in this study outperform independent methods, and the weighted mean combination (WMC) method can get the better result.", "paper_title": "Linear combination of multiple case-based reasoning with optimized weight for software effort estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000319075500015"}
