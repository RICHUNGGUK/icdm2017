Design/methodology/approach - Combined with elements of action research, a longitudinal case study of implementing a wiki in a department of a Slovenian company was conducted. Interviews, surveys and a log analysis were used for the data collection. The Delone and McLean information systems success model was the underlying theoretical approach to explore the information, systems and service quality. Findings - While a wiki may bring important benefits and change to a company's information/knowledge management, the main challenges remain the same as with earlier technological solutions. Additional problems arise due to cultural issues, the lack of control over quality and the fact that service quality largely depends on the users. Research limitations/implications - A single case study within one company was conducted. Practical implications - The findings are important for any manager or developer intending to implement a wiki as an intranet solution as they identify and classify potential challenges. Originality/value - As one of the first longitudinal case studies of implementing a wiki, several new challenges of Web 2.0 applications and of creating online environments for knowledge sharing are identified, while well-studied problems concerning other projects seeking to develop information systems also apply. A novel extension to the Delone and McLean model is proposed.", "paper_title": "A wiki as intranet: a critical analysis using the Delone and McLean model", "paper_id": "WOS:000273759300005"}
