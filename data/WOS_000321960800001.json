However, the existing modeling methods allow modeling of either DERTS or SOC concepts and there is a lack of meta-model for Service-Oriented development of DERTS. This paper proposes a service-based meta-model for DERTS, along with the constraints of the elements of the meta-model. A Smart Home case study was designed to validate the meta-model. This meta-model could not only be beneficial for Service-Oriented development of DERTS, but can also be used at the Platform Independent Model (PIM) level of MDD.", "paper_title": "Service based meta-model for the development of distributed embedded real-time systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000321960800001"}
