Many authors have considered how the diversity and array gains from CT may benefit a wireless multi-hop network, when the gains are used for increasing link reliability and reducing transmit power. However, relatively less attention has been given to the benefits of CT range extension and few testbed implementations of CT have been demonstrated. In this paper, we focus on how CT range extension can impact the lower three layers, especially medium access control (MAC) and routing for ad hoc and sensor multi-hop networks (AHSMNs). We assume cooperators decode and forward the packets. Various analytical models, performance analyses, and experimental results using software-defined radios in an indoor office environment are discussed. For wireless sensor networks (WSNs), we review CT range extension at the network layer, to eliminate the energy hole that forms around sink nodes in non-CT networks, and we review cooperator selection and duty cycle scheduling algorithms at Layer 2, to maximize the lifetime of a multi-hop WSN. For ad hoc networks, we emphasize a family of lightweight broadcasting and unicasting protocols based on a simple form of CT called the opportunistic large array (OLA). Experimental results, including OLA-based unicast routing and diversity order effects in two-hop CT networks, are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
