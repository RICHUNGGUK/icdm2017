The translocation operation is one of the popular operations for genome rearrangement. It was proved that computing the unsigned translocation distance is NP-hard. In this paper, we present a (1.5 + E)-approximation algorithm for computing the unsigned translocation distance that 4), improves upon the best known 1.75-ratio. The runtime of our algorithm is O(n(2) + (4/epsilon)(1.5) root log(4/epsilon)2(4/epsilon)), where n is the total number of genes in the genome.", "paper_title": "A (1.5+epsilon)-approximation algorithm for unsigned translocation distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000253417100005"}
