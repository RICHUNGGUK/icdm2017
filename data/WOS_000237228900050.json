PEA is inspired by the Quantum computation and the Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm, and it has a good balance between exploration and exploitation with very fast computation speed. In the PEA based human tracking framework, tracking is considered to be a function optimization problem, so the aim is to optimize the matching function between the model and the image observation. Then PEA is used to optimize the matching function. Experiments on synthetic and real image sequences of human motion demonstrate the effectiveness, significance and computation efficiency of the proposed human tracking method.", "paper_title": "Probability evolutionary algorithm based human body tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900050"}
