First we introduce the definition for generalized lower and upper approximation operators determined by mappings between two complete atomic Boolean algebras. Then we find the conditions which permit a given lattice-theoretic operator to represent a upper (or lower) approximation derived from a special mapping. Different sets of axioms of lattice-theoretic operator guarantee the existence of different types of mappings which produce the same operator.", "paper_title": "On axiomatic characterization of approximation operators based on atomic Boolean algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500019"}
