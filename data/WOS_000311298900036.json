To that end, we present an efficient visibility algorithm based on spatial line sampling, and a novel intersection algorithm between line sample planes and Bezier splines with varying thickness. Our algorithm produces accurate visibility both when the projected width of the curve is a tiny fraction of a pixel, and when the projected width is tens of pixels. In addition, we present a rapid resolve procedure that computes final visibility. Using an optimized implementation running on graphics processors, we can render tens of thousands long hair strands with noise-free visibility at near-interactive rates.", "paper_title": "High-Quality Curve Rendering using Line Sampled Visibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000311298900036"}
