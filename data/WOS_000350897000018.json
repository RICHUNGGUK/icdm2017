Important performance measures for the design of an engine cradle include stiffness, natural frequency, and durability, while minimizing weight is of primary concern. This paper presents an effective and efficient methodology for engine cradle design from conceptual design to detailed design using design optimization. First, topology optimization was applied on a solid model which only contains the possible engine cradle design space, and an optimum conceptual design was determined which minimizes weight while satisfying all stiffness constraints. Based on topology optimization results, a design review was conducted, and a revised model was created which addresses all structural and manufacturability concerns. Shape and size optimization was then performed in the detailed design stage to further minimize the mass while meeting the stiffness and natural frequency targets. Lastly, the final design was validated for durability. The initial design domain had the mass of 82.6 kg; topology optimization in conceptual design reduced the mass to 26.7 kg; and the detailed design task involving shape and size optimization further reduced the mass to 21.4 kg.", "paper_title": "Conceptual and detailed design of an automotive engine cradle by using topology, shape, and size optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000350897000018"}
