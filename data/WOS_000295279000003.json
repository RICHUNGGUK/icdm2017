The implemented spiking network relies on synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation and long-term depression) to adapt and cope with perturbations in the manipulation scenario: changes in dynamics and kinematics of the simulated robot. Furthermore, the effect of several degrees of noise in the cerebellar input pathway (mossy fibers) was assessed depending on the employed control architecture. The implemented cerebellar model managed to adapt in the three control architectures to different dynamics and kinematics providing corrective actions for more accurate movements. According to the obtained results, coupling both control architectures (forward&recurrent) provides benefits of the two of them and leads to a higher robustness against noise.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE CEREBELLAR SPIKING MODEL EMBEDDED IN THE CONTROL LOOP: CONTEXT SWITCHING AND ROBUSTNESS AGAINST NOISE", "paper_id": "WOS:000295279000003"}
