Lacking knowledge of SQ and CS results in poor efficiency. To develop cost-effective strategies for improvements, the relationship between SQ and CS must be investigated. This work proposes novel procedures to explore the relationship between identified SQ attributes and CS in the CM business. First, we conduct exploratory factor analysis to cluster intrinsically similar attributes into three constructs and identify significant attributes for subsequent assessment. Furthermore, resident satisfaction scores (RSSs) are computed to assess the relative importance rate (RIR) of investigated attributes by applying an adapted multivariate method to regress the RSSs on the performance of SQ attributes. To facilitate the decision-making process, the service-quality model evolved from the integration of an improved Kano's approach and importance-performance analysis (IPA) is utilized to develop a prioritized strategy for satisfaction improvements in the CM business.
