The result is a rational model of computational attention in which a multi-bitrate attention map will provide us with the attention score for each spatial location at high and low quality versions of the image reconstruction. At any time a rational system should choose, even though without any outside knowledge, among alternative spatial locations in such a way as to avoid certain forms of behavioral inconsistency. We compare the performance between a rational approach of computational attention and various models for predicting visual target distinctness, using scenes that represent military vehicles in complex rural backgrounds.
