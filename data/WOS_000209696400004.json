The comparison is done by studying the base station densities without having to solve for the distributions of the carrier-to-interference ratio, which are often hard to obtain.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Ordering Based Carrier-to-Interference Ratio Analysis for the Shotgun Cellular Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696400004"}
