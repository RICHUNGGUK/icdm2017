With port reduction, RF ports need to be shared among Function Units (FUs), which may lead to access conflicts, and thus, reduced performance. Our solution includes (i) a carefully designed RF-FU interconnection network that permits port sharing with minimum conflicts and without any delay/energy overheads, and (ii) a novel scheduling and binding algorithm that reduces the performance penalty. With our solution, we observed as much as 83% RF energy savings with no more than a 10% loss in performance for a set of Mediabench and Mibench benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Shared-Port Register File Architecture for Low-Energy VLIW Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000334573800001"}
