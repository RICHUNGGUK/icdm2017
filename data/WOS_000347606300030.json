Although these frameworks are valuable ways of initially identifying factors related to pupils' ICT competences, they do not take into account the broader classroom and school context in which pupils are embedded. Moreover, most frameworks and their corresponding instruments focus on post-primary education. This study first presents a multilayered model that can be used to guide future studies that try to explain why some primary-school pupils are more effective in acquiring ICI competences than others. Factors are situated on the pupil, classroom and school level. Second, this study provides future research with a range of reliable measurement instruments to identify factors related to primary school pupils' ICT competences. These factors were drawn from the developed multilayered model. A survey was conducted in a large sample of primary school pupils (n = 2413), their parents (n = 2267) and their teachers (n = 134). The results of the replication exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicate a good factorial validity and reliability of the developed scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
