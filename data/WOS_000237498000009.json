The authors have shown in previous research that uniqueness and consistency of keystroke patterns are important factors to authentication accuracy and that they can be improved by employing artificial rhythms and tempo cues. In this paper, we implement the pause strategy and/or auditory cues for KDA and assess their effectiveness using various novelty detectors. Experimental results show that improved uniqueness and consistency lead to enhanced authentication performance, in particular for those users with poor typing ability.", "paper_title": "Improving authentication accuracy of unfamiliar passwords with pauses and cues for keystroke dynamics-based authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000237498000009"}
