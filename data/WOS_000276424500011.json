We examine the homology of the independence complex Sigma(G/I) of G/I for subgroups I of K of full rank, focusing on the case that G is the square, triangular, or hexagonal grid. Specifically, we look for a certain kind of homology cycles that we refer to as \"cross-cycles,\" the rationale for the terminology being that they are fundamental cycles of the boundary complex of some cross-polytope. For the special cases just mentioned, we determine the set Q(G, K) of rational numbers r such that there is a group I with the property that Sigma(G/I) contains cross-cycles of degree exactly r . |G/I| - 1; |G/I| denotes the size of the vertex set of G/I. In each of the three cases, Q( G, K) turns out to be an interval of the form [a, b] boolean AND Q = {r is an element of Q : a <= r <= b}. For example, for the square grid, we obtain the interval [1/5, 1/4] boolean AND Q.", "paper_title": "Certain Homology Cycles of the Independence Complex of Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000276424500011"}
