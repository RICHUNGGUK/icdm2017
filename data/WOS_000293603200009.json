We suggest that this difference, due to a separation in the time scales of the dynamics guiding neural processes and the overall behavioral expression, is a key point in understanding the implementation of cognitive processes in general. In this paper we use Structured Flows on Manifolds (SFM) to understand the organization of behavioral dynamics possessing this property. Next, we discuss how this form of behavioral dynamics can be distributed across a network, such as those recruited in the brain for particular cognitive functions. Finally, we provide an example of an SFM style functional architecture of handwriting, motivated by studies in human movement sciences, that demonstrates hierarchical sequencing of behavioral processes.", "paper_title": "Building Neurocognitive Networks with a Distributed Functional Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000293603200009"}
