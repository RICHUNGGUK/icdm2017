An in-house finite element method (FEM) solver is utilized to develop accurate and efficient macromodels that capture all the essential characteristics of the device. Using the datasets generated from the FEM simulations, the artificial neural network models are trained for two-way mapping between the physical input and electrical output parameters. Realized model is implemented in a circuit simulator, enabling a simple yet accurate circuit simulator compatible modeling and optimization procedure instead of memory and time demanding FEM analysis. The derivation of dynamic macromodels with preserved electromechanical behavior of the multiport resonating structures is also presented. Capabilities of the proposed approach are demonstrated with several examples featuring capacitively actuated MEMS resonating structures: a clamped-clamped beam, a free-free beam, and a coupled clamped-clamped beam.
