Then, the concepts and formal definitions of self, nonself, antibody, antigen, agent and match algorithm in the grid security domain are given. Besides, the mathematical models of self, mature MoA (mature monitoring agent), dynamic memory MoA (memory monitoring agent) survival, CoA (communicator agent), and BoA (beating off agent) are established. The effects of several import parameters on system performance and detection efficiency in the model of dynamic memory MoA survival are analyzed and shown in the experiments. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show the model which enhances detection efficiency and assures steady performance in immune-based IDS is a good solution to grid intrusion detection.", "paper_title": "Immunity and mobile agent based intrusion detection for grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100020"}
