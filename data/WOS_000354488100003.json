We show that under such conditions the robust shortest path problem can be formulated as a binary nonlinear integer program, which can then be reformulated as a mixed integer conic quadratic program. Based on this reformulation, we present an outer approximation algorithm as a solution algorithm which is shown to be highly efficient for this class of programs. Numerical experiments conducted on small to large networks further compare the robust optimization-based strategy to the classical deterministic shortest path in terms of the uncertainty in the network.", "paper_title": "Robust Optimization Strategy for the Shortest Path Problem under Uncertain Link Travel Cost Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000354488100003"}
