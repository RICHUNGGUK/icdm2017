Upon completing service, customers may leave, or re-enter the queue, possibly as customers of a different class. The server is operating under the egalitarian processor sharing discipline. Building on prior work by Gromoll et al. (Ann. Appl. Probab. 12:797-859, 2002) and Puha et al. (Math. Oper. Res. 31(2):316-350, 2006), we establish the convergence of a properly normalized state process to a fluid limit characterized by a system of algebraic and integral equations. We show the existence of a unique solution to this system of equations, both for a stable and an overloaded queue. We also describe the asymptotic behavior of the trajectories of the fluid limit.", "paper_title": "The fluid limit of the multiclass processor sharing queue", "paper_id": "WOS:000306338700001"}
