In this article we explore an automatic and fast function to approximate the accuracy of a given classifier on a typical dataset. Then employing the function, we can convert the ensemble learning to an optimisation problem. So, in this article, the target is to achieve a model to approximate the performance of a predetermined classifier over each arbitrary dataset. According to this model, an optimisation problem is designed and a genetic algorithm is employed as an optimiser to explore the best classifier set in each subspace. The proposed ensemble methodology is called classifier ensemble based on subspace learning (CEBSL). CEBSL is examined on some datasets and it shows considerable improvements.", "paper_title": "A new classifier ensemble methodology based on subspace learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000318153800005"}
