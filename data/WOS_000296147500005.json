The proposed model comprises of a loaded spiral T-shaped SIS that reduces the size of a conventional SIS line as well as improving its frequency ratio. The proposed model behaves exactly similar to the recently developed dual-band resonators with the advantage of size reduction of similar to 35% as well as having a wide range of realizable frequency ratios between 1.4 and 3.7 compared to 1.7-2.7 and 1.8-2.3 for the conventional SIS and T-shaped transmission-lines, respectively. Dual-narrowband and wideband branch-line couplers were developed based on the spiral T-shaped SIS lines. The dual-wideband device's bandwidth was enhanced by 2.7% accompanied by a size reduction of 58.6% in comparison with the conventional dual-wideband couplers operating at the same frequencies. The theoretical results were verified by measurement. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
