This work is motivated by the goal of integrating all the steps of DNA computing into one machine called DNA computing processor. The basic structure of processor consists of making DNA micro-arrays unit, encoding DNA sequences unit, micro-reaction unit, solution extraction unit and micro-control unit. The functions of each unit are discussed in detail, especially for the solution extraction unit, where the optimal solution spaces are extracted. Finally, conclusions are drawn and future studies are discussed.", "paper_title": "DNA computing processor: An integrated scheme based on biochip technology for performing DNA computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400027"}
