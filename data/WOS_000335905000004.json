The data involves 4,707 Chinese S&T policies during the period between 1949 and 2010, which are grouped into five phases, based on the process of S&T system reform in China. We also found that S&T policies in China are leaning more towards basic research, and the gap between basic research and applied research is shrinking.", "paper_title": "Basic research is overshadowed by applied research in China: a policy perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000335905000004"}
