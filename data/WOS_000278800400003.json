Drawing from a combination of qualitative case study and historical research methods, and using Henri Lefebvre's spatial triad as an analytical framework, the researcher compares such past and present aspects of the library space as accessibility, supervision of the library space, the patron's sense of connection to the outside, and community reflection. The article suggests that the Owen Sound Carnegie Library as a place represents a possible new type of public library building worthy of further study: the historical library building in the community, a type of library that is not merely an obsolete relic of the past but is instead a vibrant and flexible place within the community.", "paper_title": "Living History: The Carnegie Library as Place in Ontario", "paper_id": "WOS:000278800400003"}
