It relies in producing of a set of certain elements in fixed intervals of time (cycle time). Process optimization is reduced to minimization of cycle time, i.e., the time after which the next batch of the same elements may be produced. Since the problem is strongly NP-hard, in order to solve it an approximate algorithm was used. There is presented a graph model of a problem and the so called block eliminating properties capable of reducing, in a significant way, neighborhood used in the tabu search algorithm. Conducted computational experiments confirm high efficiency of the proposed technique. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
