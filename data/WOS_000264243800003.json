To provide efficient implementations of such algorithms one need to be careful with the underlying arithmetic. It is well known that modular techniques such as the Chinese remainder algorithm or the p-adic lifting allow very good practical performance, especially when word size arithmetic is used. Therefore, finite field arithmetic becomes an important core for efficient exact linear algebra libraries. In this article, we study high performance implementations of basic linear algebra routines over word size prime fields: especially matrix multiplication; our goal being to provide an exact alternate to the numerical BLAS library. We show that this is made possible by a careful combination of numerical computations and asymptotically faster algorithms. Our kernel has several symbolic linear algebra applications enabled by diverse matrix multiplication reductions: symbolic triangularization, system solving, determinant, and matrix inverse implementations are thus studied.", "paper_title": "Dense Linear Algebra over Word-Size Prime Fields: the FFLAS and FFPACK Packages", "paper_id": "WOS:000264243800003"}
