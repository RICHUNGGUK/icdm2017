Mobile devices with embedded WLAN functionality are becoming increasingly popular. Such devices must be designed to support applications that require high quality of service (QoS) and have favorable to maximize battery capacity. The resources of queues in IEEE 802.11e networks may be wasted by the transmission of information that is useless to the receiver. This work develops a frame-based mapping mechanism (FBM) that exploits different methods to process I/P/B (Intra/Predictive/Bipredictive) video frame packets. FBM refers to the dropping of arriving packets if the preceding packets in the same video frame have been dropped. When fragmented packets of a single frame are allocated to different access categories (AC) queues, out-of order delivery may occur. Hence, FBM tries to treat all fragmented packets of each video frame equally and allocates them to the same AC queue if possible. The simulation results demonstrate that transmission by the FBM is more efficient than that by other mechanisms, such as EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access), static mapping and adaptive mapping, suggesting that the energy of a device is not wasted in the transmission of useless video data in WLANs.
