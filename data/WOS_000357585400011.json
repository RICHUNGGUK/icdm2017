Hydraulic jumps constitute a common phenomenon in the hydraulics of open channels that increases the shear stress on streambeds, so promoting their erosion. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model is proposed to analyze hydraulic jumps in horizontal smooth rectangular prismatic open-air channels (i.e., the so-called classical hydraulic jump). Turbulence is modeled using three widely used Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, namely: Standard k - epsilon, RNG k - epsilon, and SST k - omega. The coexistence of two fluids and the definition of an interface between them are treated using a volume method in Cartesian grids of several element sizes. An innovative way to deal with the outlet boundary condition that allows the size of the simulated domain to be reduced is presented. A case study is conducted for validation purposes (FR1 similar to 6.10, Re-1 similar to 3.5.10(5)): several variables of interest are computed (sequent depths, efficiency, roller length, free surface profile, etc.) and compared to previous studies, achieving accuracies above 98% in all cases. In the light of the results, the model can be applied to real-life cases of design of hydraulic structures.", "paper_title": "Numerical analysis of hydraulic jumps using OpenFOAM", "paper_id": "WOS:000357585400011"}
