Then we will investigate continuity of algebraic operations in this space. We will show that the class of all fuzzy Menger normed algebras strictly contains the class of normed algebras. Finally. we will prove Hyers Ulam Rassias superstability of generalized derivation functional equation f(ax + by + vw) = af(x) + bf(y) + vf(w)+ g(v)w (x, y, v, w is an element of X; 0 not equal a, b is an element of C) in complete fuzzy Menger normed algebras. A few applications of our results will be exhibited. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
