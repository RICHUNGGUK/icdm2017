This uncertainty undermines the accuracy and effectiveness of traditional DPM approaches. This paper presents a stochastic framework to improve the accuracy of decision making during dynamic power management, while considering manufacturing process and/or environment induced uncertainties. More precisely, variability and uncertainty at the system level are captured by a partially observable semi-Markov decision process with interval-based definition of states while the policy optimization problem is formulated as a mathematical program based on this model. Experimental results with a RISC processor in 65-nm technology demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique and show that the proposed uncertainty-aware power management technique ensures system-wide energy savings under statistical circuit parameter variations.", "paper_title": "Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Power Management in Partially Observable Domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000267764900009"}
