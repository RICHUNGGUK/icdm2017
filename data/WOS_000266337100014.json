Given a graph G = (V, E), a weight function w : V -> R(+), and an integer s, our goal is to cover all but s edges, by picking a set of vertices with minimum weight. The problem is clearly NP-hard as it generalizes the well-known VERTEX COVER problem. We provide a primal-dual 2-approximation algorithm which runs in O(n log n + m) time. This represents an improvement in running time from the previously known fastest algorithm. Our technique can also be used to get a 2-approximation for a more general version of the problem. In the PARTIAL CAPACITATED VERTEX COVER problem each vertex u comes with a capacity k(u). A solution consists of a function x : V -> N(0) and an orientation of all but s edges, such that the number of edges oriented toward vertex u is at most x(u)k(u). Our objective is to find a cover that minimizes Sigma(v is an element of V) x(v)w(v). This is the first 2-approximation for the problem and also runs in O(n log n + m) time.", "paper_title": "A Primal-Dual Approximation Algorithm for Partial Vertex Cover: Making Educated Guesses", "paper_id": "WOS:000266337100014"}
