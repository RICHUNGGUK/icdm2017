All existing solutions only assume the rational lazy-but-honest workers. In this paper, we first introduce the rational lazy-and-partially-dishonest workers in the outsourcing computation model. In addition, we propose a new fair conditional payment scheme for outsourcing computation that is only based on traditional electronic cash systems. The proposed construction uses a semitrusted third party T to achieve the fairness and efficiency. However, T is only involved in the protocol in the exceptional case, namely in the case of disputes. Moreover, since neither the secret sharing/splitting scheme nor the cut-and-choose protocol is used for the generation or verification of the payment token, our solution clearly outperforms the existing schemes in terms of efficiency.", "paper_title": "Efficient Fair Conditional Payments for Outsourcing Computations", "paper_id": "WOS:000311702600002"}
