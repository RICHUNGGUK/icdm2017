Consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) reduces the energy consumption since VM live migration not only optimizes VM placement, but also switches idle nodes to sleep mode. However, VM migration may negatively impact the performance of the system and lead to violations in SLA (Service Level Agreement) requirements between end users and cloud providers. In this study, we propose a VM consolidation mechanism that reduces the energy consumption of datacenters, eliminates unnecessary migrations, and minimizes the SLA violations. Compared to previous studies, the proposed policy shows a reduction of 2% to 3% in energy consumption, 13% to 41% in VM migration frequency, and 15% to 50% in SLA violations.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Consolidation of Virtual Machines in Cloud Datacenters", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784400005"}
