In this paper, we present a joint formulation for a complex super-resolution problem in which the scenes contain multiple independently moving objects. This formulation is built upon the maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework, which judiciously combines motion estimation, segmentation, and super resolution together. A cyclic coordinate descent optimization procedure is used to solve the MAP formulation, in which the motion fields, segmentation fields, and HR images are found in an alternate manner given the two others, respectively. Specifically, the gradient-based methods are employed to solve the HR image and motion fields, and an iterated conditional mode optimization method to obtain the segmentation fields. The proposed algorithm has been tested using a synthetic image sequence, the \"Mobile and Calendar\" sequence, and the original \"Motorcycle and Car\" sequence. The experiment results and error analyses verify the efficacy of this algorithm.", "paper_title": "A MAP approach for joint motion estimation, segmentation, and super resolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000243619200016"}
