This paper investigates the use of a light-weight ear worn activity recognition device combined with wireless ambient sensors for identifying common activities of daily living. A two-stage Bayesian classifier that uses information from both types of sensors is presented. Detailed experimental validation is provided for datasets collected in a laboratory setting as well as in a home environment. Issues concerning the effective use of the relatively limited discriminative power of the ambient sensors are discussed. The proposed framework bodes well for a multi-dwelling environment, and offers a pervasive sensing environment for both patients and care-takers.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Activity Classification Using Ambient and Wearable Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000271481300022"}
