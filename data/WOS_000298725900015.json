Multiple techniques have been designed to perform case selection. This paper empirically investigates how class imbalance in the available set of training cases can impact the performance of the resulting classifier as well as properties of the selected set. In this study, the experiments are performed using a dataset for the problem of detecting breast masses in screening mammograms. The classification problem was binary and we used a k-nearest neighbor classifier. The classifier's performance was evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) measure. The experimental results indicate that although class imbalance reduces the performance of the derived classifier and the effectiveness of selection at improving overall classifier performance, case selection can still be beneficial, regardless of the level of class imbalance.
