Such codes are of current practical interest as they enable optical communication at lower chip rate. To simplify practical implementation, the AM-OPPW (at most one-pulse per wavelength) restriction is often appended to a 2-D OOC. An AM-OPPW 2-D OOC is optimal if its size is the largest possible. In this paper, the notion of a perfect AM-OPPW 2-DOOCis proposed, which is an optimal (n x m, k, rho) AM-OPPW 2-DOOC with cardinality m(rho)n(n-1)...(n-p)/k(k-1)...(k-rho). A link between optimal (n x m, k, rho) AM-OPPW 2-D OOCs and block designs is developed. Some new constructions for such optimal codes are described by means of semicyclic group divisible designs. Several new infinite families of perfect (n x m, k, 1) AM-OPPW 2-D OOCs with k is an element of {2, 3, 4} are thus produced.", "paper_title": "Two-Dimensional Optical Orthogonal Codes and Semicyclic Group Divisible Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000278067900011"}
