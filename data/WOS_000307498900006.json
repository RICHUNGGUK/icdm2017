The model is based on the Reynolds-averaged NavierStokes equations with the k -epsilon turbulence model. The governing equations are solved by the finite volume method in a Cartesian staggered grid and the partial cell treatment is implemented to deal with complex geometries. The SIMPLE algorithm is utilised for the pressure-velocity coupling and the air-water interface is modelled by the interface capturing method via a high resolution volume of fluid scheme. The numerical model is validated by simulating overturning waves on a sloping beach and over a reef, and deep-water breaking waves in a periodic domain, in which good agreement between numerical results and available experimental measurements for the water surface profiles during wave overturning is obtained. The overturning jet, air entrainment and splash-up during wave breaking have been captured by the two-phase flow model, which demonstrates the capability of the model to simulate free surface flow and wave breaking problems.Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Numerical study of breaking waves by a two-phase flow model", "paper_id": "WOS:000307498900006"}
