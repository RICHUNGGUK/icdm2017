The stiffness model and natural frequency are derived, and then the stiffness and natural frequency of the manipulators are compared. The simulations show that the stiffness and natural frequency of the parallel manipulator with one or two additional legs are higher than those of the manipulator without additional leg. The stiffness performance and natural frequency of the manipulator with one additional leg can only be improved little by adding the second additional leg. It is better to develop this parallel manipulator by adding only one additional leg to construct a symmetrical architecture. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
