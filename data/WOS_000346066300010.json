The design of the stent is a major factor which determines its reliability after implantation into a stenosed non-vascular cavity. This paper presents the effect of the main structural parameters on the mechanical properties of braided stents. A parametric analysis of a commercial stent model is developed using the commercial finite element code ANSYS. As a consequence of the analytical results that the pitch of wire has a greater effect than other structural parameters, a new design of a variable pitch stent is presented to improve mechanical properties of these braided stents. The effect of structural parameters on mechanical properties is compared for both stent models: constant and variable pitches. When the pitches of the left and right quarters of the stent are 50% larger and 100% larger than that of the central portion, respectively, the radial stiffness in the central portion increases by 10% and 38.8%, while the radial stiffness at the end portions decreases by 128% and 164.7%, the axial elongation by 25.6% and 56.6% and the bending deflection by 3.96% and 10.15%. It has been demonstrated by finite element analysis that the variable pitch stent can better meet the clinical requirements.", "paper_title": "Numerical investigations of the mechanical properties of a braided non-vascular stent design using finite element method", "paper_id": "WOS:000346066300010"}
