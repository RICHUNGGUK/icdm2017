In particular, in the first part of the paper, we study the category of symbolic graphs showing that it satisfies some properties, which are the basis for the work that we present in the second part of the paper, where we study how to reason with attributed graph constraints. More precisely, we define a set of inference rules, which are the instantiation of the inference rules defined in a previous paper, for reasoning about constraints on standard graphs, showing their soundness and (weak) completeness. Moreover, the proof of soundness and completeness is also an instantiation of the corresponding proof for standard graph constraints, using the categorical properties studied in the first part of the paper. Finally, we show that adding a new inference rule makes our system sound and strongly complete. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
