However, the detailed modeling of dynamic skin deformations due to movement of the muscles during articulation is still prohibitively expensive for real-time simulations. We present ill this paper a fast approach for modeling such deformations driven by Electromyography (EMG) data. We demonstrate the method oil the muscles of the upper leg during a gait cycle. A muscle map, created from a 3D muscle model, is applied as a deformation map to deform the skill surface as per the underlying muscle geometry. EMG signals recorded from a gait cycle tire then used to dynamically vary the weights in the deformation map during animation thus producing the dynamic skin deformations. The whole operation is done on the GPU to make it very fast and suitable for real-time simulations.
