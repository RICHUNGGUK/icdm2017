Methods that compare profiles allow for the use of information about whole protein families, resulting in more sensitive and accurate detection of distantly related sequences. In this contribution, we describe a thorough optimization and tests of a profile-to-profile alignment method. A number of different scoring schemes has been implemented and compared on the basis of their ability to identify a template protein from the same SCOP family as a query. In addition to sequence profiles, secondary structure profiles were used to increase the rate of successful detection. Our results show that a properly tuned one-dimensional threading method can recognize a correct template from the same SCOP family nearly as well as structural alignment. Our benchmark set, which might be useful in other similar studies, as well as the fold-recognition software we developed may be downloaded (www.bioshell.pl/profile-alignments).", "paper_title": "Optimization of Profile-to-Profile Alignment Parameters for One-Dimensional Threading", "paper_id": "WOS:000306519400002"}
