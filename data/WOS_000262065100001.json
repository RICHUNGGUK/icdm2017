Five numerical examples of solutions with the error less than 10(-50) and 10(-30) for the bound and resonant state, respectively, obtained by the Obrechkoff one-step method implemented in the multi precision mode. which include the harmonic oscillator, the Poschl-Teller potential, the Morse potential and the Woods-Saxon potential, demonstrate that the finite difference method can yield the eigenvaltles of a complex potential with an arbitrarily desired precision within a reasonable efficiency.
