The proposed schemes can both verify user's identity as well as distribute an updated new key as the authentication key. A new defined fidelity parameter is proposed to verify the identity of the communicator and detect eavesdropping. The analytical results show the feasibility of these two identity authentication schemes and the security under the attack of general Gaussian-cloner strategy and collective attack.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION USING GAUSSIAN-MODULATED SQUEEZED STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000290857800007"}
