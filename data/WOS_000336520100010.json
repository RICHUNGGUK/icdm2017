Prudente and G.M. Cordeiro, Generalized Weibull linear models, Comm. Statist. Theory Methods 39 (2010), pp. 3739-3755]. This class of models is an alternative means of analysing positive, continuous and skewed data and, due to its statistical properties, is very competitive with gamma regression models. First, we show that the Weibull model induces maximum likelihood estimators asymptotically more efficient than the gamma model. Standardized residuals are defined, and their statistical properties are examined empirically. Some measures are derived based on the case-deletion model, including the generalized Cook's distance and measures for identifying influential observations on partial F-tests. The results of a simulation study conducted to assess behaviour of the global influence approach are also presented. Further, we perform a local influence analysis under the case-weights, response and explanatory variables perturbation schemes. The Weibull, gamma and other Weibull-type regression models are fitted into three data sets to illustrate the proposed diagnostic tools. Statistical analyses indicate that the Weibull model fitted into these data yields better fits than other common alternative models.", "paper_title": "Diagnostic tools in generalized Weibull linear regression models", "paper_id": "WOS:000336520100010"}
