Based on the type of analyzing events, two kinds of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been proposed: anomaly-based and misuse-based. In this paper, three-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture with categorized features as inputs and attack types as outputs of RNN is proposed as misuse-based IDS. The input features are categorized to basic features, content features, time-based traffic features, and host-based traffic features. The attack types are classified to Denial-of-Service (DoS), Probe, Remote-to-Local (R2L), and User-to-Root (U2R). For this purpose, in this study, we use the 41 features per connection defined by International Knowledge Discovery and Data mining group (KDD). The RNN has an extra output which corresponds to normal class (no attack). The connections between the nodes of two hidden layers of RNN are considered partial. Experimental results show that the proposed model is able to improve classification rate, particularly in R2L attacks. This method also offers better Detection Rate (DR) and Cost Per Example (CPE) when compared to similar related works and also the simulated Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Elman-based intrusion detectors. On the other hand, False Alarm Rate (FAR) of the proposed model is not degraded significantly when compared to some recent machine learning methods.", "paper_title": "Intrusion detection using reduced-size RNN based on feature grouping", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552600012"}
