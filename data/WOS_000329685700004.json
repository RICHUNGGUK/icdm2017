A physically realistic three-way factor analysis model consisting of the outer products of matrices (profiles) times a vector of mass contributions was applied to these data. The problem was solved using a weighted alternating least squares method. Five major emission sources: soil, road salt, aircraft landings, transported secondary sulfate, and local sulfate/construction were identified. The study shows that time- and size-resolved RDI data can assist in the identification of the airport emission sources and atmospheric processes leading to the observed ambient concentrations.
