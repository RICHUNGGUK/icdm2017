To exploit the intrinsic capability of reduced communication distances in 3D-ICs, three-dimensional NoC-bus hybrid mesh architecture was proposed. Besides its various advantages in terms of area, power consumption, and performance, this architecture has a unique and hitherto previously unexplored possibility to implement an efficient system-wide monitoring network. In this paper, an efficient three-dimensional NoC architecture is proposed which is optimized for system performance, power consumption, and reliability. The mechanism benefits from a congestion-aware and bus failure-tolerant routing algorithm called AdaptiveZ for vertical communication. In addition, we have integrated a low-cost monitoring platform on top of the three-dimensional NoC-Bus Hybrid mesh architecture that can be efficiently used for various system management purposes such as traffic monitoring, fault tolerance, and thermal management. The proposed generic monitoring platform called ARB-NET utilizes bus arbiters to exchange the monitoring information directly with each other without using the data network. As a test case, based on the proposed monitoring platform, a fully congestion-aware and interlayer fault-tolerant routing algorithm named AdaptiveXYZ is presented taking advantage of information generated within bus arbiters. Compared to recently proposed stacked mesh three-dimensional NoCs, our extensive simulations with synthetic and real benchmarks reveal that our architecture using the AdaptiveXYZ routing can help in achieving significant power, performance, and reliability improvements with a negligible hardware overhead.", "paper_title": "High-Performance and Fault-Tolerant 3D NoC-Bus Hybrid Architecture Using ARB-NET-Based Adaptive Monitoring Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000333471800017"}
