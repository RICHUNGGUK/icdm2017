A reaction in X-Folders is a program whose control flow depends on the status of the folder and whose actions are invocations of local services (that can be used to interact with the documents in the folders) or of services exposed by external components. The actions performed by the actors and the reactions fired by the system flow in a sequence that drives to the accomplishment of the workflow process coordinating humans and software components using documents.
