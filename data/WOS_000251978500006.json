In particular, there is no known \"entanglement analogue\" for the famous theorem by Newman, saying that the number of shared random bits required for solving any communication problem can be at, most logarithmic in the input length (i.e., using more than O(log n) shared random bits would not reduce the complexity of an optimal solution). In this paper we prove that the same is not true for entanglement. We establish a wide range of tight (up to a polylogarithmic factor) entanglement vs. communication trade-offs for relational problems. The low end is: for any t > 2, reducing shared entanglement from log(t)n to o(log(t-2)n) qubits can increase the communication required for solving a problem almost exponentially, from O(log(t)n) to Omega(root n). The high end is: for any epsilon > 0, reducing shared entanglement from n(1-epsilon) log n to o(n(1-epsilon) / log n) can increase the required communication from O(n(1-epsilon) log n) to Omega(n(1-epsilon/2) / logn). The upper bounds are demonstrated via protocols which are exact and work in the simultaneous message passing model, while the lower bounds hold for bounded-error protocols, even in the more powerful model of 1-way communication. Our protocols use shared EPR pairs while the lower bounds apply to any sort of prior entanglement. We base the lower bounds on a strong direct product theorem for communication complexity of a certain class of relational problems. We believe that the theorem might have applications outside the scope of this work.", "paper_title": "On the role of shared entanglement", "paper_id": "WOS:000251978500006"}
