However, having concepts and notations is not enough. The large size and complexity of the set of models that constitute the system specifications also forces the need to have tools for properly creating, handling, validating and maintaining these large models. This paper presents xODP, a tool for the model-based specification of open distributed systems according to the Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) standards. Using the UML4ODP notation, it provides edition and validation facilities for ODP viewpoint models and for the correspondences between them, as well as early prototyping and execution of the ODP computational models.", "paper_title": "A Tool for the Model-Based Specification of Open Distributed Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000321052400001"}
