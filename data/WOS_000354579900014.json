Both fiber/matrix interfacial debonding and matrix cracking are accounted for; the latter one is modeled by using an innovative shape optimization method coupling a moving mesh technique and a gradient-free optimization solver. Numerical applications are carried out with reference to the failure analysis of a single notched fiber-reinforced composite beam subjected to both mode-I and mixed-mode crack propagation conditions. The validity of the proposed method is assessed through original comparison models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
