GA fitness function is the mean accuracy of a cross-validation evaluation of each individual feature selection. The marginal distribution of the classification accuracy corresponding to a feature is used to measure feature saliency. The raw features are extracted as a voxel selection from anatomical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Voxel selection is provided by Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) which finds statistically significant clusters of voxels that have differences across MRI volumes on a paired dataset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy controls.
