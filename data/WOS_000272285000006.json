In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm-adaptive network-based FIS (GA-ANFIS) model has been developed in which both clustering and rule base parameters are simultaneously optimized using GAs and artificial neural nets (ANNs). The parameters of a subtractive clustering method, by which the number and structure of fuzzy rules are controlled, are optimized by GAs within which ANFIS is called for tuning the parameters of rule base generated by GAs. The model has been applied in the prediction of wave parameters, i.e. wave significant height and peak spectral period, in a duration-limited condition in Lake Michigan. The data set of year 2001 has been used as training set and that of year 2004 as testing data. The results obtained by the proposed model are presented and analyzed. Results indicate that GA-ANFIS model is superior to ANFIS and Shore Protection Manual (SPM) methods in terms of their prediction accuracy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
