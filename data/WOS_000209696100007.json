By setting higher priorities to these nodes, they send data sooner than other nodes by reducing the contention delay. We consider some senders and a receiver in their neighbourhood while one sender has a higher priority than other nodes. We analyse and formulate two concepts: delay and efficient data rate. Simulation results show that a network with prioritised nodes send more important data in a real time manner. Also average delay of sending data in a prioritised network is less compared with equal-priority nodes network.", "paper_title": "Delay Analysis in Prioritised Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696100007"}
