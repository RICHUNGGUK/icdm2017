In this paper, we investigate a new type of query in the context of uncertain databases, namely uncertain top-k influential sites query (UTkIS query for short), which can be applied in a wide range of application areas such as marketing analysis and mobile services. Since it is not so straightforward to precisely define the semantics of topk query with uncertain data, in this paper we introduce a novel and more intuitive formulation of the query on the basis of expected rank semantics. To address the efficiency issue caused by possible worlds exploration, we propose effective pruning rules and a divide-and-conquer paradigm such that the number of candidates as well as the number of possible worlds to be considered can be significantly reduced. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real data sets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the new methods proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Discovering the Most Influential Sites over Uncertain Data: A Rank-Based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000309914400004"}
