It was proved in [9] that it is undecidable whether a Buchi recognizable language of infinite pictures is E-recognizable (respectively, A-recognizable). We show here that these two decision problems are actually Pi(1)(2)-complete, hence located at the second level of the analytical hierarchy, and \"highly undecidable\". We give the exact degree of numerous other undecidable problems for Buchi-recognizable languages of infinite pictures. In particular, the non-emptiness and the infiniteness problems are Sigma(1)(1)-complete, and the universality problem, the inclusion problem, the equivalence problem, the determinizability problem, the complementability problem, are all Pi(1)(2)-complete. It is also Pi(1)(2)-complete to determine whether a given Buchi recognizable language of infinite pictures can be accepted row by row using an automaton model over ordinal words of length omega(2).", "paper_title": "Highly Undecidable Problems about Recognizability by Tiling Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000265239300006"}
