U-system is a complete orthogonal piecewise k-degree polynomials in L(2) [0,1] and it has some good properties,such as regeneration, convergence by group. Using U-system with finite items, it can be realized to accurate representation of shapes. This paper make shapes analysis in theory. We experimentally demonstrate that U descriptors are more suitable for representing and matching 2D shapes than Fourier descriptors.", "paper_title": "Matching 2D shapes using U descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600018"}
