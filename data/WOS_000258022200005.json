The numerical simulations of three cases including an uncontrolled baseline case, a controlled case with passive vortex generator, and a controlled case with active vortex generator were carried out. The numerical simulation solves the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for compressible flow using a fully implicit LU-SGS method. A fourth-order finite difference scheme is used to compute the spatial derivatives. The immersed-boundary method is used to model both the passive and active vortex generators. The characteristic frequency that dominates the flow is the natural frequency of separation in the baseline case. The introduction of the passive vortex generator does not alter the frequency of separation. In the case with active control, the frequency of the sinusoidal forcing was chosen close to the natural frequency of separation. The time- and spanwise-averaged results were used to examine the mean flow field for all three cases. The passive vortex generators can partially eliminate the separation by reattaching the separated shear layer to the airfoil over a significant extent. The size of the averaged separation zone has been reduced by more than 80%. The flow control with active vortex generator is more effective and the separation zone is not visible in the averaged results. The three-dimensional structures of the flow field have also been studied. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
