The theoretically predicted transition from the viscoelastic (omega tau << 1) Newtonian behavior to purely elastic non-Newtonian regime (omega tau >> 1) has been demonstrated. The relation of the derived solutions to microfluidics (high-frequency micro-resonators) is shown on an example of a \"plane oscillator\".", "paper_title": "Lattice Boltzmann simulation of a non-Newtonian oscillating flow in a high-frequency limit", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316000007"}
