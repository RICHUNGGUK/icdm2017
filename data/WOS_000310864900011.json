The proposed algorithm is based on MOEA which does not use weighting coefficients in converting multiple objectives into single objective. A constraint handling strategy without penalty parameters is proposed to avoid the difficulty of penalty parameter selection. Moreover, an elitist maintaining scheme is utilized to keep the evenness of the Pareto front. Simulations over several benchmark functions validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for the evenness of population distribution and the convergence to the Pareto front. Numerical experiments of a Miller compensated two-stage Op-Amp show that the proposed MOEA is able to achieve better performance than NSGA-II + PCH, GA + SPF and GA + PCH. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
