It focuses on methods that apply to different kinds of contents, including structured documents, factual data, and multimedia objects. It argues in favor of a template-based approach that enhances the ability for multiple applications to use the produced content. This approach is illustrated by AXEL, an innovative multipurpose client-side authoring framework (previously described in Sire et al. (2010)), intended for web users with limited skills. The versatility of the tool is illustrated through a series of use cases that demonstrate the flexibility of the approach for creating various kinds of web content.", "paper_title": "A lightweight framework for authoring XML multimedia content on the web", "paper_id": "WOS:000336995900028"}
