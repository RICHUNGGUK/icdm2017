Meanwhile a technique based on simplified pulse coupled neural network and used for noise positioning, is put forward. Combining the two methods above, we acquire a new method that can restore images corrupted by salt and pepper noise. Experiments show that this method is more preferable than other popular ones, and still works well while noise density fluctuates severely.", "paper_title": "Improved image filter based on SPCNN", "paper_id": "WOS:000260770400016"}
