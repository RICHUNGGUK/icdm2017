This problem must be quickly solved on the battlefield (i.e., in real-time). Considering the combined complexity and the strict time constraints, a fuzzy decision maker is proposed as an alternative to aid commanders in deciding on proper weapon assignments. The concept builds a fuzzy decision maker for a given data set by using extended grid partitioning based on a sensitivity analysis of input variables. The proposed decision maker is implemented and tested with several randomly. sampled assignment instances on realistic scenarios. In addition, a larger-scale scenario is also considered to demonstrate the scalability of the approach. The results show that the proposed system exhibits satisfactory performance and is serviceable on the battlefield. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
