As this integration deepens, the importance of securing these systems increases. In order to identify gaps and propose research directions in CPS intrusion detection research, we survey the literature of this area. Our approach is to classify modern CPS Intrusion Detection System (IDS) techniques based on two design dimensions: detection technique and audit material. We summarize advantages and drawbacks of each dimension's options. We also summarize the most and least studied CPS IDS techniques in the literature and provide insight on the effectiveness of IDS techniques as they apply to CPSs. Finally, we identify gaps in CPS IDS research and suggest future research areas.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Intrusion Detection Techniques for Cyber-Physical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000336405900013"}
