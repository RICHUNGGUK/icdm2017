The local traffic from a customer premises is carried on a radio frequency carrier along with the upstream traffic, and this traffic is electrically separated and then combined with downstream traffic at the remote repeater for delivery to the customers.", "paper_title": "Optical Layer Local Area Network Emulation in a Multifunctional Repeater-Based Optical Access Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000270332700004"}
