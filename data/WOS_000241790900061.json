The commonly used grid search method is intractable and computational expensive. In this paper, a fast grid search method is proposed for tuning multiple parameters for SVR with RBF kernel for time series forecasting. Empirical results confirm the feasibility and validation of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A fast grid search method in support vector regression forecasting time series", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900061"}
