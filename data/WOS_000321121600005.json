As the effectiveness of using VR functions to relieve travel anxiety has been shown, we proposed that a VR website enhanced with narrative video clips could relieve travelers' anxiety about accommodations by showing the important aspects of a hotel. Thus, we created a website with a narrative video showing the escape route from a hotel room and another narrative video showing the surrounding neighborhood. We then conducted experiments by having human subjects explore the enhanced VR website and fill out a questionnaire. The results confirmed our hypothesis that there is a statistically significant relationship between relief from travel anxiety and the use of narrative videos on embedded VR websites of hotels.", "paper_title": "Virtual Reality to Help Relieve Travel Anxiety", "paper_id": "WOS:000321121600005"}
