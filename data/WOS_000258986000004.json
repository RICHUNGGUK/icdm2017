Training and evaluation of such algorithms requires the availability of sufficiently general monotone data sets. In this short contribution we introduce an algorithm that allows for the (almost) uniform random generation of monotone data sets based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
