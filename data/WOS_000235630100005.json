Prestressed concrete T-beams having a shear span to depth ratio of 2.65 and 1.59 and failing in the shear have been analyzed Using 'ANSYS'. The 'ANSYS' model accounts for the nonlinear phenomenon, such as, bond-slip of longitudinal reinforcements, post-cracking tensile stiffness of the concrete, stress transfer across the cracked blocks of the concrete and load sustenance through the bridging of steel fibers at crack interlace. The concrete is modeled using 'SOLID65'-eight-node brick element, which is capable Of simulating the cracking and crushing behavior of brittle materials. The reinforcements such as deformed bars, prestressing wires and steel fibers have been modeled discretely Using 'LINK8' - 3D spar element. The slip between the reinforcement (rebar, fibers) and the concrete has been modeled using a 'COMBIN39'-non-linear spring element connecting the nodes of the 'LINK8' element representing the reinforcement and nodes of the 'SOLID65' elements representing the concrete. The 'ANSYS' model correctly predicted the diagonal tension failure and shear compression failure of prestressed concrete beams observed in the experiment. I-lie capability of the model to capture the critical crack regions, loads and deflections for various types Of shear failures ill prestressed concrete beam has been illustrated.", "paper_title": "Finite element analysis of shear critical prestressed SFRC beams", "paper_id": "WOS:000235630100005"}
