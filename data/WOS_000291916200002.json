The general formulation suggested in this article covers the common DRM as well. In order to verify the ability of the new technique, the obtained static and dynamic solutions are checked with the ones found by the other scheme. When the loads are variable and the behavior of the system is extremely nonlinear, the proposed procedure works efficiently. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
