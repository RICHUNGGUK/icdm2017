Fractal theory has been used in image and video compression due to advantages such as resolution independence, high compression rate, fast decoding, among others. Fractal compression approaches explore the presence of self-similarity to remove data redundancy, allowing high compression while maintaining low quality degradation. Early fractal compression methods presented prohibitive encoding time related to the search for similar regions in the image or video. This work describes a low bit-rate 3D searchless fractal video encoder to perform fast compression with high visual fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that the results of the proposed approach are superior when compared to those obtained by state-of-the-art x264 video encoder at very low bit rates in high motion video sequences.", "paper_title": "3D Searchless Fractal Video Encoding at Low Bit Rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000314364800005"}
