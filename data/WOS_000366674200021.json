Though classic sliding mode control (SMC) is insensitive to system uncertainties, it possesses an infinite system-state convergence time. For high-accuracy tracking control, a terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) is developed to provide a finite system-state convergence time. However, difficult estimation occurs in TSMC, and incurs high UPS inverter voltage harmonics and slow dynamic response. To obtain high-quality UPS inverter output voltage, a fuzzy logic (FL) with a computationally simple and practically easy estimator is integrated into TSMC to resolve system uncertainties. Simultaneously, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to optimally tune the control gains of the TSMC with a fuzzy estimator. Results indicate that the presented combination of PSO, FL and TSMC yields a closed-loop UPS inverter with good performance under various loading conditions. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed control can achieve low total harmonic distortion (THD) under nonlinear loading conditions and fast dynamic response under transient loading conditions.", "paper_title": "Particle swarm optimization tuned fuzzy terminal sliding mode control for UPS inverters", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200021"}
