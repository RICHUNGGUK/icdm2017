We then consider the task of denoising squared-magnitude magnetic resonance (MR) image data, which are well modeled as independent noncentral chi-square random variables on two degrees of freedom. We consider two broad classes of linearly parameterized shrinkage estimators that can be optimized using our risk estimate, one in the general context of undecimated filterbank transforms, and the other in the specific case of the unnormalized Haar wavelet transform. The resultant algorithms are computationally tractable and improve upon most state-of-the-art methods for both simulated and actual MR image data.", "paper_title": "A CURE for Noisy Magnetic Resonance Images: Chi-Square Unbiased Risk Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000306598100010"}
