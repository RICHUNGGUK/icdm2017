It effectively helps education, sensibility treatment and intelligence training for children with developmental disability. We developed special toy-like hardware and software tools: a content authoring tool that makes a variety of multimedia content operating on the hardware, a management tool that provides training results to instructors, and a real-time monitoring tool to observe the current state of learning. The hardware is designed to consider the characteristics of children with developmental disability. It can provide sensibility training, such as visual, auditory, and tactile senses to them. The easy-to-use authoring tool enables teachers and non-specialists to make educational content conveniently. In addition, the real-time monitoring tool helps observe the user's status, even outside the classroom. The management tool stores training results and provides the result for further steps. Efficient repetitive training is possible without restriction of time and location using this platform. We can recognize that our system is effective in improving their concentration and learning.", "paper_title": "Dreamware: edutainment system for children with developmental disability", "paper_id": "WOS:000331083400008"}
