The main coverage issue centres around critical conditions that require reliable monitoring and prohibit failures. This issue can be addressed by maximal-exposure paths, regarding which this article presents new results. Namely, it shows how to minimize the sensing range of a set of sensors in order to ensure the existence of a k-covered path between two points on a given region. Such a path's coverage depends on k >= 2, which is fixed. The three types of regions studied are: a planar graph, the whole plane and a polygonal region.", "paper_title": "Minimizing the Range for k-Covered Paths on Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000298386400007"}
