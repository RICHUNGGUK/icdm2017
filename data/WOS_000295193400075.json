It kills flexibility and brings non-value adding costs. Being able to mathematically model the effect of clamping to the part, these problems could be overcome. Empirical research using statistical and 3D-analysis show, that the effect of mechanical clamping can be estimated accurately with a locally linear model using finite element analysis. The accuracy of this mathematical estimate is sufficient for production line use. Experiments, supported by Daimler AG, have been done using a production line measurement system. Using a mathematical model to estimate the behavior of the measured part while clamped is called virtual clamping. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
