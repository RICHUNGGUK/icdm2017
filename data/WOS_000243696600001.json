Firstly, the relation between the Hellinger distance and the Fischer metric is analysed on the positive cone M(lambda)(+) of bounded measures absolutely continuous w.r.t. lambda, appearing as a flat Riemannian manifold. Secondly, the statistical manifold P(lambda) is seen as a submanifold of M(lambda)(+) and Amari-Chensov alpha-connections are derived. Some alpha-self-parallel curves are explicitely exhibited.", "paper_title": "Riemannian geometry on non-parametric probability space", "paper_id": "WOS:000243696600001"}
