The sensor is designed based on an order analysis. The nonlinear filter with the proposed sensor ensures damping of the high-frequency waves in smooth regions and at the same time removes the Gibbs oscillations around the discontinuities when using high-order compact finite difference schemes. In addition, a suitable scaling is proposed to have dissipation proportional to the shock strength and also to minimize the effects of the second-order filter on the very small scales. Several numerical experiments are carried out and the accuracy of the nonlinear filter with the proposed sensor is examined. In addition, some comparisons with other filters and sensors are made.
