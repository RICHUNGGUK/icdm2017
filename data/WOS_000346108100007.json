We compare the performance of our algorithm with the standard method based on distinct degree factorization from both an analytical and a practical point of view. Our results show that although the batch test is asymptotically better as a function of the degree of the polynomials to test for smoothness, it is unlikely to offer significant practical improvements for cases of practical interest.", "paper_title": "SMOOTHNESS TESTING OF POLYNOMIALS OVER FINITE FIELDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000346108100007"}
