The spatial discretization uses the symmetric interior penalty DG formulation with weighted averages and is based on a wetting-phase potential/capillary potential formulation of the two-phase flow system. After discretizing in time with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta schemes, the resulting systems of nonlinear algebraic equations are solved with Newton's method and the arising systems of linear equations are solved efficiently and in parallel with an algebraic multigrid method. The new scheme is investigated for various test problems from the literature and is also compared to a cell-centered finite volume scheme in terms of accuracy and time to solution. We find that the method is accurate, robust, and efficient. In particular, no postprocessing of the DG velocity field is necessary in contrast to results reported by several authors for decoupled schemes. Moreover, the solver scales well in parallel and three-dimensional problems with up to nearly 100 million degrees of freedom per time step have been computed on 1,000 processors.", "paper_title": "A fully-coupled discontinuous Galerkin method for two-phase flow in porous media with discontinuous capillary pressure", "paper_id": "WOS:000342073500012"}
