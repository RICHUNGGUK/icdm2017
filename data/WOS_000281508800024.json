The concept attracted lots of attention and furthermore, some other similar notions were also considered such as Laplacian energy LE(G), signless Laplacian energy LE(+)(G), incidence energy I E(G), distance energy DE(G) and Lapacian-energy like invariant LEL(G). Moreover, many researchers established a large number of upper and lower bounds for those invariants. But there are only a few graphs attaining the equalities of those bounds. In the present paper, however, we present exact estimates of LEL(G), IE(G), and DE(C), and a tight bound of LE(C) for almost all graphs by probabilistic and algebraic approaches.", "paper_title": "Various energies of random graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000281508800024"}
