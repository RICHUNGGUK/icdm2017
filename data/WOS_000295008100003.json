Shot and cluster boundaries are selected using KLDs between GGD feature vectors, and then keyframes are located based on similarity and dissimilarity criteria. Objective and subjective evaluations show the high accuracy of this new approach compared with traditional methods.", "paper_title": "Video Keyframe Analysis Using a Segment-Based Statistical Metric in a Visually Sensitive Parametric Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000295008100003"}
