In the proposed method, using the syntax elements provided in H.264 bitstreams, four new and efficient strategies are delivered for inter-coded macroblocks to improve the quality of de-interlaced video sequences as well as alleviate the error propagation side effect. Based on the real and generated interlaced video sequences with various common resolutions, experimental results demonstrate the proposed de-interlacing method achieves better quality in terms of both objective and subjective measures when compared with the recently published method by Dong and Ngan.
