Warped document images can be transformed into planar document images for improving optical character recognition accuracy and human readability using monocular dewarping techniques. Curled text-lines segmentation is a crucial initial step for most of the monocular dewarping techniques. Existing curled text-line segmentation approaches are sensitive to geometric and perspective distortions. In this paper, we introduce a novel curled text-line segmentation algorithm by adapting active contour (snake). Our algorithm performs text-line segmentation by estimating pairs of x-line and baseline. It estimates a local pair of x-line and baseline on each connected component by jointly tracing top and bottom points of neighboring connected components, and finally each group of overlapping pairs is considered as a segmented text-line. Our algorithm has achieved curled text-line segmentation accuracy of above 95% on the DFKI-I (CBDAR 2007 dewarping contest) dataset, which is significantly better than previously reported results on this dataset.", "paper_title": "Coupled snakelets for curled text-line segmentation from warped document images", "paper_id": "WOS:000315038600003"}
