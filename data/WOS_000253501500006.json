First, there are recursively random sequences such that for any computable, non-decreasing and unbounded function f and for almost all n, the uniform complexity of the length n prefix of the sequence is bounded by f(n). Second, a similar result with bounds of the form f (n) log n holds for partial-recursively random sequences. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is no Mises-Wald-Church stochastic sequence such that all non-empty prefixes of the sequence have Kolmogorov complexity O(log n). This implies a sharp bound for the complexity of the prefixes of Mises-Wald-Church stochastic and of partial-recursively random sequences. As an immediate corollary to these results, we obtain the known separation of the classes of recursively random and of Mises-Wald-Church stochastic sequences. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
