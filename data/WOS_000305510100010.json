In the model selection step, the optimal number of latent variables is determined in order to minimize the prediction error. To protect the analysis against the harmful influence of possible outliers in the data, robust calibration methods have been developed. In this paper, we focus on the preprocessing and the model selection step. We propose several robust preprocessing methods as well as robust measures of the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP). To select the optimal preprocessing method, we summarize the results for the different RMSEP values by means of a desirability index, which is a concept from industrial quality control. These robust RMSEP values are also used to select the optimal number of latent variables. We illustrate our newly developed techniques through the analysis of a real data set containing near-infrared measurements of samples of animal feed.
