Through the MP2 perturbation theory and B3LYP hybrid functional, as well as modifications on 6-31ijGk basis sets with i = triple-zeta, j = diffuse and k = polarization functions, systematic tendencies in the R-(n center dot center dot center dot HX) hydrogen bond distances and upsilon((n center dot center dot center dot HX)) stretch frequencies were determined by the hierarchical cluster analysis, two level factorial designs and principal component analysis. Based on well-fitted math models, not only because polarization functions provide a great variance on statistical analysis, but this basis set reproduces more efficiently the available experimental results. Moreover, independent of whether the quality on basis set is increased, the effects yielded by both DFT and MP2 were not considered important in the statistical analysis.", "paper_title": "A chemometrical study of intermolecular properties of hydrogen-bonded complexes formed by C2H4O center dot center dot center dot HX and C2H5N center dot center dot center dot HX with X = F, CN, NC, and CCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000263502500010"}
