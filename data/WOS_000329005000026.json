In the healthcare industry, the decision to adopt RFID technology is a problem requiring a multi-criteria decision analysis that involves both qualitative and quantitative factors. The evaluation of this decision may be based on imprecise information or uncertain data. Furthermore, there can be significant dependence and feedbacks between the different criteria and alternatives. However, most conventional decision models cannot capture these complex interrelationships. As a result, in this study we develop a general evaluation framework for industry evaluation, improvement and adoption of RFID. We use a hybrid Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method known as DDANPV that combines DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory), DANP (DEMATEL-based ANP), and VIKOR to evaluate the factors that influence the adoption of RFID. Specifically, we study the adoption of RFID in Taiwan's healthcare industry. We find that technology integration is the most influential criterion and the strongest driver in the adoption of RFID of Taiwan's healthcare industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
