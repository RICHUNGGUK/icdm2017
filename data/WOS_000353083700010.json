We emphasize that the points (x(i)) and the weights (a(i)) do not depend on u. This improves on the (probabilistic) Monte-Carlo bound vertical bar vertical bar u vertical bar vertical bar(2)(L)((Omega))/N-0.5 involving any sort of control on the oscillation of the function (which is classically done via the size of derivatives or the total variation). We do not know which decay rate is optimal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
