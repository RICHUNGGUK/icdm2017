Initially developed to estimate the behaviour of the system in terms of the expected values of population counts, the fluid approach has subsequently been extended to more sophisticated interrogations of models through its embedding within model checking procedures. In this paper we extend recent work on checking CSL properties of individual agents within a Markovian population model, to consider the checking of properties which incorporate rewards.", "paper_title": "Efficient Checking of Individual Rewards Properties in Markov Population Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000367344900004"}
