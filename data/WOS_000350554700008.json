Multimedia data is interchanged between participants in real-time in a synchronous e-training activity providing an enriched learning experience. Large organizations are usually widely dispersed in several sites, so synchronous e-training activities are especially difficult. Most of the sites constitute multicast islands, as IP multicast is available, so the data transport can use IP multicast within the sites of the organization in order to save bandwidth. In this paper, an autonomic synchronous e-training platform based on standard protocols implementing self-management features such as self-deployment, self-organization and self-healing is proposed. The platform deploys an overlay network composed of Real-time Transport Protocol relays acting as multicast/unicast reflectors. The overlay is automatically reorganized according to the joining and leaving of participants and network failures. The use of standard protocols and a modular design enable the interoperability, extensibility and portability of the platform.", "paper_title": "Autonomic Platform for Synchronous e-Training in Dispersed Organizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000350554700008"}
