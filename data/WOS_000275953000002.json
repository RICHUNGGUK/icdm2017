Properties of soil, namely plastic limit, liquid limit, color of soil, percentages of gravel, sand, and fine-grained particles are used as input variables to predict the classification of soils. The models are developed using a reliable database obtained from the previously published literature. The results demonstrate that the MEP-based formulas are able to predict the target values to high degree of accuracy. The MEP-based formulation results are found to be more accurate compared with numerical and analytical results obtained by other researchers.", "paper_title": "Multi expression programming: a new approach to formulation of soil classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000275953000002"}
