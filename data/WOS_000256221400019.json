A major challenge in the production of ethanol is the high energy cost associated with the separation of ethanol from the large excess of water. Distillation is usually the method of choice; however, water cannot be completely removed due to the presence of the azeotrope. The pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process is attractive for the final separation since it requires little energy input and is capable of producing a very pure product. The goal of this work was to perform a thorough analysis of the PSA process and find process improvements with the aid of mathematical modeling. A general purpose package for the simulation of a cyclic PSA process was developed. The system of partial differential equations was solved via method of lines using a stiff equation integration package. Parameters for the model are based on the data from an operating plant as well as data from the literature. For the ethanol production technology our model provides a fundamental understanding of the dynamics of the cyclic process and effects of some operating parameters. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
