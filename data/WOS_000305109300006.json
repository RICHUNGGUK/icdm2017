To examine the power consumption of an embedded system, an energy profiling tool is highly demanded. Although a number of energy profiling tools have been proposed, they are not directly applicable to the embedded processors with power management functions that are widely utilized in battery-operated embedded systems to reduce power consumption. Hence, this study presents a high-level energy profiling tool, called SEProf, that estimates the energy consumption of an embedded system running multithread software and a multitasking operating system (OS) that supports power management functions. This study implements the proposed SEProf in Linux 2.6.19 and evaluates its performance on an ARM11 MPCore processor. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tool can provide accurate energy profiling results with a low profiling overhead. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
