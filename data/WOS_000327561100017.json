The system uses laser triangulation to capture 3D depth, in parallel with a color camera and a line light projector to capture color texture, which are then combined into a color 2.5D model in real-time. Using many examples of completeness inspection tasks that are extremely difficult to solve with current 2D-based methods, we demonstrate how the 2.5D images and point clouds generated by our system can be used to solve these complex tasks effectively and efficiently. Our system is currently being integrated into a real production environment, showing that completeness inspection incorporating 3D technology can be readily achieved in a short time at low costs.
