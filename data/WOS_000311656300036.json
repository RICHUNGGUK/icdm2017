A transmitting boundary is implemented to absorb waves at the edges of the modeling. For the 2-D case, the SPRK schemes require only two functions for the complete description of the electromagnetic field. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithms, results from comparisons between the SPRK schemes and the standard FDTD method are presented. In addition, a complicated subsurface structure model is considered. The wiggle trace profile of this model is obtained from forward simulation using a 2-order SPRK method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
