Assume that m and d are integers with m >= 2 and d >= 8. This paper addresses the fault-tolerant hamiltonicity of GHT(m, 2d, d) with fault set F = {(w, y), (x, y)}, where w < x, w + y is even and x + y is odd. We show that such a faulty GHT is hamiltonian by presenting a systematic method for constructing a fault-free hamiltonian cycle. This result reveals another appealing feature of GHTs.
