The choice of the aggregation function is a fundamental step in the definition of inference framework. In most cases aggregation has some monotonicity property and this can lead to saturation problems in complex frameworks, particularly in stateful rational agents. In this paper, we propose an extension to the fuzzy aggregation to handle these cases and apply fuzzy reasoning to complex KBs. We especially focus on Mamdani inference framework, where aggregation is implemented by a triangular conorm.", "paper_title": "Generalizing T-conorms to face saturation in mamdani fuzzy inference systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862900004"}
