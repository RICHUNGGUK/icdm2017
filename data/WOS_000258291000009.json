In this note we contribute to this research direction with a new characterization of this type, as well as with representations of regular and context-free languages, mainly starting from context-free insertion systems of as small as possible complexity. For instance, each recursively enumerable language L can be represented in a way similar to the celebrated Chomsky-Schutzenberger representation of context-free languages, i.e., in the form L = h(L(gamma)boolean AND D), where 7 is an insertion system of weight (3, 0) (at most three symbols are inserted in a context of length zero), h is a projection, and D is a Dyck language. A similar representation can be obtained for regular languages, involving insertion systems of weight (2,0) and star languages, as well as for context-free languages - this time using insertion systems of weight (3, 0) and star languages.", "paper_title": "Representations and characterizations of languages in chomsky hierarchy by means of insertion-deletion systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258291000009"}
