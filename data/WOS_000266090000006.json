Handling interrupts properly is an essential component of low-level system programming. Unfortunately, interrupts are also extremely hard to reason about: they dramatically alter the program control flow and complicate the invariants in low-level concurrent code (e.g., implementation of synchronization primitives). Existing formal verification techniques-including Hoare logic, typed assembly language, concurrent separation logic, and the assume-guarantee method-have consistently ignored the issues of interrupts; this severely limits the applicability and power of today's program verification systems. In this paper we present a novel Hoare-logic-like framework for certifying low-level system programs involving both hardware interrupts and preemptive threads. We show that enabling and disabling interrupts can be formalized precisely using simple ownership-transfer semantics, and the same technique also extends to the concurrent setting. By carefully reasoning about the interaction among interrupt handlers, context switching, and synchronization libraries, we are able to-for the first time-successfully certify a preemptive thread implementation and a large number of common synchronization primitives. Our work provides a foundation for reasoning about interrupt-based kernel programs and makes an important advance toward building fully certified operating system kernels and hypervisors.", "paper_title": "Certifying Low-Level Programs with Hardware Interrupts and Preemptive Threads", "paper_id": "WOS:000266090000006"}
