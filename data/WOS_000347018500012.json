We do not aim to recover exact depth values for objects in the image, which is a tricky computer vision problem, requiring assumptions that are rarely satisfied. Instead, we determine layers based on relative depth ordering of objects (and their parts) in the image, and use this information to construct surfaces in the 3D relief model. Feature lines are extracted and used to build a new region-based representation of the input image. During surface construction, a base surface is first generated: it is then augmented using both intensity and gradient information from the original image. To prevent depth errors arising due to augmentation, a feedback process is used to refine the output. Our experimental results show the generated bas-reliefs have smooth boundaries with appropriate height relationships, a key property of bas-reliefs created by artists. We demonstrate that our algorithm works well for a range of input images, including human faces, flowers and animals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
