Wireless multimedia sensor networks present some challenges that are common to wireless sensor networks, such as the existence of limited resources, like sensors memory, energy consumption, and CPU performance. Many methods have been proposed to attempt to solve the problem. However, the existing data aggregations do not take into account the redundancy of the multimedia data. In order to improve the energy efficiency for multimedia data, we propose a similarity model and power model. The proposal scheme divides multimedia data into multiple different pieces, and transmits the effective pieces to the selected sensor nodes. Through theoretical justifications and empirical studies, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves substantially superior performances over conventional methods in terms of energy efficiency and data transmission under the resource-constrained wireless multimedia sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Secure Data Aggregation in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks Based on Similarity Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000335678200001"}
