However, most existing document classification algorithms are easily affected by ambiguous terms. The ability to disambiguate for a classifier is thus as important as the ability to classify accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel classification framework based on fuzzy formal concept analysis to conceptualize documents into a more abstract form of concepts, and use these as the training examples to alleviate the arbitrary outcomes caused by ambiguous terms. The proposed model is evaluated on a benchmark testbed and two opinion polarity datasets. The experimental results indicate superior performance in all datasets. Applying concept analysis to opinion polarity classification is a leading endeavor in the disambiguation of Web 2.0 contents, and the approach presented in this paper offers significant improvements on current methods. The results of the proposed model reveal its ability to decrease the sensitivity to noise, as well as its adaptability in cross domain applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
