Based on the independence of uncertain parameters and stochastic excitations, the nonlinear stochastic optimal control for the nominal quasi-Hamiltonian system with average-value parameters is first obtained by using the stochastic averaging method and stochastic dynamical programming principle. Then, the means and standard deviations of root-mean-square responses, control effectiveness and control efficiency for the uncertain quasi-Hamiltonian system are calculated by using the stochastic averaging method and the probabilistic analysis. By introducing the sensitivity of the variation coefficients of controlled root-mean-square responses, control effectiveness and control efficiency to those of uncertain parameters, the robustness of the non-linear stochastic optimal control is evaluated. Two examples are given to illustrate the proposed control procedure and its robustness.", "paper_title": "Robustness of non-linear stochastic optimal control for quasi-Hamiltonian systems with parametric uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000272497400001"}
