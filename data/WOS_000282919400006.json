Some delay-dependent conditions for fuzzy H-infinity filter are proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which produce a less conservative result. Finally, one numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the benefits of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "FUZZY H-infinity FILTER DESIGN FOR NONLINEAR DISCRETE-TIME SYSTEMS WITH TIME-VARYING DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400006"}
