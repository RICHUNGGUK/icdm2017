An example-driven deformation space and an example space energy is constructed by introducing the modified linear Cauchy strain with rotation compensation. During this simulation, our adopted total energy functional is quadratic, and its corresponding optimization can be quickly worked out by solving a linear system. For addressing the possible errors, we propose an effective error-correction algorithm. Some related factors including the parameters and example weights are also discussed. Various experiments are demonstrated to show that the proposed method can achieve high quality results. Moreover, our method can avoid complex non-linear optimization, and it outperforms previous methods in terms of the calculation cost and implementation efficiency. Finally, other acceleration algorithms, such as the embedding technique for handling highly detailed meshes, can be easily integrated into our framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
