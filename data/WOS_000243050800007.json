We prove that when the players begin with equal stakes, the expected duration of the game is, up to constant factors, the square of their collective initial wealth. This proves a conjecture of Amano, Tromp, Vitanyi, and Watanabe. More generally, we find that the expected duration is similarly related to a quadratic function that reflects the uniformity of the initial stakes, and calculate the expected duration exactly for three players.
