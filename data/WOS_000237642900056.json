This technique is extremely computationally expensive and sometimes will lead to bad result configured with unstructured mass data for its' iterative searching procedure and ill-suited distance function. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network strategy for surface registration. Before that, a typical preprocessing procedure-mesh PCA is used for coordinate direction normalization. The results and comparisons show such neural network method is a promising approach for 3D shape matching.", "paper_title": "A neural network strategy for 3D surface registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900056"}
