Design/methodology/approach - The combination of the Adomian decomposition method and the Alienor reducing transformation method allows us to solve the control problem as if it were a classical one dimensional minimization problem. The mathematical model used here describes specific model based on cell-cycle kinetics. Findings - It was found that the goal is to maintain the number of the cancerous cells around a desired value while keeping the toxicity to the normal tissues acceptable. Practical implications - Simulation results are given for illustration. Originality/value - New combined approach to optimal control of cancer chemotherapy using Adomian/Alienor Methods.", "paper_title": "Optimal control of cancer chemotherapy model using the coupled adomian/alienor methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000238997900026"}
