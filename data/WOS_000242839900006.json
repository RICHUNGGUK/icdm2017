In particular, we propose a suitable dialogue model and a set of computationally usable strategic heuristics to enable the computer to engage its users in debate on a controversial issue. The system has been fully implemented. It is anticipated that this work will contribute toward the development of human-computer dialogue in general and of computer-based educational dialogue in particular and help to illuminate research issues in the field of dialectics itself.
