As an extension of collaborative group learning, the team approach has been applied to learning in a computer-based learning environment. The current investigation sought to examine the effects of cognitive load on performance outcomes of students using computer-based instruction. Specifically, the performance of students within a cooperative group interacting in a computer-based instructional environment was compared to the performance of students working alone. Students were randomly assigned to learn individually or within a group of three, one of whom was then randomly assigned to control the mouse. Data analyses revealed that (a) there was no statistically significant difference between the performance of overall groups and the performance of individual computer-based instruction learners, and (b) individual learners and group observers both performed significantly higher on the posttest than group members controlling the mouse. Implications for groups working in computer-based learning environments are discussed in the paper.", "paper_title": "Training groups of end users: Examining group interactions in a computer-based learning environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000237466700011"}
