The basic idea of the proposed method is to transform the original DEA model to an equivalent linear parametric programming model, applying the notion of alpha-cuts. Then, a bi-objective model is constructed which its solution has determined the optimal range of decision making units efficiency. The proposed method can be used both for symmetric and asymmetric fuzzy numbers, while the feasibility of its solution for the original problem is guaranteed. The application of the proposed method is examined in two numerical examples and its results are compared with two current models of fuzzy DEA.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Data Envelopment Analysis Approach based on Parametric Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000322561300010"}
