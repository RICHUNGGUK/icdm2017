We test the ability of each of the models for dealing with information provided by shape-from-shading. Experiments show that representations based on directional information are more robust to noise than representations based on height information. Moreover, the method can be operated using a simple non-exhaustive parameter adjustment procedure and ensures that the recovered surface satisfies the image. irradiance equation as a hard constraint subject to integrability conditions.", "paper_title": "Using Cartesian models of faces with a data-driven and integrable fitting framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600013"}
