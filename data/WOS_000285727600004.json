The two key steps in this method involve feature vertex classification and an iterative, two-step denoising method depending on two feature weighting functions. The classification for feature vertices is based on volume integral invariant. With the super nature of this integral invariant, the features of vertices can be fixed with less influence of noise, and different denoising degrees can be applied to different parts of the pending surface. Compared with other methods, our approach produces better results in feature-preserving. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
