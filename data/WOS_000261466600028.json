A number of solutions to the BA problem based on Various network model assumptions have been proposed. However, most existing BA protocols are designed for pure wired or pure wireless networks, In practice, most current networks are combined wired and wireless environments. In this paper, we extend the BA problem over a combined wired/wireless network, consisting of both powerful computing stationary processor and low-power mobile processor. The communication overhead of BA protocol is inherently large and secure group communications are important. The protocols proposed in this paper use the hierarchical model concept to reduce the communication overhead and provide secure group communications well suited for combined wired/wireless networks.
