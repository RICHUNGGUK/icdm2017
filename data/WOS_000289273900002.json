However, developing this kind of information services for drivers calls for new data management approaches, such as an appropriate dissemination protocol and some mechanism to decide when a driver should be alerted. In this paper, we present a data management solution for event exchange in vehicular networks and compare two different approaches for relevance assessment. The first approach relies on the computation of geographic vectors to estimate the relevance of events, whereas the second approach exploits digital road maps. We also describe a prototype that has allowed us to test our proposals in a real environment. Moreover, we present an exhaustive simulation-based experimental evaluation that proves the usefulness of exploiting the information stored in digital road maps for data management and sharing in vehicular networks, which is an important novelty regarding existing works. The experiments also show that the first approach can also be used with a good accuracy, although smaller in some situations, in cars where maps are not available.", "paper_title": "Event sharing in vehicular networks using geographic vectors and maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000289273900002"}
