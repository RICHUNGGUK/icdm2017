The parameters for each variable in the model represent a finite state continuous time Markov process, whose transition model is a function of its parents. This paper presents an algorithm for updating parameters from an existing CTBN model with a set of data samples. It is a unified framework for online parameter estimation and batch parameter updating where a pre-accumulated set of samples is used. We analyze different conditions of the algorithm, and show its performance in experiments.", "paper_title": "Update rules for parameter estimation in continuous time Bayesian network", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500017"}
