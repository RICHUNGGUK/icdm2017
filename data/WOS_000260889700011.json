The proposed method is a full-search equivalent, i. e., it yields the same results as the Full Search (FS) algorithm. In order to pursue computational savings, the method deploys a succession of increasingly tighter lower bounds of the adopted L(p) norm-based dissimilarity function. Such bounding functions allow for establishing a hierarchy of pruning conditions aimed at rapidly skipping those candidates that cannot satisfy the matching criterion. The paper includes an experimental comparison between the proposed method and other FS-equivalent approaches known in the literature, which proves the remarkable computational efficiency of our proposal.", "paper_title": "Full-Search-Equivalent Pattern Matching with Incremental Dissimilarity Approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000260889700011"}
