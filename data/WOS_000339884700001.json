Under suitable conditions, that do not include differentiability or local uniqueness of solutions, the method converges locally quadratically to a solution of the system, thus filling an important gap in the existing theory. The new algorithm improves on known methods and, when particularized to KKT systems derived from optimality conditions for constrained optimization or variational inequalities, it has theoretical advantages even over methods specifically designed to solve such systems.", "paper_title": "An LP-Newton method: nonsmooth equations, KKT systems, and nonisolated solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000339884700001"}
