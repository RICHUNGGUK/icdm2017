This scheme, the Quasi-EA, is closely related to the Exact Algorithm (EA) for diffusion processes, as it is obtained by neglecting the rejection step in EA. We prove the existence of a myopic coupling between the Quasi-EA and the diffusion. Moreover, an upper bound for the coupling probability is given. Consequently we establish the convergence of the Quasi-EA to the diffusion with respect to the total variation distance.", "paper_title": "The strong weak convergence of the quasi-EA", "paper_id": "WOS:000316819200005"}
