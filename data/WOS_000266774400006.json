Solar radiation was the most important predictor of grave density in the Feng-Shui locations. Similarly, spatial clustering technology identified the fact that high concentrations of grave necessarily accompany the significantly increasing trends of solar radiation. The results of the regression analyses indicate that the grave density could be explained by the four landform parameters alone yielding R 2 values of 0.751. In contrast to the typical theory, slope and aspect were not a dominant determining factor upon the dependent variable of grave density. Also, the significantly increasing trends of grave density were not observed in line with a southern direction. A clear verification has been made for the hidden assumptions in Feng-Shui's long history that its approach is found to be more appropriate in avoiding shadow conditions, rather than exploring the ideal landform location.", "paper_title": "Exploring spatially prioritized parameters of Feng-Shui from tomb footprint", "paper_id": "WOS:000266774400006"}
