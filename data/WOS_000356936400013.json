In particular, we study and compare the diagonal quadratic approximation method (DQAM) of Mulvey and Ruszczyski [A diagonal quadratic approximation method for large scale linear programs, Oper. Res. Lett. 12 (1992), pp. 205-215] and the parallel coordinate descent method (PCDM) of Richtarik and Taka [Parallel coordinate descent methods for big data optimization. Technical report, November 2012. arXiv:1212.0873]. We show that the two methods are equivalent for feasibility problems up to the selection of a step-size parameter. Furthermore, we prove an improved complexity bound for PCDM under strong convexity, and show that this bound is at least 8(L/L)(-1)(2) times better than the best known bound for DQAM, where is the degree of partial separability and L' and L are the maximum and average of the block Lipschitz constants of the gradient of the quadratic penalty appearing in the augmented Lagrangian.", "paper_title": "Separable approximations and decomposition methods for the augmented Lagrangian", "paper_id": "WOS:000356936400013"}
