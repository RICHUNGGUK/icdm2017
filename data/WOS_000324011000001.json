However, partial shape description and retrieval may be used more frequently in the fields of product design and manufacture. In order to resolve the problem that the retrieval efficiency for complex model descriptors is low, a CAD model retrieval method based on local surface region decomposition is presented in this paper. First, according to the salient geometric features of the mechanical part, the surface boundary of a solid model is divided into local convex, concave and planar regions. Then, we give a kind of region codes that describe the surface regions and their links in the CAD model. Finally, the model retrievals are realized based on the similarity measurement between two models' region codes. Experimental results have shown that this approach is able to support partial retrieval of CAD models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
