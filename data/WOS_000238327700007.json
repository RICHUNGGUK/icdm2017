This paper proposes a novel vector quantization method using the wavelet transform and the enhanced SOM algorithm for the medical image compression. We propose the enhanced self-organizing algorithm to resolve the defects of the conventional SOM algorithm. The enhanced SOM, at first, reflects the error between the winner node and the input vector to the weight adaptation by using the frequency of the selection of the winner node. Secondly, it adjusts the weight in proportion to the present weight change and the previous one as well. To reduce the blocking effect and the computation requirement, we construct training image vectors involving image features by using the wavelet transform and apply the enhanced SOM algorithm to them for generating a well-defined codebook. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed method energizes the compression ratio and the decompression quality.", "paper_title": "Vector quantizer of medical image using wavelet transform and enhanced SOM algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000238327700007"}
