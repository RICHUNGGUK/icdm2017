However, the convergence rate analysis remains open until now. Using some techniques in [8] combined with a very tricky analysis, we prove in this paper that the previous method converges geometrically. This result is important in theory, showing a fundamental property of the Arrow-Hurwicz algorithm. Moreover, it motivates us to devise efficient algorithms for numerically solving steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.", "paper_title": "On the geometric convergence of the Arrow-Hurwicz algorithm for steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000348558700004"}
