In this paper, quadratic approximation based differential evolution with valuable trade off approach (QADEVT) has been developed to solve the bi-objective hydrothermal scheduling problem. The practical hydrothermal system possesses various constraints which make the problem of finding global optimum difficult. In this paper, heuristic rules are proposed to handle the water dynamic balance constraints and heuristic strategies based on priority list are employed to handle active power balance constraints. A feasibility-based selection technique is also introduced to satisfy the reservoir storage volumes constraints. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, simulation results have been compared with those obtained by differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) with same heuristic strategies and the earlier reported methods available in literature. The simulation results reveal that the proposed approach is capable of efficiently providing superior solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
