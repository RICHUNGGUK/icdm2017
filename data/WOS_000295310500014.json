We model the problem as a continuous nonlinear knapsack problem, and propose an efficient algorithm for solving the optimal solution after exploring the structural properties of the studied problem. Sensitivity analysis is done for better understanding the behavior of the problem, and numerical results are provided to show the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
