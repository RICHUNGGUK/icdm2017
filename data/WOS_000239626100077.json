In this paper, we designed and implemented an agent-based monitoring system, which consists of dynamically controllable agents. The structure of the monitoring system is divided into three layers to archive independence among communication protocol, message interpretation, and actual tasks. Components of each layer can be replaced with other components whenever they are required. To reduce development times for monitoring application in distributed systems, four monitoring agents were provided, which help to reuse legacy applications through user query.", "paper_title": "An agent-based adaptive monitoring system", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100077"}
