We present the random-attack median fortification problem (RAMF) to identify the fortification strategy that minimizes the expected operation cost after random attacks. RAMF is formulated as an integer-linear program and solved directly using general-purpose MIP solver. Moreover, a more complex problem, the fortification median problem for disruptions caused by mixed types of attacks (FMMA), is introduced to find a balance between defending the worst-case attacks and random attacks. Solving FMMA can achieve good protection results, which are more practical in dealing with systems with mixed types of attacks, if the proportion between the types is properly estimated. We formulate FMMA as a non-linear bilevel program and extend a typical implicit enumeration (IE) algorithm to solve the problem. Finally, computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both RAMF and FMMA in dealing with protective affairs involving random attacks. The efficiency of solving the formulations of RAMF and FMMA is also testified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
