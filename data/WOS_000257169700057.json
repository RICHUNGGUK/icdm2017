This work investigates the role of argumentation systems to help users evaluate such answers. More specifically, it looks closely at a gene expression case study, creating an appropriate representation of the underlying data and series of rules that are used by a third-party argumentation engine to reason over the query results provided by the mouse gene expression database EMAGE. Results: A prototype using the ASPIC argumentation engine has been implemented and a preliminary evaluation carried out. This evaluation suggested that argumentation can be used to deal with inconsistent data in biological resources.", "paper_title": "Towards the use of argumentation in bioinformatics: a gene expression case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000257169700057"}
