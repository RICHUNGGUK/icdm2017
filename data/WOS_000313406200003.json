The success of VEs depends on seamless interoperability of knowledge and data sharing. Ontology implementation is becoming an essential and successful tool for VE operation but commonly ontology mapping is also required to achieve interoperability. The current state of the art in ontology mapping indicates that mapping systems require a great deal of human intervention as mapping brings various types of conflicts and inconsistencies. The ontology mapping method proposed in this paper uses description logic (DL) based bridging axioms between the ontologies. Atomic concept level similarity has been taken as input to establish the complex concepts and roles level mapping. Manufacturing and marketing enterprise ontologies are considered and their mapping has been demonstrated as an example of the proposed mapping process. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
