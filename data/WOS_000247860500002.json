A new approach in designing fuzzy controller is called T-S region-based fuzzy controller (TSRFC), which is derived from the fuzzy region concept and the robust control technique. The fuzzy region concept is used to divide the general plant rules into several fuzzy regions and the robust control technique is used to stabilize all plant rules of each fuzzy region. A theorem in synthesizing TSRFC is derived from Lyapunov stability criterion, which is expressed in terms of LMIs. This proposed idea is greatly reduced the total number of LMIs and controller rules. For this reason, TSRFC is easy to implement with simple hardware. TSRFC is able to provide good performances as well as PDC-based designs even though the controller rules are reduced.", "paper_title": "Mixed H-2/H-infinity region-based fuzzy controller design for continuous-time fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247860500002"}
