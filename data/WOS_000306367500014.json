This system describes the evolution of a dense oxide layer. It is based on a drift-diffusion system and includes moving boundary equations. The choice of the numerical methods is justified by a stability analysis and by the study of their numerical performance. Finally, numerical experiments with real-life data shows the efficiency of the developed methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
