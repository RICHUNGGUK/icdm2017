The second purpose is to analyze the problem of lengthening the key frame interval in distributed video coding (DVC), and propose an approach to improve the rate-distortion (RD) performance of DVC for long group-of-frames (GOF) size. Design/methodology/approach - In the proposed scheme, a base layer is first obtained from an H.264 coder. When a DVC coder is then used to code the enhancement layer, information in processing the base layer is extracted and analyzed to make multiple side-information available and reduce error accumulation for DVC coding, thus further improving the performance of the DVC coder. Findings - By dividing video into base and enhancement layers, the combined video coding architecture enables a flexible video transmission. In addition, several methods are used to improve the RD performance in DVC coding. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme outperforms non-scalable DVC for long GOF size. Originality/value - Prediction from the decoding loop in base layer encoder largely reduces enhancement layer spatial redundancy. Multiple side-information provides better estimation for DVC reconstruction. Long prediction loop is more reliable because error accumulation is effectively compensated.", "paper_title": "Scalable combined H.264/distributed video coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000277371500013"}
