The adaptive rate control algorithm can reduce rate fluctuation, effectively prevent the skipping frame, and be suitable to the characteristics of wireless channel. The experimental result indicates that this plan can guarantee the quality of service of video transmission. Design/methodology/approach - A motion complexity measure is developed to enhance the existing mean of absolute difference (MAD)-based algorithm and is applied to bit allocation for rate control. Time and space relativities in frames are also used in the proposed rate control algorithm for MAD prediction. A quantitative parameter (QP) control scheme is used to adjust the computed QP based on actual encoding results of previous coded macroblocks (MBs) in a frame. Findings - The proposed rate control algorithm always outperforms JM 8.6. The adaptive MAD model can reduce the prediction error. Both the subjective and objective reconstructed video qualities are improved, and the luminance PSNR is increased by up to 0.53 dB (or an average of around 0.37 dB). Originality/value - The adaptive rate control algorithm based on motion complexity and MAD prediction with space and time relativities will be suitable for wireless communication applications.", "paper_title": "Rate control in H.264 wireless video communication system", "paper_id": "WOS:000277371500012"}
