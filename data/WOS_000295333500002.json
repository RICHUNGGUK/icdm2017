Democratic decision problems cannot be considered a usual decision task due to the subjectivity of human' opinions and the complexity of social environments. To model these processes, the concept of work committee is used, where every citizen's opinion is represented in heterogeneous groups and aggregated to obtain a representative final opinion for the problem. In these environments, traditional operators don't represent the concept of discussion groups used in social models producing inadequate aggregations for these types of problems. The purpose of this paper is to present a new OWA operator where the weights are a function of the aggregate values in order to model the work committee and aggregate the citizens' opinions in democratic decision problems.", "paper_title": "WKC-OWA, A NEW NEAT-OWA OPERATOR TO AGGREGATE INFORMATION IN DEMOCRATIC DECISION PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000295333500002"}
