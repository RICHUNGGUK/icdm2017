The first concerns LoGSPACE while the second leads to PTIME. This latter characterization shows that adding a choice command to a PTIME language (the language WHILE of Jones [1]) may not necessarily provide NPTIME computations. The result is close to Cook in [2] who used \"auxiliary push-down automata\". LOGSPACE is obtained through a decidable mechanism of tiering. It is based on an analysis of deforestation due to Wadler in [3]. We get also a characterization of NLOGSPACE.", "paper_title": "Some programming languages for LOGSPACE and PTIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425400008"}
