The authors investigated the cognitive factors underlying such perceptions by performing a qualitative analysis that included open-ended in-depth interviews of a convenience sample of healthcare providers who use a variety of documentation methods. A total of 16 providers participated in the study; subjects included physicians and nurse practitioners from medical and surgical specialties who used paper- and computer-based documentation tools. Based on interview data, authors identified five factors that influenced satisfaction with clinical documentation tools: document system time efficiency, availability, expressivity, structure, and quality. These factors, if validated by subsequent investigations, can be used to develop a formal conceptual model of providers' perceptions of their satisfaction with various documentation systems.
