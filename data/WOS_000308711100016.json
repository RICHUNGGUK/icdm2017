The main goal is to generate a degraded wiretap channel in the application layer over which Wyner-type secrecy encoding is invoked to deliver additional secure information. More specifically, we study secrecy enhancement of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) block cipher working in cipher feedback model (CFB) when adjustable noise is introduced into the encrypted data in an application layer. A verification strategy in the exhaustive search step of the linear attack is designed to allow Eve to mount a successful attack in the noisy environment. Thus, a controllable wiretap channel is created over multiple frames by taking advantage of errors in Eve's cryptanalysis, whose secrecy capacity is found for the case of known channel states at receivers. As a result, additional secure information can be delivered by performing Wyner type secrecy encoding over superframes ahead of encryption. These secrecy bits could be taken as symmetric keys for upcoming frames. Numerical results indicate that a sufficiently large secrecy rate can be achieved by selective noise addition.", "paper_title": "Enhancement of Secrecy of Block Ciphered Systems by Deliberate Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000308711100016"}
