Rev. B 44:8454, 1991), adopted for studies of intermolecular complexes (Wesolowski and Weber in Chem. Phys. Lett. 248:71, 1996). The energy components (exchange-correlation and non-additive kinetic) expressed as explicit density functionals are approximated by means of gradient-free- (local density approximation) of gradient-dependent- (generalized gradient approximation) approximations. The sample of the considered intermolecular complexes was used previously by Zhao and Truhlar to compare the interaction energies derived using various methods based on the Kohn-Sham equations with high-level quantum chemistry results considered as the reference. It stretches from rare gas dimers up to strong hydrogen bonds. Our results indicate that the subsystem-based methods provide an interesting alternative to that based on the Kohn-Sham equations. Local density approximation, which is the simplest approximation for the relevant density functionals and which does not rely on any empirical data, leads to a computational approach comparing favorably with more than twenty methods based on the Kohn-Sham equations including the ones, which use extensively empirical parameterizations. For various types of non-bonding interactions, the strengths and weaknesses of gradient-free and gradient-dependent approximations to exchange-correlation and non-additive kinetic energy density functionals are discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "Interaction energies in non-covalently bound intermolecular complexes derived using the subsystem formulation of density functional theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000247428500002"}
