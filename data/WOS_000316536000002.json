This paper advances the field further by outlining an isogeometric boundary element Method (IGABEM) that only requires a representation of the geometry of the domain for analysis, fitting neatly with the boundary representation provided completely by CAD. The method circumvents the requirement to generate a boundary mesh representing a significant step in reducing the gap between engineering design and analysis. The current paper focuses on implementation details of 2D IGABEM for elastostatic analysis with particular attention paid towards the differences over conventional boundary element implementations. Examples of Matlab (R) code are given whenever possible to aid understanding of the techniques used. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
