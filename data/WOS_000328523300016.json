However, full encryption using strong cryptographic algorithms is usually not necessary if the purpose is to destroy the commercial value by preventing pleasant viewing. For this purpose, selective encryption is preferred as its operating efficiency is higher. Here, a chaos-based selective encryption scheme implemented on the H.264/AVC standard is proposed. The scheme employs multiple Renyi chaotic maps to generate a pseudorandom bit sequence which is used to mask the selected H.2641AVC syntax elements. It provides sufficient protection against full reconstruction while keeping the format compliance property so as not to cause decoding error without the key. The operating efficiency is high due to the low computational complexity of the Renyi chaotic map, as justified by the simulation results using video clips at various resolutions. Moreover, the security analyses show that the proposed algorithm is highly sensitive to the secret key and possesses good perceptual security. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
