A reliable prognostic model should be able to accurately predict the future state of the battery such that the maintenance service could be scheduled in advance. In this paper, a multistep-ahead prediction model based on the mean entropy and relevance vector machine (RVM) is developed, and applied to state of health (SOH) and remaining life prediction of the battery. A wavelet denoising approach is introduced into the RVM model to reduce the uncertainty and to determine trend information. The mean entropy based method is then used to select the optimal embedding dimension for correct time series reconstruction. Finally, RVM is employed as a novel nonlinear time-series prediction model to predict the future SOH and the remaining life of the battery. As more data become available, the accuracy and precision of the prediction improve. The presented approach is validated through experimental data collected from Li-ion batteries. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can be effectively applied to battery monitoring and prognostics.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Prognostics for Battery Health Monitoring Using the Mean Entropy and Relevance Vector Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000342278400004"}
