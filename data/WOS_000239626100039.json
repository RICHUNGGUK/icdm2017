Unfortunately, previous studies have not been able to support the user mobility, nor the service mobility efficiently. Both, however, should be supported in a ubiquitous computing environment. Therefore, this study proposes a dynamic context aware service model, which supports the management of context information and service mobility among service gateware. We also have designed a middleware based on this model. As the middleware is implemented on the OSGi framework, it can cause interoperability among devices such as computers, PDAs, home appliances and sensors. The proposed middleware has advantages of interoperation and integrating the heterogeneous devices by applying these standard interface technologies to this middleware.", "paper_title": "Dynamic context aware system for ubiquitous computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100039"}
