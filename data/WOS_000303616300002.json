The proposed SDVS scheme utilizes the Bonsai trees and pre-image sample-able function primitives to generate the designate verifier signature (DVS). In this construction, the un-forge-ability is based on the hardness of the SIS problem which is proven in the random oracle model and the non-transferability is based on the hardness of the LWE problem. As an application of the proposed SDVS scheme, we design a strong designate verifier ring signature scheme (SDVRS) which satisfies non-transferability. It is proven that the identity of the signer is unconditionally protected not only for any third-party but also for the designate verifier. Under the hardness of the SIS problem, the proposed SDVRS scheme is proven to be existentially un-forgeable in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "LATTICE-BASED STRONG DESIGNATE VERIFIER SIGNATURE AND ITS APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000303616300002"}
