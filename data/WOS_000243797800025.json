The most used tools for this problem are single lineal regressions and autoregressive models (ARIMA). Notwithstanding, few works have used more sophisticated tools based in Artificial Intelligence, as are neural or neuro-fuzzy models. In this work, we applied some of these models to forecast olive pollen concentrations in the atmosphere of Granada (Spain). We first studied the overall performance of the selected models, then considering the data segmented into intervals (low, medium and high concentration), to test how they behave on each interval. Experimental results show an advantage of the neuro-fuzzy models against classical statistical methods, although there is still room for improvement.(1) (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
