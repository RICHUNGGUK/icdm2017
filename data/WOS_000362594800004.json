Our classes were a mix between the traditional system and the new educational system. Moreover, we tried to adapt the evaluation process to the new European Framework for Higher Education. We have used videos developed by us and by students in our classes. We have noticed that the interest and motivation in class has grown. Also the grades have improved. We did a survey during this academic year and the results were strongly positive for both students and teachers.", "paper_title": "Unifying the classical approach with new technologies: An innovative proposal for teaching mathematics in engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000362594800004"}
