In this paper, we propose a COoperative Transmission control Scheme using erasure coding (COTS) to improve the transmission efficiency. In this scheme, the cooperative message distribution algorithm uses delivery capacities to decide the transmission direction and traffic. Besides, the cooperative task scheduling algorithm sets the transfer order for messages from both sides. This algorithm uses a comprehensive parameter, the number of data blocks to send, to simplify the computation of transmission priority. After analyzing the vehicle transmission behavior under different storage conditions, we apply local deleting and creating behaviors instead of sending and receiving behaviors in specific states to decrease communication overhead. Simulation results show that COTS, compared with other well-known schemes, not only increases the delivery ratio but also decreases the delivery latency and the transmission overhead.", "paper_title": "Cooperative transmission control scheme using erasure coding for vehicular delay-tolerant networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337800400022"}
