The dry contact forces are evaluated through a Hertzian-based contact law, which includes a damping term representing the energy dissipation. The frictional forces are evaluated using a modified Coulomb's friction law. In the case of lubricated joints, the resulting lubricant forces are derived from the corresponding Reynolds' equation. An absolute nodal formulation is utilized in flexible body formulation. The generalized-a method is used to solve the resulting equations of motion. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated by two numerical examples. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
