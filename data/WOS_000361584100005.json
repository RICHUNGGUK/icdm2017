Despite lack of transparency in hedge fund market, the strategy of performance allocation is publicly available. This paper shows that, for the High-Water Mark Scheme, these complex performance allocation strategies might explain empirical facts observed in hedge fund returns, such as return persistence, skewed return distribution, bias ratio, or implied increasing risk appetite.
