The features in time-domain, frequency-domain and wavelet-domain are extracted from the vibration signals to characterize the information relevant to the fault conditions of bearing. By the improved distance evaluation technique the optimal features are selected and the corresponding feature-weights which are assigned to the features to indicate their different importance to the fault conditions of bearing are obtained. Then they are combined with the modified FAM which is described by the weighted Manhattan distance and applied to the seven-class fault diagnosis of bearing. To assess the effectiveness and stability of the modified FAM network, bootstrapping method is employed to quantify the stability of the network performance statistically. Diagnosis results show that the modified FAM can more reliably and accurately recognize different fault classes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
