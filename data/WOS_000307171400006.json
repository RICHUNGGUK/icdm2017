Despite all research done in preventive security for cloud computing, the high complexity and the interdependence of many software layers and infrastructures mean that in practice there are always chances for something going wrong. For this reason, there is a need to complement preventive security measures with reactive measures. Among these, monitoring is the most relevant approach. In this paper, we introduce a new and robust architecture for dynamic security monitoring and enforcement specially designed for cloud computing scenarios. Our solution is therefore a complete one including a three-layered architecture, a new language for expressing monitoring rules and a strategy based on the generation of a finite-state machine to improve the performance of the monitoring engine.", "paper_title": "A Performance-Oriented Monitoring System for Security Properties in Cloud Computing Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000307171400006"}
