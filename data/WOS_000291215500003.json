This paper describes driver's deceleration and acceleration behavior based on driving situation awareness in the car-following process, and then presents several driving models for analysis of driver's safety approaching behavior in traffic operation. The emphasis of our work is placed on the research of driver's various information process and multi-ruled decision-making mechanism by considering the complicated control process of driving; the results will be able to provide a theoretical basis for intelligent driving shaping model.", "paper_title": "Driver's various information process and multi-ruled decision-making mechanism: a fundamental of intelligent driving shaping model", "paper_id": "WOS:000291215500003"}
