In this article, we take a more conservative yet novel approach of using traditional relational database engines for detecting the changes to large ordered XML documents. To this end, we have implemented a prototype system called XANDY that converts XML documents into relational tuples and detects the changes from these tuples by using SQL queries. Our experimental results show that the relational-based approach has better scalability compared to published algorithm like X-Diff. It has comparable efficiency and result quality compared to X-Diff in some cases. Our experimental results also show that, generally, XANDY has better result quality than XyDiff.
