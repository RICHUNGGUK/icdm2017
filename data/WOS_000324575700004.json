We present an abnormal video event detection system that considers both spatial and temporal contexts. To characterize the video, we first perform the spatio-temporal video segmentation and then propose a new region-based descriptor called \"Motion Context,\" to describe both motion and appearance information of the spatio-temporal segment. For anomaly measurements, we formulate the abnormal event detection as a matching problem, which is more robust than statistic model-based methods, especially when the training dataset is of limited size. For each testing spatio-temporal segment, we search for its best match in the training dataset, and determine how normal it is using a dynamic threshold. To speed up the search process, compact random projections are also adopted. Experiments on the benchmark dataset and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods validate the advantages of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "Video Anomaly Search in Crowded Scenes via Spatio-Temporal Motion Context", "paper_id": "WOS:000324575700004"}
