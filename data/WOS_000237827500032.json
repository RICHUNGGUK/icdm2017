The home-away assignment problem is to find a home-away assignment that minimizes the total traveling distance of the teams. We propose a formulation of the home-away assignment problem as an integer program, and a rounding algorithm based on Bertsimas, Teo and Vohra's dependent randomized rounding method [2]. Computational experiments show that our method quickly generates feasible solutions close to optimal.", "paper_title": "Dependent randomized rounding to the home-away assignment problem in sports scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000237827500032"}
