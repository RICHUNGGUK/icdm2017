For this kind of equations, this article discusses a splitting extrapolation which possesses a high order of accuracy, a high degree of parallelism, less computational complexity and more flexibility than Richardson extrapolation. According to the problems, some domain decompositions are Constructed and some independent mesh parameters are designed. Multi-parameter asymptotic expansions are proved for the errors of approximations. Based on the expansions, splitting extrapolation formulas are developed to compute approximations with high order of accuracy on a globally fine grid. Because these formulas only require us to solve a set of smaller discrete subproblems on different coarser grids in parallel instead of on the globally fine grid, a large scale multidimensional problem is turned into a set of smaller discrete subproblems. Additionally, this method is efficient for solving interface problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
