In this paper, we extend the spatial pyramid histogram of gradients to spatio-temporal domain to give 3-dimensional facial features and integrate them with dense optical flow to give a spatio-temporal descriptor which extracts both the spatial and dynamic motion information of facial expressions. A multi-class support vector machine based classifier with one-to-one strategy is used to recognise facial expressions. Experiments on the CK+ and MMI datasets using leave-one-out cross validation scheme demonstrate that the integrated framework achieves a better performance than using individual descriptor separately. Compared with six state of the art methods, the proposed framework demonstrates a superior performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
