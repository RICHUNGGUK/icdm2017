The proposed down-mixing architecture enhances the sound localization capability of a headset using the HRTF and by simulating multiple sound reflections in a room using Moorer's reverberator. Since the HRTF has large memory and computation requirements, the common-acoustical-pole and zero (CAPZ) model can be used to reshape the lower-order HRTF model. From a power consumption viewpoint, the CAPZ model reduces computation complexity by approximately 40%. The subjective listening tests in this study shows that the proposed four-channel headset performs much better than stereo headphones. On the other hand, the four-channel headset that can be implemented by off-the-shelf components preserves the privacy with low cost.", "paper_title": "A Low-Complexity Down-Mixing Structure on Quadraphonic Headsets for Surround Audio", "paper_id": "WOS:000321467700003"}
