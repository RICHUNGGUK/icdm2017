This is done by aggregating effort information of similar projects from a given historical data set that contains projects, or objects in general, and attributes describing the objects. While this has been successful in general, existing research results have shown that a carefully selected subset, as well as weighting, of the attributes may improve the performance of the estimation methods. In order to improve the estimation accuracy of our former proposed EBA method AQUA, which supports data sets that have non-quantitative and missing values, an attribute weighting method using rough set analysis is proposed in this paper. AQUA is thus extended to AQUA(+) by incorporating the proposed attribute weighting and selection method. Better prediction accuracy was obtained by AQUA(+) compared to AQUA(+) for five data sets. The proposed method for attribute weighting and selection is effective in that (1) it supports data sets that have non-quantitative and missing values; (2) it supports attribute selection as well as weighting, which are not supported simultaneously by other attribute selection methods; and (3) it helps AQUA- to produce better performance.", "paper_title": "Software effort estimation by analogy using attribute selection based on rough set analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000255159800001"}
