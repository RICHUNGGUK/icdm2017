Unlike existing works in the literature, where only one secondary user (SU) uses overlay and underlay modes, the different transmission modes should be allocated to different SUs, according to their different quality of services (QoS), to achieve the maximal efficiency of radio spectrum. However, hybrid sharing mode allocation for heterogeneous services is still a challenge in CRNs. In this paper, we propose a new resource allocation method for hybrid sharing transmission mode of overlay and underlay (HySOU), to achieve more potential resources for SUs to access the spectrum without interfering with the primary users. We formulate the HySOU resource allocation as a mixed-integer programming problem to optimize the total system throughput, satisfying heterogeneous QoS. To decrease the algorithm complexity, we divide the problem into two sub-problems: subchannel allocation and power allocation. Cutset is used to achieve the optimal subchannel allocation, and the optimal power allocation is obtained by Lagrangian dual function decomposition and subgradient algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm further improves spectrum utilization with a simultaneous fairness guarantee, and the achieved HySOU diversity gain is a satisfactory improvement.", "paper_title": "Resource Allocation based on Hybrid Sharing Mode for Heterogeneous Services of Cognitive Radio OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000351719000009"}
