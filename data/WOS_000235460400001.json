There have been many works in the literature on the modeling and analysis of the occlusion phenomenon, most of which are from the analytical or statistical points of view. The current paper presents a new theory of occlusion based on the simple topological definitions of preimages and a binary operation on them called \"occlu.\" We study numerous topological as well as algebraic structures of the resultant noncommutative preimage monoids (a monoid is a semigroup with identity). Some implications of the new theory in terms of real vision research are also addressed.", "paper_title": "On the foundations of vision modeling III.
