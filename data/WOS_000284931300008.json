The relationship between the satisfiability of metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas over continuous-time models and over discrete-time models is studied. It is shown to what extent discrete-time sequences obtained by sampling continuous-time signals capture the semantics of MTL formulas over the two time domains. The main results apply to \"flat\" formulas that do not nest temporal operators and can be applied to the problem of reducing the verification problem for MTL over continuous-time models to the same problem over discrete time, resulting in an automated partial practically efficient discretization technique.", "paper_title": "A Theory of Sampling for Continuous-Time Metric Temporal Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000284931300008"}
