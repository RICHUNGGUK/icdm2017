However fuzzy neural network has its shortages: fuzzy membership function has only one single value, it cannot get more reasonable classified and cognizable results. While, vague sets theory is a generalization of fuzzy sets theory, its' distinguishing feature is having a truth-membership function and a false-membership function. It presents both of the opposite factors to deal with nonlinearities and uncertain of control system in the control fields., this paper has been accomplished the controller of vague neural networks based on the vague set theory, this controller combines the advantage of vague set in handling uncertain information and the capability of artificial neural networks in learning process. Moreover, in the application of inverted pendulum, the character of vague neural network controller was expressed.", "paper_title": "Vague neural network controller and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100083"}
