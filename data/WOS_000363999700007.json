Web storage with native browser support has changed the paradigm of web application development unprecedentedly because persistent data storage with increased data size can be realized on the client. Web storage is poised to quickly become an area of particular interest for forensic investigators due to the potential to discover critical information from web browser artifacts at client side. However, the literature work on web browser forensics has traditionally focused on browsing history, browser cache, and cookie files (Oh et al., 2011). Therefore, we first discuss the prevalence of web storage implementation in widely used websites. Then, we compare and contrast the web storage technology currently implemented in the five major web browsers, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Apple's Safari. Moreover, in order to provide more insights into web storage and enable unified forensic analysis, a proof-of-concept tool, named as BrowStEx (Browser Storage Extractor), is described with implementation details. The commonalities, differences, and the proof-of-concept tool discussed in this paper can be useful in developing advanced forensic tools that can extract browser storage artifacts.
