This paper presents a systematic comparison of these measures in three simulated paradigms designed to address specific situations of interest in spike train analysis where the relevant feature may be in the form of firing rate, firing rate modulations, and/or synchrony. The measures are first disseminated and extended for ease of comparison. It also discusses how the measures can be used to measure dissimilarity in spike trains' firing rate despite their explicit formulation for synchrony.", "paper_title": "A comparison of binless spike train measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000275755000007"}
