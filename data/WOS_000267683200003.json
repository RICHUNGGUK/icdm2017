Using the standard Fastslam algorithm, only low-dimensional vehicle models can be handled due to computational constraints. In this work, an extra factorization of the problem is introduced that makes high-dimensional vehicle models computationally feasible. Results using experimental data from an unmanned aerial vehicle (helicopter) are presented. The proposed algorithm fuses measurements from on-board inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyro), barometer, and vision in order to solve the slam problem.", "paper_title": "Particle Filter SLAM with High Dimensional Vehicle Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000267683200003"}
