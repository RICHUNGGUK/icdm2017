In this study, we attempted to increase the prediction accuracy of a decision tree model by integrating local application of Naive Bayes classifier. We performed a large-scale comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms on 30 standard benchmark datasets and the proposed method gave statistical better accuracy in some cases.", "paper_title": "A hybrid decision tree classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000328936600032"}
