Our approach is based on the maximization of the received signal-to-noise ratio under total power consumption by the transmission of the symbol. We show that in spite of inter-relay interferences, the maximization problem has a closed-form solution. Simulation results explicitly indicate that the performance of proposed approach outmatches the existing methods including equal power allocation and one-path relaying.", "paper_title": "Joint relay selection and power allocation for amplify-and-forward two-path relaying networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327826500012"}
