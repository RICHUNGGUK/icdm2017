The former one lets the user deform the model in real-time and also preserve the shape with sophisticated techniques like Green Coordinates. The direct techniques on the other hand free the user from the burden of creating an appropriate cage though they take more computing time to solve larger non-linear optimizations. It would be ideal to develop a cage-free technique that provides real-time deformation while respecting the local geometry. Using a simple eigen-framework, we devise such a technique. Our framework creates an implicit skeleton automatically. The user only specifies the motion in a simple and intuitive manner, and our algorithm computes a deformation whose quality is similar to that of the cage-based scheme with Green Coordinates.", "paper_title": "Eigen deformation of 3D models", "paper_id": "WOS:000304411500007"}
