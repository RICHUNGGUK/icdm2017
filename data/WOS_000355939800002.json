In this problem, we are given a graph G=(V,E) with costs on edges and a set of terminals TaS dagger V. The goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph such that every pair of terminals are connected by k openly (vertex) disjoint paths. In this paper, we present an approximation algorithm for the subset k-connected subgraph problem which improves on the previous best approximation guarantee of O(k (2)logk) by Nutov (ACM Trans. Algorithms 9(1):1, 2012). Our approximation guarantee, alpha(|T|), depends upon the number of terminals: So, when the number of terminals is large enough, the approximation guarantee improves significantly. Moreover, we show that, given an approximation algorithm for |T|=k, we can obtain almost the same approximation guarantee for any instances with |T|> k. This suggests that the hardest instances of the problem are when |T|a parts per thousand k.", "paper_title": "An Improved Approximation Algorithm for the Minimum Cost Subset k-Connected Subgraph Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000355939800002"}
