Therefore, 'smarter' networks have been proposed in order to cover this need. The cognitive packet network (CPN) is a routing protocol that provides QoS-driven routing and performs self-improvement in a distributed manner, by learning from the experience of special packets, which gather on-line QoS measurements and discover new routes. The CPN was first introduced in 1999 and has been used in several applications since then. Here we provide a comprehensive survey of its variations, applications and experimental performance evaluations.", "paper_title": "The Cognitive Packet Network: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000274974800003"}
