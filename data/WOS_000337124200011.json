In this paper, we demonstrate that motion will be exploited most effectively, if it is regarded over larger time windows. Opposed to classical two-frame optical flow, point trajectories that span hundreds of frames are less susceptible to short-term variations that hinder separating different objects. As a positive side effect, the resulting groupings are temporally consistent over a whole video shot, a property that requires tedious post-processing in the vast majority of existing approaches. We suggest working with a paradigm that starts with semi-dense motion cues first and that fills up textureless areas afterwards based on color. This paper also contributes the Freiburg-Berkeley motion segmentation (FBMS) dataset, a large, heterogeneous benchmark with 59 sequences and pixel-accurate ground truth annotation of moving objects.", "paper_title": "Segmentation of Moving Objects by Long Term Video Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000337124200011"}
