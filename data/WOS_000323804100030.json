The learning process thus has O(N-3) and O(N-2) in the time and space complexity, respectively. This poses significant burden on the vector learning problem for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a sparse approximation to a robust vector field learning method, sparse vector field consensus (SparseVFC), and derive a statistical learning bound on the speed of the convergence. We apply SparseVFC to the mismatch removal problem. The quantitative results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant speed advantage of SparseVFC over the original VFC algorithm (two orders of magnitude faster) without much performance degradation; we also demonstrate the large improvement by SparseVFC over traditional methods like RANSAC. Moreover, the proposed method is general and it can be applied to other applications in vector field learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
