This is also the case in many language processing tasks, due to the overwhelming and ever increasing amount of textual information that must be processed in a reasonable time frame. This scenario has led to a paradigm shift in the computing architectures and large-scale data processing strategies used in the Natural Language Processing field. In this paper we present a new distributed architecture and technology for scaling up text analysis running a complete chain of linguistic processors on several virtual machines. Furthermore, we also describe a series of experiments carried out with the goal of analyzing the scaling capabilities of the language processing pipeline used in this setting. We explore the use of Storm in a new approach for scalable distributed language processing across multiple machines and evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency when processing documents on a medium and large scale. The experiments have shown that there is a big room for improvement regarding language processing performance when adopting parallel architectures, and that we might expect even better results with the use of large clusters with many processing nodes.
