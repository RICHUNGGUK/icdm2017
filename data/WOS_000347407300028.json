Backward semi-Lagrangian scheme is employed for noise-free simulation of the gyrokinetic Vlasov equation with finite Larmor radius effects. Grid systems and numerical interpolations are implemented to deal with arbitrary equilibrium information given in a GEQDSK format file. In particular, we introduce an adaptive interpolation technique for fluctuating quantities, which have elongated structures along equilibrium magnetic fields. This field-aligned interpolation can reduce the required number of grid points to represent the fluctuating quantities. Also, it is shown that the new interpolation allows us to choose bigger time sizes with better simulation accuracy. Several benchmark simulation results are presented for comparison with previously known cases. It is demonstrated that the new code can reproduce the well known results of zonal flow and linear ITG instabilities in concentric circular equilibrium. It is also shown that the code can capture the effects of plasma shaping on the zonal flow and ITG instabilities, and the stabilization effects of the shaping result in significant up-shifts of the threshold of ion temperature gradient for ITG in nonlinear simulation.
