Resource discovery activity involves searching for the appropriate resource types that match the user's application requirements. Various kinds of solutions to grid resource discovery have been suggested, including centralized and hierarchical information server approaches. However, both of these approaches have serious limitations in regard to scalability, fault tolerance, and network congestion. To overcome these limitations, indexing resource information using a decentralized (e.g., peer-to-peer (P2P)) network model has been actively proposed in the past few years. This article investigates various decentralized resource discovery techniques primarily driven by the P2P network model. To summarize, this article presents a: summary of the current state of the art in grid resource discovery, resource taxonomy with focus on the computational grid paradigm, P2P taxonomy with a focus on extending the current structured systems (e.g., distributed hash tables) for indexing d-dimensional grid resource queries,(1) a detailed survey of existing work that can support d-dimensional grid resource queries, and classification of the surveyed approaches based on the proposed P2P taxonomy. We believe that this taxonomy and its mapping to relevant systems would be useful for academic and industry-based researchers who are engaged in the design of scalable grid and P2P systems.", "paper_title": "PEER-TO-PEER-BASED RESOURCE DISCOVERY IN GLOBAL GRIDS: A TUTORIAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971700003"}
