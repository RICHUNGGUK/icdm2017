When applied to speech enhancement, the fundamental difference between the traditional extended Kalman filter and our method is that we obtain the AR parameter estimations by using conjugate gradient algorithm to solve the modified Yule-Walker equation of higher-order cumulants. Simulation results show that this algorithm possesses high parameter estimation accuracy and robustness. At the same time, it can obtain good speech enhancement performance in the presence of very complicated noise.", "paper_title": "SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM BASED ON HIGHER-ORDER CUMULANTS PARAMETER ESTIMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000270426300024"}
