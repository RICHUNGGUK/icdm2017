First, a new model for SoC-RTOS partitioning is introduced in this paper, which can help in understanding the essence of the SoC-RTOS partitioning. Second, a discrete Hopfield neural network approach for implementing the SoC-RTOS partitioning is proposed, where a novel energy function, operating equation and coefficients of the neural network are redefined. Third, simulations are carried out with comparisons to the genetic algorithm and ant algorithm in the performance and search time used. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A novel discrete Hopfield neural network approach for hardware-software partitioning of RTOS in the SoC", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000089"}
