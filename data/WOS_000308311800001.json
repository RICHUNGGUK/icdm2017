The first problem focuses on minimizing the total breach under a lifetime constraint, where a breach occurs when some targets are not covered by active sensors. The second problem aims at maximizing the network lifetime under a breach constraint. Finally, the problem of computing the possible trade-offs between breach and lifetime offered by the sensor network is also addressed. An exact approach based on a column generation algorithm is proposed for solving these problems, and a heuristic is also derived from it and briefly presented. The use of a genetic algorithm within the column generation scheme appears to significantly decrease computation time. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
