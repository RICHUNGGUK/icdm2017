Hand-held devices and sensors with wireless connections create opportunities for many new nomadic applications. Service discovery is an essential component for cognitive science to discover existing network services just-in-time. Unlike many other approaches, we propose a service discovery model supporting nomadic users and services in public environments. Our model emphasizes secure and private service discovery in such environments. Location sensing is integrated for location dependent service discovery and is used to lessen service discovery network infrastructure requirements. We analyze the system performance and show our formal verification of the protocols. Our implementation shows that our model is feasible.", "paper_title": "Toward secure and private service discovery anywhere anytime", "paper_id": "WOS:000292504800002"}
