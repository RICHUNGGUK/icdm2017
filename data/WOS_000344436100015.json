Tests were also combined with hot water treatments against phytoplasmas or applied to one-year-old grafted rootlings ready for transplantation in the vineyard to reduce tagging costs. In addition, novel health-compliant methodologies for ultra-high frequency (UHF) tagging were evaluated. To assess the effects of tag implantation in rootstocks, plant viability, functional vascular tissue area and tag reliability were calculated, as well as the effects of phytopathogenic fungi on wounds produced by tagging. The tagging procedure did not cause significant effects on viability and functional vascular tissue area. Tag reliability was set at more than 96%. Fungal infections caused less than 1% of infected vascular tissue area and tagging methods could be integrated with hot water treatments against phytoplasmas. Tracking implants were applied successfully to one-year-old rootlings that were ready for transplantation, even if tag reliability decreased. Novel semi-internal implants of UHF tags did not cause concerns about plant health but tags were exposed to environmental stress or fortuitous damage during farming practices.
