It highlights six areas where developments in model-based systems in general, and in qualitative reasoning in particular, have the potential to provide significant computer-based help. The paper also examines where further technological developments might be needed in order to achieve these qualitative futures.", "paper_title": "Qualitative futures", "paper_id": "WOS:000243097900002"}
