Our respondents rated the importance of each of CobiT's 34 processes from the viewpoint of effective internal control over financial reporting. Results revealed five processes that were deemed specially critical. We also find interesting patterns of results as a function of respondents' employment type and geographic location. This survey of IT professionals shed light on the relevance of a widely used IT governance framework-CobiT-from the perspective of organizations' internal controls. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
