This paper presents the model of the small DMFC Bipolar Plate Stack System. This system is different, from the conventional complex mathematical models by the neural network (NN) which is considered the real parameters of the measurement inputs and outputs. First., the training data is the power density of short-term stability tests for the DMFC 10-cell stacks. Then, the DMFC model can be obtained by NN method and contented to the different unit, cell stacks. Finally, the simulation results an agreement with experimental results show that the NN modeling method effectively projects the power density on small DMFC packs, such as the development and simulation tool. Therefore, the NN modeling method can save much time. to reform, the conventional mathematical models by the very expensive experiment.", "paper_title": "NEURAL NETWORK MODELING FOR SMALL DMFC BIPOLAR PLATE STACK SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000272567000003"}
