But two CSPs corresponding to the same clone may still differ substantially with respect to worst-case time complexity, which makes clones ill-suited when comparing running times of CSP problems. In this article we instead consider an algebra where each clone splits into an interval of strong partial clones such that a strong partial clone corresponds to the CSPs that are solvable within the same O(c(n)) bound. We investigate these intervals and give relational descriptions, weak bases; of the largest elements. They have a highly regular form and are in many cases easily relatable to the smallest members in the intervals, which suggests that the lattice of strong partial clones has a simpler structure than the lattice of partial clones.
