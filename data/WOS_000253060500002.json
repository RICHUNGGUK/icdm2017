However, most of the existing descriptions of these patterns are incomprehensive or inconsistent with descriptions of similar patterns by other authors. We seek to improve the communication and comprehension of agent-oriented patterns by improving their descriptions. This paper presents a pattern template structure for defining agent-oriented pattern templates. We used the template structure to define eight agent-oriented pattern templates. We describe the elements of these eight templates. We illustrate the expressiveness of these templates by using three of them to describe three existing agent-oriented patterns.
