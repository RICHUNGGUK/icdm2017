The possibilistic portfolio model with general constraints to investment is proposed by means of possibilistic mean value and possibilistic variance. The conventional probabilistic mean-variance model can be simplified under the assumption that the returns of assets are triangular fuzzy numbers. Finally, a numerical example of the portfolio selection problem is given to illustrate our proposed effective means and approaches.", "paper_title": "A portfolio selection method based on possibility theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454600034"}
