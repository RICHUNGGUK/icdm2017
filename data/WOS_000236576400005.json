It is called the two-level codebook search algorithm (TLCS). The goal of this method is to reduce the computation cost of the multi-path-searching algorithm for TSVQ. It speeds up the codebook search by searching only a two-level codebook tree instead of the whole TSVQ codebook tree. According to the experimental results, a significant time reduction can be achieved with this method, compared to the multi-path-searching algorithm. In other words, our TLCS outperforms the multi-path-searching algorithm.", "paper_title": "An improved tree-structured codebook search algorithm for grayscale image compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000236576400005"}
