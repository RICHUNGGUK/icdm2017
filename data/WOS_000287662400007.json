These approaches can be used depending on the availability of (i) a composite signal comprising several user signals or, (ii) the individual user signals. The aim is to introduce solutions which can support different bandwidths and center frequencies for a large set of users and at the cost of simple modifications on the same hardware platform. Such structures have previously been used for satellite-based communication systems and the paper aims to outline their possible applications in the context of cognitive radios. For this purpose, dynamic frequencyband allocation (DFBA) and reallocation (DFBR) structures based on multirate building blocks are introduced and their reconfigurability issues with respect to the required reconfigurability measures in cognitive radios are discussed.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Frequency-Band Reallocation and Allocation: from Satellite-Based Communication Systems to Cognitive Radios", "paper_id": "WOS:000287662400007"}
