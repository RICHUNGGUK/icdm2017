The program proposes a friendly graphical user interface to visualize and quantify oxygen profiles semi-automatically. Once a data set has been selected and various parameters (e.g., diffusivity) have been set in the program, the user can convert the raw data signal in concentration units and can define the position of the sediment-water interface for obtaining the depth profiles. Then. PRO2FLUX enables the user to make diffusive O-2 calculations using three of the most widely used models: (1) Fick's first law of diffusion, (2) a quadratic curve-fitting approach, and (3) Berg's model. The PRO2FLUX software creates two types of output ASCII files for each calculation technique: a summary file for the first two diffusive models and an automatically generated input data file necessary for running Berg's model.
