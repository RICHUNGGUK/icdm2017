The approach permits an efficient method for numerical evaluation of the bound, providing an additional tool for system design. The optimal rate-diversity tradeoff for the Nakagami-m, block-fading channel is also derived and a tight upper bound is obtained for the optimal coding gain constant.", "paper_title": "A tight lower bound to the outage probability of discrete-input block-fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000250448800039"}
