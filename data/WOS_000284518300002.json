The basis functions have a local support, they are nonnegative, and they form a partition of unity. Geometrically, the problem can be interpreted as the determination of a set of triangles that must contain a specific set of points. This leads to a natural definition of tangent control triangles. We also consider a stable computation of the Bezier control net of the spline surface. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
