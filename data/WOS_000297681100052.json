The seemingly contradictive effect is achieved in an optimization framework making use of L-0 gradient minimization, which can globally control how many non-zero gradients are resulted in to approximate prominent structure in a sparsity-control manner. Unlike other edge-preserving smoothing approaches, our method does not depend on local features, but instead globally locates important edges. It, as a fundamental tool, finds many applications and is particularly beneficial to edge extraction, clip-art JPEG artifact removal, and non-photorealistic effect generation.", "paper_title": "Image Smoothing via L-0 Gradient Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000297681100052"}
