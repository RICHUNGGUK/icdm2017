However, there is a lack of resources and tools available in the area of visual speech technologies for minority languages. In this paper we present an application to animate in real time virtual characters from live speech in Basque. To get a realistic face animation, the lips must be synchronized with the audio. To accomplish this, we have compared different methods for obtaining the final visemes through HMM based speech recognition techniques. Finally, the implementation of a real prototype has proven the feasibility to obtain a quite natural animation in real time with a minimum amount of training data.", "paper_title": "Speech driven facial animation using HMMs in Basque", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500052"}
