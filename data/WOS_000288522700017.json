In these networks and applications, trust management should fulfill certain requirements (i.e. decentralisation, dynamism, simplicity, interoperability, etc.) for being functional. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary model of trust management that captures dynamic entities' behaviour over time. Likewise, we explain protection mechanisms against several attacks, which are based on the cooperative behaviour of the entities, trust relationship properties, and trust rules. Finally, we successfully validate our model from several scenarios and compare it with other proposals in this field. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
