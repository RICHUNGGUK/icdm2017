The body iron homeostasis is an important but not fully understood complex process. The modeling of the process presented in the paper is expressed in the language of Petri net theory. An application of this theory to the description of biological processes allows for very precise analysis of the resulting models. Here, such an analysis of the body iron homeostasis model from a mathematical point of view is given. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
