Various numerical examples are presented to compare the proposed method with interface capturing methods using pressure-temperature equilibrium and non-equilibrium temperature mixed cell approaches. It is found both mixing models are unable to generate accurate results for strong shock refractions through high acoustic impedance mismatch interfaces. The proposed method is found to be quite robust and can provide relatively reasonable results across a wide variety of flow regimes. The ghost fluid coupling between the fluid solver and the volume of fluid method is designed to be simple and consistent in any spatial dimension on AMR grid.
