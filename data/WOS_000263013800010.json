However, in practice, technologies at different layers may be incompatible to each other, which necessitates a careful choice of a multi-layer network model. Not much work has been done on path selection in multi-layer networks. In this paper, we describe how to represent a multi-layer network and we provide algorithms for selecting paths in them. Throughout the paper we will use examples drawn from practical experience with routing in hybrid optical networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
