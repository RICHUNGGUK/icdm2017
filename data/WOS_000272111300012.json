In view of the fast expanding electric drive vehicle market, fuel cell cars were considered as a combined micro-source/energy storage unit along with Photovoltaic units. Simulation results are presented. The study highlights that voltage regulation is critically important in a MicroGrid, there are still substantial challenges in the design of control for renewable sources in such systems and energy storage is crucial for successful operation of any MicroGrid, though such storage may be distributed throughout the system. It was established that electric vehicles or plug-in-hybrids could be highly suitable due to the fast charge/discharge characteristic of on-board storage.", "paper_title": "STUDY OF A MICROGRID WITH VEHICLE-TO-GRID SOURCES DURING NETWORK CONTINGENCIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000272111300012"}
