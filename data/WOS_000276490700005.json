It is infeasible to collect all the data together to train a global learner for prediction; even exchanging learners trained on different sites is costly. In this paper, aggregative-learning is proposed. In this paradigm, every site maintains a local learner trained from its own data. Upon receiving a request for prediction, an aggregative-learner at a local site activates and sends out many mobile agents taking the request to potential remote learners. The prediction of the aggregative-learner is made by combining the local prediction and the responses brought back by the agents. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments show the superiority of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Exploiting remote learners in Internet environment with agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000276490700005"}
