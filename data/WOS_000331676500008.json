The effects of microscopic instability and bifurcation are studied by using an updated Lagrangian formulation and frictionless self-contact between crack faces is accounted. Two special classes of homogenization problems are examined: effective contact and self-adjoint data. Numerical applications are developed by means of an FE approach with reference to a cellular material with diagonal microcracks and to a laminated microstructure with interface debonding. The strong role of crack self-contact nonlinearities and the influence of microscopic defects on the homogenized composite properties are pointed out. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
