Later, Qin et al. showed a double-CNOT attack on the protocol and also provided an improvement to avoid the attack. This work tries to use a batch of decoy single photons prepared randomly in one of four different states, to enhance the qubit efficiency on their DSQC protocols and avoid the double-CNOT attack at the same time.", "paper_title": "On the \"Deterministic Secure Quantum Communication using Four-Particle Entangled State and Entanglement Swapping\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000304633500003"}
