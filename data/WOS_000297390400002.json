That, in turn, leads to multiple process models that capture a common process from different perspectives and at different levels of abstraction. In order to guarantee a certain degree of uniformity, the consistency of such related process models is evaluated using formal criteria. However, it is unclear how modelling experts assess the consistency between process models, and which kind of notion they perceive to be appropriate. In this paper, we focus on control flow aspects and investigate the adequacy of consistency notions. In particular, we report findings from an online experiment, which allows us to compare in how far trace equivalence and two notions based on behavioural profiles approximate expert perceptions on consistency. Analysing 69 expert statements from process analysts, we conclude that trace equivalence is not suited to be applied as a consistency notion, whereas the notions based on behavioural profiles approximate the perceived consistency of our subjects significantly. Therefore, our contribution is an empirically founded answer to the correlation of behaviour consistency notions and the consistency perception by experts in the field of business process modelling.
