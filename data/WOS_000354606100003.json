Still, their sound analysis is not yet common practice and difficulties arising in the determination of uncertain parameters are typically not assigned properly. This contribution provides a tutorial review on methods for identifiability analysis, regularization techniques and optimal experimental design. A guideline for the analysis and classification of nonlinear ill-posed problems to detect practical identifiability problems is given. Techniques for the regularization of experimental design problems resulting from ill-posed parameter estimations are discussed. Applications are presented for three different case studies of increasing complexity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
