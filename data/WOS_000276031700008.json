Few studies have focused directly on design variables, visual aesthetics and usability, and the consequences on satisfaction of adopting a user-centered perspective. We propose an integrative model of relationship quality to provide an explanation of overall satisfaction through the influence of usability and visual aesthetics. We also suggest that purchase involvement moderates the strength of the relationships between design variables and satisfaction. Partial least squares (PLS) is used to estimate the parameters of the structural model and develop a multi-group analysis. The results provide strong support for the proposals. Design variables, satisfaction and trust lead the users to develop high customer loyalty; and, purchase involvement is an important moderator to engage in online service relationships. Our investigation contributes to the growing literature by examining the influence of purchase involvement in developing virtual relationships. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
