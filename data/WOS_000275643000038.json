A sufficient condition is derived to ensure the global synchronization of switched linearly coupled complex neural networks, which are controlled by some designed controllers. A globally convergent algorithm involving convex optimization is also presented to construct such controllers effectively. In many cases, it is desirable to control the whole network by changing the connections of some nodes in the complex network, and this paper provides an applicable approach. It is even applicable to the case when the derivative of the time-varying delay takes arbitrary. Finally, some simulations are constructed to justify the theoretical analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
