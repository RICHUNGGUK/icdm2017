With software implementations being rather slow, the study of hardware architectures became an active research area. In this paper, we discuss several algorithms to compute the eta T pairing in characteristic three and suggest further improvements. These algorithms involve addition, multiplication, cubing, inversion, and sometimes cube root extraction over F(3m). We propose a hardware accelerator based on a unified arithmetic operator able to perform the operations required by a given algorithm. We describe the implementation of a compact coprocessor for the field F(397) given by F(3)[x]/(x(97) + x(12) + 2), which compares favorably with other solutions described in the open literature.", "paper_title": "Algorithms and arithmetic operators for computing the eta(T) pairing in characteristic three", "paper_id": "WOS:000259364700003"}
