In agent-based models, computationally intense problems, such as global navigation, hinder the efficient real-time modelling of thousands of agents. In this paper we present a novel approach to crowd behaviour modelling which couples the agent-based paradigm of allowing high level of individual parametrization (group behaviour between friends, leader/ follower individuals) with an efficient approach to computationally intensive problems encountered in very large number of agents thus enabling the simulation of thousands of agents in real time using a simple desktop PC.
