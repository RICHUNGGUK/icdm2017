An efficient use of the existing infrastructure relates closely to multiagent systems as many problems in traffic management and control are inherently distributed. In particular, traffic signal controllers located at intersections can be seen as autonomous agents. However, challenging issues are involved in this kind of modeling: the number of agents is high; in general agents must be highly adaptive; they must react to changes in the environment at individual level while also causing an unpredictable collective pattern, as they act in a highly coupled environment. Therefore, traffic signal control poses many challenges for standard techniques from multiagent systems such as learning. Despite the progress in multiagent reinforcement learning via formalisms based on stochastic games, these cannot cope with a high number of agents due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of joint actions. One possible way to reduce the complexity of the problem is to have agents organized in groups of limited size so that the number of joint actions is reduced. These groups are then coordinated by another agent, a tutor or supervisor. Thus, this paper investigates the task of multiagent reinforcement learning for control of traffic signals in two situations: agents act individually (individual learners) and agents can be \"tutored\", meaning that another agent with a broader sight will recommend a joint action.
