Reliable PLC systems are vital to many critical applications. The reliability analysis of PLC is special because the hardware component and embedded software are combined and operated in a specific manner. This paper presents a probabilistic modeling for PLC systems, which considers both the hardware and software components. Three analysis strategies are proposed for probabilistic evaluation of reliability characterization. The first method is an input-based analysis which considers the impact of errors from primary inputs. The second one is an action-based analysis. It extends the first method by considering the impact of software-based processing deviations on primary inputs. The third method is an action-traverse analysis. It computes the reliability characterization in a single topological traverse through the primary inputs during the software execution. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches when compared to fault tree analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
