Two different but related constructions of MWBE codebooks from difference sets were developed by Xia et al. and Ding recently. The objectives of this correspondence are to present a generic construction of MWBE codebooks that contains the previous two constructions as special cases and describe new MWBE codebooks that cannot be produced by the earlier two constructions.", "paper_title": "A generic construction of complex codebooks meeting the welch bound", "paper_id": "WOS:000250448800028"}
