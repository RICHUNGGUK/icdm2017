At its core lies a self-referential recursive process with alternating phases of data acquisition and evaluation. Memory entries are organized in schemata. The activation at a time of part of a schema biases the whole structure and, in particular, missing features, thus triggering expectations. An iterative recursive monitor process termed 'consumption analysis' is then checking how well such expectations fit with successive activations. Mismatches between anticipations based on previous experience and actual current data are highlighted and used for controlling the allocation of attention. A measure for the goodness of fit provides feedback as (self-) monitoring signal. The basic algorithm works for goal directed movements and memory search as well as during abstract reasoning. It is sketched how the Ouroboros Model can shed light on characteristics of human behavior including attention, emotions, priming, masking, learning, sleep and consciousness.", "paper_title": "The Ouroboros Model, Selected Facets", "paper_id": "WOS:000293603200019"}
