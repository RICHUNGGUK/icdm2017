However, the potential financial performances have not been sufficiently considered at the selection stage of fund recipient SMEs whereas the default risk has been a major concern. This article proposes a Case Based Reasoning (CBR) system with Genetic Algorithm (GA) for predicting the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) of multiperiod financial performances of technology-oriented SMEs. It is expected that the proposed model can be applied to a wide range of technology investment-related decision-making procedures.", "paper_title": "Case-based reasoning for predicting multiperiod financial performances of technology-based SMEs", "paper_id": "WOS:000258005000005"}
