We study forecasting of stochastic, dynamic systems based on observations from multivariate time series. We model the domain as a dynamic multiply sectioned Bayesian network (DMSBN) and populate the domain by a set of proprietary, cooperative agents. We propose an algorithm suite that allows the agents to perform one-step forecasts with distributed probabilistic inference. We show that as long as the DMSBN is structural time-invariant (possibly parametric time-variant), the forecast is exact and its time complexity is exponentially more efficient than using dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). in comparison with independent DBN-based agents, multiagent DMSBNs produce more accurate forecasts. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through experiments on a supply chain testbed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
