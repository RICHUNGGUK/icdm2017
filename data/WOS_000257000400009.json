However, this proxy certificate has two drawbacks: the potential security threat caused by non-traceability of a delegation chain and the inefficiency caused by an interactive communication between the right grantor and the right grantee on the delegation protocol. To address these problems, a new delegation protocol is presented. The proposed protocol employs an ID-based key generation technique to support delegation traceability and non-interactive delegation. Since access-right delegation occurs frequently in the computational grid environment, the proposed protocol can enhance security by providing delegation traceability and can enhance efficiency by reducing the inter-domain communication cost.
