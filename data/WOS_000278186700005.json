This paper presents a fast randomized algorithm to solve the same problem. With similar memory requirement and accuracy, the computational complexity analysis and comparison show that our proposed algorithm performs much better in terms of efficiency. We have tested our algorithm on 13 real images. Experimental results indicated that our algorithm has 38% execution-time improvement over Cauchie et al.'s algorithm. The extension of the proposed algorithm to detect multiple centers is also addressed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
