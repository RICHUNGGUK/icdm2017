Typical analytical studies on the power saving operations in wireless networks have been carried out under the assumption that an expectation of exponentially distributed packet arrival intervals stays unchanged. However, practical packet arrival rate may change depending on time or typical Internet services may incur bursty packet arrivals. In either case, we need to evaluate the performance of the DRX operation. For this purpose, we develop a more realistic traffic arrival model considering packets may arrive in a bursty manner under the DRX operation. We, then, analyze the performance of the DRX operation in terms of power saving efficiency and average queuing delay, respectively. The analytical results are validated via comparisons with simulation results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
