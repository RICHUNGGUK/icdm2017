The control scheme is based on a control design procedure that constructs static feedback regulators for nonlinear systems which are linearizable by dynamic feedback. Besides, the flatness characteristics of the helicopter's longitudinal dynamics are used to design the desired trajectory. The controller proposed is based on the longitudinal model of the small scale helicopter including the main rotor and stabilizer bar dynamics. Sufficient conditions are given to guarantee asymptotic convergence to zero of the tracking error and to keep the main rotor thrust always negative assuming that all the helicopter's parameters are known and that all helicopter's states are measured. Numerical simulations are given to show the performance of the controller in the presence of the main rotor and stabilizer bar dynamics.", "paper_title": "A New Nonlinear Controller for Trajectory Tracking of the Longitudinal Dynamics of a Small Scale Helicopter", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400008"}
