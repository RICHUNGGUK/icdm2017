This paper investigates the performance improvement under this bad situation by BS cooperation (BSC) in the downlink scenario using multiantenna transmission assuming the perfect channel state information (CSI), and compares the effectiveness of several strategies based on a three cell model. Through computer simulations, the performance improvement by BSC is verified. Then the result is extended to multiple stream transmission utilizing the feature of multiantenna, and advantage of BSC with data sharing is shown.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Base Station Cooperation in Multiantenna Cellular System", "paper_id": "WOS:000296673300024"}
