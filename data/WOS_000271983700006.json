Signals were acquired from nine healthy subjects during four imaginary isometric plantar-flexions of the right foot involving two RTDs (ballistic and moderate) and two TTs (30 and 60% of the maximal voluntary contraction torque), each repeated 60 times in random order. The single-trial EEG traces were classified with a pattern recognition approach based on wavelet coefficients as features and support vector machine (SVM) as classifier. Average misclassification rates were (mean +/- A SD) 16 +/- A 9% and 26 +/- A 13% for discrimination of the two TTs under ballistic and moderate RTDs, respectively. RTDs could be discriminated with misclassification rates of 16 +/- A 11% and 19 +/- A 10% under high and low TT, respectively. These results indicate that differences in both TT and RTD can be detected from single-trial EEG traces during imaginary tasks.", "paper_title": "Identification of task parameters from movement-related cortical potentials", "paper_id": "WOS:000271983700006"}
