Thus, any expression consisting of repetitions of u and theta(u) can be considered in some sense periodic. In this paper, we give a generalization of Lyndon and Schutzenberger's classical result about equations of the form u(l) = V(n)W(m) to cases where both sides involve repetitions of words as well as their complements. Our main results show that, for such extended equations, if l >= 5, n, m >= 3, then all three words involved can be expressed in terms of a common word t and its complement theta(t). Moreover, if l >= 5, then n = m = 3 is an optimal bound. These results are established based on a complete characterization of all possible overlaps between two expressions that involve only some word u and its complement theta(u), which is also obtained in this paper.
