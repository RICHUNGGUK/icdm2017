However, video search and management operations are typically supported by manual textual annotations, which are subjective and laborious. Therefore, research has been conducted to automate or semi-automate this process. Since a diverse vocabulary for video annotations is of paramount importance towards good search results, this article proposes to leverage crowdsourced data from social multimedia applications that host tags of diverse semantics to build a spatio-temporal tag repository, consequently acting as input to our auto-annotation approach. In particular, to build the tag store, we retrieve the necessary data from several social multimedia applications, mine both the spatial and temporal features of the tags, and then refine and index them accordingly. To better integrate the tag repository, we extend our previous approach by leveraging the temporal characteristics of videos as well. Moreover, we set up additional ranking criteria on the basis of tag similarity, popularity and location bias. Experimental results demonstrate that, by making use of such a tag repository, the generated tags have a wide range of semantics, and the resulting rankings are more consistent with human perception.", "paper_title": "Spatial-Temporal Tag Mining for Automatic Geospatial Video Annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000348308800006"}
