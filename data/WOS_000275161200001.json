Although numerical and theoretical studies suggest that group cuts can be significantly improved by considering higher-dimensional groups, there are no known facets for infinite group problems whose dimension is larger than two. In this paper, we introduce an operation that we call sequential-merge. We prove that the sequential-merge operator creates a very large family of facet-defining inequalities for high-dimensional infinite group problems using facet-defining inequalities of lower-dimensional group problems. Further, they exhibit two properties that reflect the benefits of using facets of high-dimensional group problems: they have continuous variables' coefficients that are not dominated by those of the constituent low-dimensional cuts and they can produce cutting planes that do not belong to the first split closure of MIPs. Further, we introduce a general scheme for generating valid inequalities for lower-dimensional group problems using valid inequalities of higher-dimensional group problems. We present conditions under which this construction generates facet-defining inequalities when applied to sequential-merge inequalities. We show that this procedure yields some two-step MIR inequalities of Dash and Gunluk.", "paper_title": "Relations between facets of low- and high-dimensional group problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000275161200001"}
