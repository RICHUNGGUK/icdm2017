With edge information, we propose a novel fast estimation algorithm to reduce the computation overhead of H.264/AVC for mode selection, where the edge direction of each coding block is detected from only part of the transformed coefficients. Hence, the computation complexity is greatly reduced. Experimental results show that the proposed fast mode decision method can eliminate about 81.34% encoding time for all intra-frame sequences with acceptable degradation of averaged PSNR and bitrates.", "paper_title": "Transformed-domain mode selection for h.264 intra-prediction improvement", "paper_id": "WOS:000254606100053"}
