Recent studies have shown that the most commonly used partition-based clustering algorithm, the K-means algorithm, is more suitable for large datasets. However, the K-means algorithm can generate a local optimal solution. In this paper we propose a novel Harmony K-means Algorithm (HKA) that deals with document clustering based on Harmony Search (HS) optimization method. It is proved by means of finite Markov chain theory that the HKA converges to the global optimum. To demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of HKA, we have applied HKA algorithms on some standard datasets. We also compare the HKA with other meta-heuristic and model-based document clustering approaches. Experimental results reveal that the HKA algorithm converges to the best known optimum faster than other methods and the quality of clusters are comparable.", "paper_title": "Harmony K-means algorithm for document clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000265081200002"}
