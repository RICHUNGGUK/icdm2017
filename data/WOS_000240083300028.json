In addition, an exponential transfer function (exp (-D)) is employed to transfer the distance of any two factors into the value of similarity among different rules, thus a different rule clustering method is developed accordingly. The intensive experimental results show that the WEFuNN performs very well when applied in the PCB sales forecasting.", "paper_title": "The development of a weighted evolving fuzzy neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300028"}
