They allow us to analyze the sequences and functions of different genes simultaneously and detect small differences in those. They are source of tremendous amount of data in the field of Bioinformatics. Moreover, the engineering process of DNA chip requires the latest results of information technology, too. In this paper, we address the mathematical problem of the prediction the hybridization process on the chip surface. A novel in situ in silico approach is presented and the obtained results are discussed.", "paper_title": "A novel mathematical model for the optimization of DNA-chip design and its implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900003"}
