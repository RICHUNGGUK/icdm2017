The computer vision system consisted of a digital camera, illumination, computer hardware and software was developed to capture and process the images. Variations in area, perimeter, major and minor diameters, diameters parallel and perpendicular to airflow, Feret diameter, roundness were measured in intervals during drying. All morphological features decreased smoothly with drying time. Shrinkage of the potato slices decreased almost linearly with moisture content. Results showed that airflow direction had significant effect on parallel and perpendicular diameters in 60 and 70 degrees C and had no significant effect when temperature was 80 degrees C. Drying time decreased with increasing air temperature. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
