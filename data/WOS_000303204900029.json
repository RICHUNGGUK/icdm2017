For this class of random graphs, we establish a new version of a conjectured zero-one law for graph connectivity as the number of nodes becomes unboundedly large. The results reported here complement and strengthen recent work on this conjecture by Blackburn and Gerke. In particular, the results are given under conditions which are more realistic for applications to WSNs.", "paper_title": "Zero-One Laws for Connectivity in Random Key Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000303204900029"}
