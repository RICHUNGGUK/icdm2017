The proposed OTA is designed under low power supply voltage consideration while its gain, excess phase, and linearity are well maintained. The common-mode control system, including common-mode feedback and common-mode feedforward circuits, is added to ensure stability of the proposed filter. Measurement results show that the inter-modulation distortion of -40 dB can be achieved with 250 MHz 400 mV(pp) differential input signals. The filter works in 1 - V supply voltage and its power consumption is 32 mW.", "paper_title": "A 250 MHz low voltage low-pass G(m)-C filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000304101200012"}
