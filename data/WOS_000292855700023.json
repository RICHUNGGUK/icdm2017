In this paper, we enumerate the number of RNA structures for a special case, in which any arbitrary number of base pairs are allowed in the given RNA sequence. The only criteria considered in our model, is the minimum length condition for hairpin loops, assumed to be 1. The asymptotic behavior and its relation with the number of involutions are presented from the analytical and combinatorial points of view.", "paper_title": "Enumerating RNA Structures, Including Pseudoknots of any Topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000292855700023"}
