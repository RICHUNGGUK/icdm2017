The first experiments using a recognition system trained for Broadcast News resulted in word error rates near 60%, clearly. confirming the need for adaptation to the specific topic of the lectures, on one hand, and for better strategies for handling spontaneous speech. This paper describes the different domain adaptation steps that lowered the error rate to 45%, with very little transcribed adaptation material. It also includes a qualitative analysis of the different types of error, focusing on the ones related to a very high rate of disfluencies.", "paper_title": "Classroom lecture recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800020"}
