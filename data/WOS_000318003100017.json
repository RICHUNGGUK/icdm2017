By introducing the proper data-driven weights to the penalty terms, the partly adaptive elastic net is proposed, which can encourage an adaptive grouping effect and reduce the influence of the wrong initial estimation. A fast-solving algorithm is also developed in the line of pathwise coordinate descent. Experiments performed on the two cancer data sets are provided to verify the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Partly adaptive elastic net and its application to microarray classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000318003100017"}
