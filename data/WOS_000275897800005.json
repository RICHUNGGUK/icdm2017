We first search for feature points in the neighborhood of the hole. These feature points allow us to define the feature curves with missing parts in the hole. A polynomial blending curve is constructed to complete the missing parts of the feature curves. These feature curves divide the original complex hole into small simple sub-holes. We use the Bezier-Lagrange hybrid patch to fill each sub-hole. The experimental results show that our mesh hole-filling algorithm can effectively restore the original shape of the hole.
