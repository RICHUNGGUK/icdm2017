Most existing research has predominantly focused on the learning of a universal aesthetic model based on hand-crafted visual descriptors. However, this research paradigm can achieve only limited success because 1) such hand-crafted descriptors cannot well preserve abstract aesthetic properties, and 2) such a universal model cannot always capture the full diversity of visual content. To address these challenges, we propose in this paper a novel query-dependent aesthetic model with deep learning for photo quality assessment. In our method, deep aesthetic abstractions are discovered from massive images, whereas the aesthetic assessment model is learned in a query-dependent manner. Our work addresses the first problem by learning mid-level aesthetic feature abstractions via powerful deep convolutional neural networks to automatically capture the underlying aesthetic characteristics of the massive training images. Regarding the second problem, because photographers tend to employ different rules of photography for capturing different images, the aesthetic model should also be query-dependent. Specifically, given an image to be assessed, we first identify which aesthetic model should be applied for this particular image. Then, we build a unique aesthetic model of this type to assess its aesthetic quality. We conducted extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets and demonstrated that the proposed query-dependent model equipped with learned deep aesthetic abstractions significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hand-crafted feature-based and universal model-based methods.", "paper_title": "Query-Dependent Aesthetic Model With Deep Learning for Photo Quality Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000364102400016"}
