This is because the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices can provide contextual information and allow users to demonstrate preferences. This study proposes a targeted mobile advertising system (TMAS) that works as a platform to provide both merchants and consumers with context-aware advertisements. The approach integrates the advantages of both mobile and targeted advertising to allow merchants to disseminate location-based targeted advertisements while providing pull-type and personalized advertisements for consumers. To demonstrate the TMAS, we build a platform to provide highly relevant advertising to consumers and to guarantee that advertisements have an equal opportunity of being presented to consumers.
