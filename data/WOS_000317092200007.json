With numerical simulations, we prove (1) Walter J. Freeman's conjecture that the response of cortex dynamics cannot code external stimulation information; (2) the possession of rhythm coding in the neural coding of serial neural networks; (3) the importance of neural inhibition in the regulation of the central nervous system.
