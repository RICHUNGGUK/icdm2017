(Thus Z((1))(2) is precisely Z(2).) Let p(c)(omega) be the critical probability for site percolation on Z((omega))(2) Extending recent results of Frieze, Kleinberg, Ravi and Debany, we show that lim(omega ->infinity) omega p(c)(omega) = log(3/2). We also prove analogues of this result for the n-by-n grid and in higher dimensions, the latter involving interesting connections to Gilbert's continuum percolation model. To prove our results, we explore the component of the origin in a certain non-standard way, and show that this exploration is well approximated by a certain branching random walk.", "paper_title": "Line-of-Sight Percolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000265047400005"}
