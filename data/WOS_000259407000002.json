If the stochastic signal with the additive fractional Brownian motion occurs multiplied by a scalar parameter, then the rate of change of the mutual information with respect to this parameter is described by the error of another related estimation problem. These results generalize some results for a model where the fractional Brownian motion is a Brownian motion to a model with an arbitrary fractional Brownian motion.", "paper_title": "Mutual information for stochastic signals and fractional Brownian motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000259407000002"}
