It provides a theoretical result bounding the expected memory cost by T+CNlogN where T is the time horizon, N is the number of particles and C is a constant, as well as an efficient algorithm to realise this. The theoretical result and the algorithm are illustrated with numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Path storage in the particle filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000349551100022"}
