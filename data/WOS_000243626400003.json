We prove that this problem can be solved by a deterministic algorithm in time 2.695(n) (up to polynomial factors) and in polynomial space. This result improves the previous bound of 2.8805(n), which is due to Bjorklund and Husfeldt. To prove our result, we combine an algorithm by Fomin et al. with Yamamoto's algorithm for the satisfiability problem. In addition, we show that the 3-domatic number problem can be solved for graphs G with bounded maximum degree Delta (G) by a randomized polynomial-space algorithm, whose running time is better than the previous bound due to Riege and Rothe whenever Delta (G) >= 5. Our new randomized algorithm employs Schoning's approach to constraint satisfaction problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
