The market-based environment in a democratized Grid context poses new requirements concerning the functionality of a semantic information system. In this context, the paper motivates the development of the Grid4All Semantic Information System (G4A-SIS) and presents the design and the technologies used for the realization of this system. G4A-SIS is deployed as a web service using a Java API which defines the functionality of the system and abstracts low-level ontology implementation details, providing to the clients an interface for registering and querying semantically annotated market and application-specific services. In addition to the \"ontology-centred\" mechanisms provided for matchmaking and semi-automatic annotation of web services, the system provides a ranking mechanism to support the selection of markets and services that, in contrast to baseline ranking approaches, is based on agents' preferences and satisfaction as well as on the workload. The paper accentuates specific advantages of using the G4A-SIS service: support for highly complex queries, multi-attributed and continuous queries. Finally, the paper provides experimental results of G4A-SIS efficiency, showing the strengths and limitations of deploying this system in a real setting. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
