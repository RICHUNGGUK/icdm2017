The travel cost on an arc is proportional to the travel time via the arc and changes over time. This study proposes an iterated greedy (IG) heuristic for the TD-PARP. Computational study on 41 benchmark problems indicates that the proposed IG heuristic outperforms existing approaches. The proposed IG heuristic obtains the best solutions to most of the benchmark problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
