In this paper, a simple bifurcated micro-channel is used to sort the particles with different rigidities. The behavior of a compliant particle inside the channel is investigated numerically. The fluid flow and the particle's deformation are solved by Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and Lattice Spring Model (LSM), respectively. The fluid and solid solvers are coupled through interpolated bounce-back scheme. Two benchmark problems are used to validate our method. One is the motion of a compliant capsule in a channel and the other is the deformation of a capsule inside a simple shear flow. The results are quantitatively consistent with those in literature. By taking advantage of the rotating of capsules in shear flow, a simple distinguished bifurcated micro-channel is proposed to sort capsules with different rigidities. In this micro-channel, the initial offset and shear stress induce the rotating and lateral migration of the capsule and flux ratio is determined by the outlet pressures. The competition between the effect of initial offset and flux ratio contributes to the sorting mechanism. Compared-to other micro-channels with,different geometrical models, present one is more convenient and may be more efficient to screen the microcapsule we want. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
