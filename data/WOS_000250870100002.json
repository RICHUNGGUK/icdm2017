Given a graph and a tree that spans it, the algorithm is required to check whether this tree is an MST. This paper investigates the problem in the distributed setting, where the input is given in a distributed manner, i.e., every node \"knows\" which of its own emanating edges belong to the tree. Informally, the distributed MST verification problem is the following. Label the vertices of the graph in such a way that for every node, given (its own state and label and) the labels of its neighbors only, the node can detect whether these edges are indeed its MST edges. In this paper, we present such a verification scheme with a maximum label size of 0 (log n log W), where n is the number of nodes and W is the largest weight of an edge. We also give a matching lower bound of ohm (log n log W) (as long as W > (log n) (1+is an element of) for some fixed is an element of > 0). Both our bounds improve previously known bounds for the problem. For the related problem of tree sensitivity also presented by Tarjan, our method yields rather efficient schemes for both the distributed and the sequential settings.", "paper_title": "Distributed verification of minimum spanning trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000250870100002"}
