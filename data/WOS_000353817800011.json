The proposed low noise amplifier consists of a positive transformer feedback to achieve noise-reduction and a negative transformer feedback to obtain high reverse isolation and stability. The noise cancellation technique is applied in this LNA to achieve a low noise figure. This LNA has been fabricated by standard commercial 90 nm CMOS. According to measurements, this proposed LNA achieves a peak gain of 11.5 dB, a noise figure of 6.5 dB and an input P-1dB of -12 dBm. It consumes 11.5 mA from a 1.2 V supply occupying the area of 0.6x0.7 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A Q-band CMOS LNA exploiting transformer feedback and noise-cancelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000353817800011"}
