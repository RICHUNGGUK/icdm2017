Smarandache generalized the Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets and other kinds of sets to neutrosophic sets (NSs). Also, this author introduced a general definition of neutrosophic topology. On the other hand, there exist various kinds of paraconsistent logics, where some contradiction is admissible. The purpose of this paper is to show that a Smarandache's definition of neutrosophic paraconsistent topology is not a generalization of coker's intuitionistic fuzzy topology (IFT) or Smarandache's general neutrosophic topology. Design/methodology/approach - The possible relations between the IFT and the neutrosophic paraconsistent topology are studied. Findings - Relations on IFT and neutrosophic paraconsistent topology are shown. Research limitations/implications - Clearly, the paper is confined to IFSs and NSs. Practical implications - The main applications are in the mathematical field. Originality/value - The paper shows original results on fuzzy sets and topology.", "paper_title": "On neutrosophic paraconsistent topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000279227800009"}
