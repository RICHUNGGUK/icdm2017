In this paper we consider a simple extension with natural numbers and a restricted iterator: only closed linear functions can be iterated. We show properties of this linear version of Godel's T using a closed reduction strategy, and study the class of functions that can be represented. Surprisingly, this linear calculus offers a huge increase in expressive power over previous linear versions of T, which are 'closed at construction' rather than 'closed at reduction'. We show that a linear T with closed reduction is as powerful as T. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Godel's system T revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000275624900006"}
