In order to build the SM, we propose two new field of view (FOV) pixellation schemes, based on a polar coordinate system (polar grid) by taking advantage of the polar rotation symmetries of CT devices. Comparisons between the SMs proposed are performed using two phantom and a real CT-simulator images. Global error, contrast, noise and homogeneity of the reconstructed images are discussed.
