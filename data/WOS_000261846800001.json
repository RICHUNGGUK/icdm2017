When processing a handwritten script, a great deal of ambiguity occurs when strokes overlap, merge, or intersect. This paper presents a novel loop modeling and contour-based handwriting analysis that improves loop investigation. We show excellent results on various loop resolution scenarios, including axial loop understanding and collapsed loop recovery. We demonstrate our approach for loop investigation on several realistic data sets of static binary images and compare with the ground truth of the genuine online signal.", "paper_title": "Offline Loop Investigation for Handwriting Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000261846800001"}
