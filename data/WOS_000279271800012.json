In the local regularization part, our algorithm constructs a regularized classifier for each data point using its neighborhood, while the global regularization part adopts a Laplacian regularizer to smooth the data labels predicted by those local classifiers. We show that such a learning framework can easily be incorporated into either unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and supervised learning paradigm. Moreover, many existing learning algorithms can be derived from our framework. Finally we present some experimental results to show the effectiveness of our method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
