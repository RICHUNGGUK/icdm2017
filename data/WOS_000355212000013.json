This proposed converter can reduce output voltage ripple, because its inductor is connected to the output. This proposed converter adopts a new controlled architecture, self-adaptive slope generator with hysteresis comparison technology, to shorten the transient response. The proposed boost converter has been fabricated with TSMC 0.35-mu m CMOS 2P4M processes, and a total chip area of 1.49 mm x 1.49 mm. Its maximum output current is 260 mA when the output voltage is 3.6 V. When the supply voltage is 3.3 V, the output voltage can be 3.6-5.1 V. The maximum efficiency is 90.99% and the minimum output ripple is 10.8 mV. Finally, the theoretical analysis is verified to be correct by the experimental results.", "paper_title": "A New Efficiency-Improvement Low-Ripple Charge-Pump Boost Converter Using Adaptive Slope Generator With Hysteresis Voltage Comparison Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000355212000013"}
