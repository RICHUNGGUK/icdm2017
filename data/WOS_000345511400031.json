When both bases are orthogonal, it is known that the sparse representation is unique when the sparsity K of the signal satisfies K < 1/mu(D), where mu(D) is the mutual coherence of the dictionary. Furthermore, the sparse representation can be obtained in polynomial time by basis pursuit (BP), when K < 0.91/mu(D). Therefore, there is a gap between the unicity condition and the one required to use the polynomial-complexity BP formulation. For the case of general dictionaries, it is also well known that finding the sparse representation under the only constraint of unicity is NP-hard. In this paper, we introduce, for the case of Fourier and canonical bases, a polynomial complexity algorithm that finds all the possible K-sparse representations of a signal under the weaker condition that K < root 2/mu(D). Consequently, when K < 1/mu(D), the proposed algorithm solves the unique sparse representation problem for this structured dictionary in polynomial time. We further show that the same method can be extended to many other pairs of bases, one of which must have local atoms. Examples include the union of Fourier and local Fourier bases, the union of discrete cosine transform and canonical bases, and the union of random Gaussian and canonical bases.", "paper_title": "On Sparse Representation in Fourier and Local Bases", "paper_id": "WOS:000345511400031"}
