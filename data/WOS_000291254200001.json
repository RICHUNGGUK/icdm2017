Although it allows for the modeling of complex cooperation among many processes in a natural environment, not many tools have been developed to support the modeling capability in this regard. In this article, we first give examples to argue that special algorithms are needed for the efficient verification of systems with complex synchronizations. We then define our models of distributed real-time systems with synchronized cooperation among many processes. We present algorithms for the construction of BDD-like diagrams for the characterization of complex synchronizations among many processes. We present weakest precondition algorithms that take advantage of the just-mentioned BDD-like diagrams for the efficient verification of complex real-time systems. Finally, we report experiments and argue that the techniques could be useful in practice.", "paper_title": "Efficient verification of distributed real-time systems with broadcasting behaviors", "paper_id": "WOS:000291254200001"}
