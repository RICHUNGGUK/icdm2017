The most used approaches for cluster validation are based on internal cluster validity indices. Although many indices have been proposed, there is no recent extensive comparative study of their performance. In this paper we show the results of an experimental work that compares 30 cluster validity indices in many different environments with different characteristics. These results can serve as a guideline for selecting the most suitable index for each possible application and provide a deep insight into the performance differences between the currently available indices.
