We prove that h(G) <= h(c)(G) <= gamma(c)(G) <= h(G) + 1, where h(G), h(c)(G), and gamma(c)(G), respectively, are the minimum sizes of a hub set in G, a hub set inducing a connected subgraph, and a connected dominating set. Furthermore, all graphs with gamma(c)(G) > h(c)(G) >= 4 are obtained by substituting graphs into three consecutive vertices of a cycle; this yields a polynomial-time algorithm to check whether h(c) (G) = gamma(c) (G).
