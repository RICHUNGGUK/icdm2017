IPC techniques can be used to convey a large amount of information about a multidimensional dataset in a small area of the screen through the following approaches: (a) edge-bundling through splines; (b) visualization of \"branched\" clusters to reveal the distribution of the data; (c) opacity-based hints to show cluster density; (d) opacity and shading effects to illustrate local line density on the parallel axes; and (e) silhouettes, shadows and halos to help the eye distinguish between overlapping clusters. Thus, the primary goal of this work is to convey as much information as possible in a manner that is aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand for non-experts.", "paper_title": "Illustrative parallel coordinates", "paper_id": "WOS:000257075000041"}
