Three-dimensional finite element analyses are presented for piles of different geometries, installed at several distances from slopes of various inclinations. The results of these analyses are used to establish the pattern of lateral load distribution along the pile length in relation to slope inclination and pile to slope distance. Subsequently, p-y curves are developed for the case of undrained lateral loading of piles near the crest of clay slopes, a case for which no such curves exist so far. The proposed p-y curves are implemented into a commercial subgrade reaction computer code and used to perform a series of parametric numerical analyses. The results of these analyses show that the predicted response of piles near slopes with the proposed p-y curves is in good agreement with the response observed in some pile tests reported in the literature.
