We generated a force constituting a contrasting moment by pulling a wire using a dc motor. We also developed a control system, which included a motor controller, an interface, and a control software. We evaluated the performance of our interface by conducting a simple task experiment. To execute one task, the control data for each joint jaw must be prepared, and we used force control data generated by a rectified and filtered electromyogram (EMG) curve. From the force representation experiments, it was determined that a force curve based on the EMG data could be used for a haptic interface, and we confirmed that a suitable force curve could be obtained for each subject.", "paper_title": "Development of a Wearable Exoskeleton Haptic Interface Device", "paper_id": "WOS:000261210300010"}
