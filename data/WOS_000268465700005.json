This disproves a claim in (Balas and Oosten 36 (2000), 34-46) that the only such facets are those defined by the linear ordering inequalities. After examining the relationship between the cycle polytope, its dominant, and the upper cycle polyhedron, we turn to the polar relationship between cycles and permutations or transitive tournaments. Our central result is a characterization of the relationship between facets of the dominant of the cycle polytope, facets of the cycle polytope that cut off the origin, and vertices of the linear relaxation of the transitive tournament polytope.
