This approach leads to scale spaces, which in the continuous formulation are the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work we derive properties for a class of inverse scale space methods. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a proof that the methods considered are convergent for convex regularization operators. The proof is based on energy methods and the Bregman distance. Further, estimates for convergence toward a clean image with noisy forcing data is provided in terms of both the L (2) norm and Bregman distances. This leads to natural estimates of optimal stopping scale for the inverse scale space method. These analytical results are discussed in the context of a numerical example.", "paper_title": "Inverse scale spaces for nonlinear regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000243465400003"}
