The topological model is extracted from a grid map using cell decomposition and normalized graph cut. The autonomous topological modeling involves the incremental extraction of a subregion without predefining the number of subregions. A method of topological localization based on this topological model is proposed wherein a current local grid map is compared with the original grid map. The localization is accomplished by obtaining a node probability from a relative motion model and rotational invariant grid-map matching. The proposed method extracts a well-structured topological model of the environment, and the localization provides reliable node probability even when presented with sparse and uncertain sonar data. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed topological modeling and localization in a real home environment.", "paper_title": "Autonomous topological modeling of a home environment and topological localization using a sonar grid map", "paper_id": "WOS:000289105400001"}
