Thus, techniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also that number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of these techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD analyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users is constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of users entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly pessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and detection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one may impair performance. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem of identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a random-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the system. The tool whose use we advocate is Random-Set Theory (RST): applying this, we derive optimum receivers in an environment where the set of transmitters comprises an unknown number of elements. In addition, we can derive Bayesian-filter equations which describe the evolution with ti me of the a posteriori probability (APP) density of the unknown user parameters, and use this density to derive optimum detectors. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to interferer identi- fication and data detection, while in a companion paper we shall examine the more complex problem of estimating users' parameters.", "paper_title": "Multiuser detection in a dynamic environment - Part 1: User identification and data detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000249025100013"}
