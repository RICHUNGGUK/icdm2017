In the proposed algorithm, the required duty cycle is calculated directly by two parallel terms. With some simple operations in digital implementation, the resultant control system achieves rapid and precise output voltage regulation under the input voltage and output load change. Moreover, the implementation of the proposed algorithm with a digital controller is discussed in detail. Analysis shows that the parallel current-mode control does not exhibit subharmonic oscillation. A 400-kHz switching frequency buck converter based on field-programmable gate array implementation is built to verify the feasibility and advantages of the parallel current-mode control.", "paper_title": "A Digital Parallel Current-Mode Control Algorithm for DC-DC Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000344995800017"}
