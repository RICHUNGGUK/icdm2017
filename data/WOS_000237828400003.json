Voloshin, On the upper chromatic number of a hypergraph, Australas. J. Combin. 11 (1995) 25-45], Voloshin proposed the following generalization of the Helly property. Let p >= 1, q >= 0 and s >= 0. A hypergraph H is (p, q)-intersecting when every partial hypergraph H' subset of H formed by p or less hyperedges has intersection of cardinality at least q. A hypergraph H is (p, q, s)-Helly when every partial (p, q)-intersecting hypergraph H' subset of H has intersection of cardinality, at least s. In this work, we study the complexity of determining whether H is (p, q, s)-Helly. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
