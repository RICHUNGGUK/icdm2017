Traffic modeling has had a very large impact on network simulation reliability, which is usually statistically described for simulation purposes. Most often, the network traffic analysis is based on the captured packets. However, modeling of network traffic is usually described by statistics of data sources, from higher layers of a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model. For these reasons, we have developed a method that allows distribution parameter estimation of the data-source process from captured packets. This method is based on the algorithm, which mimics defragmentation as opposite to the TCP/IP fragmentation and encapsulation processes. The proposed method achieves an accurate description of network traffic.", "paper_title": "Modeling of captured network traffic by the mimic defragmentation process", "paper_id": "WOS:000289279100005"}
