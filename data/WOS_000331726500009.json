In this paper, a new key management scheme is proposed to facilitate control by providing two functionalities. First, a patient can authorize more than one healthcare institute within a designated time period to access his or her ePHIs. Second, a patient can revoke authorization and add new authorized institutes at any time as necessary. In the design, it is not required to re-encrypt ePHIs for adding and revoking authorizations, and the implementation is time- and cost-efficient. Consent exception is also considered by the proposed scheme. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
