Specifically, the face is modeled by the discriminative common vector and the discrete wavelet transform. Our lip features are simple geometric features based on a lip contour, which can be interpreted as multiple spatial widths and heights from a center of mass. In order to combine these features, we consider two simple fusion strategies: data fusion before training and score fusion after training, working with two different face databases. Fusing them together boosts the performance to achieve an equal error rate as low as 0.4% and 0.28%, respectively, confirming that our approach of fusing lips and face is effective and promising.
