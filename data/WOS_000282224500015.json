The emphasis in this study is put on circuit robustness and applicability to industrial applications, which requires sufficient EMI rejection over all process corners. Furthermore, a new topology based on a replica amplifier is introduced, that is more robust to process variation compared to previous works (Jean-Michel Redout, and Michiel Steyaert, ESSCIRC, Sept. 2008; Fiori, IEEE Transac Electromag Compat 49(4):834-839, 2007) that rely on accurate matching of absolute values in order to achieve efficient EMI cancellation.", "paper_title": "Comparison of high impedance input topologies with low EMI susceptibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000282224500015"}
