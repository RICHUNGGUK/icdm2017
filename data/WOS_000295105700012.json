The two models are compared in terms of approximation rates, i.e., speeds of decrease of approximation errors for a growing number n of basis functions. Proofs of upper bounds on approximation rates by dictionary-based models are inspected, to show that for individual functions they do not imply estimates for dictionary-based models that do not hold also for some linear models. Instead, the possibility of getting faster approximation rates by dictionary-based models is demonstrated for worst-case errors in approximation of suitable sets of functions. For such sets, even geometric upper bounds hold. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
