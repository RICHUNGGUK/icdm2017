We show that the optimal value of Pm parallel to WTV is identical to the optimal value of the problem for minimizing the completion time variance of jobs on identical parallel machines (Pm parallel to CTV). We prove that, given the same job set, any feasible schedule of Pm parallel to WTV can be transformed into the feasible solution for Pm parallel to CTV with the same job set by applying the polynomial algorithms proposed in this paper. Several other important properties of Pm parallel to WTV are also proved. Heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve Pm parallel to WTV problems. We present the testing results of these heuristic algorithms, which are applied to problems with both small and large job sets.", "paper_title": "Minimization of job waiting time variance on identical parallel machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000249023700016"}
