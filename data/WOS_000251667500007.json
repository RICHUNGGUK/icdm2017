In this paper we survey in a unified framework several methods to transform raster input images into good quality mosaics. For each of the major different approaches in literature the paper reports a short description and a discussion of the most relevant issues. To complete the survey comparisons among the different techniques both in terms of visual quality and computational complexity are provided.", "paper_title": "Digital mosaic frameworks - An overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000251667500007"}
