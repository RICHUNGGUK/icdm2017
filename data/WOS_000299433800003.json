Mesh refinement was accomplished via convergence of strain energy density (SED) predictions for each spinal tissue. The converged model was validated based on range of motion, intradiscal pressure, facet force transmission, anterolateral cortical bone strain and anterior longitudinal ligament deformation predictions. Changes in mesh resolution had the biggest impact on SED predictions under axial rotation loading. Nonlinearity of the moment-rotation curves was accurately simulated and the model predictions on the aforementioned parameters were in good agreement with experimental data. The validated and converged model will be utilised to study the effects of degeneration on the lumbar spine biomechanics, as well as to investigate the mechanical underpinning of the contemporary treatment strategies.", "paper_title": "Parametric convergence sensitivity and validation of a finite element model of the human lumbar spine", "paper_id": "WOS:000299433800003"}
