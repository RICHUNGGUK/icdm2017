In all stages, an isotropic LoG filter is first used to segment the handwriting image into word regions (WRs). Then, the SIFT descriptors (SDs) of WRs and the corresponding scales and orientations (SOs) are extracted. In the training stage, an SD codebook is constructed by clustering the SDs of training samples. In the enrollment stage, the SDs of the input handwriting are adopted to form an SD signature (SDS) by looking up the SD codebook and the SOs are utilized to generate a scale and orientation histogram (SOH). In the identification stage, the SDS and SOH of the input handwriting are extracted and matched with the enrolled ones for identification. Experimental results on six public data sets (including three English data sets, one Chinese data set, and two hybrid-language data sets) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Offline Text-Independent Writer Identification Based on Scale Invariant Feature Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000332459700017"}
