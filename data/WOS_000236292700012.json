It interprets image editing as a variational problem concerning the adaptive adjustments to the zero- and first-derivatives of the images which correspond to the color and gradient items. By varying the definition domain of each of the two items as well as applying diverse operators; the new model is capable of tackling a variety of image editing tasks. It achieves visually better seamless image cloning effects than existing approaches. It also induces a new and efficient solution to adjusting the color of an image interactively and locally. Other image editing tasks such as stylized processing, local illumination enhancement and image sharpening, can be accomplished within the unified variational framework. Experimental results verify the high flexibility and efficiency of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "A novel variational image model: Towards a unified approach to image editing", "paper_id": "WOS:000236292700012"}
