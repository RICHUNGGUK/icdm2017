An interpolation system takes a refutation and extracts an interpolant by building it inductively from partial interpolants. We survey color-based interpolation systems for ground proofs produced by key inference engines of state-of-the-art solvers: DPLL for propositional logic, equality sharing for combination of convex theories, and DPLL(J) for SMT-solving. Since color-based interpolation systems use colors to track symbols in proofs, equality is problematic, because replacement of equals by equals mixes symbols and therefore colors. We analyze interpolation in the presence of equality, and we demonstrate the color-based approach by giving a complete interpolation system for ground proofs by superposition.", "paper_title": "Interpolation Systems for Ground Proofs in Automated Deduction: a Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000354474100003"}
