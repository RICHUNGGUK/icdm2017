A CT scan was done on one patient who had mandibular continuity defects. This CT dataset in DICOM format was imported into Mimics 10.0 software in which a three-dimensional (3-D) model of the facial skeleton was reconstructed and the mandible was segmented out. With Geomagic Studio 11.0, one custom-made plate and nine virtual screws were designed. All parts of the reconstructed mandible were converted into NURBS and saved as IGES format for importing into pro/E 4.0. After Boolean operation and assembly, the model was switched to ANSYS Workbench 12.0. Finally, after applying the boundary conditions and material properties, an analysis was performed. As results, a 3-D FEA model was successfully developed using the softwares above. The stress-strain distribution precisely indicated biomechanical performance of the reconstructed mandible on the normal occlusion load, without stress concentrated areas. The Von-Mises stress in all parts of the model, from the maximum value of 50.9 MPa to the minimum value of 0.1 MPa, was lower than the ultimate tensile strength. In conclusion, the described strategy could speedily and successfully produce a biomechanical model of a reconstructed mandible with custom-made plate. Using this FEA foundation, the custom-made plate may be improved for an optimal clinical outcome. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
