Implemented in 0.18-mu m CMOS process, a time difference within 225 ps can be amplified 80x linearly under maximum frequency of 25 MHz. Measured maximum gain error is 4.1%. Measured output rms jitter is 84.5 ps under gain of 80x. The time amplifier consumes 1.7 mW under supply voltage of 1.8 V.", "paper_title": "An 80x Analog-Implemented Time-Difference Amplifier for Delay-Line-Based Coarse-Fine Time-to-Digital Converters in 0.18-mu m CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000358511300014"}
