A novel approach is proposed for the selection of best alternative action in the face of the imprecise probabilities and the complex attitudinal character of the decision makers (DMs). This approach is distinguished with its capacity to accommodate the linguistic specification of probabilities as provided by human experts directly without the need to determine the fuzzy membership grades. The focus is to compute the net payoff for each alternative in the face of uncertain states of nature and DM's attitude. The proposed operator and the approach are illustrated through two real case studies.", "paper_title": "A Probabilistic and Decision Attitude Aggregation Operator for Intuitionistic Fuzzy Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000320475300005"}
