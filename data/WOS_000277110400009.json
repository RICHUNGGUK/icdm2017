This article presents the findings of a yearlong study conducted in three Canadian provinces during the 2007-2008 school year initially involving 32 teachers and 388 students Due to varying levels of implementation our final data set included 14 teachers and 296 students Using a non-equivalent pre-test/post-test design, we found that grade 4-6 students who were in classrooms where the teacher provided regular and appropriate use of the electronic portfolio tool ePEARL e.. medium-high implementation condition, n = 7 classrooms and 121 students), compared to control students (n = 7 classrooms and 175 students) who did not use ePEARL, showed significant improvements (p < .05) in their writing skills on a standardized literacy measure (i.e., the constructed response subtest of the Canadian Achievement Test-4th ed) and certain metacognitive skills measured via student self-report The results of this study indicate that teaching with ePEARL has positive impacts on students' literacy and self-regulated learning skills when the tool is used regularly and Integrated into classroom instruction (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Improving literacy and metacognition with electronic portfolios: Teaching and learning with ePEARL", "paper_id": "WOS:000277110400009"}
