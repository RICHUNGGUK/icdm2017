Currently, the different planners work more or less separated in an asynchronous manner. To facilitate a collaborative planning process between these different stakeholders we developed a collaboration platform. Clearly, the integration of geographical information and geoprocessing results into the planning process and the different modelling tools will improve this process in a significant way. In this paper, we show how to describe the needed geographical information by so-called Geospatial Web Service Context Documents in a suitable way and how to integrate these pieces of information into the different planning tools via the collaboration platform in a unified, dynamic, and generic way.
