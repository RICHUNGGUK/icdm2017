It is shown that, in a marked contrast with the linear case, such a selection does not speed up the computation in the general case; directions for researches on more flexible methods to select projections are then discussed.", "paper_title": "On the selection of a transversal to solve nonlinear systems with interval arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200043"}
