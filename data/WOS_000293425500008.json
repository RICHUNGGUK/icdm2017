However, these variants by themselves cannot prevent network congestion. Congestion avoidance also relies on other mechanisms, such as Active Queue Management (AQM). This paper introduces a novel optimal AQM policy to operate in networks that adopt the High Speed TCP (HSTCP) variant as their transport protocol. The effectiveness of various optimal controllers is evaluated and the performance of the new policy is compared to that of Random Early Detection (RED) policy. Results, derived via simulation, reveal the advantages of adopting HSTCP-H2 in large bandwidth-delay product networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
