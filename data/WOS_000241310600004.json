The shortest path routing in FCCNs is an open problem. In this paper, we present an oblivious routing algorithm for n-level FCCN with N = 8(n) nodes, and prove that this algorithm creates a shortest path from the source to the destination. At the costs of both an O(N)-parallel-step off-line preprocessing phase and a list of size N stored at each node, the proposed algorithm is carried out at each related node in O(n) time. In some cases the proposed algorithm is superior to the one proposed by Chang and Wang in terms of the length of the routing path. This justifies the utility of our routing strategy.
