Design/methodology/approach - An environmental scan of the web was conducted to find sample health websites for teens. Inlink data was gathered using Google Webmaster Tools, and the inlink sources were classified by the type of creator. Findings - The teen health websites in this study had a low level of visibility on the web compared to general health web portals (such as Medline Plus, for example) and a weak level of referrals from health-related groups compared to other organisations such as schools and public libraries. Many non-healthcare related websites are linking to teen health information, demonstrating that teens' health information needs are being met by sources that lack expertise in health care. Research limitations/implications - Due to the small sample of six websites, generalisations beyond the context of the study are difficult to infer. The Google Webmaster inlink tool does not guarantee 100 per cent coverage and some inlinks may not have been captured by the tool, although this number is most likely minimal. The results of this study present a snapshot rather than an all-inclusive view of the visibility of teen health websites and offer a starting point for further investigation. Practical implications - The weak network of inlinks leading from reliable health care providers is a lost opportunity for health care professionals to reach young people. Social implications - Due to the weak network of inlinks from reliable health information sources, teens may not be accessing accurate and reliable health information. This could have a potential cost in terms of health outcomes. Originality/value - The study investigates health information for teens, a population that increasingly uses the web as a source for health information. The authors used an approach that has not been used before in the study of teens and health information on the web.", "paper_title": "The visibility of health web portals for teens: a hyperlink analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000293929700007"}
