The proposed testing procedures are implemented in a step-down manner together with three different types of weighted Kaplan-Meier statistics. Comparative results of a Monte Carlo error rate and power/bias study for a variety of survival and censoring distributions are then presented and discussed. The application of the proposed procedures is finally illustrated for identifying the MED of the diethylstilbestrol in the treatment of prostate cancer.", "paper_title": "Identification of the minimum effective dose based on weighted Kaplan-Meier statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000290769600007"}
