For this scheme, we prove general convergence results and, under a natural non-degeneracy assumption,, local quadratic convergence. We analyze the behavior of this scheme on a natural problem class for which we get global and local worst-case complexity bounds. The implementation of each step of the scheme can be done by standard convex optimization technique.", "paper_title": "Modified Gauss-Newton scheme with worst case guarantees for global performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000246622500006"}
