We show that CMT suffers from significant \"receive buffer blocking\" which degrades performance during both permanent and short-term failure. To improve performance, we introduce a new \"Potentially-Failed\" (PF) destination state, and revise CMT\"s failure detection and (re)transmission policies to include the PF state. Using simulation, we demonstrate that the modification called CMT-PF outperforms CMT during failure - even with aggressive failure detection thresholds and varying receive buffer constraints. In non-failure scenarios, CMT-PF performs on par or better but never worse than CMT. Finally, we confirm these simulation results using FreeBSD implementations of CMT and CMT-PF. Based on our findings, we recommend CMT-PF be used in existing and future CMT implementations and RFCs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
