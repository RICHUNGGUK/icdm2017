The fundamental idea is to choose favorable transfer modes for traffics with different characteristics. The ratio of HCCA and EDCA periods can be dynamically adjusted by changing the CAPLimit value, which specifies the maximal permissible duration for HCCA. A two-phase algorithm is designed to adaptively adjust the CAPLimit value based on measured system dynamics. In Phase 1, coarse-grain adjustment was made to the CAPLimit value according to the measured ratio of CBR-prone traffics and VBR-prone traffics. In Phase 2, the CAPLimit value is subject to fine-tuning based on observed system throughput. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the average delay and, in the same time, is capable of maintaining or even improving the total throughput.", "paper_title": "ADAPTATION OF HCCA/EDCA RATIO IN IEEE 802.11E FOR IMPROVED SYSTEM PERFORMANCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000271852600014"}
