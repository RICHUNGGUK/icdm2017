Each 16 mu m x 16 mu m pixel area contains a photodiode, with a fill factor of 22%, a comparator used to convert the pixel level from analog to digital (A/D) values and an 8-bit DRAM, resulting in a total of 44 transistors per pixel. The A/D conversions use one common digital to analog converter to deliver the voltage reference needed to determine the pixel voltage. Three selectable operation modes are combined in the proposed MIPS: A high dynamic range logarithmic mode, a linear integration mode, and a novel differential mode between two consecutive images. This last mode that allows 3D information is required for a visual cortical stimulator. A test chip has been fabricated in CMOS 0.18 mu m technology and tested to validate the full operation of the different proposed modes.", "paper_title": "A new CMOS multimode digital pixel sensor dedicated to an implantable visual cortical stimulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000242343500013"}
