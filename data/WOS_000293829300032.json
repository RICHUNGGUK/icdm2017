Here we aim at presenting further interesting identities about certain finite or infinite series involving harmonic numbers and generalized harmonic numbers. We also give a brief eclectic review on some known properties associated with the harmonic and generalized harmonic numbers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
