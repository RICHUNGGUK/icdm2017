At its core, the Semantic Web consists of ontologies that describe the meaning of concepts in a certain domain or across domains. The domain ontologies are mostly created and maintained by domain experts using manual, time-intensive processes. In this paper, we propose a rule-based method for learning ontology instances from text that helps domain experts with the ontology population process. In this method we define a lexico-semantic pattern language that, in addition to the lexical and syntactical information present in lexico-syntactic rules, also makes use of semantic information. We show that the lexico-semantic patterns are superior to lexico-syntactic patterns with respect to efficiency and effectivity. When applied to event relation recognition in text-based news items in the domains of finance and politics using Hermes, an ontology-driven news personalization service, our approach has a precision and recall of approximately 80% and 70%, respectively.
