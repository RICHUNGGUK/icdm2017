This paper reviews state-of-the-art CAD methods in 3D garment design. A large range of techniques are selected and organized into several key modules which form the core of a 3D garment design technology platform. In each module, basic techniques are presented first. Then advanced developments are systematically discussed and commented. The selected key modules - digital human modeling, 3D garment design and modification, numerical integration of draping, 2D pattern generation, geometric details modeling, parallel computation and CPU acceleration - are discussed in turn. Major challenges and solutions that have been addressed over the years are discussed. Finally, some of the ensuing challenges in 3D garment CAD technologies are outlined. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
