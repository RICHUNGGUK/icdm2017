The problem is NP-hard which makes difficult finding quality solution in short amount of time. Recently a new kind of TTP has been proposed 'The Relaxed Travelling Tournament Problem'. This version of the problem allows teams to have some days off during the tournament. In this paper, we propose an immune algorithm that is able to solve both problem versions. The algorithm uses moves which are based on the team home/away patterns. One of these moves has been specially designed for the relaxed travel tournament instances. We have tested the algorithm using well-known problem benchmarks and the results obtained are very encouraging.", "paper_title": "Solving scheduling tournament problems using a new version of CLONALG", "paper_id": "WOS:000349006500003"}
