A causality conflict arises at the coupling node, due to the inductive nature of each device. To deal with the variable structure of the model (same devices have to be coupled or decoupled depending on specific conditions), switching power junction concept is used at the coupling node. Causality changes involve changes in alternator and induction machine models allowing the management of the structure commutations. Power flow management is presented. Simulation results show the advantages of using bond graph models and the validity of the proposed models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
