Our method incorporates a computationally efficient linear predictor that exploits short-term spatio-temporal coherence in the RF data. Segmentation is achieved jointly using an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) spatial model for RF intensity and a multiframe conditional model that relates neighboring frames in the image sequence. Segmentation using the RF data overcomes challenges due to image inhomogeneities often amplified in B-mode segmentation and provides geometric constraints for RF phase-based speckle tracking. The incorporation of multiple frames in the conditional model significantly increases the robustness and accuracy of the algorithm. Results are generated using between 2 and 5 frames of RF data for each segmentation and are validated by comparison with manual tracings and automated B-mode boundary detection using standard (Chan and Vese-based) level sets on echocardiographic images from 27 3D sequences acquired from six canine studies.
