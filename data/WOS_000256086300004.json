Since wavelength converters are expensive, it is desirable that each node in WDM optical networks uses a minimum number of wavelength converters to achieve a near-ideal performance. The searching capability of genetic evolutionary algorithm has been exploited for this purpose. The distinguished feature of the proposed approach lies in handling the conflicting circumstances during allocation of wavelength converters considering various practical aspects (e.g., spatial problem, connectivity of a node with other nodes) rather than arbitrarily to possibly improve the overall blocking performance of WDM optical networks. The proposed algorithm is compared with a previous approach to establish its effectiveness and the results demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to efficiently solve the problem of Optimal Wavelength Converters Allocation (OWCA) in practical WDM optical networks.", "paper_title": "Genetic evolutionary algorithm for optimal allocation of wavelength converters in WDM optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256086300004"}
