Here we investigate inter-site variability in signal to noise ratio (SNR), percent integral uniformity (PIU), width and height using the American College of Radiology (ACR) phantom scans from the NIHPD project. Longitudinal variations are also analyzed. All measurements are fully automated. Our results show that the mean SNR, PIU and the 2 metric values were statistically different across sites. The maximum mean difference in diameter across sites was 2 mm (1.1%), and the maximum mean difference in height was 2.5 mm (1.7%). Over time, an average drift of 0.4 mm per year was observed for the diameter while a drift of 0.5 mm per year was observed for the height. Trends observed over time often depended not only on site, but also on modality and scanner manufacturer.", "paper_title": "Automated analysis of multi site MRI phantom data for the NIHPD project", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700018"}
