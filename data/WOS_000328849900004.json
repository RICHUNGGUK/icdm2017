In this work we report on a technique to compute a continuous evaluation path, if one exists, that solves the reachability problem for geometric constructions with one variant parameter. The technique is developed in the framework of a constructive geometric constraint-based dynamic geometry system, uses the A (auaEuro parts per thousand) algorithm and minimizes the variant parameter arc length.", "paper_title": "The Reachability Problem in Constructive Geometric Constraint Solving Based Dynamic Geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000328849900004"}
