In this paper, a novel Cooperative Control and Management Framework (CCMF) in multi-domain WSON is proposed to support the arising intelligent applications and optimize resource utilization with more scalability and robustness. In CCMF, we focus on the mechanism with the consideration of requirements of intelligent applications with complex flows, performance guarantees and traffic engineering in a traditional optical network. Thus, a combined provisioning approach, synergetic between the control plane (CP) and the management plane (MP), is presented with the policy based management system, in which a mobile agent is introduced to support the communication between MP and CP. Furthermore, one application, a novel multi-domain impairment aware routing and wavelength assignment (MIA-RWA) algorithm at the Bit Error Rate level, based on the proposed CCMF, is presented. It is proposed to improve the routing performance in multi-domain WSON. Finally, comprehensive simulations are conduced to verify the effectiveness of CCMF and the proposed mechanisms.", "paper_title": "A Novel Framework and the Application Mechanism with Cooperation of Control and Management in Multi-domain WSON", "paper_id": "WOS:000320046100005"}
