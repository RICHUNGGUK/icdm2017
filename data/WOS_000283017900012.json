The objective is to identify this probability distribution - the dispersion of which is independent of the sample size since intrinsic variability is at stake - based on observation of some model outputs. Moreover, in order to limit the number of (usually burdensome) physical model runs inside the inversion algorithm to a reasonable level, a nonlinear approximation methodology making use of Kriging and a stochastic EM algorithm is presented. It is compared with iterated linear approximation on the basis of numerical experiments on simulated data sets coming from a simplified but realistic modelling of a dyke overflow. Situations where this nonlinear approach is to be preferred to linearisation are highlighted. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
