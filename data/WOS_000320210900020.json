Recent advances indicate that it is possible to decrease the computational burden of IW techniques in scenarios involving long heterogeneous streams of bi-tonal document images by recalling embedding parameters (solutions) from a memory based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) representation of optimization problems. This representation can provide ready-to-use solutions for similar optimization problem instances, avoiding the need for a costly re-optimization process. In this paper, a dual surrogate dynamic Particle Swarm Optimization (DS-DPSO) approach is proposed which employs a memory of GMMs in regression mode in order to decrease the cost of re-optimization for heterogeneous bi-tonal image streams. This approach is applied within a four level search for near-optimal solutions, with increasing computational burden and precision. Following previous research, the first two levels use GMM re-sampling to recall solutions for recurring problems, allowing to manage streams of heterogeneous images. Then, if embedding parameters of an image require a significant adaptation, the third level is activated. This optimization level relies on an off-line surrogate, using Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), in order to replace costly fitness evaluations during optimization. The final level also performs optimization, but GMR is employed as a costlier on-line surrogate in a worst-case scenario and provides a safeguard to the IW system. Experimental validation were performed on the OULU image data set, featuring heterogeneous image streams with a varying levels of attacks. In this scenario, the DS-DPSO approach has been shown to provide comparable level of watermarking performance with a 93% decline in computational cost compared to full re-optimization. Indeed, when significant parameter adaptation is required, fitness evaluations may be replaced with GMR. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
