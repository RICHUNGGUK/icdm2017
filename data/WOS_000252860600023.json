Here, a new fourth-order implementation of the Fourier split-step algorithm is described for problems possessing FDA azimuthal symmetry in 3 + 1-dimensions. This implementation is based, in part, on a finite difference approximation Delta(FDA)(perpendicular to) of 1/r partial derivative/partial derivative r r partial derivative/partial derivative r that possesses an associated exact unitary representation of e(1/2 lambda Delta perpendicular to FDA). The matrix elements of this unitary matrix are given by special functions known as the associated Bessel functions. Hence the attribute Fourier-Bessel for the method. The Fourier-Bessel algorithm is shown to be unitary and unconditionally stable. The Fourier-Bessel algorithm is employed to simulate the propagation of a periodic series of short laser pulses through a nonlinear medium. This numerical simulation calculates waveform intensity profiles in a sequence of planes that are transverse to the general propagation direction, and labeled by the cylindrical coordinate z. These profiles exhibit a series of isolated pulses that are offset from the time origin by characteristic times, and provide evidence for a physical effect that may be loosely termed normal mode condensation. Normal mode condensation is consistent with experimentally observed pulse filamentation into a packet of short bursts, which may occur as a result of short, intense irradiation of a medium.
