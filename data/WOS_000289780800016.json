Currawong is an extensible tool which applies optimisations at the point where an application invokes framework or library code. Currawong does not require source code to perform optimisations, effectively decoupling the relationship between compilation and optimisation. We show, through examples written for the popular Android smartphone platform, that Currawong is capable of significant performance improvement to existing applications.", "paper_title": "Architecture Optimisation with Currawong", "paper_id": "WOS:000289780800016"}
