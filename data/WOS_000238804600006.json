In this approach, the power system is considered as a collection of separate control areas under the bilateral Load Frequency Control (LFC) scheme. Each control area which is introduced by one or more distribution companies, can buy electric power from some generation companies to supply the area-load. The control area is responsible to perform its own LFC by buying enough power from pre-specified generation companies, which equipped with a FNNs based load frequency controller. The proposed control strategy is applied to a 3-control area power system. The resulting controllers are shown to minimize the effect of disturbances and achieve acceptable frequency regulation in the presence of load variations and line disturbances.", "paper_title": "Load-frequency regulation under a bilateral LFC scheme using flexible neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238804600006"}
