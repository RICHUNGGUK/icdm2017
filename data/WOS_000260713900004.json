In this paper, we develop a new spatio-temporal data analysis approach aimed at discovering abnormal spatio-temporal clustering patterns. We also propose a quantitative evaluation framework and compare our approach against a widely used space-time scan statistic-based method under this framework. Our approach is based on a robust clustering engine using support vector machines and incorporates ideas from existing online surveillance methods to track incremental changes over time. Initial experimental results using both simulated and real-world datasets indicate that Our approach is able to detect abnormal areas with irregular shapes more accurately than the space-time scan statistic-based method.
