To automatically determine the length of region of support for corner detection, Teh-Chin and Guru-Dinesh presented adaptive approaches based on some local properties of boundary points. However, these local-property based approaches are sensitive to noise. In this paper, we propose a new approach to find the optimum length of region of support for corner detection based on a statistic discriminant criterion. Since our approach is based on the global perspective of all boundary points, rather than the local properties of some points., the experiments show that the determined length of region of support increases as the noise intensity strengthens. In addition, the detected corners based on the optimum length of region of support are consistent with human experts' judgment, even for noisy boundaries.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Region of Support for Boundary-Based Corner Detection: A Statistic Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394700033"}
