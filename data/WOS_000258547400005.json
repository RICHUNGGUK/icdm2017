To find the equilibrium position of the system, six different optimization algorithms are used to minimize the total potential energy (TPE) of the system and compared with respect to accuracy and efficiency. A computer program is developed to evaluate the equality constraints and objective function of a general multibody dynamic system to find the equilibrium condition. It is seen that the indirect methods have better results and converge faster. Also it is shown that the genetic algorithm (GA) results in a global optimum while the other methods converge to a local optimum.", "paper_title": "Equilibrium analysis of multibody dynamic systems using genetic algorithm in comparison with constrained and unconstrained optimization techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000258547400005"}
