We propose two kinds of portfolio selection models based on lower and upper possibilistic means and possibilistic variances, respectively, and introduce the notions of lower and upper possibilistic efficient portfolios. We also present an algorithm which can derive the explicit expression of the possibilistic efficient frontier for the possibilistic mean-variance portfolio selection problem dealing with lower bounds on asset holdings.
