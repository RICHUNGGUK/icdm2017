We investigate a novel approach of extending the description logic SHOIQ to SHOIQFC by annotating concepts and roles based on comparison expressions. SHOIQFC provides the ability to represent complex fuzzy knowledge, in addition to the expressive power of the fuzzy description logic FSHOIQ. The main contributions are a decidability proof for the consistency problem of SHOIQFC knowledge bases, as well as its tableau-based reasoning algorithm.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy extension for SHOIQ based on comparisons between degrees of membership", "paper_id": "WOS:000323665900012"}
