We propose self-assembly (SA) hypergraph automata as an automata-theoretic model for patterned self-assembly. We investigate the computational power of SA-hypergraph automata and show that for every recognizable picture language, there exists an SA-hypergraph automaton that accepts this language. Conversely, we prove that for any restricted SA-hypergraph automaton, there exists a Wang Tile System, a model for recognizable picture languages, that accepts the same language. The advantage of SA-hypergraph automata over Wang automata, acceptors for the class of recognizable picture languages, is that they do not rely on an a priori defined scanning strategy.", "paper_title": "HYPERGRAPH AUTOMATA: A THEORETICAL MODEL FOR PATTERNED SELF-ASSEMBLY", "paper_id": "WOS:000340462400005"}
