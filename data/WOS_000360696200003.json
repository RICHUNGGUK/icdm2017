There have been many different approaches in the literature that has their own strengths and weaknesses to tackle these two important steps, however, there is none comprehensive approach. Among them, formal methods by using their mathematical supporting background could achieve a precise, clear and in detail requirement analysis. However they were not able to illustrate graphically a system for stakeholders. On the other hand, semiformal methods owning graphically representation of a system's behavior make it easy for the stakeholders to perceive thoroughly. In this paper we represent an integration of object Z formal language and a graphically modeling tool hierarchical object oriented petri net. The application of business process was used to be modeled by this intergraded language.", "paper_title": "Enrichment of Object Oriented Petri Net and Object Z Aiming at Business Process Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000360696200003"}
