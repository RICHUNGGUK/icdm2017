The established 3D-QSAR models exhibit reasonable statistical quality and prediction capabilities, with internal cross-validated Q (2) values of similar to 0.5 and external predicted R (2) values of > 0.9, respectively. The relative contributions of the steric/electrostatic fields of the 3D-QSAR models show that the electronic effect governs the narcotic activities of the molecules, but the hybrid effect of the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions is more influential in the insecticidal activities of the compounds. These findings may have valuable implications for the development of novel natural insecticides.", "paper_title": "Isolation, biological evaluation and 3D-QSAR studies of insecticidal/narcotic sesquiterpene polyol esters", "paper_id": "WOS:000289531300006"}
