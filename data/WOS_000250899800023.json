The goal is to evolve an image analysis program that correctly recognizes the training concept (shape). The approach uses generative evaluation scheme: individuals are rewarded for reproducing the shape of the object being recognized using graphical primitives and elementary background knowledge encoded in predefined operators. Evolutionary run is driven by a multiobjective fitness function to prevent premature convergence and enable effective exploration of the space of solutions. We present the method in detail and verify it experimentally on the task of learning two visual concepts from examples. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
