Although several robust sparse models have been proposed and promising results have been obtained, they are either for error correction or for error detection, and learning a general framework that systematically unifies these two aspects and explores their relation is still an open problem. In this paper, we develop a half-quadratic ( HQ) framework to solve the robust sparse representation problem. By defining different kinds of half-quadratic functions, the proposed HQ framework is applicable to performing both error correction and error detection. More specifically, by using the additive form of HQ, we propose an l(1)-regularized error correction method by iteratively recovering corrupted data from errors incurred by noises and outliers; by using the multiplicative form of HQ, we propose an l(1)-regularized error detection method by learning from uncorrupted data iteratively. We also show that the l(1)-regularization solved by soft-thresholding function has a dual relationship to Huber M-estimator, which theoretically guarantees the performance of robust sparse representation in terms of M-estimation. Experiments on robust face recognition under severe occlusion and corruption validate our framework and findings.", "paper_title": "Half-Quadratic-Based Iterative Minimization for Robust Sparse Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000328899500005"}
