Even though most interval logics turn out to be undecidable, meaningful exceptions exist, such as the logics of temporal neighborhood and (some of) the logics of the subinterval relation. In this paper, we explore a different path to decidability: instead of restricting the set of modalities or imposing severe semantic restrictions, we take the most expressive interval temporal logic studied so far, namely, Venema's CDT, and we suitably limit the negation depth of modalities. The decidability of the satisfiability problem for the resulting fragment, called CDTBS, over the class of all linear orders, is proved by embedding it into a well-known decidable quantifier prefix class of first-order logic, namely, Bernays-Schonfinkel class. In addition, we show that CDTBS is in fact NP-complete (Bernays-Schonfinkel class is NEXPTIME-complete), and we prove its expressive completeness with respect to a suitable fragment of Bernays-Schonfinkel class. Finally, we show that any increase in the negation depth of CDTBS modalities immediately yields undecidability.", "paper_title": "The light side of interval temporal logic: the Bernays-Schonfinkel fragment of CDT", "paper_id": "WOS:000338322800002"}
