Thus, we propose a new scheme to incorporate non-linear generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (NGARCH) into BWGC prediction, which is optimally regularized by quantum minimization (QM), in such a way that the composite model, BWCC/NGARCH, can overcome the problem of volatility clustering substantially. In comparison with forecasting performance of several notable prediction methods, the proposed one can get the best predictive accuracy in two typical experiments.", "paper_title": "New forecasting scheme using quantum minimization to regularize a composite of prediction and its nonlinear heteroscedasticity", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243700016"}
