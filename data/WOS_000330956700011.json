The all existing approaches with regard to event detection, video summarization based on video stream and application of text sources in event detection have been surveyed. As regard the current challenges for automatic and real time provision of summary videos, different computer vision approaches are discussed and compared. Audio, video feature extraction methods and their combination with textual methods have been investigated. Available commercial products are presented to better clarify the boundaries in this domain and future directions for improvement of existing systems have been suggested.", "paper_title": "Features extraction for soccer video semantic analysis: current achievements and remaining issues", "paper_id": "WOS:000330956700011"}
