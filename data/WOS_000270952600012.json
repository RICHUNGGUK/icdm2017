The influence of the vane-type suppressors which prevent the vortex formation is investigated. An attempt has been made to understand the mechanism that is responsible for vortex suppressing. There is a strong updraft generated due to the suppressors which leads to annihilation of vorticity which appears to be responsible for vortex suppression.", "paper_title": "Draining from Cylindrical Tanks with Vane-Type Suppressors - A PIV Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000270952600012"}
