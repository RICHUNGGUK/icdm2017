Its major problem is that packets can be mis-sequenced when they arrive at outputs. In a recent work, the packet mis-sequencing problem is elegantly solved by a feedback-based switch architecture. In this paper, we extend the feedback-based switch from two-stage to three-stage for further cutting down average packet delay while still ensuring in-order packet delivery and close to 100% throughput. The basic idea is to use the third stage switch to map heavy flows to experience less middle-stage delays. To identity heavy flows, an adaptive traffic estimation algorithm is proposed. To ensure max-min fairness in bandwidth allocation under any inadmissible traffic pattern, an efficient fair scheduler is devised. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
