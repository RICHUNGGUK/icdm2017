The author works in an Austrian finance institution. There are at the moment two rating systems in use. The main purpose of such a rating system is to analyze company ratios to calculate a rating score, which is a measure for the financial situation and rigidity of a company. The first one is a solely hard fact rating system based on the Quicktest by Kralicek. The second one uses self-organizing maps and neural networks to calculate a rating classification and also offers the possibility to dispose personal appraisal in the calculation process. The following work examines the application spectrum of fuzzy logic and fuzzy models in soft-fact rating systems. We show that the use of fuzzy models in rating systems enables visualization of additional knowledge and offers the possibility to enhance the influence of a company's soft fact rating to the overall rating.", "paper_title": "APPLYING FUZZY MODELS IN RATING SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275005500009"}
