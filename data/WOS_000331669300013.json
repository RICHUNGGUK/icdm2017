However, the computation of LDA involves dense matrices eigendecomposition, which is time-consuming for large-scale problems. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called Rayleigh-Ritz Discriminant Analysis (RADA) for efficiently solving LDA. While much of the prior research focus on transforming the generalized eigenvalue problem into a least squares formulation, our method is instead based on the well-established Rayleigh-Ritz framework for general eigenvalue problems and seeks to directly solve the generalized eigenvalue problem of LDA. By exploiting the structures in LDA problems, we are able to design customized and highly efficient subspace expansion and extraction strategy for the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. To reduce the storage requirement and computational complexity of RRDA for high dimensional, low sample size data, we also establish an equivalent reduced model of RRDA. Practical implementations and the convergence result of our method are also discussed. Our experimental results on several real world data sets indicate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
