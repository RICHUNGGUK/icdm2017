According to the theoretical development, feature interactions are more accurate than current, bivariate dependence measures due to their stable and unambiguous definition. In experiments with artificial and real data we compare first the empirical dependency estimates of correlation, mutual information and 3-way feature interaction. Then, we present feature selection and classification experiments that show superior performance of interactions over bivariate dependence measures for the artificial data, for real world data this goal is not achieved yet.", "paper_title": "Can feature information interaction help for information fusion in multimedia problems?", "paper_id": "WOS:000263116400004"}
