It is used to distribute objects' resources to subjects according to some principles. But until now, most traditional access control models are focused on the distributional principles; the security of systems is always ignored. Protecting data and resources in computers from threats and attacks is also an important aspect in access control, especially in cloud web where there are a great deal of threats and attacks. In this paper, we introduce the present situation and related work of access control. Then we analyze the security problems in computer systems with traditional access control model, and get the prisoner's dilemma in it through Nash equilibrium. To solve this dilemma, we applied repeated-game theory to access control and build a new model RTAC. The ultimate goal of RTAC is to encourage subjects' honest accesses and discourage subjects' malicious accesses through Nash equilibrium. At last, we perform some experiments and show the advantages of RTAC over the traditional access control model.", "paper_title": "The Dynamic Access Control Model for Cloud Web Based on Repeated-game Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968700004"}
