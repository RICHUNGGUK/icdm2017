For computational efficiency, the multiclass support vector machines (SVMs) with binary tree architecture is introduced to recognize advanced RESs. Resemblance coefficient is used to convert multi-class problems into binary-class problems and consequently the structure of multi-class SVM is obtained. The presented classifier has good classification capability and fast decision-making speed. Experimental results show that the introduced classifier is superior to one-against-all, one-against-one, directed acyclic graph, bottom-up binary tree and several classification methods in the recent literature.", "paper_title": "Application of support vector machines with binary tree architecture to advanced radar emitter signal recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300016"}
