We propose a new hash chain construction, the Duplex Hash Chain, which allows us to achieve bit-by-bit authentication that is robust to low bit error rates. This construction is well suited for wireless broadcast communications characterized by low packet losses such as in satellite networks. Moreover, neither hardware upgrades nor specific end-user equipment are needed to enjoy the authentication services. The computation overhead experienced on the receiver only sums to two hashes per block of pictures and one digital signature verification for the whole received stream. This overhead introduces a provably negligible decrease in video quality. A thorough analysis of the proposed solution is provided in conjunction with extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Robust and Efficient Authentication of Video Stream Broadcasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000291100500005"}
