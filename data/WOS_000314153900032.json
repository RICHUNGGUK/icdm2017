This system is a Hamiltonian system with the Hamiltonian H(p, q) = 1/2p(T)p + 1/2q(T)Mq+U(q). The energy-preserving formula exactly preserves the Hamiltonian. We analyze in detail the properties of the energy-preserving formula and propose new efficient energy-preserving integrators in the sense of numerical implementation. The convergence analysis of the fixed-point iteration is presented for the implicit integrators proposed in this paper. It is shown that the convergence of implicit Average Vector Field methods is dependent on parallel to M parallel to, whereas the convergence of the new energy-preserving integrators is independent of parallel to M parallel to. The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem and the sine-Gordon equation are carried out numerically to show the competence and efficiency of the novel integrators in comparison with the well-known Average Vector Field methods in the scientific literature.
