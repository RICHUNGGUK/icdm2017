In this paper, we develop the interval-valued fuzzy ANP (IVF-ANP) to solve MCDM problems since it allows interdependent influences specified in the model and generalizes on the supermatrix approach. Furthermore, performance rating values as well as the weights of criteria are linguistics terms which can be expressed in IVF numbers (IVFN). Moreover, we present a novel methodology proposed for solving MCDM problems. In proposed methodology by applying IVF-ANP method determined weights of criteria. Then, we appraise the performance of alternatives against criteria via linguistic variables which are expressed as triangular interval-valued fuzzy numbers. Afterward, by utilizing IVF-weights which are obtained from IVF-ANP and applying IVF-TOPSIS and IVF-VIKOR methods achieve final rank for alternatives. Additionally, to demonstrate the procedural implementation of the proposed model and its effectiveness, we apply it on a case study regarding to assessment the performance of property responsibility insurance companies.", "paper_title": "Soft computing based on interval valued fuzzy ANP-A novel methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000308820200007"}
