This paper proposes the use of flexible spectrum management techniques in multi-RAT systems. A Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) framework that addresses the shortcomings of FSA, while ensuring the reliable operation of all co-deployed RATs, is presented. Simulations for a system co-deploying HSPA and LTE show that the proposed framework outperforms FSA schemes and is capable of adapting to system traffic variations.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Spectrum Management in Multi-Radio Access Technology (RAT) Cellular Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681300003"}
