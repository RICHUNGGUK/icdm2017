Practically, basal cells constitute the proliferative compartment (called basal layer) of the epithelium. In the context of histopathological evaluation, the morphometry and texture of basal nuclei are assumed to vary during malignant transformation according to onco-pathologists. In order to automate the pathological understanding, the basal layer is initially extracted from histopathological images of NOM (n = 341) and OSF (n = 429) samples using fuzzy divergence, morphological operations and parabola fitting followed by median filter-based noise reduction. Next, the nuclei are segmented from the layer using color deconvolution, marker-controlled watershed transform and gradient vector flow (GVF) active contour method. Eighteen morphological, 4 gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features and 1 intensity feature are quantized from five types of basal nuclei characteristics. Afterwards, unsupervised feature selection method is used to evaluate significant features and hence 18 are obtained as most discriminative out of 23. Finally, supervised and unsupervised classifiers are trained and tested with 18 features for the classification between normal and OSF samples. Experimental results are obtained and compared. It is observed that linear kernel based support vector machine (SVM) leads to 99.66% accuracy in comparison with Bayesian classifier (96.56%) and Gaussian mixture model (90.37%).
