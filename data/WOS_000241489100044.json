In this paper, a new approach to low complexity wireless video compression is proposed, based on Wyner-Ziv coding theorem. The proposed method encodes video only by intracoding techniques and detection of regions of interest, without the complicated motion estimation and compensation in the mobile video terminal. Thus, the computational burden is obviously reduced and the requirement of low power can be satisfied in mobile video devices. Experimental results show that the proposed method is quite effective.", "paper_title": "New approach to wireless video compression with low complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100044"}
