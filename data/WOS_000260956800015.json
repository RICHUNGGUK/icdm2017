With this demand, we have designed and implemented a novel software platform in traditional object-oriented fashion with some common design patterns. This platform integrates the mainstream algorithms for medical image processing and analyzing within a consistent framework, including reconstruction, segmentation, registration, visualization, etc., and provides a powerful tool for both scientists and engineers. The overall framework and certain key technologies are introduced in detail. Presented experiment examples, numerous downloads, extensive uses, and practical applications commendably demonstrate the validity and flexibility of the platform.", "paper_title": "A Novel Software Platform for Medical Image Processing and Analyzing", "paper_id": "WOS:000260956800015"}
