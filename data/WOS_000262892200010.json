This is inefficient because they are closely related. Therefore we present a framework in which it is possible to derive one from the other. To this end we introduce a special class of Petri nets, called Jackson nets, to model the business processes, and a document type, called Jackson types, to model the database. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between Jackson nets and Jackson types. We illustrate the use of the framework by an example. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
