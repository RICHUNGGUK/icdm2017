The aim of the present study was to analyze critical drug prescriptions in a university-based nephrology clinic and to evaluate the effect of different alerting strategies on the alert burden. Methods In a prospective observational study, two advanced strategies to automatically generate alerts were applied when medication regimens were entered for discharge letters, outpatient clinic letters, and written prescriptions and compared to two basic reference strategies. Strategy A generated alerts whenever drug-specific information was available, whereas strategy B generated alerts only when the estimated glomerular filtration rate of a patient was below a drug-specific value. Strategies C and D included further patient characteristics and drug-specific information to generate even more specific alerts. Results Overall, 1012 medication regimens were entered during the observation period. The average number of alerts per drug preparation in medication regimens entered for letters was 0.28, 0.080, 0.019, and 0.011, when using strategy A, B, C, or D ( P<0.001, for comparison between the strategies), leading to at least one alert in 87.5%, 39.3%, 13.5%, or 7.81% of the regimens. Similar average numbers of alerts were observed for medication regimens entered for written prescriptions. Conclusions The prescription of potentially hazardous drugs is common in patients with renal impairment. Alerting strategies including patient and drug-specific information to generate more specific alerts have the potential to reduce the alert burden by more than 90 %.", "paper_title": "Tailoring of alerts substantially reduces the alert burden in computerized clinical decision support for drugs that should be avoided in patients with renal disease", "paper_id": "WOS:000361282200017"}
