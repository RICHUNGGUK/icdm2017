A software implementation has been realized and then transferred to the Handel-C language. By parallelization of the algorithm and using language mechanisms in Handel-C the processing efficiency has been increased 10 times with respect to the initial hardware implementation. The implementation has been verified in hardware-software environment with real data transmitted on-line from a DV camcorder.", "paper_title": "Handel-c design enhancement for FPGA-based DV decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036500018"}
