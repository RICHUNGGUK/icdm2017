Our process called MeCOMA (Meta-Model Driven Collaborative Object Modeling Approach) is based on three meta-models: physical object meta-model, data object meta-model, and activity object meta-model. After the three meta-models are extended independently for a given production system, they are collaboratively integrated on the basis of an integration pattern. The main advantages of MeCOMA are (1) to reduce software development time and (2) to consistently build reusable production software components.", "paper_title": "Meta-model driven collaborative object analysis process for production planning and scheduling domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900092"}
