Asynchronous time stepping, i.e., updating the solution in different cell sizes according to their local rates, is known to be a promising way to improve the efficiency of explicit time-stepping methods without compromise in accuracy. In the present paper, a new asynchronous time-stepping algorithm is developed for the Compact Accurately Boundary-Adjusting high-REsolution Technique (CABARET) Euler method. This allows to significantly speedup the original single-step CABARET method with non-uniform grids and improves its accuracy at the same time. Numerical examples are provided and issues associated with the method performance on various grid resolutions are discussed. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
