In this paper, we propose a scheme of layout-aware as well as coverage-driven ILS design. The partitioning of the flipflops into ILS segments is determined by their geometric locations, whereas the set of the flip-flops to be placed in parallel is determined by the minimum incompatibility relations among the corresponding bits of a test set, to enhance fault coverage in broadcast mode. As a result, the number of serial test patterns also reduces.", "paper_title": "A Routing-Aware ILS Design Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000296459300020"}
