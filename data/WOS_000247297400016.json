In this paper, we employ a novel exploratory modeling technique, multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS), to build software maintainability prediction models using the metric data collected from two different object-oriented systems. The prediction accuracy of the MARS models are evaluated and compared using multivariate linear regression models, artificial neural network models, regression tree models, and support vector models. The results suggest that for one system MARS can predict maintainability more accurately than the other four typical modeling techniques, and that for the other system MARS is as accurate as the best modeling technique.
