Especially, a maximal repetition, which cannot be extended neither to left nor to right, is called a run.The ratio of the length of the run to its period, i.e. j-i+1/p, is called an exponent. The sum of exponents of runs in a string is of interest. The maximal value of the sum is still unknown, and the current upper bound is 2:9n given by Crochemore and Ilie, where n is the length of a string. In this paper we show a closed formula which exactly expresses the average value of it for any n and any alphabet size, and the limit of this value per unit length as n approaches infinity. For binary strings, the limit value is approximately 1.13103. We also show the average number of squares in a string of length n and its limit value.", "paper_title": "AVERAGE VALUE OF SUM OF EXPONENTS OF RUNS IN A STRING", "paper_id": "WOS:000272093500010"}
