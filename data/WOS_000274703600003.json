Besides, web search services index the disseminated information with different algorithms, having as result different response time in updating their directories. In this paper, we propose a meta-search algorithm, which is capable of self-adapting over the continuous changes that Occur on the indexed Web, using a web evolution adaptation mechanism. This mechanism carries out statistical results according to the rationale of the capture-recapture experiments conducted in wildlife biological studies. The meta-search algorithm also records the user's browsing behaviour during his search activities. The paper provides the implementation details of the proposed meta-search ranking algorithm along with its initial assessment. We prove in Our approach, that when user's browsing, behaviour is jointly used with a dynamic survey mechanism, which scores the ability of each search service to adapt in the incessant evolution of the web, a more effective meta-search is provided. Experimental results showed that the precision of the third-party results in several recall levels were increased within a six-month period. For acquiring third-party results we used five known web search services, namely AltaVista, Google, Lycos, MSN, and Yahoo!", "paper_title": "Improving the Precision of Third-Party Results by Monitoring Browsing Behaviour and Evolution in Internet Search Engine Caches", "paper_id": "WOS:000274703600003"}
