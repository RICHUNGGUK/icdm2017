Recently, different new models of tissue-like P systems have received much attention from the scientific community. In this paper we present a linear-time solution to an NP-complete problem from graph theory, the 3-coloring problem, and we discuss the suitability of tissue-like P systems as a framework to address the efficient solution to intractable problems.
