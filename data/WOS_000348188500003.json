However, the nursing domain often fails to meet this requirement. In this article, we address this challenge by presenting a three-stage methodological approach that can be used to (1) capture knowledge in a nursing domain; (2) design a nursing ontology, composed of data models linked with terminology concepts in a multi-relational property graph; and (3) implement and (4) evaluate the ontology. Through the feasibility, development, and evaluation phases of our methodological approach, we modeled a nursing domain (ontology) and the indices that partition the domain into an efficient, searchable space, where the solution to a nursing problem is seen as abstractly defined traversals through its graph vertices and edges. Thus, the use of the three-phase ontology development process and multi-relational property graph was sufficiently comprehensive for achieving the representation of a nursing domain ontology and its instantiation.", "paper_title": "Toward the Design of a Nursing Ontology System", "paper_id": "WOS:000348188500003"}
