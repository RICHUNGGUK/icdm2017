The existing approaches can be improved by introducing a new model and a new analysis method of network user's traffic behaviors. The description dimensions to network user's traffic behaviors in the current approaches are high, resulting in high processing complexity, high delay in differentiating an individual user's abnormal traffic behavior from massive network data, and low detection rate. To improve the detection rate and efficiency, we develop a new method of establishing user's traffic behavior analysis system based on a new model of network traffic monitoring. First, we establish a more complete feature set based on the characteristics of network traffic to describe massive network user's behaviors. Then, we define a feature selection rule based on the relative deviation distance to select the optimized feature set. We use the selected feature set to locate the abnormality moment and the users who produce the abnormal traffic behavior. Finally, a traffic behavior analysis method based on prediction is developed to improve efficiency of the system. This new method is applied to evaluate the mobile users on mobile cloud. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a higher detection rate and lower delay in the analysis of abnormal user's traffic behavior than that of the existing approaches.
