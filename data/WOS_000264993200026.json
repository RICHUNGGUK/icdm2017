This new algorithm adjusts the widths of Gaussian membership functions of the IF parts of fuzzy rules in the lower fuzzy sub-systems. and updates the weights and bias terms of the upper neural network by gradient-descent method. Two advantages of the proposed algorithm are shown in this paper: firstly, its parameters are usually fewer, compared with the existing training algorithm for HHFNN and standard BP algorithm: secondly, it outperforms the latter two algorithms in accuracy according to simulation results.
