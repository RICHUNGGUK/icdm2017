The prescaler can work properly for both differential and single phase input clocks. For differential input clocks, the prescaler achieves not only high operating frequency but also low power consumption since it consists of only five NMOS-like blocks. For single phase input clock, the operating frequency range is further expanded by utilizing a complementary clocks generator. Simulation results show that, in 180-nm standard CMOS technology, the proposed prescaler achieves operating frequency range of 1.7-9.0 GHz for differential input clocks and 0.5-10.2 GHz for single phase input clock. And the maximum power consumption from 1.8 V power supply is 0.92 mW and 1.32 mW for differential and single phase input clocks respectively.", "paper_title": "A 2/3 Dual-Modulus Prescaler Using Complementary Clocking NMOS-Like Blocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356446200016"}
