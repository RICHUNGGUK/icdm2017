Applications have been performed on different types of devices and/or platforms. The point of view of this paper is focused on a hardware taxonomy (devices where the applications have been implemented) and highlights the characteristics of the different applications covering the aforementioned paradigms done over the last two decades, and the beginning of the current decade. Special mention is made up of reconfigurable devices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
