This paper presents results from an empirical study which investigates implications for application performance and resource requirements (CPU, disk and network) resulting from how multi-tier applications are deployed to IaaS clouds. We investigate the implications of: (1) component placement across VMs, (2) VM memory size, (3) VM hypervisor type (KVM vs. Xen), and (4) VM placement across physical hosts (provisioning variation). All possible deployment configurations for two multi-tier application variants are tested. One application variant was computationally bound by the application middleware, the other bound by geospatial queries. The best performing deployments required as few as 2 VMs, half the number required for VM-level service isolation, demonstrating potential cost savings when components can be consolidated. Resource utilization (CPU time, disk I/O, and network I/O) varied with component deployment location, VM memory allocation, and the hypervisor used (Xen or KVM) demonstrating how application deployment decisions impact required resources. Isolating application components using separate VMs produced performance overhead of similar to 1%-2%. Provisioning variation of VMs across physical hosts produced overhead up to 3%. Relationships between resource utilization and performance were assessed using multiple linear regression to develop a model to predict application deployment performance. Our model explained over 84% of the variance and predicted application performance with mean absolute error of only similar to 0.3 s with CPU time, disk sector reads, and disk sector writes serving as the most powerful predictors of application performance.
