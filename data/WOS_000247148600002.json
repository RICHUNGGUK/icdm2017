In order to reduce the amount the transmitted data via network, VQ (vector quantization) is applied to compressing the transmitted data. Since VQ is a low-bit-rate compression scheme, it is difficult to find large redundant hiding space and to get stego-images with high quality for hiding data in VQ-based compressed images. A hiding method for VQ-based compressed images is proposed in this paper according to the Hamming distance between the index values of codewords. Our method makes hiding data more effective and provides stego-images with higher quality than other conventional methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of our method.", "paper_title": "A novel image hiding scheme based on VQ and hamming distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000247148600002"}
