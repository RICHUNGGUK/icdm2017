This is known as a Broadcast Scheduling Problem (BSP) and shown as an NP-complete problem, in earlier studies. Because of this NP-complete nature, earlier studies used genetic algorithms, mean field annealing, neural networks, factor graph and sum product algorithm, and sequential vertex coloring algorithm to obtain the solution. In our study, a valid solution mechanism is included in simulated annealing. Because of this inclusion, we are able to achieve better results even for networks with 100 nodes and 300 links. The results obtained using our methodology is compared with all the other earlier solution methods.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT SIMULATED ANNEALING WITH A VALID SOLUTION MECHANISM FOR TDMA BROADCAST SCHEDULING PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600014"}
