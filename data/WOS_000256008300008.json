We present the two-graph state, this being a generalisation of the graph state and a two-graph representation of a stabilizer state. Mathematically, the two-graph state can be viewed as a simultaneous generalisation of a binary linear code and quadratic Boolean function. It describes precisely the coefficients of the pure quantum state vector resulting from the action of a member of the local Clifford group on a graph state, and comprises a graph which encodes the magnitude properties of the state, and a graph encoding its phase properties. This description facilitates a computationally efficient spectral analysis of the graph state with respect to operations from the local Clifford group on the state, as all operations can be realised graphically. By focusing on the so-called local transform group, which is a size 3 cyclic subgroup of the local Clifford group over one qubit, and over n qubits is of size 3(n), we can efficiently compute spectral properties of the graph state.", "paper_title": "From graph states to two-graph states", "paper_id": "WOS:000256008300008"}
