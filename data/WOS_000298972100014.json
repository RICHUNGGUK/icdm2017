The proposed approach consists in the estimation of fuzzy levels to detect movement and noise presence in the neighbourhood frames, permitting to preserve the edges, fine details and chromaticity characteristics in colour images and video sequences. The new framework has been justified applying commonly used objective criteria, such as, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Normalized Colour Difference (NCD), as well subjective perception by human viewer showing better performance in comparison with known methods presented in the literature.
