In particular, we target unconstrained large-scale problems and compare two variants of this methodology: the static and the evolutionary path relinking (EvoPR). Both are based on the strategy of creating trajectories of moves passing through high-quality solutions in order to incorporate their attributes to the explored solutions. Computational comparisons are performed on a test-bed of 19 global optimization functions previously reported with dimensions ranging from 50 to 1,000, totalizing 95 instances. Our results show that the EvoPR procedure is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the average optimality gap achieved. Statistical analysis is applied to draw significant conclusions.", "paper_title": "Path relinking for large-scale global optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000297127200012"}
