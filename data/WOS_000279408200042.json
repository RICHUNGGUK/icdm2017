Firstly, a theoretical framework for supporting the international marketing planning process is proposed and presented. Secondly, a Web-enabled hybrid intelligent software system combining Web-based knowledge automation, fuzzy rules and on-line databases for international marketing decision-making is introduced and described. Thirdly, the evaluation procedure and findings on the system's value are reported and analysed. Our evaluation results with ten involved managers demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of this Web-based approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
