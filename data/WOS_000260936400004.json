In this paper we discuss two strategies of sensing and two possible realizations of sensors. The functionality of proposed devices has been studied in numerical simulations and the results have been confirmed by experiments performed with ruthenium catalyzed, photosensitive Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.", "paper_title": "On Chemical Methods of Direction and Distance Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000260936400004"}
