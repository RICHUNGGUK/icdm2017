We show that these order functions are simple when their ordered domains are isomorphic to the value semigroup algebra of the corresponding valuation. Otherwise, we provide parametric equations to compute them. In the first case, we construct, for each order function, families of error correcting codes which can be decodified by the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm and we give bounds for their minimum distance depending on minimal sets of generators for the above value semigroup.", "paper_title": "Evaluation codes and plane valuations", "paper_id": "WOS:000241889400007"}
