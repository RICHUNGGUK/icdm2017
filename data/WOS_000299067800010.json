The numerical results are obtained for values of normalized excavation height (H/b) and friction angle (phi) greater than those considered previously in the literature. The results compare well with those available in literature. The stability numbers presented in this note would be beneficial from a design point of view. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
