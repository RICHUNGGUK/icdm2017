Then, we generalize this criterion to multipartite arbitrarily dimensional pure states. Our criterion is directly built upon coefficient matrices, but not density matrices or observables, so it has the advantage of being computed easily. Indeed, to judge separability for an arbitrary n-partite pure state in a d-dimensional Hilbert space, it only needs at most O(d) times operations of multiplication and comparison. Our criterion can be extended to mixed states. Compared with Yu's criteria, our methods are faster, and can be applied to any quantum state.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT SEPARABILITY CRITERION FOR n-PARTITE ARBITRARILY DIMENSIONAL QUANTUM STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000292204500007"}
