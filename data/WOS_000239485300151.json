Despite many useful information of ex-situ sensor measurements, their applications to recognize plasma faults have not been investigated. In this study, a new technique to identify fault causes by recognizing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using neural network and continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). The presented technique was evaluated with the plasma etch data. A total of 17 experiments were conducted for model construction. Model performance was investigated from the perspectives of training error, testing error, and recognition accuracy with respect to various thresholds. CWT-based BPNN models demonstrated a higher prediction accuracy of about 26%. Their advantages over pure XPS-based models were conspicuous in all three measures at small networks.", "paper_title": "Recognition of plasma-induced X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy fault pattern using wavelet and neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300151"}
