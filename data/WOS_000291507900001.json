In this paper, we expand the scheme to a multi-user setting for generating and verifying signatures in practical applications. An ID-based multi-signer universal designated multi-verifier signature scheme based on bilinear pairings is proposed that allows a set of multi-signer to cooperatively generate a signature and designate a set of multi-verifier to verify it. The security of the proposed scheme is demonstrated to be resistant to existentially forgery from adaptive chosen-message and chosen-ID attacks under the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem.
