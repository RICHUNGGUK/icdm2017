The asymptotic boundary conditions admit the trivial solution along with the solution of type of solitary wave. which is a bifurcation problem. The bifurcation is treated by prescribing the solution in the origin and introducing an unknown coefficient in the equation. Making use of the method of variational imbedding. the inverse problem for the coefficient identification is reformulated as a higher-order boundary value problem. The latter is solved by means of an iterative difference scheme. which is thoroughly validated. Solitary waves with oscillatory tails are obtained for different values of tension and linear restoring force Special attention is devoted to the case with negative tension. when the solutions have oscillatory tails.
