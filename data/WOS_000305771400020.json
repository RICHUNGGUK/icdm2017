On approximating Euclidean metrics by weighted t-cost distances in arbitrary dimension. Pattern Recognition Lett. 32,824-831] recently introduced a class of distance functions called weighted t-cost distances that generalize m-neighbor, octagonal, and t-cost distances. He proved that weighted t-cost distances form a family of metrics and derived an approximation for the Euclidean norm in Z(n). In this note we compare this approximation to two previously proposed Euclidean norm approximations and demonstrate that the empirical average errors given by Mukherjee are significantly optimistic in R-n. We also propose a simple normalization scheme that improves the accuracy of his approximation substantially with respect to both average and maximum relative errors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
