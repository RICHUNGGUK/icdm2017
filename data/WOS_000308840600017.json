Some important factors to address people's performances, such as the developing trends and potentialities are considered. The purpose of this paper is to attempt to propose a dynamic evaluation model based on multivariate delay connection number. Design/methodology/approach - First, evaluation results of previous periods are taken into the current period and values of uncertain numbers are revised. Next, a dynamic evaluation model is built for university leading cadre. Last, a numerical example is used to prove its feasibility and effectiveness. Findings - This paper promotes a corrected equal portion value method of uncertain numbers i1(tau), ... ,in(tau) from the adjacent two periods to multi periods, and builds a dynamic evaluation model, which proved simple-structured and easy to apply. Practical implications - The new model is applied in the evaluation of university leading cadre, and could give a more comprehensive, dynamic, scientific analysis for evaluation by model application. Originality/value - The paper develops a novel evaluation model based on a multivariate delay connection number, which expands traditional methods from a static situation to a dynamic and multi-scale-based situation.", "paper_title": "A dynamic evaluation model of university leading cadre based on multivariate delay connection number", "paper_id": "WOS:000308840600017"}
