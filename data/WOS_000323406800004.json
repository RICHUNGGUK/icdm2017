Whether a probability satisfies Kolmogorov's axioms or not depends almost exclusively on the t-norm and dual t-conorm used to define intersection and union, respectively, of fuzzy sets. In order to better understand fuzzy probability theory, we provide a complete characterization of the P-Z-compatible continuous t-norms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
