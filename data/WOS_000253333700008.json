The first step to identify insect infestation in fruit by X-ray imaging technique is image acquisition. This is followed by the image segmentation procedure, which can locate sites of infestation. Since the grey level of X-ray images depends on the density and thickness of the test samples, the relative contrast of infestation site to the intact region inside a typical fruit varies with its position. To accurately determine whether a fruit has signs of insect infestation, we have developed an adaptive image segmentation algorithm based on the local pixels intensities and unsupervised thresholding algorithm. This paper presents the detailed image processing procedure including the grid formation, local thresholding, threshold value interpolation, background removal, and morphological filtering for the determination of infestation sites of a fruit in X-ray image. The real-time image processing procedure was tested with X-ray images of several types of fruit such as citrus, peach, guava, etc. Additional tests and analyses were also performed using the developed algorithm on the X-ray images obtained with different image acquisition parameters.
