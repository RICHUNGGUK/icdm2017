Social tagging addresses information overload by easing the task of locating interesting entities in a social network. Nevertheless, users can still be overwhelmed by too many tags posted at each moment. A process is needed that offers an accurate overview of the representative entities and their relationships with each other, while dealing with the dynamics of social tagging and of tags' semantics. We propose a method for the automated summarization of an evolving multi-modal social network, focusing on the entities that stay representative over time for some subnetwork in the social tagging system. We report on experiments with real data from the Bibsonomy social tagging system, where we compare our dynamic approach with a static one. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
