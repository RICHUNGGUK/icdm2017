The key idea of our algorithm is to embed messages by adjusting the normal vector of a vertex according to the pivot vector. All vertices in a 3D model can be embedded with multiple-bit payloads by using multiple pivot vectors. The distortion is measured by the angle between the adjusted normal vector and the original normal vector to distortion. A distortion coefficient is also introduced to control the distortion rate during the embedding process. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve high data capacity (up to 12 bits per normal vector), and is robust against rotation, translation, and uniform scaling attacks.", "paper_title": "A novel data hiding algorithm using normal vectors of 3D model", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600020"}
