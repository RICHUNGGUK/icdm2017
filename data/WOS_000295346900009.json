A variety of parallel transmission algorithms based on GridFTP and multi-copy can be used to accelerate data transmission further, but they can not adapt to a wide range of network, and they can not be used to solve the problems of storage space and network traffic waste. Grid Torrent combined with Bit Torrent and GridFTP has compatibility with grid and has flexible scalability, but the speed is very slow when there are few peers, to solve this problem multicopy is needed also. To achieve multiple optimization objectives of storage space saving, suitable for two kinds of application modes(i.e. parallel transfer based on GridFTP and Bit Torrent), adaptability for wide range of network and higher performance when there are fewer peers, based on the idea of Grid Torrent, a distributed storage model, parallel transfer algorithm and virtual peer strategy are proposed. In experiments the performance is compared among the verification system VPG-Torrent and original parallel transfer algorithm (DCDA) only based on GridfTP & multi-copy and Grid Torrent. When the same amount of data is deployed VPG-Torrent has better performance than DCDA, and when there are fewer peers VPG-Torrent also exceed Grid Torrent, which prove the effectiveness of VPG-Torrent.", "paper_title": "A Novel Parallel Transmission Strategy for Data Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000295346900009"}
