FITS defines an innovative architecture that allows users running experiments with new mechanisms and protocols using both Xen and OpenFlow on the same network infrastructure. FITS integrates several recognized state-of-the-art features such as plane separation, zero-loss network migration, and smartcard-driven security access, to cite a few. The current physical testbed is composed of nodes placed at several Brazilian and European institutions interconnected by encrypted tunnels. Besides presenting the FITS architecture and its features, we also discuss deployment challenges and how we have overcome them. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
