A model-based procedure has been previously developed for detecting multiple cluster structures from independent subsets of variables. The method relies on model-based clustering methods and on a comparison among mixture models using the Bayesian Information Criterion. A generalization of this method which allows the use of any model-selection criterion is considered. A new approach combining the generalized model-based procedure with variable-clustering methods is proposed. The usefulness of the new method is shown using simulated and real examples. Monte Carlo methods are employed to evaluate the performance of various approaches. Data matrices with two cluster structures are analyzed taking into account the separation of clusters, the heterogeneity within clusters and the dependence of cluster structures. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.
