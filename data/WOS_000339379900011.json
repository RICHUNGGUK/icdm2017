The proposed SON algorithm pro-actively allocates resources to nodes which are expected to experience traffic spikes before the higher traffic load occurs, as opposed to overloaded nodes reacting to a resource-exhaustion condition. In addition, the solution ensures inter-cell interference coordination is maintained across the LTE cells/sectors.", "paper_title": "Proactive resource allocation optimization in LTE with inter-cell interference coordination", "paper_id": "WOS:000339379900011"}
