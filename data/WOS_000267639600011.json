The filter design is simple and it can effectively reduce noise with an adequate filter parameter. This paper presents a method for estimating the optimal filter parameter of epsilon-filter based on signal-noise decorrelation and shows that it yields the optimal filter parameter concerning a wide range of noise levels. The proposed method is applicable where the noise to be removed is un-correlated with signal, and it does not require any other knowledge such as noise variance and training data.", "paper_title": "Estimation of Optimal Parameter in epsilon-Filter Based on Signal-Noise Decorrelation", "paper_id": "WOS:000267639600011"}
