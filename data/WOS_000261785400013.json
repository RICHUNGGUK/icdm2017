The map Pal restricts to de Luca's right iterated palindromic closure on the submonoid generated by a, b. We show that Pal is continuous for the profinite topology on F-2; it is the unique continuous extension of de Luca's right iterated palindromic closure to F-2. The values of Pal are palindromes and coincide with the elements g epsilon F-2 such that abg and bag are conjugate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
