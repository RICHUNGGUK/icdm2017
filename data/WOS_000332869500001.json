In this paper, based on the knowledge of compositions of an integer, we present two new kinds of construction of rotation symmetric Boolean functions having optimal algebraic immunity on either odd variables or even variables. Our new functions are of much better nonlinearity than all the existing theoretical constructions of rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity. Further, the algebraic degree of our rotation symmetric Boolean functions are also high enough.", "paper_title": "Construction of rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity and high nonlinearity", "paper_id": "WOS:000332869500001"}
