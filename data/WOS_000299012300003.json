We propose DH4SS, a distributed heuristic service selection approach to solve the problem efficiently while avoiding massive data delivery and protecting data privacy in large scale cross-organisational applications. The basic idea is to decompose the global optimisation problem into local problems, then perform local selection in each QoS registry, and finally conduct centralised optimisation. Experimental results show that DH4SSperforms efficiently with high approximation ratios and fits well with distributed QoS management environments.", "paper_title": "DH4SS: a distributed heuristic for QoS-based service selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000299012300003"}
