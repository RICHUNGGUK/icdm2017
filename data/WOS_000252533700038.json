It is well known that the slowly varying nature of the average queue size computed using an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) used in the RED scheme causes this chaotic behavior. This paper presents a new mathematical function to model the weighting parameter used in the EWMA. The proposed weighting function incorporates the knowledge of the dynamic changes in the congestion characteristics, traffic characteristics and queue normalization. Using this pragmatic information eliminates the slowly varying nature of the average queue size. It is evident from our simulations that the proposed approach not only reduces the chaotic queue oscillation significantly but also provides predictable low delay and low delay jitter with high throughput gain and reduced packet loss rate even under heavy load of traffic conditions.
