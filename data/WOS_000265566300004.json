In this paper, a different general theory of resource-bounded measurability and measure on those complexity classes is developed. Our approach is parallel to the Carath,odory outer measure approach in classical Lebesgue measure theory. We shall show that many nice properties in the classical Lebesgue measure theory hold in the resource-bounded case also. The Carath,odory approach gives short and easy proofs of theorems in the resource-bounded case as well as in the classical case. The class of measurable sets in our paper is strictly larger than that of Lutz, and the two resource-bounded measures assign the same measure for a set if the set is measurable in the sense of Lutz.", "paper_title": "An Outer-Measure Approach for Resource-Bounded Measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000265566300004"}
