The integration is often hampered by a large variety of existing file formats, often containing similar information, and the necessity to use complicated tools to achieve the desired results. We have built an R package, genomation, to expedite the extraction of biological information from high throughput data. The package works with a variety of genomic interval file types and enables easy summarization and annotation of high throughput data sets with given genomic annotations.", "paper_title": "genomation: a toolkit to summarize, annotate and visualize genomic intervals", "paper_id": "WOS:000352269500020"}
