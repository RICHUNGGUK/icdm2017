Studies have shown that satisfied followers of a brand page are more likely to spread positive word of mouth about the brand to connected friends. However, most current research on brand pages is essentially descriptive and lack clear understanding about what factors contribute to customers' satisfaction with brand pages. This study relies on the Customer Value Theory, and develops a framework that investigates how multidimensional customer values enhance brand page satisfaction, and how such satisfaction further affects positive word of mouth intention. We use partial least square (PLS), which is a component based structural equation modeling technique, to analyze a survey sample including 375 \"followers\" of brand pages. The result reveals the significant role of customer value in determining brand page satisfaction and positive word of mouth.", "paper_title": "INVESTIGATING CUSTOMERS' SATISFACTION WITH BRAND PAGES IN SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES", "paper_id": "WOS:000347761800006"}
