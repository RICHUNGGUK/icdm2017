Such maps, however, are normally produced without considering the effect of uncertainty associated with data, which can contribute to incorrect interpretation. The purpose of this paper is to develop a method that can be used to evaluate the classification robustness of choropleth maps when the attribute uncertainty associated with the data is known or can be estimated. We first develop a measure to indicate the robustness of classification schemes. We then design a set of experiments to examine the robustness of different choropleth map classifications under various levels and types of uncertainty. Our experiments suggest that the robustness of a choropleth classification scheme is a function of uncertainty and the number of classes used. Increases in data uncertainty will decrease map robustness. However, it is possible to increase map robustness by choosing a smaller number of classes. We also discuss a visualization approach that can be used to display the classification robustness of each enumeration unit within a choropleth map.", "paper_title": "Assessing the effect of attribute uncertainty on the robustness of choropleth map classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000244002100007"}
