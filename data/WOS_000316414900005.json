We show that a natural algorithm, which uses Shortest Remaining Processing Time for scheduling and sets the power to be one more than the number of unfinished jobs, is 3-competitive for the objective of total flow time plus energy. We also show that another natural algorithm, which uses Highest Density First for scheduling and sets the power to be the fractional weight of the unfinished jobs, is a 2-competitive algorithm for the objective of fractional weighted flow time plus energy.", "paper_title": "Speed Scaling with an Arbitrary Power Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000316414900005"}
