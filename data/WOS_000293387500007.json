We show that these inequalities can be separated from single rows of the simplex tableaux of their linear programming relaxations. We present the results of a computational study comparing their performance with that of Gomory mixed-integer cuts on a collection of MIPLIB and randomly generated 0-1 mixed-integer programs. The computational study shows that these cuts yield better results than Gomory mixed-integer cuts.", "paper_title": "Lifted Tableaux Inequalities for 0-1 Mixed-Integer Programs: A Computational Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000293387500007"}
