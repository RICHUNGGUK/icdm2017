The major merits include: 1 the privacy protection of Mobile User (MS) 2 MS can construct a digital signature to prove the requests 3 the satisfaction of some security properties 4 the mutual authentication between MS and the Visited Location Register (VLR) 5 low computation and communication cost of MS. We then show that the privacy of MS is not kept and the overcharge problem exists in Lee et al.'s protocol and propose a method to enhance the delegation and security level and to keep the same efficiency.", "paper_title": "A privacy and delegation-enhanced user authentication protocol for Portable Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000282476100006"}
