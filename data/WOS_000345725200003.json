In distributed RTS, similar ideas have led to the adoption of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components integrated via Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles and technologies that are already well-established in business-oriented information systems. However, current SOA technologies for orchestration, such as Enterprise Service Busses, do not meet strict time-dependent constraints on scalability and latency required by RTS. We present a novel approach to RTS development where the orchestration of real-time processes is decentralised among the services within a fully distributed rule-driven process framework. Our framework wraps around COTS components implementing individual processing steps in a decentralised real-time process. Our execution model incorporates real-time constraints and is configurable through message routing policies distributed as a knowledge base containing rule sets, and therefore dispenses with the need for a central orchestration component which could easily become a bottleneck. Deterministic behaviour can be achieved through the validation of the rule-sets and the use of Modular Performance Analysis (MPA). We analyse the performance of our architecture using the Real-Time Calculus and show by empirical evaluation that our method scales to a typical real-time process application found in a tactical naval combat system context.
