The algorithm has been specifically developed for a reconfigurable computer. Our implementation utilizes a microprocessor and two reconfigurable processors on a dual-MAP SRC-6 system. The two reconfigurable processors are used as two application-specific co-processors. Two independent computational kernels are simultaneously executed on the reconfigurable processors while data pre-fetching from disk and initial data pre-processing are executed on the microprocessor. The overall end-to-end algorithm execution speedup achieved by this implementation is over 90x as compared to a sequential implementation of the algorithm executed on a single 2.8 GHz Intel Xeon microprocessor.", "paper_title": "Implementation of the two-point angular correlation function on a high-performance reconfigurable computer", "paper_id": "WOS:000272227900003"}
