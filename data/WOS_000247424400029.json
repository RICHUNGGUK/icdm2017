In order to achieve strong coupling the Jacobian of the fluid and/or structural problem is needed or has to be approximated. A technique is presented which uses the Jacobian from reduced order models that are built up during the coupling iterations. As validation, pressure wave propagation in a blood vessel is computed and as a second example growth and detachment of a gas bubble from a vertical needle submerged in a liquid is simulated. Both examples illustrate the algorithmic performance and show accurate results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
