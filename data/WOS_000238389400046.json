The model is independent of the initial set of triangle strips and the simplification method used to obtain the lower resolution versions of the original model. The information stored in the data structures is sorted to minimise the time needed to recover a Level of Detail (LoD). The orientation of triangles in each strip is maintained as the model is simplified, so back-face culling can be used. The main result is a dramatic improvement in the rendering time.", "paper_title": "Triangle strip multiresolution modelling using sorted edges", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400046"}
