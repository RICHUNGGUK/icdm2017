Before we propose this method, we have analyzed this domain and developed the components as parameter-customized-style in order to facilitate the customization. In the proposed method, PCSW requirement specification is developed from information that is used to customize components. We applied it to five development cases, and achieved 91[%] of Requirement Coverage and 94[%] of the Requirement Conformity Rate. This result indicates that proposed method have sufficient capabilities to develop exhaustive and adequate PCSW requirement specification.", "paper_title": "A method for development of adequate requirement specification in the plant control software domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600037"}
