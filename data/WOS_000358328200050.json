This paper presents an approach to a comparative visualization of the inertial particles' separation behavior. For this, we define the Finite-Time Mass Separation (FTMS), a scalar field that measures at each point in the domain how quickly inertial particles separate that were released from the same location but with slightly different mass. Extracting and visualizing the mass that induces the largest separation provides a simplified view on the critical masses. By using complementary coordinated views, we additionally visualize corresponding inertial particle trajectories in space-time by integral curves and surfaces. For a quantitative analysis, we plot Euclidean and arc length-based distances to a reference particle over time, which allows to observe the temporal evolution of separation events. We demonstrate our approach on a number of analytic and one real-world unsteady 2D field.", "paper_title": "Finite-Time Mass Separation for Comparative Visualizations of Inertial Particles", "paper_id": "WOS:000358328200050"}
