This paper focuses on the synchronous system model, and formalizes the partitioning problem using timed automata (TA), which captures the key elements of the partitioning problem. Based on the TA model, we propose a hybrid heuristic algorithm to obtain near-optimal solutions effectively and efficiently. The experiments conducted show that our approach can deal with large applications with hundreds of nodes in task graph.", "paper_title": "A hybrid heuristic algorithm for HW-SW partitioning within timed automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000056"}
