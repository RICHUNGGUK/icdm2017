The optimum bias function is compared to other bias function using a particle pulled through a viscous fluid as an illustrative example. Our analysis indicates that the uncertainty in the free energy is smallest if both dominant and typical work values are sampled with high frequency. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
