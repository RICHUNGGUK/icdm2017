This is modeled as an L(2, 1)-coloring of a graph which is no-hole and irreducible in the sense that no color can be replaced with a smaller one. In this article, we show that if the network is any tree other than a star, then frequencies may be assigned in this fashion without increasing the bandwidth; that is, we show that for any such tree T, the inh-span of T is equal to its span.
