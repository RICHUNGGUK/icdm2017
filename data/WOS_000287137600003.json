The method is formulated in category theory in terms of alternate descriptions and their functorial connections. This general theory of impredicative systems has implications in the biological, psychological, and social realms, from which we offer many exemplifications.", "paper_title": "The spread of hierarchical cycles", "paper_id": "WOS:000287137600003"}
