However, analyzing their security threats and countering them have received little attention. In this paper we discuss the security threats of a state-of-the-art routing protocol, Beeffive, and then extend the algorithm with our security model to counter them. We further conclude from our extensive experiments that standard cryptography techniques can not be utilized due to their large processing and communication costs, if Nature inspired routing protocols are to be deployed in real world networks.", "paper_title": "BeeHiveGuard: A step towards secure nature inspired routing algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900022"}
