The author declared that this scheme was shape preserving when all free parameters were explicitly selected by some specific rules. In this note, we demonstrate that the author (a) ignored the consistency of the definition to straight edges. and also (b) did not give a perfect scheme and proof for the shape preserving subdivision.
