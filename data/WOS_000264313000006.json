In 2006, Lee, Hwang, and Liao proposed an enhanced authentication scheme with user anonymity for roaming environments. This article shows that Lee-Hwang-Liao's scheme cannot provide anonymity under the forgery attack. Moreover, the heavy computation cost may consume battery power expeditiously for mobile devices. Therefore, we propose a novel authentication scheme to overcome these weaknesses that is efficient, secure, and suitable for battery-powered mobile devices in global mobility networks.
