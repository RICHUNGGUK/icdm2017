Different sources of noise are considered including bit flip, bit-phase flip and phase flip. We derive the ultimate quantum limits to precision of estimation by evaluating the analytical expressions of the quantum Fisher information and assess performances of feasible measurements by evaluating the Fisher information for realistic spin-like measurements. We also propose an experimental scheme to test our results.", "paper_title": "OPTIMIZED QUBIT PHASE ESTIMATION IN NOISY QUANTUM CHANNELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289153800035"}
