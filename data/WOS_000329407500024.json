The concepts of feature relevance, redundance, and complementarity (synergy) are clearly defined, as well as Markov blanket. The problem of optimal feature selection is defined. A unifying theoretical framework is described, which can retrofit successful heuristic criteria, indicating the approximations made by each method. A number of open problems in the field are presented.", "paper_title": "A review of feature selection methods based on mutual information", "paper_id": "WOS:000329407500024"}
