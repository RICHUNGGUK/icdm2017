This research proposes the design of a file-system-oriented flash translation layer, in which a filter mechanism is designed to separate the access requests of file-system metadata and file contents for better performance. A recovery scheme is then proposed for maintaining the integrity of a file system. The proposed flash translation layer is implemented as a Linux device driver and evaluated with respect to ext2 and ext3 file systems. Experiments were also done over NTFS by a series of realistic traces. The experimental results show significant performance improvement over ext2, ext3, and NTFS file systems with limited system overheads.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive File-System-Oriented FTL Mechanism for Flash-Memory Storage Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000302557400009"}
