A distinguishing feature of wireless sensors is the need to perform both source coding tasks, such as measurement and compression, and transmission tasks. It is known that the overall energy consumption for source coding is generally comparable to that of transmission, and that a joint design of the two classes of tasks can lead to relevant performance gains. Moreover, the efficiency of source coding in a sensor network can be potentially improved via distributed techniques by leveraging the fact that signals measured by different nodes are correlated. In this paper, a data-gathering protocol for multihop wireless sensor networks with energy-harvesting capabilities is studied whereby the sources measured by the sensors are correlated. Both the energy consumptions of source coding and transmission are modeled, and distributed source coding is assumed. The problem of dynamically and jointly optimizing the source coding and transmission strategies is formulated for time-varying channels and sources. The problem consists in the minimization of a cost function of the distortions in the source reconstructions at the sink under queue stability constraints. By adopting perturbation-based Lyapunov techniques, a close-to-optimal online scheme is proposed that has an explicit and controllable tradeoff between optimality gap and queue sizes. The role of side information available at the sink is also discussed under the assumption that acquiring the side information entails an energy cost.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Compression-Transmission for Energy-Harvesting Multihop Networks With Correlated Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000346796000003"}
