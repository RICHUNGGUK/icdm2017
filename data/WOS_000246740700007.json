We investigate the possibilities to improve the performance of the existing hand-geometry systems using the discretization of extracted features. This paper proposes employing discretization of hand-geometry features, using entropy-based heuristics, to achieve the performance improvement. The performance improvement due to the unsupervised and supervised discretization schemes is compared on a variety of classifiers: k-NN, naive Bayes, SVM, and FFN. Our experimental results on the database of 100 users achieve significant improvement in the recognition accuracy and confirm the usefulness of discretization in hand-geometry-based systems.", "paper_title": "Hand-geometry recognition using entropy-based discretization", "paper_id": "WOS:000246740700007"}
