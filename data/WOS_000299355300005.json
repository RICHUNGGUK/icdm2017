The proposed method consists of a preprocessing step for QRS detection and HRV signal extraction. In the next step, several features which can be used as markers for the prediction of PAF are extracted from the HRV signal. These features consist of spectrum features, bispectrum features, and non-linear features including sample entropy and Poincare plot-extracted features. The spectrum features are able to discriminate the sympathetic and parasympathetic contents of the HRV signal, which are affected before PAF attacks. The bispectrum features are used in order to reveal information not presented on the spectral domain, and to detect quadratic phase coupled harmonics arising from non-linearities of the HRV signal. Moreover, the non-linear analysis can map the heart rate irregularities in the feature space and it leads to better understanding of the system dynamics before PAF attacks. In the final step, a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier has been used for PM prediction. The performance of the proposed method in prediction of PAF episodes was evaluated using the Atrial Fibrillation Prediction Database (AFPDB). The obtained sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictivity were 96.30%, 93.10%, and 92.86%, respectively. The proposed methodology presents better results than the other existing approaches. The other important advantage of the proposed method when compared to the other approaches is that we do not need the both records of a subject to specify which episode preceding PM events.
