It is shown that under very mild condition on activation functions, the mixture neural networks have the same approximation order with that of the normal feedforward sigmoid neural networks. The obtained result sharpens the estimation developed by Maiorov and Meir in IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks (9(1998),969-978) over the compact region in L-w(p).
