The generic framework ensures existence of minimizers and covers a wide range of relaxations of the original combinatorial problem. We focus on two specific relaxations that differ in flexibility and simplicity-one can be used to tightly relax any metric interaction potential, while the other covers only Euclidean metrics but requires less computational effort. For solving the nonsmooth discretized problem, we propose a globally convergent Douglas-Rachford scheme and show that a sequence of dual iterates can be recovered in order to provide a posteriori optimality bounds. In a quantitative comparison to two other first-order methods, the approach shows competitive performance on synthetic and real-world images. By combining the method with an improved rounding technique for nonstandard potentials, we were able to routinely recover integral solutions within 1%-5% of the global optimum for the combinatorial image labeling problem.", "paper_title": "Continuous Multiclass Labeling Approaches and Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000298370600004"}
