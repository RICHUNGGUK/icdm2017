However, preparing basis functions requires a certain amount of prior knowledge and is, in general, a difficult task. To overcome this difficulty, an adaptive basis function construction technique has been proposed by Keller et al. recently, but it requires excessive computational cost. We propose an efficient approach to this difficulty, in which the problem of approximating the value function is decomposed into a number of subproblems, each of which can be solved with small computational cost. Computer experiments show that the CPU time needed by our method is much smaller than that by the existing method.", "paper_title": "Incremental State Aggregation for Value Function Estimation in Reinforcement Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000295012000019"}
