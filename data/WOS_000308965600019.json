To that end, we first characterize the largest set of arrival processes (rather than rates) whose deadline and delivery ratio requirements can be satisfied. Then, we propose a dynamic (channel) coding algorithm that provably satisfies the requirements of any arrival process in this region. This optimal dynamic algorithm evolves through simple iterations to utilize a combination of pricing and finite-horizon dynamic programming operations. Next, we proposed two low-complexity approximations of the algorithm that has provable performance. We also extend the setup to allow for a flow controller that adjusts the incoming flow rates to satisfy their delivery ratio constraints when the arrival process is unknown but controllable. We propose a joint dynamic coding and a rate control algorithm to solve this problem, and prove its stability under the stochastic system operation. We also apply these general results to an important wireless down-link broadcast scenario with and without random network coding capabilities. Our theoretical work is supported by extensive numerical studies, which also reveal that our dynamic coding strategy outperforms any static coding strategy by opportunistically exploiting the statistical variations in the arrival and channel processes.", "paper_title": "Optimal Dynamic Coding-Window Selection for Serving Deadline-Constrained Traffic Over Time-Varying Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000308965600019"}
