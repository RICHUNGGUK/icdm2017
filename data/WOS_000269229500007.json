A numerical model of the experimental device is proposed and compared with the data measured. By using this numerical model, a convergent optimisation strategy using a Gauss-Newton method is given. This optimisation process is applied on simulated data and on several configurations using measurements. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
