The VN embedding problem is a major challenge in this field. Its target is to efficiently map the virtual nodes and virtual links onto the substrate network resources. Previous research focused on designing heuristic-based algorithms or attempting two-stage solutions by solving node mapping in the first stage and link mapping in the second stage. In this study, we propose a new VN embedding algorithm based on integer programming. We build a model of an augmented substrate graph, and formulate the VN embedding problem as an integer program with an objective function and some constraints. A factor of topology-awareness is added to the objective function. The VN embedding problem is solved in one stage. Simulation results show that our algorithm greatly enhances the acceptance ratio, and increases the revenue/cost (R/C) ratio and the revenue while decreasing the cost of the VN embedding problem.", "paper_title": "A virtual network mapping algorithm based on integer programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000328364300001"}
