In this paper, the RIPDCF in which the activities are subject to generalized precedence relations is first modeled. Then. a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve this model. in addition, design of experiments and response surface methodology are employed to both tune the GA parameters and to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in 240 test problems. The results of the performance analysis show that the efficiency of the proposed GA method is relatively well. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
