To assess these modifications, it is necessary to use measures that quantify the impact of resources on surgical processes. Objectives: The objective of this work is to introduce and evaluate distance measurements that are able to represent differences in the courses of surgical interventions as processes. Methods: Hence, we present four different distance measures for surgical processes: the Jaccard distance, Levenshtein distance, Adjacency distance, and Graph matching; distance. These measures are formally introduced and evaluated by applying them to clinical data sets from laparoscopic training in pediatric surgery. Results: We analyzed the distances of 450; surgical processes using these four measures with a focus on the difference in surgical; processes performed by novices and by experienced surgeons. The Levenshtein and, Adjacency distances were best suited to measure distances between surgical processes. Conclusion: The measurement of distances between surgical processes is necessary to, estimate the benefit of new surgical techniques and strategies.", "paper_title": "Distance Measures for Surgical Process Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000326480900007"}
