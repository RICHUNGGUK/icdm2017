The proposed hybrid connectivity framework is based on various consumer electronics and mobile devices with wireless interfaces such as IEEE 802.15.4 (e.g., radio frequency for consumer electronics (RF4CE) or ZigBee) and IEEE 802.11. In particular, this framework involves an RF4CE-based WiFi zero-configuration scheme. It simplifies connectivity by means of secure key distribution and a simple WiFi configuration involving WiFi-capable devices. To validate our framework, we analyzed the system and security performance using real hardware prototypes.
