For a single response variable, a mutual information criterion is blended into the formulation of independent components. Extending this conceptual algorithm to multiple response variables, it reduces to canonical correlation regression if the predictor and response sets are Gaussian distributed. An analysis of the weighted objective function yields that the new algorithm can be reduced to recently published independent component regression methods. Application studies to a simulation example and recorded data confirm that the proposed algorithm can balance between the extraction of latent non-Gaussian components and the accuracy of the regression model.
