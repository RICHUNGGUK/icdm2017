However, it introduces more complexity into the routing and wavelength assignment problem. In this paper, we propose a novel graph model for describing the states of the multi-granularity switching WDM networks. Based on the model, the dynamic routing and wavelength assignment problems for multi-granularity traffic can be solved jointly, and different on-line wavelength grooming policies can be achieved simultaneously. By simulation, we compared the performance of our algorithms under different policy and different percent of fibers for fiber switching. The result proved that our algorithms yield better performance than those deal with the routing and wavelength assignment separately.", "paper_title": "Dynamic routing and wavelength assignment in multi-granularity WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000245500300004"}
