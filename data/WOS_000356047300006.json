Unlike most a priori grid generation systems for the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations, the strand meshing paradigm is automatic, fast and requires little memory to provide boundary-layer coverage. In addition, the stacks of elements implied by the strands can be used to the simulation's advantage, where they naturally provide a line direction for semi-implicit solving.", "paper_title": "MOSS: multiple orthogonal strand system", "paper_id": "WOS:000356047300006"}
