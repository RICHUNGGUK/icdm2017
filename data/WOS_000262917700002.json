In this paper some new and efficient algorithms for recognizing and analyzing cell phases of high-content screening are presented. The conceptual frameworks are based on the morphological features of cell nuclei. The useful preprocessing includes: smooth following and linearization; extraction of morphological structural points; shape recognition based morphological structure; issue of touching cells for cell separation and reconstruction. Furthermore, the novel detecting and analyzing strategies of feed-forward and feed-back of cell phases are proposed based on gray feature, cell shape, geometrical features and difference information of corresponding neighbor frames. Experiment results tested the efficiency of the new method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
