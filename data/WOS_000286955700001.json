The model describes aggregate housing market developments, such as price and turnover, as the outcome of households' decisions to search for a new dwelling, accept an offered dwelling or sell their dwelling. An important feature of the model is that households' decisions are based on perceptions of housing market probabilities. Households update these perceptions based on observed bargaining outcomes in the market. The model was tested in a simulation experiment and appeared to respond plausibly to different market settings in terms of prices and households' perception of the market. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
