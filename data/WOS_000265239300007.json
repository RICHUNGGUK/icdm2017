These are periodicity in groups and the common coset range property of two functions having identical ranges within each coset of some normal subgroup. Our periodicity tester is efficient in Abelian groups and generalizes, in several aspects, previous periodicity testers. This is achieved by introducing a technique refining the majority correction process widely used for proving robustness of algebraic properties. The periodicity tester in non-Abelian groups and the common coset range tester are query efficient.", "paper_title": "Quantum Testers for Hidden Group Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000265239300007"}
