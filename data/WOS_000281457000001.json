We say that a collection C of subsets of S has the consecutive ones property if there exist a linear order on S and a 0-1 matrix M, where M(ij) = 1 if and only if the jth element is in the ith set in C. such that all l's appear consecutively in each row of M. A set X is an element of C is hit by a subset S' subset of S if X boolean AND S' not equal 0. Let C(r) (red collection) and C(b) (blue collection) be two collections of subsets of S respectively. The red-blue hitting set problem asks for a subset S' subset of S such that all sets in the blue collection are hit by S', while the number of sets in the red collection hit by S' has to be minimum. We present a shortest-path based algorithm with time complexity O(vertical bar C(b)parallel to S vertical bar + vertical bar C(r)parallel to S vertical bar + vertical bar S vertical bar(2)) for this problem with C(r) boolean OR C(b) having the consecutive ones property, which improves the previous time bound O(vertical bar C(r)parallel to C(b)parallel to S vertical bar(2)) by Dom et al.
