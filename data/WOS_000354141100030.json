The dynamics can be determined classically via the Lorentz force and Landau-Lifshitz equations or, alternatively, via the simulation of photon emission events determined by strong-field quantum-electrodynamics amplitudes and implemented using Monte-Carlo routines. Multiple background fields can be included in the simulation and, where applicable, the propagation direction, field type (plane wave, focussed paraxial, constant crossed, or constant magnetic), and time envelope of each can be independently specified. Program summary Program title: SIMLA Catalogue identifier: AEWD_v1_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEWD_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.acuk/licence/licence.html No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 4536 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 38351 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran. Computer: Home and office-spec desktop and laptop machines, networked or stand alone. Operating system: Linux, Mac OS, Windows, with Fortran compiler. Matlab required to exploit full post-processing features. RAM: Varies greatly depending on calculation to be performed. Supplementary material: A SIMLA manual with tutorial type examples is available. Classification: 15. Nature of problem: Calculation of dynamics and emission spectra of charged particles in multiple (intense) laser and other background fields, including effects of classical and quantum radiation reaction. Solution method: Solution of the Landau-Lifshitz equation (or simply Lorentz equation for weak fields), or alternatively, via the simulation of photon emission events determined by strong-field quantum-electrodynamics amplitudes and implemented using Monte-Carlo type routines. Restrictions: As a single particle code, the parameters are restricted to a regime in which pair production does not occur. The program will abort with an explicit error message if such a parameter regime does occur in a given simulation. Additional comments: Classical spectra calculated separately in independent Matlab program 'spectrum.m'. Manual included with tutorial style examples Running time: Varies greatly depending on calculation requested, from seconds to hours. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
