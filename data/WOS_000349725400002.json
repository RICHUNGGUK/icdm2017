This ontology was developed to provide an unambiguous definition of core notions of robotics and related topics. It is based on SUMO, a top-level ontology of general concepts, and on ISO 8373:2012 standard, developed by the ISO/TC184/SC2 Working Group, which defines in natural language important terms in the domain of Robotics and Automation (R&A). In this paper, we introduce a set of ontologies that complement CORA with notions such as industrial design and positioning. We also introduce updates to CORA in order to provide more ontologically sound representations of autonomy and of robot parts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
