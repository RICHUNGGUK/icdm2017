In this study, we present an approach based on a multi-population framework hybridizing these methods to solve dynamic environment problems. A key feature of the hybrid approach is the utilization of offline and online learning methods at successive stages. The performance of our approach along with the influence of different heuristic selection methods used within the selection hyper-heuristic is investigated over a range of dynamic environments produced by a well known benchmark generator as well as a real world problem, referred to as the Unit Commitment Problem. The empirical results show that the proposed approach using a particular hyper-heuristic outperforms some of the best known approaches in literature on the dynamic environment problems dealt with.", "paper_title": "A hybrid multi-population framework for dynamic environments combining online and offline learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000327086200010"}
