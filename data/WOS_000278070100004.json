We develop a minimum theory by which we prove that the index of an event structure of degree 3 is bounded by a linear function of the height. The main theorem of the paper states that event structures of degree 3 whose causality order is a tree have a nice labelling with 3 colors. We exemplify how to use this theorem to construct upper bounds for the index of other event structures of degree 3.
