The injectivity (one-to-one property) of rational Bezier curve as a mapping function is equivalent to the curve without self-intersections. We present a geometric condition on the control polygon which is equivalent to the injectivity of rational Bezier curve with this control polygon for all possible choices of weights. The proof is based on the degree elevation and toric degeneration of rational Bezier curve. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
