With features extracted from a driving posture dataset created at Southeast University (SEU), the holdout and cross-validation experiments on driving posture classification are conducted by MLP classifiers, compared with the Intersection Kernel Support Vector Machines (IKSVMs), the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier and the Parzen classifier. The experimental results show that feature extraction based on GHM multwavelet transform and MLP classifier, using softmax activation function in the output layer and hyperbolic tangent activation function in the hidden layer, offer the best classification performance compared to IKSVMs, kNN and Parzen classifiers. The experimental results also show that talking on a cellular phone is the most difficult one to classify among four predefined classes, which are 83.01% and 84.04% in the holdout and cross-validation experiments respectively. These results show the effectiveness of the feature extraction approach using GHM multiwavelet transform and MLP classifier in automatically understanding and characterizing driver behaviors towards Human-centric Driver Assistance Systems (HDAS).
