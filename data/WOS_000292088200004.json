Using this Green's function the dynamic behavior of the array can be described for any arbitrary free running frequency of elements of the oscillator array. Beam steering is realized via detuning the edge oscillators of the array from a reference frequency and the beam direction is controlled by the amount of detuning for each oscillator at the edge. Some detuning functions such as sinusoidal, triangular and rectangular ones have been applied and, the resulting array patterns are compared with one another. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
