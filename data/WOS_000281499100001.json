The identification of physical and geometric parameters using experimental measurements is required in many applications. In this work a boundary element formulation to identify boundary and interface values as well as material properties is proposed. In particular the proposed formulation is dedicated to identifying material parameters when a cohesive crack model is assumed for 2D problems. A computer code is developed and implemented using the BEM multi-region technique and regularisation methods to perform the inverse analysis. Several examples are shown to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
