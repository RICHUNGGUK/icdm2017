The design principles of these schemes are examined in detail. It is found that the selection of appropriate flux-limiters is a key design element in developing these schemes. Different flux-limiter forms (CFL-dependent or CFL-independent, and various limiting criteria) are shown to lead to different performances in accuracy and convergence. Furthermore, a refined SS-TVD flux-limiter, referred to henceforth as TCDF (Third-order Continuously Differentiable Function), is proposed for steady-state calculations based on the review. To evaluate the performance of the newly proposed scheme, many existing classical SS-TVD limiters are compared with the TCDF in eight two-dimensional test cases. The numerical results clearly show that the TCDF results in an improved overall performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
