Each logical qubit, composed of two physical qubits with a decoherence-free subspace, is immune to a collective noise and can carry one bit of information in theory. Although the receiver should prepare entangled two-photon quantum systems, he can read out the information encoded by the sender with two unitary operations on two photons, resorting to only two single-photon measurements, not Bell-state measurements, which makes these protocols simpler than others in experiment. These two QKD protocols are deterministic, not random, which makes the classical information exchanged be reduced largely. Also, they have a high intrinsic efficiency.", "paper_title": "FAULT-TOLERATE QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION OVER A COLLECTIVE-NOISE CHANNEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000287366900003"}
