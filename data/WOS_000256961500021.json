Since attribute reduction is an NP-hard problem, it is necessary to investigate fast and effective approximate algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new approach based on ant colony optimization (ACO) for attribute reduction. To verify the proposed algorithm, numerical experiments are carried out on thirteen small or medium-sized datasets and three gene expression datasets. The results demonstrate that this algorithm can provide competitive solutions efficiently. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
