We propose an approach based on coverings and packings of the face lattice of the corresponding convex support polytopes and results from coding theory. We show that m = q(N-1) is the smallest number for which any distribution of N q-ary variables can be written as mixture of m independent q-ary variables. Furthermore, we show that any distribution of N binary variables is a mixture of m = 2(N-(k+1)) (1 + 1/(2(k) - 1)) elements of the k-interaction exponential family.", "paper_title": "MIXTURE DECOMPOSITIONS OF EXPONENTIAL FAMILIES USING A DECOMPOSITION OF THEIR SAMPLE SPACES", "paper_id": "WOS:000317087400002"}
