The high resolution radar range profiles were selected as the feature vectors for data representation, and the product spectrum based features were introduced to improve classification performance. Simulations are presented to identify the four different aircrafts. The results show that the SARPROP algorithm combined with product spectrum based features is effective and robust for the application of radar target recognition.", "paper_title": "Feed-forward neural network using SARPROP algorithm and its application in radar target recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000054"}
