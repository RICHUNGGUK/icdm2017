In this topology, the retimed data is generated within the circuit and no extra circuit is required. Furthermore, the error and reference signals are independent of delay time through gates and thus, no extra replica circuit is needed to compensate such delay. Designed in a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology, the proposed 10 Gb/s PD consumes 30mA from a 1.8V supply, resulting in a lower power consumption for high-speed applications compared to conventional topologies.", "paper_title": "A 1/4-RATE LINEAR PHASE DETECTOR FOR HIGH SPEED PLL-BASED CLOCK AND DATA RECOVERY CIRCUIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000336150600016"}
