In this paper, we present a new method to forecast enrollments based on automatic clustering techniques and fuzzy logical relationships. First, we present an automatic clustering algorithm for clustering historical enrollments into intervals of different lengths. Then, each obtained interval will be divided into p sub-intervals, where p >= 1. Based on the new obtained intervals and fuzzy logical relationships, we present a new method for forecasting the enrollments of the University of Alabama. The proposed method gets a higher average forecasting accuracy rate than the existing methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
