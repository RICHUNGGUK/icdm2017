The fractional division is implemented by a nested fractional topology, which is constructed from a dual-modulus divide-by-(N-1/16)/N divider to divide the VCO outputs as a first division period and a fractional control circuit to establish a second division period to cause the overall fractional division. The dual-modulus divider introduces a delay-locked-loop network to achieve phase compensation. Operating at the frequency of 3.2 GHz, the measured peak power reduction is around 16 dB for a deviation of 0.37% and a frequency modulation of 33 kHz. The circuit occupies 1.4 x 1.4 mm(2) in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process and consumes 52 row.", "paper_title": "A 3.2-GHz down-spread spectrum clock generator using a nested fractional topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000253656200009"}
