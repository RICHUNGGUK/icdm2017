The measured ECG signals are encoded using a lossless antidictionary encoder, and the system subsequently uses the compression rate to distinguish between normal beats and arrhythmia. An automated training data procedure is used to construct the automatons, which are probabilistic models used to compress the ECG signals, and to determine the threshold value for detecting the arrhythmia. Real-time computer simulations with samples from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database show that the averages of sensitivity and specificity of the proposed system are 97.8% and 96.4% for premature ventricular contraction detection, respectively. The automatons are constructed using training data and comprise only 11 kilobytes on average. The low complexity and low memory requirements make the system particularly suitable for implementation in portable ECG monitors.", "paper_title": "Real-Time and Memory-Efficient Arrhythmia Detection in ECG Monitors Using Antidictionary Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000329006900004"}
