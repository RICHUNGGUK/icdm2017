We consider the situations of weak and strong magnetic fields as well as electron temperature nonequilibrium and the linear systems are investigated in their natural constrained singular symmetric form. Stationary iterative techniques are considered with new more singular formulations of the transport linear systems as well as orthogonal residuals algorithms. The new formulations are derived by considering generalized inverses with null-spaces of increasing dimension. Numerical tests are performed with high temperature air and iterative techniques lead to fast and accurate evaluation of the transport coefficients for all ionization levels and magnetic field intensities.
