Knee-function characteristics are collected using a three-dimensional motion-analysis technique. The classification method transforms these characteristics into sets of three belief values: a level of belief that a subject has OA knee function, a level of belief that a subject has NL knee function, and an associated level of uncertainty. The evidence from each characteristic is then combined into a final set of belief values, which is used to classify subjects. The final belief values are subsequently represented on a simplex plot, which enables the classification of a subject to be represented visually. The control parameters, which are intrinsic to the classification method, can be chosen by an expert or by an optimization approach. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, the classification accuracy of the proposed method is shown to compare favorably with that of a well-established classifier-linear discriminant analysis. Overall, this study introduces a visual tool that can be used to support orthopaedic surgeons when making clinical decisions.", "paper_title": "Classification of osteoarthritic and normal knee function using three-dimensional motion analysis and the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence", "paper_id": "WOS:000234234900014"}
