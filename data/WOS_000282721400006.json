Parametric tabu-search for mixed integer programs. Computers and Operations Research 2006; 33: 2449-94.]. This approach solves a series of linear programming problems by incorporating branching inequalities as weighted terms in the objective function. New strategies are proposed for uncovering feasible and high-quality solutions and extensive computational tests are performed on instances from the literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
