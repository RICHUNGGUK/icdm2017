In this paper, we introduce an enhanced information server (EIS) to accelerate vertical handover procedures in IEEE 802.21 media independent handover (MIH) networks. Based on the EIS, we propose an improved vertical handover procedure in which wireless channel conditions are estimated by exploiting spatial and temporal locality at the EIS, and therefore time consuming channel scanning procedures can be skipped. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reduce the vertical handover latency under diverse environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
