In 2006, Tsai and Chang proposed an authentication mechanism that integrated authentication of GSM/GPRS mobile cellular networks with WLANs access control. However, their scheme neither resists denial of service attack nor anonymity. In addition, the mobile cellular systems gradually evolve into 3G. Therefore, in this paper, we elaborate a denial of service attack for Tsai and Chang's scheme, and then propose two versions of 3GPP SIM-based schemes to overcome these drawbacks according to the status of registration. Meanwhile, since our schemes are based on 3GPP, they can successfully integrate 3G authentication into WLANs access control with security and efficiency.", "paper_title": "3GPP SIM-BASED AUTHENTICATION SCHEMES FOR WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275222300004"}
