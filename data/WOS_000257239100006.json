We propose a high-quality analytical placement algorithm considering wirelength, preplaced blocks, and density based on the log-sum-exp wirelength model proposed by Naylor et al. and the multilevel framework. To handle preplaced blocks, we use a two-stage smoothing technique, i.e., Gaussian smoothing followed by level smoothing, to facilitate block spreading during global placement (GP). The density is controlled by white-space reallocation using partitioning and cut-line shifting during GP and cell sliding during detailed placement. We further use the conjugate gradient method with dynamic step-size control to speed up the GP and macro shifting to find better macro positions. Experimental results show that our placer obtains very high-quality results.", "paper_title": "NTUplace3: An analytical placer for large-scale mixed-size designs with preplaced blocks and density constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000257239100006"}
