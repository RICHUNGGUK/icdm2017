The principle of this simulation optimization with Heuristic Transformation (SOHT) and the methods - matrix analysis and transformation that are used to realize the algorithm are first described. Then, the algorithm is applied to solving the Vehicle Routing Problems with rigid time windows. Finally, a system that can execute the computational experiments is presented. The results show the efficiency and effectiveness of SOHT.", "paper_title": "A simulation optimization algorithm with heuristic transformation and its application to vehicle routing problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000255957800017"}
