In this work, we investigate the reversibility in SNPA systems as well as the computational power of reversible SNPA systems. It is proved that reversible SNPA systems are universal, where the forgetting rules and the feature of delay in spiking rules are not used, and each neuron contains only one spiking rule. The result suggests that the astrocytes play a key role in the functioning of reversible SNPA systems.", "paper_title": "Reversible Spiking Neural P Systems with Astrocytes", "paper_id": "WOS:000349462400004"}
