Constructing proofs is in Hoare logic. Discovering programs' invariants is done by abstract interpreters. One problem of this approach is that abstract interpreters often compute invariants that are not needed for the proof goal. The reason is that the abstract interpreter does not know what the proof goal is, so it simply tries to find as strong invariants as possible. These unnecessary invariants increase the size of the constructed proofs. Unless the proof-construction phase is notified which invariants are not needed, it blindly proves all the computed invariants. In this article, we present a framework for designing algorithms, called abstract-value slicers, that slice out unnecessary invariants from the results of forward abstract interpretation. The framework provides a generic abstract-value slicer that can be instantiated into a slicer for a particular abstract interpretation. Such an instantiated abstract-value slicer works as a postprocessor to an abstract interpretation in the whole proof-construction process, and notifies to the next proof-construction phase which invariants it does not have to prove. Using the framework, we designed an abstract-value slicer for an existing relational analysis and applied it on programs. In this experiment, the slicer identified 62%-81% of the computed invariants as unnecessary, and resulted in 52%-84% reduction in the size of constructed proofs.", "paper_title": "Goal-directed weakening of abstract interpretation results", "paper_id": "WOS:000250967500010"}
