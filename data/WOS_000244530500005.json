The key point of all critical care transport is the continuous monitoring of vital signs. Also, with the growing popularity of wireless technology in the health care area, there is a pressing need to have a proper system in place for patient identification. Errors in patient identification and hence improper administrator of medication can lead to disastrous results. This paper proposes a mobile physiological patient monitoring system, which integrates current mobile smart phone, wireless sensor network, Bluetooth, and RFID patient identification systems for patient monitoring. This system enables continuous monitoring and patient identification during intra-hospital or inter-hospital patient transport.", "paper_title": "A mobile physiological monitoring system for patient transport", "paper_id": "WOS:000244530500005"}
