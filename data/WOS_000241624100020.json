The OS provides support for both periodic sensor sampling and sequential appliation logic. Core component is a lightweight real-time runtime system guaranteeing predictable real-time behavior of periodic sampling processes. The design utilizes a novel method, called buffer feedback scheduling (BFS), to adapt the system under unpredictable workload. Processes are automatically coordinated and expensive hardware accesses are reduced when the feedback indicates that the results do not contribute to the application. Real-time behavior is guaranteed throughout the entire runtime. Theoretical analysis and implementation in a Ubicomp application study on the Particle Computer sensor platform demonstrate a significant performance step-up when utilizing BFS.", "paper_title": "Buffer feedback scheduling: Runtime adaptation of ubicomp applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624100020"}
