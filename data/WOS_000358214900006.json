Learning system is necessary to make the learning process more efficient for users. Ubiquitous based learning (U-learning) is a state-of-the-art mechanism in the education area, applying many types of multimedia resources and network technology today. However, U-learning is not enough to provide information and learning course process to users about sharing the learning resources and collaborating between user and teacher. In this paper, we propose a learning system in cloud computing environment that allows sharing the learning multimedia resources with users and collaboration on discussion processes about learning contents using SNS. It also provides user oriented learning processes through each learning unit.", "paper_title": "User tailored cloud-learning system using SNS and learning resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000358214900006"}
