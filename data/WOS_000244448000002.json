The paper describes the strategies we employed, and the solutions to problems encountered. We believe we have a good model for corpus creation for lexicography, and others may find it useful as a blueprint. The corpus has two parts, one Irish, the other Hiberno-English (English as spoken in Ireland). We describe its design, collection and encoding.", "paper_title": "Efficient corpus development for lexicography: building the New Corpus for Ireland", "paper_id": "WOS:000244448000002"}
