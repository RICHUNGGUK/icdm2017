Firstly, a new distributed event-triggered communication scheme is proposed to determine whether or not each sensor's current sampled-data should be broadcast and transmitted for filter design. Each sensor node is capable to make its own decision to broadcast and to transmit current sampled-data only when its local measurement output error exceeds a specified threshold. Secondly, under the distributed event-triggered communication scheme, the resultant filtering error system, which includes information of communication delays, is transformed into a system with multiple delays. Sufficient conditions on the existence of desired distributed event-triggered H-infinity filters are derived such that the resultant filtering error system is asymptotically stable with prescribed weighting average H-infinity performance. The trade-off analysis between communication resource utilization and weighting average H-infinity performance is carried out. Thirdly, a co-design algorithm for simultaneously determining the filter parameters and the threshold parameters is developed. Finally, a benchmark example is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
