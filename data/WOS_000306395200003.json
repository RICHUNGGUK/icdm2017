Four groups of concrete mixtures were prepared and the corresponding concrete properties, such as workability, compression strength, ultrasonic velocity, surface resistivity and chloride ion penetration, were measured and finally the results are interpreted in terms of \"coating thickness\". The result shows as the coating thickness of the concrete is higher than critical one, the coating thickness on aggregate does affect the workability, and whatever workability is required the superplasticizer can be adjusted to achieve the demand workability. Under a fixed paste quality at the same age, coating paste thickness is inversely proportional to the concrete properties, especially as the coating thickness gets thinner.", "paper_title": "An approach of using ideal gradating curve and coating paste thickness to design concrete performance-(2) Experimental work", "paper_id": "WOS:000306395200003"}
