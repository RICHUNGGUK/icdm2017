While the case of single durations is easily handled from the semantics point of view, intervals of durations raise several interesting questions. Moreover subtle algorithmic problems have to be handled when dealing with model checking. We propose a semantics for which we develop efficient (PTIME) algorithms for timed ATL without equality constraints, while the general case is shown to be EXPTIME-complete.", "paper_title": "Model-checking timed ATL for durational concurrent game structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241576400018"}
