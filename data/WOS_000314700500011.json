In this paper, we introduce a slight-rotating operation for cross-sections of polyhedra. By applying the operation to suitably chosen cross-sections, we prove that a convex polyhedron is a universal tiler if and only if it is a tetrahedron or a pentahedron with parallel facets.", "paper_title": "Determining All Universal Tilers", "paper_id": "WOS:000314700500011"}
