Among other benefits, it is expected that VANETs will support applications and services targeting the increase of safety on the road, and assist in improving the efficiency of the road transportation network. However, several serious challenges remain to be solved before efficient and secure VANET technology becomes available, one of them been efficient authentication of messages in a VANET. In this paper, we analyse a recent authentication scheme for VANETs introduced by Lee et al. Unfortunately this scheme is vulnerable to the impersonation attack so that a malicious user can generate a valid signature on behalf of the other vehicles. Based on the attack, we propose an improved scheme and introduce a simulation expressing the efficiency of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "A secure authentication scheme for VANETs with batch verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000356096800022"}
