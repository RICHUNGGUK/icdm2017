Following the worst-case deterministic model, our objective is to maximize the worst-case harvested energy for the energy receiver while guaranteeing that the rate for the information receiver is above a threshold for all possible channel realizations. Such problem is nonconvex with infinite number of constraints. Using certain transformation techniques, we convert this problem into a relaxed semidefinite programming problem (SDP) which can be solved efficiently. We further show that the solution of the relaxed SDP problem is always rank-one. This indicates that the relaxation is tight and we can get the optimal solution for the original problem. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Robust Beamforming for Wireless Information and Power Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200028"}
