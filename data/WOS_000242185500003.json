In this study, we are concerned with the development of logic networks composed of fuzzy neurons. The main phase of the design includes the granulation of the output space (via triangular fuzzy sets) being realized with the use of fuzzy equalization. In the sequel these fuzzy sets are used to guide the construction of a family of fuzzy sets in the input space. Further processing of the resulting fuzzy sets deals with some additional aggregation of those that are not sufficiently distinct. This helps reduce the size of the logic network. We include comprehensive experimentation and offer a thorough interpretation of the networks. Experiments concerning real-world continuous data help evaluate the network's appealing properties: transparent interpretability and practical feasibility.
