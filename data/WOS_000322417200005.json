It is crucial to evaluate the turning corner effect in three-dimensional (3D) slope engineering because this effect may influence the slope stability. CCM determines the criticality of opposing effects by comparing the stabilities of the different components of a turning corner slope (turning, virtual and common components). These effects depend on the slope angle and the cohesion and internal friction angle. CCM determines the critical slope angles for a turning slope with different shear strengths. These results are presented graphically to facilitate the safe and economic design and the reinforcement of corner turning slopes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
