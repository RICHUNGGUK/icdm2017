Intuitionistic fuzzy set takes into account the uncertainty in assignment of membership degree known as hesitation degree. Also a new distance measure, called intuitionistic fuzzy divergence, has been proposed. With this proposed distance measure, edge detection is carried out, and the results are found better with respect to the previous methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
