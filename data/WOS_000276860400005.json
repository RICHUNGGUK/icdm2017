Unlike the original algorithm, the method introduced here uses a polynomial basis representation. As the main contribution, the proposed method reduces both the number of required multiplications and squaring operations by applying a modified decomposition for m - 1. When the field is generated with an irreducible trinomial, our proposal shows almost the same practical complexity as the TYT algorithm using normal basis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
