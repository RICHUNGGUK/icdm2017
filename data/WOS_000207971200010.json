The data aggregation tree contains the sink node, all the source nodes, and some other non-source nodes. Our goal of constructing such a data aggregation tree is to minimize the number of non-source nodes to be included in the tree so as to save energies. We prove that the data aggregation tree problem is NP-hard and then propose an approximation algorithm with a performance ratio of four and a greedy algorithm. We also give a distributed version of the approximation algorithm. Extensive simulations are performed to study the performance of the proposed algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithms can find a tree of a good approximation to the optimal tree and has a high degree of scalability.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithm for constructing data aggregation trees for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971200010"}
