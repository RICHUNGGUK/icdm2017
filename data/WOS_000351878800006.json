Identity-based versions of proxy ring signatures employ identity strings in place of randomly generated public keys. Our contribution is twofold. First, we formalize a security model for identity-based proxy ring signatures. We note that there exists no formal security model for identity-based proxy ring signatures prior to our work. Second, we present the first provably secure identity-based proxy ring signature scheme using a new paradigm called sequential aggregation. The construction is proved secure, under the one-wayness assumption of RSA, in the random oracle model by presenting a new forking lemma. We should highlight that the proxy key exposure attack cannot be applied to our scheme. Further, in contrast to the existing schemes that are based on pairings, our scheme is based on RSA; therefore, it outperforms the existing schemes in terms of efficiency and practicality.
