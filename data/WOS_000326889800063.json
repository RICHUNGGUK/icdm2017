In this paper, fuzzy grids-based association rules mining, as an effective data mining technique, is used for feature selection in misuse detection application in computer networks. The main idea of this algorithm is to find the relationships between items in large datasets so that it detects correlations between inputs of the system and then eliminates the redundant inputs. To classify the attacks, a fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is employed whose training parameters are optimized by gravitational search algorithm. The performance of the proposed system is compared with some other machine learning methods in the same application. Experimental results show that the proposed system, when choosing optimum \"feature subset size-adjustment\" parameter, performs better in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and cost per example in classification problems. In addition, employing the reduced-size feature set results in more than 8.4 percent reduction in computational complexity.", "paper_title": "Gravitational search algorithm-optimized neural misuse detector with selected features by fuzzy grids-based association rules mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800063"}
