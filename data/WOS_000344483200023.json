MOSFET transistors in weak-inversion region and translinear principle for the temperature cancellation were used. The functionality of the proposed design confirmed with 0.35 mu m CMOS process technology using +/- 0.75 V supply voltage. Results demonstrate the theoretical analysis and verify the efficiency of the proposed structure compared with previously reported designs. Around 96 linear-in-dB output current range is achieved with +/- 0.5 dB linearity error over normalized input range from -5.75 to 5.75. The maximum deviation in the output current is +/- 1.27 and +/- 3.35 dB due to 100 degrees C temperature variations and +/- 10% supply voltage fluctuation, respectively.", "paper_title": "A 6.13 mu W and 96 dB CMOS Exponential Generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000344483200023"}
