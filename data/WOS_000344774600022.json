AliView handles alignments of unlimited size in the formats most commonly used, i.e. FASTA, Phylip, Nexus, Clustal and MSF. The intuitive graphical interface makes it easy to inspect, sort, delete, merge and realign sequences as part of the manual filtering process of large datasets. AliView also works as an easy-to-use alignment editor for small as well as large datasets.", "paper_title": "AliView: a fast and lightweight alignment viewer and editor for large datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000344774600022"}
