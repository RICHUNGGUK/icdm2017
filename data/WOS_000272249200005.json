In the approach, specific to a patient group, a regulatory network is simulated using a fully-connected neural network and is optimized towards minimizing a novel energy function that is defined as a measure of disagreement between the input and output of the network. The nonlinear version of the network is achieved by applying a sigmoid function. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches can capture regulatory patterns associated with SARS and efficiently implement early prediction of SARS.", "paper_title": "MINING PROTEIN REGULATORY RELATIONSHIPS USING NEURAL NETWORK METHODS FOR EARLY PREDICTION OF SARS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272249200005"}
