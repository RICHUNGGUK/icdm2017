In this paper, we present a maze routing based heuristics to solve the obstacle-avoiding RSMT (OARSMT) problem. Our approach can handle multi-pin nets in good quality and reasonable running time. We also present an implementation of the heuristics in parallel approach with the aid of graphic processing units (GPU). The parallel algorithm is implemented by using CUDA and has been tested on a NVIDIA graphic card. Our experimental results show that our parallel algorithm has promising speedups over our sequential approach. This work demonstrates that we can apply a parallel algorithm to solve the OARSMT problem with the aid of GPU. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
