It is shown that most codes do not have a finite pseudocodeword redundancy. Also, upper bounds on the pseudocodeword redundancy for some families of codes, including codes based on designs, are provided. The pseudocodeword redundancies for all codes of small length (at most 9) are computed. Furthermore, comprehensive results are provided on the cases of cyclic codes of length at most 250 for which the eigenvalue bound of Vontobel and Koetter is sharp.", "paper_title": "On the Pseudocodeword Redundancy of Binary Linear Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000305575000047"}
