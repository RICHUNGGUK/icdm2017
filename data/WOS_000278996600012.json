The current work identifies weakness and limitation of existing CA-based byte ECC and proposes an improved CA-based double byte ECC which overcomes the identified weakness. The code is very much suited from VLSI design viewpoint and requires significantly less hardware and power for decoding compared to the existing techniques employed for Reed-Solomon (RS) Codes. Also it has been shown that the CA-based scheme can easily be extended for correcting more than two byte errors.", "paper_title": "New Architectural Design of CA-Based Codec", "paper_id": "WOS:000278996600012"}
