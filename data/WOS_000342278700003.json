In particular, solution methods from the hierarchical game theory can be adopted. Here, we focus on solving problems that belong to the specific class of reverse Stackelberg games. In this game, a follower player acts subsequent to the leader's revelation of her so-called leader function, which maps the leader decision space to the follower decision space. In general, the problem of finding a leader function such that the leader's objective function is optimized while taking into account a follower decision that is optimal for the follower, is difficult to solve. We provide a structured solution approach for the class of nonlinear leader functions and make a comparison with the evolutionary approaches proposed in the literature. In particular, a continuous multilevel optimization approach and a gridding approach are proposed to compute an optimal leader function based on basis functions. Also, leader functions derived by interpolation are discussed. All approaches are illustrated and compared in a worked example, in which the required computation times and deviation from the desired solution are considered.", "paper_title": "On Systematic Computation of Optimal Nonlinear Solutions for the Reverse Stackelberg Game", "paper_id": "WOS:000342278700003"}
