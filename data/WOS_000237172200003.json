One of the most common distance join queries is the closest-pair query ( CPQ). Given two datasets D-A and D-B the CPQ retrieves the pair ( a, b), where a 2 DA and b is an element of D-B, having the smallest distance between all pairs of objects. An extension to this problem is to generate the k closest pairs of objects ( k-CPQ). In several cases spatial constraints are applied, and object pairs that are retrieved must also satisfy these constraints. Although the application of spatial constraints seems natural towards a more focused search, only recently they have been studied for the CPQ problem with the restriction that D-A = D-B. In this work, we focus on constrained closest-pair queries, between two distinct datasets D-A and D-B, where objects from D-A must be enclosed by a spatial region R. Several algorithms are presented and evaluated using real-life and synthetic datasets. Among them, a heap-based method enhanced with batch capabilities outperforms the other approaches as it is demonstrated by an extensive performance evaluation.", "paper_title": "Processing distance join queries with constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000237172200003"}
