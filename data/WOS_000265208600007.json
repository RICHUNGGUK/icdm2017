However, there exist problems whose assessments need to be represented by means of unbalanced linguistic term sets, i.e. using term sets that are not uniformly and symmetrically distributed. The aim of this paper is to present a consensus model for GDM problems with unbalanced fuzzy linguistic information. This consensus model is based on both a fuzzy linguistic methodology to deal with unbalanced linguistic term sets and two consensus criteria, consensus degrees, and proximity measures. To do so, we use a new fuzzy linguistic methodology improving another approach to manage unbalanced fuzzy linguistic information,(1) (Int. J. Intell. Syst. 22(11) (2007) 1197-1214), which uses the linguistic 2-tuple model as representation base of unbalanced fuzzy linguistic information. In addition, the consensus model presents a feedback mechanism to help experts for reaching the highest degree of consensus possible. There are two main advantages provided by this consensus model. First, its ability to cope with GDM problems with unbalanced fuzzy linguistic information overcoming the problem of finding different discrimination levels in linguistic term sets. Second, it supports the consensus process automatically, avoiding the possible subjectivity that the moderator can introduce in this phase.", "paper_title": "A CONSENSUS MODEL FOR GROUP DECISION MAKING PROBLEMS WITH UNBALANCED FUZZY LINGUISTIC INFORMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000265208600007"}
