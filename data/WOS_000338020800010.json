Three types of attributes are used for image representation: statistical, spectral, and segmentation features and regional descriptors. Classification is performed by nearest neighbor using different p-norms defined in the corresponding spaces of attributes. In this approach, each attribute together with its corresponding type of the analysis (local or global) and the distance criterion (norm or cosine), define a different classifier. The classification is unsupervised since no class information is used to improve the design of the different classifiers. Three different versions of ensemble classifiers are proposed in this paper: CAV1, CAV2, and CBAG, being the main differences among them the way the image candidates that perform the consensus are selected. The main results shown in this paper are the following: 1. The statistical attributes (local histogram and percentiles) are the individual classifiers that provided the higher accuracies, followed by the spectral methods (DWT), and the regional features (texture analysis). 2. No single attribute is able to provide systematically 100% accuracy over the ORL database. 3. The accuracy and stability of the classification is increased by consensus classification (ensemble learning techniques). 4. Optimum results are obtained by reducing the number of classifiers taking into account their diversity, and by optimizing the parameters of these classifiers using a member of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) family. These results are in accord with the conclusions that are presented in the literature using ensemble learning methodologies, that is, it is possible to build strong classifiers by assembling different weak (or simple) classifiers based on different and diverse image attributes. Due to these encouraging results, future research will be devoted to the use of supervised ensemble techniques in face recognition and in other important biometric problems.", "paper_title": "UNSUPERVISED ENSEMBLE CLASSIFICATION FOR BIOMETRIC APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000338020800010"}
