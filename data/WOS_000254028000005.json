The system consists of a master and a slave subsystem with different structure. These two subsystems are governed by bilateral control scheme. For master slave manipulation systems, nonlinear interferences may deteriorate performance in the bilateral control systems. To realize a sense of force for slave manipulation, the bilateral control scheme together with a decoupling control for slave is introduced to the master manipulator with different configurations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.", "paper_title": "Force display for master slave manipulator with different configurations", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000005"}
