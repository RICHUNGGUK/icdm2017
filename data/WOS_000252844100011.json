The output triangulation is guaranteed to be homeomorphic to Sigma. We also prove that the triangulation has well-shaped triangles, large dihedral angles, and a small size. The only assumption we make is that the input surface representation is amenable to certain types of computations, namely, computations of the intersection points of a line and Sigma, computations of the critical points in a given direction, and computations of certain silhouette points.", "paper_title": "Sampling and meshing a surface with guaranteed topology and geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000252844100011"}
