However, they can be slow during testing because of the possibly large number of support vectors obtained. Recently, Wu et al. (2005) proposed a sparse formulation that restricts the SVM to use a small number of expansion vectors. In this paper, we further extend this idea by integrating with techniques from multiple-kernel learning (MKL). The kernel function in this sparse SVM formulation no longer needs to be fixed but can be automatically learned as a linear combination of kernels. Two formulations of such sparse multiple-kernel classifiers are proposed. The first one is based on a convex combination of the given base kernels, while the second one uses a convex combination of the so-called \"equivalent\" kernels. Empirically, the second formulation is particularly competitive. Experiments on a large number of toy and real-world data sets show that the resultant classifier is compact and accurate, and can also be easily trained by simply alternating linear program and standard SVM solver.", "paper_title": "Building Sparse Multiple-Kernel SVM Classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000265748600007"}
