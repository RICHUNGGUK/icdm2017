In the concerned model, stochastic disturbances are described by a Brownian motion, and time-varying delay d(k) satisfies d(m) <= d(k) <= d(M). Based on the delay partitioning idea and some inequalities, a new stability criterion with less conservatism in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is proposed by introducing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional combined with a free-weighting matrix method. The condition can be checked by utilizing some numerical software and a numerical example is provided to show the usefulness of the proposed condition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
