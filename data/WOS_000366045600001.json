In order to extend a traditional CDN and enable it to offer hybrid content delivery service, we have modified a traditional domain name system-based request routing mechanism. The proposed scheme relies on an oligopolistic mechanism to balance the load on the edge servers and employs a truthful profit-maximizing auction to maximize the contribution of users in the P2P content delivery. In particular, economics of content delivery in HCDNs is studied, and it is shown that through our request routing mechanism, it is possible to deliver higher quality of service to majority of end-users, increase the net profit of the HCDN provider and decrease the content distribution cost at the same time.
