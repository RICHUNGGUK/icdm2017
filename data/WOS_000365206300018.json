The proposed flow is exemplified through two commonly used amplifier topologies. Specifically, input-referred switching noise is introduced as the first figure-of-merit and compared with the well-known equivalent input device noise through analytic expressions. The comparison is achieved as a function of multiple parameters that characterize switching noise in the time domain (modeled as a decaying sine wave), such as peak amplitude, period, oscillation frequency within each period, and damping coefficient. The analytic expressions used to obtain input-referred switching and device noise are verified with SPICE simulations. These expressions are utilized to develop dominance regions for both noise sources. Furthermore, time-domain switching noise amplitude (at the bulk node) at which the input device and switching noise magnitude are equal (in the frequency domain) is determined as the second figure-of-merit, providing guidelines for the signal isolation process. Reverse body biasing is also proposed to alleviate the effect of switching noise by weakening the bulk-to-input transfer function as opposed to reducing the switching noise amplitude at the bulk nodes. It is demonstrated that this method has a negligible effect on primary design objectives of the victim circuit while reducing the input-referred switching noise by up to 10 dB. As a case study, the proposed flow is applied to a potentiostat circuitry where input sensitivity is of primary importance.", "paper_title": "Figures-of-Merit to Evaluate the Significance of Switching Noise in Analog Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000365206300018"}
