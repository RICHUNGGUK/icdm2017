The application of D-S theory is critically dependent on the availability of the basic probability assignment (BPA). The determination of BPA is still an open issue. A non-parametric method to obtain BPA is proposed in this paper. This method can handle multi-attribute datasets in classification problems. Each attribute value of the dataset sample is treated as a stochastic quantity. Its non-parametric probability density function (PDF) is calculated using the training data, which can be regarded as the probability model for the corresponding attribute. The BPA function is then constructed based on the relationship between the test sample and the probability models. The missing attribute values in datasets are treated as ignorance in the framework of the evidence theory. This method does not have the assumption of any particular distribution. As a result, it can be flexibly used in many engineering applications. The obtained BPA can avoid high conflict between evidence, which is desired in data fusion. Several benchmark classification problems are used to demonstrate the proposed method and to compare against existing methods. The constructed classifier based on the proposed method compares well to the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "A non-parametric method to determine basic probability assignment for classification problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342426700002"}
