This is more meaningful for n large, since the computation of permanent is proved to be a #P-complete problem in counting. However structural parameters p,q and r become all zero for isolated-pentagon isomers when n is large (say n >= 60). New structural parameters v, v and w; are introduced in this paper, which count two or three contiguous hexagons. The stepwise regression model is used to predict the permanents of adjacency matrices of fullerenes. Computational results show that our new models are simple, reliable and efficient.", "paper_title": "New structural parameters and permanents of adjacency matrices of fullerenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240967000005"}
