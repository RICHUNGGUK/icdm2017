The architecture includes two layers: 1) a conceptual layer and 2) a data and communication layer. On the one hand, the conceptual layer based on ontologies is proposed to unify the management procedure and integrate incoming data from all the sources involved in the telemonitoring process. On the other hand, the data and communication layer based on REST web service (WS) technologies is proposed to provide practical backup to the use of the ontology, to provide a real implementation of the tasks it describes and thus to provide a means of exchanging data (support communication tasks). A case study regarding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease data management is presented in order to evaluate the efficiency of the architecture. This proposed ontology-based solution defines a flexible and scalable architecture in order to address main challenges presented in home-based telemonitoring scenarios and thus provide a means to integrate, unify, and transfer data supporting both clinical and technical management tasks.", "paper_title": "Designing an Architecture for Monitoring Patients at Home: Ontologies and Web Services for Clinical and Technical Management Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000336050400021"}
