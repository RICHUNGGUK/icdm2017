In this way, a stochastic planning model is proposed to determine the location of MCFCPPs as well as their operation mode. The planning problem is solved considering three main objectives: cost, emission and voltage profile. The total cost consists of the production costs of electrical and thermal energy as well as costs due to hydrogen production and the investment costs of the MCFCPPs. The total emission consists of the emissions of both MCFCPPs and network. Finally the voltage profile is improved by minimizing the voltage deviation of system buses. The proposed model employs 2m Point Estimate Method (2PEM) to analyze the uncertainties associated with forecasting of system loads (electrical and thermal), the pressures of input gases(hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide) in MCFCPP model besides the unpredictability of the nominal temperature of MCFCPP. The whole model is a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem with multiple objectives, which requires the utilization of an effective optimization tool. A Modified Firefly Algorithm (MFA) is suggested to solve the proposed multi-objective problem by which the best Pareto optimal set will be obtained. The feasibility and satisfying performance of the proposed method are examined on the IEEE 69-bus test system. The simulation results show the high robustness and search ability of MFA for optimal operation and management of MCFCPP in the distribution systems. Also, it is seen that considering hydrogen production and thermal recovery can enhance the efficiency of the MCFCPP, effectively.", "paper_title": "Stochastic allocation and sizing of fuel cells using MFA and 2m-PEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800025"}
