Through the use of appropriate coherence relations, BiVisu can detect constant, constant-row, constant-column, additive-related as well as multiplicative-related biclusters. The biclustering results are then visualized under a 2D setting for easy inspection. In particular, parallel coordinate (PC) plots for each bicluster are displayed, from which objective and subjective cluster quality evaluation can be performed.
