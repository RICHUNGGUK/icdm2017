The proposed circuit can adapt itself to 32-, 16-, and 8-bit operands widths avoiding time and power consuming reconfiguration. When implemented in an XCV400 device, the multiplier here described reaches a running frequency of about 97 MHz with an energy dissipation of just 20 mW/MHz. Comparisons with previously proposed SIMD multipliers for FPGA-based designs demonstrate that the new circuit allows the best area-time-power trade-off to be obtained.", "paper_title": "SIMD multipliers for accelerating embedded processors in FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000243117600005"}
