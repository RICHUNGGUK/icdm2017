Using off-the-shelf technology, we conducted a simple experiment that required participants to engage in a person-identification task while posing as security agents in a field setting. Participants attempted to identify a target person in a public setting under different conditions with or without the aid of video information distributed to them via wireless-enabled multimedia PDAs. We developed a research framework and expectations based on previous research in the areas of the dual processing theory of working memory, information richness theory, and the role of video in grounding. Our findings suggest that dual modes of presentation (i.e., phonological and visuospatial information) simultaneously incorporated by a specific presentation significantly influence user perception and enhance task performance.", "paper_title": "The Effects of Different Presentation Modalities on a Person Identification Task: A Study of Wireless Multimedia PDA Use in a Security Context", "paper_id": "WOS:000263872300002"}
