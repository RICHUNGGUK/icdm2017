However, the combination of video streaming's stringent requirements and the dynamic topology of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) poses severe challenges for efficient and effective video dissemination. We propose in this work a receiver-based solution that conducts video transmissions decoupled from the relay nodes selection mechanism, namely REDEC. This solution takes advantage of the reactive nature of the receiver-based approach without incurring excessive collisions and overhead due to the transmission of videos large packets at a high frequency. We have also conducted extensive simulation experiments using variety of scenarios with different densities and data exchange rate. Our results indicate clearly that our proposed REDEC protocol outperforms other solutions and is scalable while fulfilling the end-to-end delay requirements of video streaming. Furthermore, we have observed that REDEC also offers higher video reception rates when compared to existing video streaming solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
