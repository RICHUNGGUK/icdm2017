The performance evaluation of on several multi-core systems has shown noticeable improvements compared with other Java shared memory solutions, reaching and even overcoming the performance of natively compiled libraries. Thus, has obtained start-up latencies around 0.76 mu s and almost 90 Gbps bandwidth for point-to-point communications, as well as high performance and scalability both for collective operations and representative messaging kernels. This fact has motivated the integration of in F-MPJ, our message-passing implementation in Java.", "paper_title": "Design of Scalable Java Communication Middleware for Multi-Core Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314892500007"}
