In this companion paper, we further the analysis by providing worst-case global iteration complexity bounds for ARC and a second-order variant to achieve approximate first-order, and for the latter second-order, criticality of the iterates. In particular, the second-order ARC algorithm requires at most O(epsilon(-3/2)) iterations, or equivalently, function- and gradient-evaluations, to drive the norm of the gradient of the objective below the desired accuracy epsilon and O(epsilon(-3)) iterations, to reach approximate nonnegative curvature in a subspace. The orders of these bounds match those proved for Algorithm 3.3 of Nesterov and Polyak which minimizes the cubic model globally on each iteration. Our approach is more general in that it allows the cubic model to be solved only approximately and may employ approximate Hessians.", "paper_title": "Adaptive cubic regularisation methods for unconstrained optimization.
