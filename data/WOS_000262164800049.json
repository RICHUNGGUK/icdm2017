In this paper, we propose a fast peak power wave estimation method for clock scheduling and fast clock Scheduling methods for the peak power reduction. In experiments, it is shown that the peak power wave estimated by the proposed method in a few seconds is highly correlated with the peak power wave obtained by HSPICE simulation in several days. By using the proposed peak power wave estimation method, proposed clock scheduling methods find clock schedules that greatly reduce the peak power consumption in a few minutes.", "paper_title": "A Fast Clock Scheduling for Peak Power Reduction in LSI", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800049"}
