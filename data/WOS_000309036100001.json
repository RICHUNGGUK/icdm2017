Camera parameters, including focal length, principal point, lens distortion parameter and the angle and axis of rotation, can be recovered from a minimum set of two images of the camera, provided that the axis of rotation between the two images goes through the camera's optical center and is parallel to either the vertical (panning) or horizontal (tilting) axis of the image. Previous methods for auto-calibration of cameras based on pure rotations fail to work in these two degenerate cases. In addition, our approach includes a modified RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, as well as improved integration of the radial distortion coefficient in the computation of inter-image homographies. We show that these modifications are able to increase the overall efficiency, reliability and accuracy of the homography computation and calibration procedure using both synthetic and real image sequences.
