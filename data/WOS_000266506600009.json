However, using a conventional keyboard for Internet access is prohibitive for persons whose hand coordination and dexterity are impaired by ailments such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and other severe handicaps. To assist participants with physical disabilities in sharing the resources of the Internet, we designed and implemented an easy-to-operate wireless input interface using Morse code as an adaptive communication tool. Moreover, an adaptive Morse code recognition process is introduced. After two months' practice on this system, three participants with physical disabilities could conveniently gain access to the Internet. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
