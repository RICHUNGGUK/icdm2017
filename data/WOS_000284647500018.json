In the optimization model, Lyapunov optimization method is used to allocate the idle channels of PU to secondary user (SU) most efficiently. The time distribution of the idle channels of PU is predicted by a low-pass time window. An algorithm is proposed to implement the optimization process. The algorithm is efficient because of using a greedy selection mechanism. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by mathematic analyses and simulation results.", "paper_title": "Channel-aware and queue-aware joint-layer resource optimization for cognitive radio networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647500018"}
