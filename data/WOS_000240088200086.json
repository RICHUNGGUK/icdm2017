Many models have been brought up to explain the static and dynamic properties of the graph. Most of them pay much attention to the pages without considering their essential relations. In fact, Web pages are well organized in Web sites as a tree hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model of Web graph which exploits both link structure and hierarchical relations of Web pages. The analysis of the model reveals many properties about the evolution of pages, sites and the relation among them.", "paper_title": "A hierarchical model of Web Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200086"}
