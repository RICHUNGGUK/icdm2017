However, in embedded systems, the significance of virtualization does not come into the picture. The extensive utilization of mobile smart devices has led to a series of issues such as security, wasting of resources, and power consumption. In this paper, we discuss how mobile virtualization addresses these challenges and then present a detail analysis of four mainstream mobile virtualization solutions: containers, paravirtualization, hardware-assisted full virtualization, and microkernel. At last, we carry out a series of performance comparisons among these solutions and make some suggestions for further research.", "paper_title": "The Study and Evaluation of ARM-Based Mobile Virtualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000358909300001"}
