This method is based oil the theory of linear transformation and geometrical analysis. Central to this method is a set of novel 5 DoFs 3T2R parallel mechanisms (PMs). Based on the legs configuration, the generated mechanisms are classified. Moreover, the promising mechanisms of each class are introduced with respect to some criteria, Le.: (a) degree Of Coupling between the actuators and degrees of freedom; (b) easy kinematics and control command; (c) easy construction (or low cost construction); and, (d) manufacturability. With reference to these criteria, some discussions are given oil the promising mechanisms. Finally, to demonstrate the role of legs configuration in relation to the characteristics of a manipulator, the kinematic analysis of two of the introduced mechanisms is compared.
