Here, the \"distance\" has two different meanings: the L(1)-norm distance and L(infinity)-norm distance. So we have two models of two-dimensional bandwidth problem. This paper investigates the basic properties and relations of these two models. Some lower bounds, upper bounds, and exact results are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
