We employ polynomial chaos for discretization in random space, and discontinuous Galerkin and finite difference for discretization in physical space. The accuracy of the stochastic solutions is investigated by comparing the first two moments against analytical and Monte Carlo simulation results. Of particular interest is the interplay of spatial discretization error with the stochastic approximation error, which is examined for different orders of spatial and stochastic approximation.
