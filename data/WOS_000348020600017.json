The problem is formulated as an integer programming model under the basic and extended scenarios. A four-phase heuristic called SIGALNS and a two-phase Tabu Search-modified Clarke and Wright Savings heuristic (TS-MCWS) are proposed to solve the problem. In the proposed SIGALNS, the BSSs location stage and the vehicle routing stage are alternated iteratively, which considers the information from the routing plan while improving the location strategy. In the first phase, an initial routing plan is generated with a modified sweep algorithm, leading to the BSSs location subproblem, which is then solved by using an iterated greedy heuristic. In the third phase, the vehicle routes resulting from the location subproblem are determined by applying an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic with several new neighborhood structures. At the end of SIGALNS, the solution is further improved by a split procedure. Compared with the MIP solver of CPLEX and TS-MCWS over three sets of instances, SIGALNS searches the solution space more efficiently, thus producing good solutions without excessive computation on the medium and large instances. Furthermore, we systematically conduct economic and environmental analysis including the comparison between basic and extended scenarios, sensitivity analysis on battery driving range and efficiency analysis about the vehicle emissions reduction when EVs are used in the logistics practice.
