Both conventional and adaptive fuzzy control can be designed. The control methodology can integrate a priori knowledge about the control and/or about the plant, with on-line control adaptation mechanisms to cope with time-varying and/or uncertain plant parameters. The paper presents the fuzzy control software architecture that can be integrated in industrial processing and communication structures. It includes four distinct modules: a mathematical fuzzy library, a graphical user interface (GUI), fuzzy controller, and industrial communication. Three types of adaptive fuzzy control methods have been studied, and compared: (1) direct adaptive, (2) indirect adaptive, and (3) combined direct/indirect adaptive. An experimental benchmark composed of two mechanically coupled electrical DC motors has been employed to study the performance of the presented control architectures. The first motor acts as an actuator, while the second motor is used to generate nonlinearities and/or time-varying load. Results indicate that all tested controllers have good performance in overcoming changes of DC motor load. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
