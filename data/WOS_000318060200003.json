Here we describe a new computational framework to predict polypharmacological profiles of drugs by the integration of chemical, side effect, and therapeutic space. On the basis of our previous developed drug side effects database, named MetaADEDB, a drug side effect similarity inference (DSESI) method was developed for drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction on a known DTI network connecting 621 approved drugs and 893 target proteins. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.882 +/- 0.011 averaged from 100 simulated tests of 10-fold cross-validation for the DSESI method, which is comparative with drug structural similarity inference and drug therapeutic similarity inference methods. Seven new predicted candidate target proteins for seven approved drugs were confirmed by published experiments, with the successful hit rate more than 15.9%. Moreover, network visualization of drug-target interactions and off-target side effect associations provide new mechanism-of-action of three approved antipsychotic drugs in a case study. The results indicated that the proposed methods could be helpful for prediction of polypharmacological profiles of drugs.", "paper_title": "Prediction of Polypharmacological Profiles of Drugs by the Integration of Chemical, Side Effect, and Therapeutic Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000318060200003"}
