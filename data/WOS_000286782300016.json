They might be large for coarse discretizations even using high-order schemes, which led us to design explicit finite differences specially for 8, 16, 32 and 64 points per circle. These schemes are shown to improve accuracy with respect to standard finite differences, and to provide solutions for a two-dimensional propagation problem similar to those obtained using Fourier spectral methods in the direction 0. A method is then presented to alleviate the time-step limitation resulting from explicit time integration near cylindrical origin, when finite differences are used. It consists in calculating azimuthal derivatives at coarser resolutions than permitted by the grid, in the same way as usually done using spectral methods. In practice, a series of doublings of the effective discretization in 0 is implemented. Thus simulations can for instance be performed on a grid containing n(0) = 256 points with a time step 32 times larger, with an accuracy comparable to that achieved in corresponding simulations involving Fourier spectral methods in the direction 0.
