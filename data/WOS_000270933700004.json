Human location and motion are the most important contexts in the ubiquitous smart home. In this paper, we present a real-time human tracker that predicts human location and motion for the ubiquitous smart home. The system uses four network cameras for real-time human tracking. This paper explains the architecture of the real-time human tracker, and proposes an algorithm for predicting human location and motion. To detect human location, three kinds of images are used: IMAGE(1)-empty room image, IMAGE(2)-image of furniture and home appliances, IMAGE(3)-image of IMAGE(2) and the human. The real-time human tracker decides which specific furniture or home appliance the human is associated with, via analysis of three images, and predicts human motion using a support vector machine (SVM). The performance experiment of the human's location, which uses three images, lasted an average of 0.037 seconds. The SVM feature of human motion recognition is decided from the pixel number by the array line of the moving object. We evaluated each motion 1,000 times. The average accuracy of all types of motion was 86.5%.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Tracking of Human Location and Motion using Cameras in a Ubiquitous Smart Home", "paper_id": "WOS:000270933700004"}
