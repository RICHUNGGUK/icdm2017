The proposed framework is based on alpha-level fuzzy measure models on the basis of background knowledge, as described in the paper. In the proposed framework, deduction, induction, and abduction are characterized as reasoning processes based on typical situations about the facts and rules used in these processes. Using variable precision rough set models, we consider beta-lower approximation of truth sets of nonmodal sentences as typical situations of the given facts and rules, instead of the truth sets of the sentences as correct representations of the facts and rules. Moreover, we represent deduction, induction, and abduction as relationships between typical situations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
