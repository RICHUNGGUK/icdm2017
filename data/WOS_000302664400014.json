Based upon ID-based concept, Yang and Chang scheme (YC scheme) does not require additional computations for certificate and is not constructed by bilinear-pairings, which is an expensive operation on elliptic curve. In addition, YC scheme not only provides mutual authentication but also supports a session key agreement between the user and the server. Therefore, YC scheme is more efficient and practical than the related works. However, we find that YC scheme not only is vulnerable to an impersonation attack but also does not provide perfect forward secrecy in spite of efforts to perform mutual authentication and session key agreement between the user and the remote server and reduce the computational costs than the related works. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved ID-based remote mutual authentication with key agreement scheme for mobile devices based on ECC. Compared with YC scheme, the proposed scheme is more secure, efficient and practical for mobile devices because the proposed scheme not only eliminates the security flaws of YC scheme but also reduces the computational costs between the user and the server.", "paper_title": "A SECURE AND EFFICIENCY ID-BASED AUTHENTICATED KEY AGREEMENT SCHEME BASED ON ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOSYSTEM FOR MOBILE DEVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000302664400014"}
