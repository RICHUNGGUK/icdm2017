Our approach assembles large environments from sets of spatial elements which contain inter-connectible, periodic crowd animations. Such a Crowd Patches approach allows us to avoid expensive and difficult-to-control simulations. It also overcomes the limitations of motion editing, that would result into animations delimited in space and time. Our novel methods allows the user to control the crowd patches layout in ways inspired by elastic shape sculpting: the user creates and tunes the desired populated environment through stretching, bending, cutting and merging gestures, applied either in space or time. Our examples demonstrate that our method allows the space-time editing of very large populations and results into endless animation, while offering real-time, intuitive control and maintaining animation quality.", "paper_title": "Crowd sculpting: A space-time sculpting method for populating virtual environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000337543000036"}
