Spatial reuse with Stream Control (SC) provides a considerable improvement of the network throughput over spatial multiplexing. The gain of spatial reuse, however, is still not fully exploited. There exist large numbers of additional data streams, which could be transmitted concurrently with those data streams scheduled by stream control at certain time slots and vicinities. In this paper, we address the issue of MIMO link scheduling to maximize the gain of spatial reuse and thus network throughput. We propose a Receiver-Oriented Interference Suppression model (ROIS), based on which we design both centralized and distributed link scheduling algorithms to fully exploit the gain of spatial reuse in multihop MIMO networks. Further, we address the traffic-aware link scheduling problem by injecting nonuniform traffic load into the network. Through theoretical analysis and comprehensive performance evaluation, we achieve the following results: 1) link scheduling based on ROIS achieves significant higher network throughput than that based on stream control, with any interference range, number of antennas, and average hop length of data flows. 2) The traffic-aware scheduling is enticingly complementary to the link scheduling based on ROIS model. Accordingly, the two scheduling schemes can be combined to further enhance the network throughput.", "paper_title": "Link Scheduling for Exploiting Spatial Reuse in Multihop MIMO Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319678800009"}
