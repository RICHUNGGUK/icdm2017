This emerging communication paradigm is to provide new various services, such as ubiquitous multimedia services, with anyone, anytime, anyplace by using IP-based mobile devices. In this paradigm, providing authentication and session keys of a subscriber is a critical tasks because of the open accessibility and heterogeneousness of an All-113 network. In this paper, we develop a so-called Integrated Mobile Authentication Server (IMAS) that can securely inter-work among all mobile networks and fully support the legacy networks with backward compatibility. In designing IMAS, the mobile authentication interworking mechanism and other issues to be overcome are addressed. A test environment for IMAS is established, and performance results are analyzed and evaluated. It is demonstrated that IMAS works in an All-IP network without compensating the efficiency and functionalities of the legacy networks. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
