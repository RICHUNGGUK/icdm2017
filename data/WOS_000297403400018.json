It has lots of practical applications in distributed systems, grid computing, mobile agent applications, distributed shared object systems, global distribution networks, and mobile communications. In the last years, fruitful achievements have been seen in certificateless public key cryptography which has the advantages of no certificate management and no key escrow compared with traditional public key cryptography and identity-based public key cryptography respectively. However, the existing certificateless proxy signature schemes is either insecure or without formal security analysis. In this paper, we formalize the security model of certificateless proxy signature schemes and propose a provably secure certificateless proxy signature scheme with formal security proof under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption.
