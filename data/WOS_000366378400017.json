Here, we present Model based Interaction Calling from ChIA-PET data (MICC), an easy-to-use R package to detect chromatin interactions from ChIA-PET sequencing data. By applying a Bayesian mixture model to systematically remove random ligation and random collision noise, MICC could identify chromatin interactions with a significantly higher sensitivity than existing methods at the same false discovery rate.", "paper_title": "MICC: an R package for identifying chromatin interactions from ChIA-PET data", "paper_id": "WOS:000366378400017"}
