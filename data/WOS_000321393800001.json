We also introduce a sequent calculus RJ for intuitionistic unprovability with the same properties of LSJ. We show that from a refutation of RJ of a sequent sigma we can extract a Kripke counter-model for sigma. Finally, we provide a procedure that given a sequent sigma returns either a proof of sigma in LSJ or a refutation in RJ such that the extracted counter-model is of minimal depth.", "paper_title": "Contraction-Free Linear Depth Sequent Calculi for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic with the Subformula Property and Minimal Depth Counter-Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000321393800001"}
