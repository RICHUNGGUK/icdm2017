Questions related to properties which contribute to cryptographic security are investigated, such as distributional, coverage and complexity properties. We show that the distribution of elements in a certain multiset tends to uniform. In particular we consider the family of finite non-abelian groups PSL(2)(F(p)), p a prime, as possible candidates in the design of new cryptographic primitives, based on our new discrete logarithm.", "paper_title": "Discrete logarithms for finite groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000266910500002"}
