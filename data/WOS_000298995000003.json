Currently, the coarse cage is constructed mainly by hand, and the construction usually takes several hours, even longer. Therefore, it is important to develop a convenient method to generate the coarse cage bounding a model. In this paper, we devise a method to construct the coarse cage automatically using the improved OBB tree, while allowing the users to modify the cage easily. Firstly, the OBB tree bounding the model is generated, where we propose an improved OBB slicing rule to make the generated OBBs close to the model it contains. Secondly, the OBBs are adjusted and merged into a whole entity by the boolean union operation. Finally, the outer surface of the entity is extracted as the coarse cage. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the automatic coarse cage-generation method.", "paper_title": "Automatic cage generation by improved OBBs for mesh deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298995000003"}
