Our approach is fully automatic which requires zero human intervention. Tree edit distance is a term used in the field of theoretical computer science to describe the similarity between two labeled trees. In our approach, we abstract the geometry and morphology of vessel branches into the labels of tree nodes and then use combinatorial optimization strategies to compute the approximated edit distance between the trees. Once the optimal tree edit distance is computed, the spatial correspondences between the vessels can be established. By visual inspection to the experimental results, we find that our approach is accurate.", "paper_title": "Cerebral vascular tree matching of 3D-RA data based on tree edit distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500015"}
