This method uses the incentre point of a triangle where the three bisector lines of its angles meet. Coordinates of incentre point can also be easily calculated by the \"Mathematica\" package to solve problems of defuzzification and ranking fuzzy numbers. Some numerical examples are illustrated to show the utility of proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
