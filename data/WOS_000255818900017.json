Given a set of surveillance videos, the aims of our work are twofold: firstly a continuous video is segmented according to the activities captured in the video; secondly a model is constructed for the video content, based on which an unseen activity pattern can be recognised and any unusual activities can be detected. To segment a video based on activity, we propose a semantically meaningful video content representation method and two segmentation algorithms, one being offline offering high accuracy in segmentation, and the other being online enabling real-time performance. Our video content representation method is based on automatically detected visual events (i.e. 'what is happening in the scene'). This is in contrast to most previous approaches which represent video content at the signal level using image features such as colour, motion and texture. Our segmentation algorithms are based on detecting breakpoints on a high-dimensional video content trajectory. This differs from most previous approaches which are based on shot change detection and shot grouping. Having segmented continuous surveillance videos based on activity, the activity patterns contained in the video segments are grouped into activity classes and a composite video content model is constructed which is capable of generalising from a small training set to accommodate variations in unseen activity patterns. A run-time accumulative unusual activity measure is introduced to detect unusual behaviour while usual activity patterns are recognised based on an online likelihood ratio test (LRT) method. This ensures robust and reliable activity recognition and unusual activity detection at the shortest possible time once sufficient visual evidence has become available. Comparative experiments have been carried out using over 10 h of challenging outdoor surveillance video footages to evaluate the proposed segmentation algorithms and modelling approach.
