One of the most common interconnection network topologies is the fat-tree, whose advantages have turned it into the favorite topology of many interconnect designers. One of these advantages is the possibility of using simple but efficient routing algorithms, like the recently proposed deterministic routing algorithm referred to as DET, which offers similar (or better) performance than Adaptive Routing while reducing complexity and guaranteeing in-order packet delivery. However, as other deterministic routing proposals, DET cannot react when packets intensely contend for network resources, leading to the appearance of Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking which spoils network performance. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a simple queue scheme that efficiently reduces HoL-blocking in fat-trees using the DET routing algorithm, without significantly increasing switch complexity and required silicon area. Additionally, we propose an implementation of OBQA in a feasible switch architecture. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
