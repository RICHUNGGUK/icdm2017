It improves the existing Daisy descriptor by combining intensity-based Haar wavelet response with a new color-based ratio model. The color ratio model is invariant to changes of viewing direction, object geometry, and the direction, intensity and spectral power distribution of the illumination. The experiments show that our descriptor has high discriminative power and robustness.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Wide-Baseline Dense Matching Descriptor", "paper_id": "WOS:000306198700035"}
