To do so and obtain a feasible schedule, charging tank cycling is an effective strategy. With a hybid Petri net model, scheduling analysis is carried out and schedulability conditions under a charging tank cycling strategy are presented. They can be used for determining a refining schedule and checking if a target refining schedule is realizable. If so, a detailed feasible schedule can be easily obtained by creating the operation decisions one by one and put into immediate industrial use (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All tights reserved", "paper_title": "Tank cycling and scheduling analysis of high fusion point oil transportation for crude oil operations in refinery", "paper_id": "WOS:000276426900012"}
