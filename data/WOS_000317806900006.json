In this paper, we present an integrative cognitive model of semantic relatedness. The model - semantic family resemblance - uses a variation of the co-product as a mathematical structure that guides the fusion of distributional and experiential information. Our algorithm provides superior results in a set expansion task and a significant correlation with two benchmarks of human rated word-pair similarity datas ets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
