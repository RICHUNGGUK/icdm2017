In particular, assuming that the Internet functions as an effective source of information for the tourist, one would expect the above relationship to be positive and significant. Design/methodology/approach - In order to test the proposed hypotheses, a structured questionnaire was administered to tourists of different nationalities. The total number of valid cases was 279. The field work was done between June 2004 and June 2005. Findings - The results seem to show that the greater the tourist's satisfaction with the Internet, the fuller is his or her enjoyment of the holiday. This relationship, however, is moderated by two variables - the tourist's previous experience of the destination and the tourist's experience of the Intemet. These conclusions may well prove crucial for the future use of the Intemet in the promotion of tourism destinations. Practical implications - The results of the study lend support to the importance of the Intemet as an information source in the promotion of tourism destinations, which contributes in particular to attracting new visitors. However, its development will depend heavily on improvements in the ease of use of the information highway and will progress with the passage of time and the concomitant increase in the Intemet experience of its users. Originality/value - The study focuses on empirically testing the advantages that, from a merely conceptual perspective, are becoming evident in the use of the Intemet in the tourist sector.", "paper_title": "The influence of the internet on destination satisfaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000249538100004"}
