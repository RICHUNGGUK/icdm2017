Some works have also included fixture maintenance policies into the tolerance allocation problem since they are related to both manufacturing cost and final part quality. However, there is a lack of incorporation of other factors that lead to increase of manufacturing cost and degrade of product quality, such as cutting-tool wear and machine-tool thermal state. The allocation of the admissible values of these process variables may be critical due to their impact on cutting-tool replacement and quality loss costs. In this paper, the process-oriented tolerancing is expanded based on the recently developed extended stream of variation (Soy) model which explicitly represents the influence of machining process variables in the variation propagation along MMPs. In addition, the probability distribution functions (pdf) for some machining process variables are analyzed, and a procedure to derive part quality constraints according to GD&T specifications is also shown. With this modeling capability extension, a complete process-oriented tolerancing can be conducted, reaching a real minimum manufacturing cost. In order to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methodology over a conventional method, a case study is analyzed in detail. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
