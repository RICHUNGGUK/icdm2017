Firstly, the global feature is extracted from the DC and first nine low-frequency coefficients in every 8x8-sized DCT block of the input image, obtaining the strong robustness to common acceptable manipulations. And then we extract the local feature by fitting DWT coefficients of the image based on the least-squares method (LSM). The proposed local feature can locate the maliciously modified positions. Lastly, the above two kinds of features are combined together to generate the final hash for image authentication. To enforce security, feature extraction is key-dependent in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can resist almost all content-preserving operations such as JPEG compression, filtering, adding noises, and contrast enhancement, while being high sensitive to content tampering.", "paper_title": "DCT-DOMAIN GLOBAL FEATURE AND DWT-DOMAIN LEAST-SQUARES LINE FITTING BASED LOCAL FEATURE FOR ROBUST IMAGE HASHING", "paper_id": "WOS:000278688700011"}
