The proposed protocol is based on a swarm agent that integrates the residual energy of nodes into the route selection mechanism and maximizes the network's lifetime by evenly balancing the residual energy across nodes and minimizing the protocol overhead. The protocol is robust and scales well both with the network size and in the presence of multiple sinks. An information-theoretic lower bound on the protocol overhead associated with the swarm agent advertisement is obtained. Simulation results are used to verify SIMPLE's performance.", "paper_title": "A swarm-intelligence-based protocol for data acquisition in networks with mobile sinks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256780400002"}
