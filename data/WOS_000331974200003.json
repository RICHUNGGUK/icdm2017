Solving the STP is of great importance since it is one of the fundamental problems in network design, very large scale integration routing, multicast routing, wire length estimation, computational biology, and many other areas. However, the STP is NP-hard, which shatters any hopes of finding a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem exactly. This is why the majority of research has looked at finding efficient heuristic algorithms. Additionally, many authors focused their work on utilizing the ever-increasing computational power and developed many parallel and distributed methods for solving the problem. In this way we are able to obtain better results in less time than ever before. Here, we present a survey of the parallel and distributed methods for solving the STP and discuss some of their applications.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for the Steiner Tree Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000331974200003"}
