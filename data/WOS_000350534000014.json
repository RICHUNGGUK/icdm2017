Based on the operation mechanism, the channel surface potential phi(sf) which involves the impact of both the gate and the drain voltages is established for the first time. In addition, a new calculation method for the dynamic tunneling width, which is the critical parameter for the TFET modeling, is derived from the surface potential. The surface-potential-based current model is established which is in a good agreement with TCAD simulation results.", "paper_title": "Analytical current model of tunneling field-effect transistor considering the impacts of both gate and drain voltages on tunneling", "paper_id": "WOS:000350534000014"}
