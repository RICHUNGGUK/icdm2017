The relative performance of the WVC model was compared with regular artificial neural networks (ANN), wavelet-artificial neural networks (WA-ANN) models and other baseline models such as auto-regressive moving average with exogenous variables (ARMAX) for lead times of 1-5 days. The models were applied for the forecasting of daily streamflow at Krishna Agraharam Station at Krishna River. The WVC performed very well, especially when compared with the WA-ANN model for lead times of 4 and 5 days. The results indicate that the WVC model is a promising alternative to the other traditional models for short-term flow forecasting.", "paper_title": "Wavelets-based non-linear model for real-time daily flow forecasting in Krishna River", "paper_id": "WOS:000320926800029"}
