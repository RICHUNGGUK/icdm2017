It facilitates the construction of gene regulatory networks from DNA microarray data by using Bayesian network. Significant sub-modules of regulatory networks with high confidence are reconstructed by using our extended sub-network mining algorithm of directed graphs.

To evaluate the statistical features of generated Bayesian networks, re-sampling procedures are utilized to yield collections of candidate 1st-order network sets for mining dense coherent sub-networks.", "paper_title": "BNArray: an R package for constructing gene regulatory networks from microarray data by using Bayesian network", "paper_id": "WOS:000242246300020"}
