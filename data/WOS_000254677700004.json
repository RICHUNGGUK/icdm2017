The simulation is based on taking Lie commutators of symmetrized Hamiltonians to extract Hamiltonians at desired local positions. During the simulation, only a part of the qubits can be used for storing information, the others are left unchanged by the commutators. We propose constructions for various symmetry groups where a pretty large fraction of the qubits can be used. As a few of the other qubits need to be set to one, our construction requires individual initialization of some of the qubits.", "paper_title": "Constructions for quantum computing with symmetrized gates", "paper_id": "WOS:000254677700004"}
