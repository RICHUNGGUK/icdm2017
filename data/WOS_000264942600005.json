Although intonation and syntax are both related to dependencies between the different parts of a sentence, and are therefore related to meaning, the precise influence of grammar on intonation is not clear. We describe a novel method that uses syntactic and part-of-speech features in the framework of corpus-based intonation modelling, and which integrates part of the phrasing algorithm in the unit selection stage. Subjective tests confirm an improvement in the quality of the resulting synthetic intonation: 75% of the sentences synthesised with the new intonation model were considered to be better or much better than the sentences synthesised using the old model, while only 7.5% of sentences were rated as worse or much worse.
