These functions are optimized to be run in a wide range of architectures increasing the portability of scientific codes between different computing environments. MIMOPack aims to become a useful library for the research community facilitating to the programmer the development of adaptable parallel applications and also to speed up simulation platforms used to assess different technologies proposed by several companies involved in standarization processes.", "paper_title": "MIMOPack: a high-performance computing library for MIMO communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000349259600016"}
