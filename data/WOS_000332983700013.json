By considering the local image fitting energy to extract the local image information, our model can effectively and efficiently segment images with intensity inhomogeneities. In addition, to keep the smoothness of the level set function, the time-consuming reinitialization step widely adopted in traditional level set methods can be avoided by introducing a Gaussian filtering process. Experimental results on synthetic and real images demonstrate that the proposed model has much less CPU time and sensitivity to the initial contour than the well-known local binary fitting model.
