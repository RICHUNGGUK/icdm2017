However, a good explanation has not been given. In this paper, we obtain the formulas for the degree of these functions, which can well explain the behavior of their degree.", "paper_title": "The Degree of Two Classes of 3rd Order Correlation Immune Symmetric Boolean Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000330553400044"}
