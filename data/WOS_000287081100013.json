First, we present the desired requirements for shot boundary detection from the perspective of news video story parsing, and propose a new shot boundary detection method, based on singular value decomposition, and a newly developed algorithm, viz., Kernel-ART, which meets all of these requirements. Second, we propose a new anchor shot detection system, viz., MASD, which is able to detect anchor person cost-effectively by reducing the search space. It consists of skin color detector, face detector, and support vector data descriptions with non-negative matrix factorization sequentially. The experimental results with the qualitative analysis illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A unified scheme of shot boundary detection and anchor shot detection in news video story parsing", "paper_id": "WOS:000287081100013"}
