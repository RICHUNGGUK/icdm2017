The proposed approach for probabilistic fuzzy logic-based image fusion automatically forms fuzzy membership functions using the Gaussian-Rayleigh mixture distribution. It fuses the input pixel values directly without requiring fuzzification and defuzzification, thereby removing the subjective nature of the existing fuzzy logic methods. In this paper, the proposed approach is applied to through-the-wall radar imaging in urban sensing and evaluated on real multi-view and polarimetric data. Experimental results show that the proposed approach yields improved image contrast and enhances target detection.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Fuzzy Image Fusion Approach for Radar Through Wall Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000325223300030"}
