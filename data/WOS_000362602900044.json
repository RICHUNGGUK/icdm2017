As with other components, turboEELS is optimized to run on a variety of different platforms, from laptops to massively parallel architectures, using native mathematical libraries (LAPACK and FFTW) and a hierarchy of custom parallelization layers built on top of MPI. Program summary Program title: turboEEIS Catalogue identifier: AEXB_v1_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEXB_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License V 2.0 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 1371515 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 37355712 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 95. Computer: Any computer architecture. Operating system: GNU/Linux, AIX, IRIX, Mac OS X, and other UNIX-like OS's. Classification: 7.2. External routines: turboEELS is a tightly integrated component of the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution and requires the standard libraries linked by it: BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW, MPI. Nature of problem: Calculation of the electron energy loss and inelastic X-ray scattering spectra of periodic solids. Solution method: The charge-density susceptibility of a periodic system is expressed in terms of the resolvent of its Liouvillian superoperator within time-dependent density functional perturbation theory. It is calculated using non-Hermitian or pseudo-Hermitian variants of the Lanczos recursion scheme, whose implementation does not require the calculation of any virtual states. Pseudopotentials (both norm-conserving and ultrasoft) are used in conjunction with plane-wave basis sets and periodic boundary conditions. Relativistic effects (spin-orbit coupling) can be included in calculations. Restrictions: Linear-response regime. Adiabatic exchange-correlation kernels only. No hybrid functionals. Collinear spin-polarized formalism is not supported, only non-collinear spin-polarized case can be used. Spin-orbit coupling cannot be used with ultrasoft pseudopotentials. No magnetism. No Hubbard U formalism. No PAW pseudopotentials. Unusual features: No virtual orbitals are used, nor even calculated. A single Lanczos recursion gives access to the whole spectrum at fixed transferred momentum.

The distribution file for this program is over 37 Mbytes and therefore is not delivered directly when download or Email is requested. Instead a html file giving details of how the program can be obtained is sent. !!!!! Running time: From a few minutes for elemental bulk systems with a few atoms in the primitive unit cell on serial machines up to many hours on multiple processors for complex systems (e.g., surfaces with high Miller indices) with dozens or hundreds of atoms.
