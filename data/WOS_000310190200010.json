Assume that the distribution of the process is otherwise unknown. We construct a sequence of stopping times An along which we will be able to estimate the conditional expectation E(f (X gimel n+1)vertical bar X-0, . . . , X-gimel n) from the observations (X-0, . . ., X-gimel n) in a point wise consistent way for a restricted class of stationary and ergodic finite or countably infinite alphabet time series which includes among others all stationary and ergodic finitarily Markovian processes. If the stationary and ergodic process turns out to be finitarily Markovian (in particular, all stationary and ergodic Markov chains are included in this class) then lim(n ->infinity) n/gimel(n) > 0 almost surely. If the stationary and ergodic process turns out to possess finite entropy rate then gimel(n) is upper bounded by a polynomial, eventually almost surely.", "paper_title": "A NOTE ON PREDICTION FOR DISCRETE TIME SERIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000310190200010"}
