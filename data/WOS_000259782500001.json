Following the framework the companies can asses and improve their existing ways of working, capture them into formalised methods and continuously enrich them based on the past development experiences. Furthermore, the formalised methods that arc designed based on the suggested framework are flexible and can be automatically adjusted by the supporting tools to suite circumstances of a particular project or team. This paper describes the framework philosophy and its tool support.", "paper_title": "A framework and tool-support for reengineering software development methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000259782500001"}
