At most 5-valued crosscorrelation of m-sequences is first discussed, which is linked to crosscorrelation of some other binary two-level autocorrelation sequences. Then, several theorems and conjectures are established for describing 3- or 5-valued crosscorrelation of a pair of binary two-level autocorrelation sequences.", "paper_title": "Crosscorrelation properties of binary sequences with ideal two-level autocorrelation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000009"}
