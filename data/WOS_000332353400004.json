Based on the multi-channel equalization model in the WSN transmission system, various experimental analyses and performance comparisons proved that the convergence rate of the method proposed in this study was higher than that of general existing algorithms. The final experimental analysis proved that the higher the sampling rate was, the higher the convergence rate and the smaller the mean square error would be. The sampling rate had an important effect on the blind equalization, and it was proved that the method proposed in this study had an improved blind equalization algorithm to some extent.
