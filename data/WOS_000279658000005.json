In the case of plane curves, we recover a known description for rational parameterizations having a syzygy of minimal degree (mu = 1). We also show that our approach can be applied to parameterizations of rational surfaces having a Hilbert-Burch resolution with mu(1) = mu(2) = 1. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
