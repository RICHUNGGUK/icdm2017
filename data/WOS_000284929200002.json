Sensitive data may also be leaked accidentally due to improper disposal or resale of storage media. To protect the secrecy of the entire data lifetime, we must have confidential ways to store and delete data. This survey summarizes and compares existing methods of providing confidential storage and deletion of data in personal computing environments.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Confidential Data Storage and Deletion Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000284929200002"}
