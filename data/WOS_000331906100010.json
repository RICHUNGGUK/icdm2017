By utilizing the Bayesian rule, we design a nonlinear adaptive velocity and a probability-weighted stopping force to implement a robust segmentation for objects with weak boundaries. The proposed method is featured by the following three properties: 1) it automatically determines the curve to shrink or expand by utilizing the Bayesian rule to involve the regional features of images; 2) it drives the curve evolve with an appropriate speed to avoid the leakage at weak boundaries; and 3) it reduces the influence of false boundaries, i.e., edges far away from objects of interest. We applied the proposed segmentation method to artificial images, medical images and the BSD-300 image dataset for qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The comparison results show the proposed method performs competitively, compared with the LSM and its representative variants.", "paper_title": "A Nonlinear Adaptive Level Set for Image Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000331906100010"}
