Current automated sequencers process single strands only. To improve the utility of existing technologies, we propose to mix two independent strands prior to electrophoresis, and base-call jointly by applying the sum-product algorithm on factor graphs. We first present a statistical model for DNA sequencing data and examine the model parameters. A practical heuristic is then proposed to estimate the peaks, which are then separated into two source sequences (Major/Minor) by passing messages on a factor graph. Simulation results show that joint base-calling can provide less accurate but valid results for the minor. The algorithm presented provides a basis for future investigation of joint sequencing techniques.", "paper_title": "Joint Base-Calling of Two DNA Sequences With Factor Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000275032900008"}
