The delay and concurrency of a query are two measures for the degree of their streamability. They count the maximal number of stream elements during the life time for some query answer, and respectively, the maximal number of simultaneously alive answer candidates of a query. We study queries defined by deterministic nested word automata, which subsume large streamable fragments of XPath subject to schema restrictions by DTDs modulo P-time translations. We show that bounded and k-bounded delay and concurrency of such automata-defined queries are all decidable in polynomial time in the size of the automaton. Our results are obtained by P-time reduction to the bounded valuedness problem for recognizable relations between unranked trees, a problem that we show to be decidable in P-time.
