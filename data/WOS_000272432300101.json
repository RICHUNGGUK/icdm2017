Cv-SVM, whose constraint conditions are less than those of the standard v-SVM by one, is proved to satisfy the structure risk minimum rule under the condition of probability Moreover there is no parameter b in the regression function of Cv-SVM. And then, an intelligence-forecasting method is put forward. The results of application in car demand forecasting show that the forecasting method based on Cv-SVM is feasible and effective.
