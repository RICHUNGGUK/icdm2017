The user fits the feature curves on a few calibrated images with 2D NURBS curves using the interactive user interface. Then, 3D NURBS curves are constructed by stereo reconstruction of the corresponding feature curves. Using these as building blocks, NURBS surfaces are reconstructed by the known surface building methods including bilinear surfaces, ruled surfaces, generalized cylinders, and surfaces of revolution. In addition to them, we also employ various advanced techniques, including skinned surfaces, swept surfaces, and boundary patches. Based on these surface modeling techniques, it is possible to build various types of 3D shape models with textured curved surfaces without much effort.
