This has lead to motivation for the design of a powerful and accurate automatic contrast enhancement for a digital image. Histogram equalization is the most commonly used contrast enhancement method. However, the conventional histogram equalization methods usually result in excessive contrast enhancement, which causes the unnatural look and visual artifacts of the processed image. In this paper, we propose a novel histogram equalization method using the automatic histogram separation along with the piecewise transformed function. The contrast enhancement results of the proposed method were not only analyzed through qualitative visual inspection and for quantitative accuracy, but are also compared to the results of other state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Image Quality Analysis of a Novel Histogram Equalization Method for Image Contrast Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342100013"}
