In mobile social applications, mobile nodes usually play different roles (active and passive). This relationship between mobile nodes is a characteristic in neighbor discovery problem. In the daily life, the start time and duration of a neighbor detection are determined by the node which launches the application. In other words, the neighbor discovery will occur suddenly at any time in the network. So timelimit is another characteristic in neighbor discovery. This paper proposes a new neighbor discovery protocol called ERUPT that takes two characteristics above into account. In the ERUPT protocol, the mobile nodes which launch applications in the network are named sponsor nodes, and those nodes that participate applications following the sponsor nodes are named participant nodes. The core idea of ERUPT neighbor discovery protocol depends on the common phenomenon that the sponsor nodes will spend more energy to invite more participant nodes into applications as soon as possible. More efficient of discovering neighbors for the sponsor nodes than existing approaches is validated by the theoretical analysis and simulation in this paper. We evaluate the ERUPT protocol through NS2 network simulator, and show almost 26% - 30% improvement in discovery latency while at almost the same energy consumption over existing approaches.", "paper_title": "ERUPT: A Role-based Neighbor Discovery Protocol for Mobile Social Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000350193200006"}
