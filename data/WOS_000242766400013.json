Starting from a cognitive architecture for Natural Interaction, an agent-based design is presented, focusing particularly on the role of the interaction agent. Regarding the intentional processing within this agent, the Threads Model is proposed. Finally, its implementation is described and evaluated to find out the integrity of the intentional approach.
