In this study, we present several improvements over the two main bottlenecks in a distributed information retrieval system (the network and the brokers). We extend a simulation network model in order to represent a switched network. The new simulation model is validated by comparing the estimated response times with those obtained using a real system. We show that the use of a switched network reduces the saturation of the interconnection network, especially in a replicated system, and some improvements may be achieved using multicast messages and faster connections with the brokers. We also demonstrate that reducing the partial results sets will improve the response time of a distributed system by 53%, with a negligible probability of changing the system's precision and recall values. Finally, we present a simple hierarchical distributed broker model that will reduce the response times for a distributed system by 55%. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
