Through a development of innovative motion and gesture capture and detection techniques, we create a smart ambience that enables students to interact intuitively with a virtual environment to create a rich variety of multimedia forms and space without the use of specific physical tools. Through various interactive activities and game scenarios, particular subjects such as history and mathematics can be taught through developed VR games that can help students to overcome inhibitions related to learning, become more active learners and stimulate creativity in art education.", "paper_title": "Smart ambience games for children with learning difficulties", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300056"}
