However, only recently exploration and exploitation measures were presented in a quantitative way enabling to measure amounts of exploration and exploitation. To move a step further, this paper introduces a parameter control approach that utilizes such measures as feedback to adaptively control evolution processes. The paper shows that with new exploration and exploitation measures, the evolution process generates relatively well results in terms of fitness and/or convergence rate when applying to a practical chemical engineering problem of fitting Sovova's model. We also conducted an objective statistical analysis using Bonferroni-Dunn test and sensitivity analysis on the experimental results. The statistical analysis results again proved that the parameter control strategy using exploration and exploitation measures is competitive to the other approaches presented in the paper. The sensitivity analysis results also showed that different initial values may affect output in different magnitude. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
