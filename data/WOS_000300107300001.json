We propose a system that uses a graphical password deployed from a Trojan and virus-resistant embedded device. The graphical password utilizes a personal image to construct an image hash, which is provided as input into a cryptosystem that returns a password. The graphical password requires the user to select a small number of points on the image. The embedded device will then stretch these points into a long alphanumeric password. With one graphical password, the user can generate many passwords from their unique embedded device. The image hash algorithm employed by the device is demonstrated to produce random and unique 256-bit message digests and was found to be responsive to subtle changes in the underlying image. Furthermore, the device was found to generate passwords with entropy significantly larger than that of users passwords currently employed today.", "paper_title": "Token-based graphical password authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000300107300001"}
