The papers published in 2005 are classified in the following way: 4% theory, 17% empirical, 4.7% hypothesis testing, 3.4% other, and 70% design and modeling (using the 1995 paper categories). Within the design and modeling class, 33% of the papers have no evaluation. The numbers of the 2005 sample are very similar to the original figures for the 1995 sample, which shows that Computer Science research has not increased significantly its empirical or experimental component.
