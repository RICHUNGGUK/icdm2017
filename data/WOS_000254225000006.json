Recently Bede gave a counterexample to show that this statement does not hold and he also argued that in many cases two-point boundary value problems have no solutions. Under a new structure and certain conditions we show that a two-point boundary value problem is equivalent to a fuzzy integral equation. We also prove the existence of solutions to the two-point boundary value problem. In some sense, this is an amendment to results of Lakshmikantham et al. and O'Regan et al., and it is an answer to one of Bede's problems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
