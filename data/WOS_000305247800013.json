The chaotic system with disturbance is modeled as a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system. Using a Lyapunov function, stable adaptation laws for the estimation of the parameters of the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model are derived as well as what the control signal should be to compensate for the uncertainties. The synchronization of chaotic systems is also considered in the paper. It is shown that by the use of an appropriate reference signal, it is possible to make the reference model follow the master chaotic system. Then, using the proposed model reference fuzzy controller, it is possible to force the slave to act as the reference system. In this way, the chaotic master and the slave systems are synchronized. It is shown that not only can the initial values of the master and the slave be different, but also there can be parametric differences between them. The proposed control scheme is simulated on the control and the synchronization of Duffing oscillators and Genesio-Tesi systems.", "paper_title": "Control and synchronization of chaotic systems using a novel indirect model reference fuzzy controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000305247800013"}
