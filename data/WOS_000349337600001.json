We discuss virtual agent vision in large scale multi-agent based simulations where agents are situated in open environments (i.e., inaccessible, non-deterministic, dynamic, continuous). When dealing with open environments, the efficiency of agent vision algorithms is of great importance since every agent's perception must be calculated in simulated real-time. We discuss optimizations for vision algorithms in DIVAs, a large scale multi-agent based simulation framework.", "paper_title": "Agent vision in multi-agent based simulation systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000349337600001"}
