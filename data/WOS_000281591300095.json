In this paper, we focus on a constrained version of coverage problem in which a set of demand points and some constrained regions are given and the goal is to find a minimum number of sensors which covers all demand points. A heuristic approach is presented to solve this problem by using the Voronoi diagram and p-center problem's solution. The proposed algorithm is relatively time-saving and is compared with alternative solutions. The results are discussed, and concluding remarks and future work are given. (c) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
