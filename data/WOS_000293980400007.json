In general, the stoichiometry is not uniform, and the goal is to determine the proper proportion (spectrum) of each type of molecule within a test tube to allow for complete assembly. According to possible components that assemble in complete complexes we partition multisets of tiles, called here \"pots\", into classes: unsatisfiable, weakly satisfiable, satisfiable and strongly satisfiable. This classification is characterized through the spectrum of the pot, and it can be computed in PTIME using the standard Gauss-Jordan elimination method. We also give a geometric description of the spectrum as a convex hull within the unit cube.", "paper_title": "On stoichiometry for the assembly of flexible tile DNA complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000293980400007"}
