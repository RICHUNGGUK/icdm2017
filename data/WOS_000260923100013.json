It is useful to apply these images to retrieve medically relevant cases from digital patient databases. The main effort in the study concerns image feature reduction using nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) for neuroimage retrieval. The experimental retrieval results on real brain CT datasets, including two and three classes respectively, show that NTF outperforms both traditional principal component analysis and nonnegative matrix factorization.", "paper_title": "NONNEGATIVE TENSOR FACTORIZATION FOR BRAIN CT IMAGE RETRIEVAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000260923100013"}
