The purpose of this study is to find an approach for user interest mining via behaviour analysis in a VLE. Design/methodology/approach - According to research in psychology, any interaction in a VLE has implications for the user's implicit interest. In order to mine a user's implicit interest, an explicit interaction-interest model needs to be established. This paper presents findings from the concept classification of behaviour in a VLE. Based on this classification, the paper proposes a hierarchical interaction model. In this model the relation between interaction and user interest can be described and used to improve system performance. Findings - In the experimental prototype the authors found that user-implicit interest could be mined via stages of web mining, i.e. capture the user's original gesture signal, data pre-process, pattern discovery, interaction goal and interest mining. The mined user's interest information can be used to update the state of local interest, leading to a reduction in network traffic and promotion of better system performance. Originality/value - This is an original study using behaviour analysis for interest mining in e-learning. Research on interest mining in e-learning focused on content mining or search engine and usage mining in web courses. The paper provides valuable clues regarding user interest mining in a VLE, in which the context is different from usual web courses. The research output can be implemented widely, including online learning, and especially in the VLE.", "paper_title": "Interest mining in virtual learning environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000256167400003"}
