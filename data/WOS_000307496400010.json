In this paper, the authors introduce a practical solution for data grounding. On the one hand, we need a mapping language to relate data structures from services definition in WSDL documents to concepts, properties and instances of a business domain. On the other hand, two functions that perform the lowering and lifting processes using these mapping specifications are also presented.", "paper_title": "Towards a Practical Solution for Data Grounding in a Semantic Web Services Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000307496400010"}
