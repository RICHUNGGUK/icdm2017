In the new proposal, first the road surface areas which include cracks are extracted as crack images by analyzing the color variance on norm. Then cracks are extracted from those areas by introducing a method on discriminant analysis. According to experiments using the images of different road surfaces, the new proposal showed better performances than the conventional approaches.", "paper_title": "Road crack detection using color variance distribution and discriminant analysis for approaching smooth vehicle movement on non-smooth roads", "paper_id": "WOS:000358074500003"}
