Therefore, how to improve the success rate for adopting a KMS becomes important. This study applies a technology acceptance model as its theoretical framework. Critical external variables, empowering leadership, task-technology fit (TTF) and compatibility are proposed as significant contributors to KMS. To test the proposed model, data were collected through a questionnaire survey sent to IT managers of 500 large companies in Taiwan. The results indicate that the perceptions of usefulness, ease-of-use and compatibility significantly affect behavioural intention. Empowering leadership, TTF and compatibility are significant predictors of perceived ease of use (PEOU); however, perceived usefulness is only influenced by compatibility and PEOU. Further, there is a positive and significant relationship between TTF and compatibility. Finally, this study also discusses the implications for practitioners.", "paper_title": "Knowledge management system adoption: exploring the effects of empowering leadership, task-technology fit and compatibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000287026000010"}
