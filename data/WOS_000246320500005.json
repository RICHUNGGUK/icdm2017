Today, the indexing of these resources is carried out manually by the CISMeF team at the University Hospital of Rouen. This indexing is based on MeSH thesaurus. We use a subset of SCORM metadata standard. This choice was defined in collaboration with the French Medical Virtual University consortium (French acronym: UMVF). Currently, with the UMVF searching tool (called Doc'UMVF), medical students can reach more than 3300 resources useful in their curriculum. Doc'UMVF is developed in close collaboration between the medical informatics laboratories of Rennes and Rouen. In this paper we present two complementary searching tools based on different methods and which are integrated and used to improve both the relevance and the coverage rate of the answers. A specific searching module has been built to retrieve specific resources concerning the National Medical Exam ENC (\"Examen National Classant\") is also available. Nevertheless, due to lack of time, numerous resources are not yet indexed. Therefore we have decided to use also automatic indexing method (Nomindex). This approach will be improved by further research works, resulting from Rouen and Geneva teams. After having built a searching meta-motor, our objective is to develop a meta-tool intended to index the whole set of digital pedagogical resources produced by the UMVF framework. This manual re-indexing will be carried out only for the most important resources (national references), with a more or less fine granularity (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.", "paper_title": "Doc'UMVF: Two search tools to provide quality-controlled teaching resources in French to students and teachers", "paper_id": "WOS:000246320500005"}
