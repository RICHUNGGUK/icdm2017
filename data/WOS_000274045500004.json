In addition, to develop an e-Training course, personal ignorance or incorrect concepts might significantly affect the quality of the course if only a single employee is asked to develop the subject materials. To cope with this problem, a multi-expert e-Training course design model is proposed, and a computer-assisted e-Training course development system has been implemented accordingly. Moreover, a practical application has shown that the innovative approach not only can improve the quality of the e-Training courses, but also help experienced employees to well organize their domain knowledge.", "paper_title": "A Computer-Assisted Collaborative Approach for Developing Enterprise e-Training Courses on the Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000274045500004"}
