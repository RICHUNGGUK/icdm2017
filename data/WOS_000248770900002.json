A prescription is meant to be the best error concealment scheme among several pre-chosen ones, which are evaluated at encoder side for each MB. The collection of prescriptions for each frame is compressed and transmitted through a reliable channel to provide flexible and better error-recovery performance at decoder side. Experimental results show that the proposed PEC method is capable of achieving a PSNR improvement of up to 1.5 dB, with respect to the best single-mode scheme, when video bit rate and PER (packet error rate) are up to 512 kbps and 20%, respectively, whereas only a small amount of overheads (i.e., the coded prescriptions) is generated for reliable transmission. 2007 Elsevier Inc.
