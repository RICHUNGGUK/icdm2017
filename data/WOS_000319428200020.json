The pathogen-host interaction search tool (PHISTO) is a web-accessible platform that provides relevant information about pathogen-host interactions (PHIs). It enables access to the most up-to-date PHI data for all pathogen types for which experimentally verified protein interactions with human are available. The platform also offers integrated tools for visualization of PHI networks, graph-theoretical analysis of targeted human proteins, BLAST search and text mining for detecting missing experimental methods. PHISTO will facilitate PHI studies that provide potential therapeutic targets for infectious diseases.", "paper_title": "PHISTO: pathogen-host interaction search tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000319428200020"}
