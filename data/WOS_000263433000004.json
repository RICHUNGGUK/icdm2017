The topology compression consists of two parts-the mesh's boundary consisting of quadrilaterals is compressed first, and then the hexahedra are processed by the help of six commands. The topology compression algorithm has been matched against the best-known method to-date, and shows itself to be competitive. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
