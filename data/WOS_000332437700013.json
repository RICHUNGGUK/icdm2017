This study focused on an educational physics game about Newton's 3 Laws of Motion called SURGE: The Fuzzy Chronicles. Eighty-six middle school students played one of three versions of the game: (1) the base version with no tips or questions, (2) the self-explanation version with self-explanation questions prompts, and (3) the explanatory feedback version with gameplay tips. There were no significant overall learning differences between the three groups, but students in the base version successfully answered more questions about Newton's second law than students in the self-explanation group. This may have been due to students in the base condition progressing significantly further through the game than students in the self-explanation group. The results suggest that the cognitive load for gameplay as well as game flow must be managed in order for students to take advantage of explanation functionality in educational tools designed to increase deeper, germane processing.
