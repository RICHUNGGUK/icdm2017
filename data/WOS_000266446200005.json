One is the density classification. Each rule classifies the density of its conserved quantity in the same sense that Capcarrere and Sipper proved for rule 184. The other is the nonequilibrium phase transition similar to that shown by the TASEP. Possible relations between the number of conserved quantities and the dynamical behavior is discussed.", "paper_title": "Characteristic Dynamics of Elementary Cellular Automata with a Single Conserved Quantity", "paper_id": "WOS:000266446200005"}
