However, currently, there is no any cross-language medical information retrieval (CLMIR) system that can help Chinese-speaking consumers cross the language barrier in finding useful English medical information. A few CLMIR systems utilize MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) to help overcome the language barrier. Unfortunately, the traditional Chinese version of MeSH is currently unavailable. In this paper, we employ a semi-automatic term translation method to construct a Chinese-English MeSH by exploiting abundant multilingual Web resources, including Web anchor texts and search-result pages. Through this method, we have developed a Chinese-English Mesh Compilation System to assist knowledge engineers in compiling a Chinese-English medical thesaurus with more than 19,000 entries. Furthermore, this thesaurus has been used to develop a prototypical system for cross-language medical information retrieval, MMODE, which can help consumers retrieve top-quality English medical information using Chinese terms.
