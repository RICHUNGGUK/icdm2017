It is assumed that the drive chaotic system is perturbed by white noise and shows stochastic chaotic behavior. In addition the output of the system does not contain the whole state variables of the system, and it is also affected by some independent white noise. By combining the UKBF and the sliding mode control, a synchronizing control law is proposed. Simulation results show the ability of the proposed method in synchronizing chaotic systems in presence of noise. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
