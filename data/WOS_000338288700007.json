We obtain two upper bounds for the distance-t chromatic index, the least number of colours necessary for such a colouring. One is a bound of (2 - epsilon)Delta(t) for graphs of maximum degree at most Delta, where e is some absolute positive constant independent of t. The other is a bound of O(Delta(t)/log Delta) (as Delta -> infinity) for graphs of maximum degree at most Delta and girth at least 2t + 1. The first bound is an analogue of Molloy and Reed's bound on the strong chromatic index. The second bound is tight up to a constant multiplicative factor, as certified by a class of graphs of girth at least g, for every fixed g >= 3, of arbitrarily large maximum degree Delta, with distance-t chromatic index at least Omega(Delta t/log Delta).", "paper_title": "The Distance-t Chromatic Index of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000338288700007"}
