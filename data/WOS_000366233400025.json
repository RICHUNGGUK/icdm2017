The problem has wide applications in cargo transportation, warehouse management, medical packaging, and so on. We develop a differential evolution (DE) algorithm hybridized with a novel packing heuristic strategy, best-match-first (BMF), which generates a compact packing solution based on a given box packing sequence and a container loading sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a set of industrial instances and randomly generated instances. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing solution approaches in terms of solution quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
