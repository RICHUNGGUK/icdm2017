Through a case study based on measurement data, we showed that network anomalies generating a large number of small flows, such as network scans or SYN flooding, become difficult to detect during packet sampling. We then developed an analytical model that enables us to quantitatively evaluate the effect of packet sampling and traffic conditions, such as anomalous traffic volume, on detection accuracy. We also investigated how the detection accuracy worsens when the packet sampling rate decreases. In addition, we show that, even with a low sampling rate, spatially partitioning monitored traffic into groups makes it possible to increase detection accuracy. We also developed a method of determining an appropriate number of partitioned groups, and we show its effectiveness.
