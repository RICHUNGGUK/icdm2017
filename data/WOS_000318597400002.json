It has be shown that secrecy can be improved when the transmitter simultaneously transmits an information-bearing signal to the intended receivers and artificial noise to confuse the eavesdroppers. Several processing schemes have been proposed to limit the cochannel interference (CCI). In this paper, we propose the increasing security degree of freedom (ISDF) method, which takes an idea from dirty-paper coding (DPC) and ZF beam-forming. By means of known interference precancellation at the transmitter, we design each precoder according to the previously designed precoding matrices, rather than other users' channels, which in return provides extra freedom for the design of precoders. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the better performance and relatively low complexity.", "paper_title": "Increasing Security Degree of Freedom in Multiuser and Multieve Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000318597400002"}
