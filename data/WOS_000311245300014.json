This study focused on human detection using an omni-directional stereo vision (OSV). The Lucas-Kanade optical flow detection method was used to detect human in a panoramic image. A 3D panoramic image that was reconstructed from stereo rectified images using the sum of squared differences (SSDs) method was used to locate the position of a human. To evaluate the performance of the developed human detection method, two RTK-GPSs were used to investigate the accuracy of the detection method under stationary and motion conditions of a robot tractor. The results of field experiments indicated that a human could be detected successfully under both given conditions in the daytime. The RMS error of measured distance was less than half a meter compared with the reference distance measured by the RTK-GPSs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
