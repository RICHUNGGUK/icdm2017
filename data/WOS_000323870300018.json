To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, some security analyses are presented. It can be concluded that, the proposed image encryption technique can be applied for practical applications. Although the Jacobian elliptic maps presented in this paper aim at image encryption, it is not just limited to this experience and can be directly applied in other information security fields such as video encryption.
