In this paper, we propose a novel saliency detection model based on color contrast and image boundaries. The saliency of an image is defined as the contrast between the image elements (regions) and image boundaries elements (regions). We consider the saliency in two-stage procedure rather than in one stage. First of all, according to the definition of saliency, we take four boundaries of image into consideration respectively to obtain a combination coarse saliency map. Furthermore, a new energy function based on the coarse saliency map is proposed, which takes the coarse saliency map as input to yield the final full resolution saliency map. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Saliency detection with color contrast based on boundary information and neighbors", "paper_id": "WOS:000350223900009"}
