The paper first presents an implicit time integration scheme for an advanced constitutive model. This scheme is based on the return-mapping algorithm and proposes a use of the viscoplastic multiplier which enables to avoid Jacobian matrixes inversion and high computational cost. This peculiar numerical model is then integrated in a comprehensive computational TMF lifetime approach. The couple is shown to give the best agreement in terms of TMF lifetime estimation when compared with more simple TMF design approaches and an other constitutive model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
