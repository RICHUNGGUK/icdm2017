The health platform called SIS-RA is used through a Web interface. An iconic interface is dedicated to the platform and presents information in a unique way for all users. Methods: New techniques have been used to develop this platform which will be used by a great number of Rhone-Alpes doctors in the future. We chose a user-centered design which takes into account doctors' requirements (hospital and GP). We also consider that no system has to be rebuilt, but a direct connection to the legacy systems should be provided. Results. The platform permits fast and more appropriate medical decisions than those made without this information system. The iconic interface presents all medical documents in a uniform way. Currently, I I healthcare facilities and 15 community health networks are connected to SIS-RA sharing more than 60,000 records with 1.2 million indexed items. 3200 doctors use the system. Conclusion: The platform is approved by French vision authorities(regional hospitals association (ARH)), regional practitioners union (URML) and Rhones-Alpes region administration and is known as the official shared health record.", "paper_title": "The Rhone-Alpes health platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000249094000012"}
