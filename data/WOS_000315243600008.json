Especially when a number of large-scale distributed applications concurrently share the resource, efficacy of comprehensive usage of network, computation, and storage resources is needed from the viewpoint of information processing performance. Therefore, a reconsideration of the coordination and partitioning of functions between networks (providers) and applications (users) has become a recent research topic. In this paper, we first address the need and discuss the feasibility of adaptive network services by introducing special processing nodes inside the network. Then, a design and an implementation of an advanced relay node platform are presented, by which we can easily prototype and test a variety of advanced in-network processing on Linux and off-the-shelf PCs. A key feature of the proposed platform is that integration between kernel and userland spaces enables to easily and quickly develop various advanced relay processing. Finally, on the top of the advanced relay node platform, we implement and test an adaptive packet compression scheme that we previously proposed. The experimental results show the feasibility of both the developed platform and the proposed adaptive packet compression.", "paper_title": "A Design and Prototyping of In-Network Processing Platform to Enable Adaptive Network Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000315243600008"}
