In the presence of antagonistic interference, reliable communication in sensor networks becomes an extremely challenging problem that, in recent years, has attracted significant attention from the research community. This survey presents the current state of affairs in the formulation of theoretical models for adversarial interference in sensor networks and the different algorithmic remedies developed by the research community. There is a particular focus on jamming adversaries and Byzantine faults as these capture a wide range of benign faults as well as malicious attacks. The models in the literature are examined and contrasted with the aim of discerning the underlying assumptions that dictate analytical bounds with regards to feasibility and a number of performance metrics such as communication complexity, latency, and energy efficiency. Limitations are also highlighted with a focus on how various results impact real world applications and, conversely, how the current sensor network technology informs newer models. Finally, directions for future research are discussed.", "paper_title": "Overcoming Adversaries in Sensor Networks: A Survey of Theoretical Models and Algorithmic Approaches for Tolerating Malicious Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000296728500006"}
