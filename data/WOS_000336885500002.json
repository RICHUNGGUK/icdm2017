Hacking is not an easy task, it requires high effort and perseverance to get access, the ability to gather information, skill of coding, and internetworking capability is a must. To prevent from intruders, penetration testing is a comprehensive effort to attempt breaking into a system. In this work the evaluation of performance system is built on Linux operating systems. It can be seen that penetration tests are a useful measurement to check the sanity of network infrastructure and hackable or not.", "paper_title": "Threat and Vulnerability Penetration Testing: Linux", "paper_id": "WOS:000336885500002"}
