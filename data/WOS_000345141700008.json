To address these issues, we adopted a multiphase non-Newtonian model to carry out a comparative study between a helical artery bypass graft (ABG) and a conventional ABG in which the blood flow is composed of plasma and RBCs. The investigation focused on the mechanism of RBC buildup in an ABG but the haemodynamic parameters obtained by single-phase and multiphase models were also compared. The aggregation of RBCs along the inside wall of a conventional ABG and at the heel of its distal anastomosis was predicted while a poor aggregation was observed along the helical ABG. In addition, RBCs were observed to gradually sediment along the gravity direction. However, the computed haemodynamic parameters by multiphase model qualitatively agreed well with those by single-phase model. It was concluded that (1) the single-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is reasonable to do the computation of haemodynamic parameters in ABGs; (2) secondary flow does not definitely produce buildup of RBCs in the inside curvature, its configuration played an important role in the movement of RBCs and the dominating one-way rotating flow in a helical ABG guaranteed no buildup of RBCs on its inside wall and (3) gravity direction is important for the movement of RBCs which may help to explain why doing exercise is good for human health. This study helps to shed light on the migration of RBCs in ABGs, which cannot be explored by single-phase CFD models, and provides more understanding of the underlying flow mechanism for ABG failure.", "paper_title": "Numerical investigation of haemodynamics in a helical-type artery bypass graft using non-Newtonian multiphase model", "paper_id": "WOS:000345141700008"}
