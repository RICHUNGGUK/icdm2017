We provide an algorithm that solves CAPACITATED DOMINATING SET exactly in O(1.89(n)) time and polynomial space. Despite the fact that the CAPACITATED DOMINATING SET problem is quite similar to the DOMINATING SET problem, we are not aware of any published algorithms solving this problem faster than the straightforward O*(2(n)) solution prior to this paper. This was stated as an open problem at Dagstuhl seminar 08431 in 2008 and IWPEC 2008. We also provide an exponential approximation scheme for CAPACITATED DOMINATING SET which is a trade-off between the time complexity and the approximation ratio of the algorithm.
