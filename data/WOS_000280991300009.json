Drawings of such graphs generally suffer from visual clutter induced by the large amount of edges and their crossings. Consequently, it is difficult to read the relationships between nodes and the high-level edge patterns that may exist in standard node-link diagram representations. Edge bundling techniques have been proposed to help solve this issue, which rely on high quality edge rerouting. In this paper, we introduce an intuitive edge bundling technique which efficiently reduces edge clutter in graphs drawings. Our method is based on the use of a grid built using the original graph to compute the edge rerouting. In comparison with previously proposed edge bundling methods, our technique improves both the level of clutter reduction and the computation performance. The second contribution of this paper is a GPU-based rendering method which helps users perceive bundles densities while preserving edge color.", "paper_title": "Winding Roads: Routing edges into bundles", "paper_id": "WOS:000280991300009"}
