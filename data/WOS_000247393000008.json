In this paper, we consider embeddings of meshes in crossed cubes. The major research findings in this paper are: (1) For any integer n >= 1, a 2 x 2n(-1) mesh can be embedded in the n-dimensional crossed cube with dilation 1 and expansion 1. (2) For any integer n >= 4, two node-disjoint 4 x 2(n-3) meshes can be embedded in the n-dimensional crossed cube with dilation 1 and expansion 2. The obtained results are optimal in the sense that the dilations of the embeddings are 1. The embedding of the 2 x 2(n-1) mesh is also optimal in terms of expansion because it has the smallest expansion 1. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
