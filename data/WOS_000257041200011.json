In this paper, the authors propose a new authentication protocol, based on pointer forwarding to reduce the HLR update cost and traffic load for the MS authentication protocol. The proposed protocol for GSM can achieve some objectives described in Introduction. Compared with other authentication protocols, our protocol is efficient.
