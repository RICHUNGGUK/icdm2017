The new method is based on a vision model that incorporates various masking effects of human visual perception and a perceptual distortion metric that takes spatial and spectral summation of individual quantization errors into account. Compared with the conventional rate-based distortion minimization JPEG2000 encoding, the new method provides a way to generate consistent quality images at a lower bit rate.", "paper_title": "JPEG2000 encoding with perceptual distortion control", "paper_id": "WOS:000238714200006"}
