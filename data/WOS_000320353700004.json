This increasing flexibility, however, typically implies decreased user guidance by the PAIS and thus poses significant challenges to its users. As a major contribution of this work, we propose a recommendation system which assists users during process execution to optimize performance goals of the processes. The recommendation system is based on a constraint-based approach for planning and scheduling the BP activities and considers both the control-flow and the resource perspective. To evaluate the proposed constraint-based approach different algorithms are applied to a range of test models of varying complexity. The results indicate that, although the optimization of process execution is a highly constrained problem, the proposed approach produces a satisfactory number of suitable solutions.
