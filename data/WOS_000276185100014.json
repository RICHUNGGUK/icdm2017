The system comprises three stages: the stencil preparation stage, the page printing stage and the invoice assembly stage. Since each page can be considered as a component and the invoice as the finished product, the production system for multi-page invoices can be treated as an assembly-type flowshop with parallel machines at the last two stages. Moreover, two types of sequence-dependent setup operations are considered at the second stage. The objective is to minimize the makespan for all the invoice orders. We first formulate this problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Then a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed for solving it due to its NP-hardness. To evaluate the performance of the HGA heuristic, a lower bound for the makespan is developed. Numerical experiment indicates that our algorithm can solve the problem efficiently and effectively.
