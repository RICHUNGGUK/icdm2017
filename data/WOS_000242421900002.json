Propagating generalized arc consistency on this constraint is NP-hard. We show that computing even the lower bound on the number of values is NP-hard. We therefore study different approximation heuristics for this problem. We introduce three new methods for computing a lower bound on the number of values. The first two are based on the maximum independent set problem and are incomparable to a previous approach based on intervals. The last method is a linear relaxation of the problem. This gives a tighter lower bound than all other methods, but at a greater asymptotic cost.", "paper_title": "Filtering algorithms for the NVALUE constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000242421900002"}
