In this paper, an edge-based tracking algorithm is proposed. We extract the feature points by efficiently utilizing the image edges in the object region. Then the parameter vector of the object's motion model is estimated based on minimizing the sum-of-squared differences between the reference feature points in the reference frame and the observed feature points in the tracking sequence frame. The experiments show that the edge-based tracking algorithm proposed by us can track object efficiently under uniform and varying illumination conditions. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
