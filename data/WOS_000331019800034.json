CBR has been applied in many areas in the commercial sector to assist daily operations. However, CBR is relatively new in the field of forensic science. Even though forensic personnel have consciously used past experiences in solving new cases, the idea of applying machine intelligence to support decision-making in forensics is still in its infancy and poses a great challenge. This paper highlights the limitation of the methods used in forensics compared with a CBR method in the analysis of forensic evidences. The design and development of an Intelligent Forensic Autopsy Report System (I-AuReSys) basing on a CBR method along with the experimental results are presented. Our system is able to extract features by using an information extraction (IE) technique from the existing autopsy reports; then the system analyzes the case similarities by coupling the CBR technique with a Naive Bayes learner for feature-weights learning; and finally it produces an outcome recommendation. Our experimental results reveal that the CBR method with the implementation of a learner is indeed a viable alternative method to the forensic methods with practical advantages.
