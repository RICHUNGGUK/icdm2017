When meeting problems, learners usually force themselves to form work groups in order to find a solution. Currently, blogs are becoming more popular and in fact has formed a community wherein people can share their learning experiences with others. Many pedagogical applications have adopted what are posted in the community for supplementary learning. Integrating blogs in an intelligent tutoring system means that learners can better regulate and enhance their own learning. In this study, a novel learning device, a blog-based dynamic learning map, which employs both information retrieval and automated scheduling techniques, is designed to provide useful blog articles to help learning. The relevant articles in blogs are used to promote learner engagement in their interactions with the teaming map and hence achieve their goals more easily. An experimental course has been implemented and the results show that learners make use of the blog-based learning aid in a very positive way and can eventually cross the specified threshold in a test. The proposed approach can encapsulate the dynamic learning principles in cohesive and supportive ways. Thus it can lead learners to gain useful supplementary materials, shorten the learning time and offering expanded alternative viewpoints to use in the solution of assigned problems. Our results show that both the learners and lectures are very positive to the design of our blog-based dynamic learning map. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
