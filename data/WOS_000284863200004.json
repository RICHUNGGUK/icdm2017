Because the two frequencies of UNFSK are extremely close, the traditional demodulation method cannot separate them successfully. This study aims to successfully demodulate the UNFSK signals by applying cycle extension and notch filter. The signal processing procedure is as follows: First, the sampling signals have been made cycle extension to enlarge their spectrum difference between signal 0 and 1; secondly, the cycle extension signals have been processed by the notch filter algorithm and finally, we could get the information by sentencing the filtering result. Finally, the method is applied in transportation. The simulation results proved that the algorithm greatly enhanced UNFSK signal demodulation performance, compared to the traditional demodulation method. There can be 2-3 dB improvement in performance, which is very suitable for UNFSK. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
