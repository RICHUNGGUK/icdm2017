The framework is applied to magnetic resonance spectra (MRS), which are indicators of the grade of malignancy in brain tumours. A model for multivariate data clustering and visualization, the generative topographic mapping (GTM), is re-formulated as a mixture of Student's t-distributions making it more robust to outliers while supporting the imputation of missing values. An important new development is the extension of the model to provide automatic feature relevance determination. Its effectiveness on the MRS data is demonstrated empirically. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V..
