Although some approaches have addressed this problem previously in the literature, many are not well suited to the sequential nature of the data. RESULTS: Here, we present a method that allows us to infer regulatory network structures that may vary between time points, using a set of hidden states that describe the network structure at a given time point. To model the distribution of the hidden states, we have applied the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model, a non-parametric extension of the traditional Hidden Markov Model, which does not require us to fix the number of hidden states in advance. We apply our method to existing microarray expression data as well as demonstrating is efficacy on simulated test data.", "paper_title": "Inference of temporally varying Bayesian Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000312105300019"}
