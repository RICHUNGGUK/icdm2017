However, planning of chemical centres still involves many formidable challenges, including locating production sites, arrangement of transportation, and selection of appropriate technologies. These problems become further complicated when considering the geographic situation of a region under study. In this paper, we propose a multi-period mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach to the optimal planning of chemical centres. The planning horizon is firstly divided into several time intervals, and the planning region is represented by a grid. Then a superstructure representation is developed to capture all available logistic and technical options. Based on the superstructure representation, an MIP problem is developed, and by solving it an optimal planning strategy can be obtained. A real-life case study for the UK follows, where the UK is divided into a grid of 34 cells. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
