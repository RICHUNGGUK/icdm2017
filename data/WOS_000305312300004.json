Compared with the various and approximately infinite application requirements from end users, the web services held by a cloud platform are usually limited. Therefore, it is often a challenging effort to develop a service composition, in such a situation that only part of the functional qualified candidate services could be found inside a cloud platform. In this situation, the absent services will be invocated in a cross-platform way outside the cloud platform. In view of this challenge, a QoS-aware composition method is investigated for supporting cross-platform service invocation in cloud environment. Furthermore, some experiments are deployed to evaluate the method presented in this paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
