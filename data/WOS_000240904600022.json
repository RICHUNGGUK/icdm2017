A good playlist is not merely a bunch of songs, but a selected collection of songs, arranged in a meaningful sequence, e.g. a good DJ creates good playlists. Our CBR approach focuses on recommending new and meaningful playlists, i.e. selecting a collection of songs that are arranged in a meaningful sequence. In the proposed approach, the Case Base is formed by a large collection of playlists, previously compiled by human listeners. The CBR system first retrieves from the Case Base the most relevant playlists, then combines them to generate a new playlist, both relevant to the input song and meaningfully ordered. Some experiments with different trade-offs between the diversity and the popularity of songs in playlists are analysed and discussed.", "paper_title": "Case-based sequential ordering of songs for playlist recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240904600022"}
