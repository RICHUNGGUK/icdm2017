By taking the advantage of smaller dimension, lower cost and simple structure of the sensor node, the more restrictions come together with sensors. Therefore, the limited power of sensor nodes is the most direct and difficult problem we meet. The limitation on the energy of sensor node makes the bottlenecks for designing the suitable routing protocols. In order to solve the problem of limited energy, the loading of nodes have to be distributed as possible as it can. If the energy consumption can be shared averagely by most nodes, then the lifetime of sensor networks will be enlarged. Thus we propose the routing protocol called Reactive Energy Decision Routing Protocol (REDRP) for sensor networking by considering several representative routing protocols in different structures. This protocol will create the routes in reactive routing method to transmit the data node gathered and the REDRP use the residual energy of nodes as the routing decision for energy-aware. As the results of simulation shows that the more fairness usage of sensor nodes, the total energy consumption of entire network will be distributed fairly by our protocol and the lifetime will also be increased.", "paper_title": "REDRP: Reactive energy decisive routing protocol for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600054"}
