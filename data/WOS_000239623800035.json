By evaluating interestingness value calculated from interestingness measures on association rules, a new approach based on the Pearson's correlation coefficient is proposed to answer the question: How we can capture the stable behaviors of interestingness measures on different datasets?. In this paper, a correlation graph is used to evaluate the behavior of 36 interestingness measures on two datasets.", "paper_title": "Evaluating interestingness measures with linear correlation graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800035"}
