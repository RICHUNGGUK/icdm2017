To achieve optimal image quality for each halftoning method, the classification of halftone images is highly demanded. This study employed the least mean-square filter for improving the robustness of the extracted features, and employed the naive Bayes classifier to verify all the extracted features for classification. Nine of the most well-known halftoning methods were involved for testing. The experimental results demonstrated that the classification performance can achieve a 100% accuracy rate, and the number of distinguishable halftoning methods is more than that of a former method established by Chang and Yu.", "paper_title": "Halftone Image Classification Using LMS Algorithm and Naive Bayes", "paper_id": "WOS:000295008100013"}
