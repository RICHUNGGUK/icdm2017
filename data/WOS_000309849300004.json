V-K, the clustered traveling salesman problem is to compute a shortest tour so that all vertices are visited and the vertices of each cluster are visited consecutively. Supposing that no starting and ending vertices of any cluster are specified, we provide a 13/6 (approximate to 2.17)-approximation algorithm, and improve the previous approximation ratio of 2.75 due to Guttmann-Beck, Hassin, Khuller, and Raghavachari [Algorithmica 28 (2000) 422-437].
