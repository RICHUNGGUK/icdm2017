In settings where the available geological and/or geophysical data are relatively sparse, the construction of a consistent 3D structural framework is seldom straightforward and is strongly dependent on the optimization of the use of surface data. To deal with this challenge, workflows for constructing 3D models from sparse surface data have been proposed by multiple authors. This paper presents three automated techniques which optimize the use of data and enhance the time-efficiency of 3D model construction: 3D geological contact analysis, 3D dip-domain construction, and 3D isopach measurement and construction.", "paper_title": "Automated tools within workflows for 3D structural construction from surface and subsurface data", "paper_id": "WOS:000266162800005"}
