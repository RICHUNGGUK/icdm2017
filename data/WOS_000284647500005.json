Non-homogeneous model resizing introduced by Kraevoy et al. is able to preserve important geometric features during anisotropic scaling. However, many practical objects contain various geometric textures. Different from similar objects without geometric textures, such objects seem to be extremely difficult for resizing even if the underlying surfaces are relatively simple. In this paper, we present an automatic model resizing method based on geometric texture transfer. Geometric textures are separated from the underlying surfaces and reconstructed on the non-homogenously scaled surfaces using geometric texture synthesis. By utilizing the natural correspondence between the surfaces before and after resizing, surfaces with multiple geometric textures can be resized and geometric texture recovered automatically. Experimental results show that our method effectively and automatically preserves geometric textures during the model resizing process. Our method can also easily be used in general deformation process.", "paper_title": "Anisotropic resizing and deformation preserving geometric textures", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647500005"}
