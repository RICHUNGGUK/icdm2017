In order to enable adaptive execution of multiple jobs running concurrently in a computational grid, we propose an integrated performance-based resource management framework that is supported by a multi-agent system (MAS). The multi-agent system initially allocates the jobs on to different resource providers based on a resources election algorithm. Later, during runtime, if performance of any job degrades or quality of service cannot be maintained for some reason (resource failure or overloading), the multi-agent system assists the job to adapt to the system. This paper focuses on a part of our framework in which adaptive execution facility is supported. Adaptive execution facility is availed by reallocation and local tuning of jobs. Mobile, as well as static agents are employed for this purpose. The paper provides a summary of the design and implementation and demonstrates the efficiency of the framework by conducting experiments on a local grid test bed.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Execution of Jobs in Computational Grid Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000270282900012"}
