It evolves from the sleep mode operation in the IEEE 802.16 standard but with more advanced features, e.g., the listening window may be extended and the sleep cycle length is adjustable. To fully exploit these advancements, we conduct a comprehensive analytical study on the power consumption and average packet delay under the new sleep mode operation. Then, based on the analytical results, we propose a novel adaptive sleep mode management scheme called Adaptive Sleep Mode Management (ASMM), which adjusts an MS's sleep cycle and listening window in an adaptive manner based on online monitoring and estimation of the traffic condition. The goal is to minimize the power consumption by the MS while limiting the average packet delay under a user-specified level. The effectiveness of ASMM is demonstrated via simulation-based performance evaluation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
