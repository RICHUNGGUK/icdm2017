The approach uses natural language processing - in the form of simple grammar-based techniques - to extract features of interest from textual data retrieved from a microblogging platform in real-time and generate appropriate executable code for the robot. The simple rule-based solution exploits some of the 'natural' constraints imposed by microblogging platforms to manage the potential complexity of the interactions and create bi-directional communication. In order to evaluate the developed system, an analysis of real-time, user-generated social media data is presented. The analysis demonstrates the feasibility of producing programmes from the social media data which lead to executable actions by a front-end application - an approach of immediate relevance to web-based systems, like question-answering engines, personal digital assistants, and smart home/office devices.
