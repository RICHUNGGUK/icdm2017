It uses discrete sets of velocity vectors, or lattices, to create a reduced model of the molecular dynamics of a continuum fluid. While several lattices are believed to behave isotropically, there are reports of qualitatively incorrect results. However, thus far, the reason as to why a lack of isotropy occurs is not known. Based on the hypothesis that lower order lattices may not display rotational invariance, this study tests the isotropy of the D3Q15, D3Q19 and D3Q27 lattices by performing simulations at intermediate Reynolds numbers (50-500) and low Knudsen number (<0.0005) in an axisymmetrical geometry with a nozzle leading to a throat followed by a sudden expansion. The symmetry properties of the results were examined. It was found that at Re >= 250 the D3Q15 and D3Q19 lattices produced different results depending on the plane of the lattice with which the flow was aligned. Lattice planes with fewer than six velocity vectors consistently produced results which were qualitatively different from the planes with six or more velocity vectors. These errors were not observed at Re = 50 or when a D3Q27 lattice was used. They appeared to be independent of grid density, collision operator and Ma. This suggests that the lattices which contain these planes are not fully isotropic and therefore do not properly replicate the behavior of a real fluid in this particular situation, notably downstream from the expansion. Predictions made using these models in more complex geometries may therefore be affected by the orientation of the lattice. When using LBM in CFD simulation (including validation) this study highlights the need for caution to ensure that the solution obtained is independent of the lattice orientation throughout the domain.
