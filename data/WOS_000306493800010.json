The scheme rests on the interpretation of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem that, using a logarithmic transformation, can be recast as a linear eigenvalue problem, for which the principal eigenvalue and its eigenfunction are sought. The latter can be computed efficiently by approximating the underlying stochastic process with a coarse-grained Markov state model for the dominant metastable sets. We illustrate our method with two numerical examples, one of which involves the task of maximizing the population of alpha-helices in an ensemble of small biomolecules (alanine dipeptide), and discuss the relation to the large deviation principle of Donsker and Varadhan.", "paper_title": "Optimal control of molecular dynamics using Markov state models", "paper_id": "WOS:000306493800010"}
