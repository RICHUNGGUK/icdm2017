First, a novel model transformation method is introduced to pull the time-varying delay uncertainty out of the original system. Consequently, the transformed model is composed of a linear time-invariant system and a norm-bounded uncertain subsystem. By using this model transformation method combined with the Lyapunov-Krasovskii technique, sufficient conditions of the dissipativity are established. Then, a fuzzy controller is designed to guarantee the dissipative performance of the closed-loop system. Finally, three examples are presented: one shows the effectiveness of model transformation method, the second performs the comparison with alternative approaches, and the third illustrates the applicability of the proposed dissipative control methods.", "paper_title": "Dissipativity Analysis and Synthesis for Discrete-Time T-S Fuzzy Stochastic Systems With Time-Varying Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000334178800012"}
