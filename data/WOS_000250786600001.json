To reinforce the case on behalf of approaches that endorse infeasible/feasible search trajectories, it is possible to formulate simple theorems disclosing useful properties of such trajectories in the context of integer programming. These results motivate a closer examination of integer programming search processes based on directional rounding processes, including a special variant called conditional directional rounding. From these foundations a variety of new strategies emerge for exploiting connections between feasible and infeasible space.", "paper_title": "Infeasible/feasible search trajectories and directional rounding in integer programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000250786600001"}
