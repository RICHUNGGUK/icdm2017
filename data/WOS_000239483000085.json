In recent years, an accelerating algorithm based on variance is addressed and has shortened the encoding time greatly; however, in the meantime, the image fidelity is obviously diminished. In this paper, a neural network is utilized to modify the variance-based encoding algorithm, which makes the quality of reconstructed images improved remarkably as the encoding time is significantly reduced. Experimental results show that the reconstructed images quality measured by peak-signal-to-noise-ratio is better than conventional variance-based algorithm, while the time consumption for encoding and the compression ratio are almost the same as the conventional variance-based algorithm.", "paper_title": "Improved variance-based fractal image compression using neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000085"}
