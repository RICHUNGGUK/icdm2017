This paper utilizes dynamic programming and linear programming transformation to provides a method to specify an optimal decision for a given inventory state. in doing so, it can be empirically shown that the structure of the optimal policy is not an order-up-to policy. Using this method, one only needs to solve a small subproblem, which using LP transformation can be done using commercially available LP solvers without concern for solution time. These results may improve the decision-making capabilities of real-time complex environments since the emphasis is on developing policy rules that are easy to implement in manufacturing applications, as well as service industries such as airlines, healthcare and education. Additionally, the results may be used as a means of evaluating (bounding) existing approximation methods. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
