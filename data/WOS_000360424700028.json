In order to achieve highly product quality, an effective optimization technique is indispensable. In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm named teaching-learning-based cuckoo search (TLCS) is proposed for parameter optimization problems in structure designing as well as machining processes. The TLCS combines the Levy flight with teaching-learning process, then evolves with a co-evolutionary mechanism: for solutions to be abandoned in the cuckoo search will perform Levy flight to generate new solutions, while for other better solutions, the teaching-learning process is used to improve the local searching ability of the algorithm. Then the proposed TLCS method is adopted into several well-known engineering parameter optimization problems. Experimental results show that TLCS obtains some solutions better than those previously reported in the literature, which reveals that the proposed TLCS is a very effective and robust approach for the parameter optimization problems.
