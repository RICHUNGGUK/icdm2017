Moreover, let us introduce n set-valued mappings F-i : Xi-1 X Y-i -> F-c(x(i)) (the family of all non-empty compact subsets of X-i), (i = 1, ... ,n 0). Here, we have a fixed point theorem in weak topology on the successively recurrent system of set-valued mapping equations: x(i) is an element of F-i(x(i-1), f(i)(x(i-1))), (i = 1, - - -, n 0). This theorem can be applied immediately to analysis of the availability of system of circular networks of channels undergone by uncertain fluctuations and to evaluation of the tolerability of behaviors of those systems.", "paper_title": "A Fixed Point Theorem in Weak Topology for Successively Recurrent System of Set-Valued Mapping Equations and Its Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394500025"}
