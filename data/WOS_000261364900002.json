This goal can be achieved by acquiring intrainterventional 2-D images and matching them to the preinterventional 3-D image via 3-D/2-D image registration. A novel 3-D/2-D registration method is proposed in this paper. The method is based on robustly matching 3-D preinterventional image gradients and coarsely reconstructed 3-D gradients from the intrainterventional 2-D images. To improve the robustness of finding the correspondences between the two sets of gradients, hypothetical correspondences are searched for along normals to anatomical structures in 3-D images, while the final correspondences are established in an iterative process, combining the robust random sample consensus algorithm (RANSAC) and a special gradient matching criterion function. The proposed method was evaluated using the publicly available standardized evaluation methodology for 3-D/2-D registration, consisting of 3-D rotational X-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR), and 2-D X-ray images of two spine segments, and standardized evaluation criteria. In this way, the proposed method could be objectively compared to the intensity, gradient, and reconstruction-based registration methods. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method performs favorably both in terms of registration accuracy and robustness The method is especially superior when just a few X-ray image, and when MR preinterventional images are used for registration, which are important advantages for many clinical applications.", "paper_title": "Robust Gradient-Based 3-D/2-D Registration of CT and MR to X-Ray Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000261364900002"}
