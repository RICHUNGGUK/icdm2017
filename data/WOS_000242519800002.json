Two control architectures, model predictive control based on ULN model and single neuron PID (SN-PID) controller based on ULN predictor, are designed to control pH neutralization process, respectively. In addition, to verify the performance of ULN, two comparisons are also made. One is the generalization ability between ULN and back-propagation (BP) network, the other comparison is ULN predictor and Smith predictor, in which the same controller is used. Simulation results prove the applicability and effectiveness of the ULN model. The special architecture and its learning algorithm give ULN more representing abilities to model and control complicated nonlinear systems with long time delay. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
