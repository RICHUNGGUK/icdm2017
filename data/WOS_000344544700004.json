The ESL method transforms dynamic problems into equivalent static problems. Although it provides an efficient way to solve dynamic optimization problems, large-scale dynamic problems still require heavy computation. In order to approximate solutions to dynamic optimization problems more efficiently, the proposed method combines ESLs with a system reduction method. The proposed method combines transient dynamic analysis with static optimization to form a highly efficient dynamic optimization algorithm.", "paper_title": "Effective structural optimization based on equivalent static loads combined with system reduction method", "paper_id": "WOS:000344544700004"}
