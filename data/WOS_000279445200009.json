Identifying the real time of the change in a process is recognized as change-point estimation problem. Most of the change-point models in the literature are limited to fixed sampling control charts which are only a special case of more effective charts known as variable sampling charts. In this paper, we develop a general fuzzy-statistical clustering approach for estimating change-points in different types of control charts with either fixed or variable sampling strategy. For this purpose, we devise and evaluate a new similarity measure based on the definition of operation characteristics and power functions. We also develop and examine a new objective function and discuss its relation with maximum-likelihood estimator. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach for different types of control charts with different sampling strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
