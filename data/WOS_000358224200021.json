A novel transformation approach is proposed, which is able to systematically transfer the original nonaffine nonlinear system into an equivalent affine one. Then, to deal with the unknown dynamics and unknown control coefficient contained in the affine system, online approximator and Nussbaum gain techniques are utilized in the controller design. It is proven rigorously that asymptotic convergence of the tracking error and ultimate uniform boundedness of all the other signals can be guaranteed by the proposed control method. The control feasibility is further verified by numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Neural Control of Nonaffine Systems With Unknown Control Coefficient and Nonsmooth Actuator Nonlinearities", "paper_id": "WOS:000358224200021"}
