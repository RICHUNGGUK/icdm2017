Rev. Lett. 95, 230505 (2005); ibid. 98, 028902 (2007)], it is found that both versions are insecure against coherent attacks though the original idea is so remarkable. To overcome this fatal flaw; here we propose a protocol with a distinct security checking strategy, which still involves single qubit operations only, making it possible to achieve better security of quantum secret sharing with current technology.", "paper_title": "SINGLE QUBIT QUANTUM SECRET SHARING WITH IMPROVED SECURITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000273154700003"}
