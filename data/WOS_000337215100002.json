In this paper we first propose a generalization of these classes of functions to the multiple-valued logic framework. Then we study their spectral properties and provide a complete spectral characterization for both the Boolean and the multiple-valued setting. We finally show that the two types of structural regularity are one the \"spectral counterpart\" of the other.", "paper_title": "Autosymmetric and Dimension Reducible Multiple-Valued Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000337215100002"}
