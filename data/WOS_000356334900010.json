Three classes of discrete-time polynomial fuzzy systems are studied via a sum of squares (SOS) approach. A polynomial fuzzy systemis amore general representation of the wellknown Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system. The conditions in the proposed approach are derived in terms of SOS, which is the extension of the LMI method. Hence, the conditions obtained in this paper are more general than the corresponding LMI approaches for T-S fuzzy systems. All the design conditions in the proposed approach can be symbolically and numerically solved via the recently developed SOSTOOLS and a semidefinite-program solver, respectively. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed SOS-based design approach.", "paper_title": "An SOS-Based Observer Design for Discrete-Time Polynomial Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000356334900010"}
