The resulting regression function follows a stochastic process known as a student t process. The model is attractive because its implementation is based on a tractable posterior predictive distribution and a simple expectation-maximization (EM) estimation algorithm. In addition, treating the transductive inference as a missing data problem, we devise the EM algorithm to deal with the parameter estimation as well as the response prediction in a single paradigm. The model is also elaborated for multivariate-response regression problems. For this purpose, we present a generalization of multivariate t models and some of its properties. Experimental results show our approaches to be effective.", "paper_title": "Semiparametric regression using student t processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000250789100002"}
