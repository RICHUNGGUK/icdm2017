The main limitation of such schemes is that they do not support short-term fairness. In this paper, we propose a new low-complexity round-robin scheduler, called Fair Round-Robin (FRR), that overcomes this limitation. FRR has similar complexity and long-term fairness properties as the STratified Round-Robin (STRR) scheduler, a recently proposed scheme that arguably provides the best quality-of-service properties among all existing round-robin-based low-complexity packet schedulers. FRR offers better short-term fairness than STRR and other existing round-robin schedulers.", "paper_title": "Fair Round-Robin: A Low-Complexity Packet Scheduler with Proportional and Worst-Case Fairness", "paper_id": "WOS:000262561900007"}
