The proposed architecture also includes BIST debug and diagnosis circuitry to help locate BIST failures. The aligned scheme detects and allows diagnosis of structural and delay faults among all synchronous clock domains, whereas the staggered scheme detects and allows diagnosis of structural and delay faults among all asynchronous clock domains. Both schemes solve the long-standing problem of using the conventional one-hot scheme, which requires testing each clock domain one at a time, or the simultaneous scheme, which requires adding isolation logic to normal functional paths across interacting clock domains. Physical implementation is easily achieved by the proposed solution due to the use of a slow-speed, global scan enable signal and reduced timing-critical design requirements. Application results for industrial designs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.", "paper_title": "Using Launch-on-Capture for Testing BIST Designs Containing Synchronous and Asynchronous Clock Domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000273928400014"}
