Education systems have a role to play in this, especially given the growing evidence of a digital divide. Through this study, we look to identify and characterize factors related to the digital skills of 10th grade Chilean students, as measured by a national standardized test. A mixed methodology was used to explore these factors and provide a more detailed analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a Hierarchical Linear Model to determine which factors explain student performance on the test. In addition to this, a qualitative analysis was also carried out using an exploratory case study. The purpose of this case study was to take a more in-depth look at the characteristics of high and low-performing students on the digital skills test. This was done by analyzing their activities, perceptions and motivations when using technology. The quantitative results revealed that the most important factors in developing digital skills are having access to a computer at home, linguistic capital, socioeconomic status, and years of experience using a computer. The qualitative study also revealed that students who scored highly on the test were generally able to focus and concentrate on their school assignments when using the Internet. These students also adopted cognitive and organizational strategies in order to be more effective. Our findings should be further investigated in order to support the design of school activities that aim to develop students' digital skills. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
