However, the roles that are designed into technologies often ill-fit the real roles of teachers, learners and other stakeholders in educational institutions. This can exacerbate problems in adoption as stakeholders do not recognise the roles described for them in the technology. In this paper, Positioning Theory is used to explore the relationship between role, social context and communication drawing on specific examples of IMS Learning Design, Virtual Learning Environments, and Personal Learning Environments. With insights gained from this analysis, recommendations are made for theoretical focus on understanding the particulars of practice and identification of specific technical issues of interoperability rather than designing technologies based on idealisations of the roles of stakeholders within institutions.", "paper_title": "Positioning Theory, Roles and the Design and Implementation of Learning Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000298048200008"}
