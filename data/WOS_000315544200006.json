So far, MBDoE for diabetes models has been considered for discrete glucose measurement systems only. However, recent advances on sensor technology allowed for the development of continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMSs), where glucose measurements can be collected with a frequency that is practically equivalent to continuous sampling. To specifically address the features of CGMSs, in this paper the optimal clinical test design problem is formulated and solved through a continuous, rather than discrete, approach. A simulated case study is used to assess the impact of CGMSs both in the optimal clinical test design problem and in the subsequent parameter estimation for the identification of a complex physiological model of glucose homeostasis. The results suggest that, although the optimal design of a clinical test is simpler if continuous glucose measurements are made available through a CGMS, the noise level and formulation may make continuous measurements less suitable for model identification than their discrete counterparts.
