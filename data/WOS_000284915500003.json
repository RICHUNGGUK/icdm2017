An accent is put on interfaces (IFs). The model of IFs consisting of a pair of finite deterministic automata sharing a part of their internal state space is introduced. The presented model of alliance interface can be successfully implemented for the study of typical phenomena in complex heterogeneous objects with a significant degree of uncertainty.", "paper_title": "ALLIANCE APPROACH TO THE MODELING OF INTERFACES IN COMPLEX HETEROGENEOUS OBJECTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000284915500003"}
