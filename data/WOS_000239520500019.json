On the other hand, many of the details that are typically neglected in this high-level perspective must necessarily be taken into account to obtain a meaningful evaluation of different architectural choices in terms of extra-functional quality attributes, like performance or reliability. Toward the reconciliation of these two contrasting needs, we propose a model-based approach whose goal is to support the derivation of sufficiently detailed prediction models from high level models of component-based systems, focusing on the prediction of performance and reliability. We exploit for this purpose a refinement mechanism based on the use of model transformation techniques.", "paper_title": "A model transformation approach for the early performance and reliability analysis of component-based systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239520500019"}
