First, the previous researches on the safety analysis and assessment were briefly reviewed for the train itself and its key equipment, and the existential problems were further pointed out. Then, using the safety monitoring data and the safety region estimation theory, a new online safety assessment method with data-driven was put forward, which was followed by a detailed description of the concrete implementation steps including the EMD (Local Mean Decomposition) and EM (Energy Moment) based safety risk evaluation index selection, Interval Type 2 Fuzzy C-Means (IT2FCM) clustering based safety region boundary calculation modeling and safety risk grading. Finally, in order to verify its performance through experiments, the above method was applied in analyzing and evaluating service states of the rolling bearings, the key equipment of the train, on the basis of mass field data. The experimental results indicate that this method is valid.", "paper_title": "An Online Quantified Safety Assessment Method for Train Service State Based on Safety Region Estimation and Hybrid Intelligence Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000359322900005"}
