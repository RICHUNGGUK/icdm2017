Unfortunately, most of these algorithms cannot be applied to instances that are defined on road networks, because they implicitly assume that the cheapest path between two customers is equal to the quickest path. Garaix and co-authors proposed to tackle this issue by first storing alternative paths in an auxiliary multi-graph, and then using that multi-graph within a branch-and-price algorithm. We show that, if one works with the original road network rather than the multi-graph, then one can solve the pricing subproblem more quickly, in both theory and practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
