The present study is the first in a series planned to explore contextual effects as moderators of both the goal and the feedback. Tentative results are reported of a study where two different levels of alternative goals (related/unrelated) are primed and compared as to theory predictions of their motivational strength. Results suggest enhanced performance when an action-related goal is primed, however, more participants must be included before final conclusions can be drawn.", "paper_title": "Persuasive appliances: Goal priming and behavioral response to product-integrated energy feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000238092800007"}
