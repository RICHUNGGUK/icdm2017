Most previous research and products intend to offer only a single warning service, such as lane departure warning, collision warning, lane change assistance, etc. Although each component of these functions elevates the driving safety and convenience to a certain degree, a new type of ADAS will be developed to integrate all of the important functions with an efficient human-machine interface (HMI) framework for various driving conditions. We present an all-around sensing system based on an integrated ADAS that senses all directions using 2 cameras and 8 sonars, recognizes the driving environment via lane and vehicle detection, and construct a novel bird's-eye view HMI of the environment for easy comprehension that even gives a proper warning signal in case of imminent danger. It was tested on our experimental vehicle with a good demonstration its working. Further, it has a good potential for commercial use by virtue of the low cost of the sensors used.", "paper_title": "An intelligent and integrated driver assistance system for increased safety and convenience based on all-around sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000252541000002"}
