For example, each value observed at a given time- stamp from environmental sensors may have an associated type ( e. g., temperature, humidity, etc.) as well as location. Time- stamp, type and location are the three aspects, which can be modeled using a tensor ( highorder array). However, the time aspect is special, with a natural ordering, and with successive time- ticks having usually correlated values. Standard multiway analysis ignores this structure. To capture it, we propose 2 Heads Tensor Analysis ( 2- heads), which provides a qualitatively different treatment on time. Unlike most existing approaches that use a PCA- like summarization scheme for all aspects, 2- heads treats the time aspect carefully. 2- heads combines the power of classic multilinear analysis with wavelets, leading to a powerful mining tool. Furthermore, 2- heads has several other advantages as well: ( a) it can be computed incrementally in a streaming fashion, ( b) it has a provable error guarantee and, ( c) it achieves significant compression ratio against competitors. Finally, we show experiments on real datasets, and we illustrate how 2- heads reveals interesting trends in the data.
