This paper outlines an LES model developed for the study of multi-component transient gas jets with density gradients. The compressible LES formulation together with the numerical model, boundary conditions, perturbation, and parallelization are discussed. A non-dissipative sixth-order finite difference scheme is used to discretize the governing equations, and a low-pass sixth-order spatial filtering scheme is employed to avoid the growth of high-frequency modes. The conditions at the boundaries are implemented using Navier-Stokes characteristic boundary conditions. In addition to code performance, results are presented from a study of an impulsively started jet at high pressure and temperature with an injected to ambient gas density ratio of approximately 3.5.
