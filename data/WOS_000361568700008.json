ECL is introduced as a subsystem Z(omega) of LK omega. The first order case Z(1) and the propositional case Z(0) of ECL are examined as well. A comparison of constructivism from the point of view of ECL and of the corresponding features of Intuitionistic Logic, and Constructive Paraconsistent Logic is proposed.", "paper_title": "Explicit Constructive Logic ECL: a New Representation of Construction and Selection of Logical Information by an Epistemic Agent", "paper_id": "WOS:000361568700008"}
