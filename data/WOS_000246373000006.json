Some of the JCR's (ISI's Journal Citation Report) Subject Categories have a greater exporting character than others because they are less isolated. This influences the rank/JIF (ISI's Journal Impact Factor) distribution of the category. While all the categories fit a negative power law fairly well, those with a greater External JIF give distributions with a more sharply defined peak and a longer tail - something like an iceberg. One also observes a major relationship between the rates of export and import of knowledge.", "paper_title": "Import-export of knowledge between scientific subject categories: The iceberg hypothesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000246373000006"}
