During recent years the topic of exact (exponential-time) algorithms for NP-hard problems in general, and for graph coloring in particular, has led to extensive research. Consequently, it is natural to ask how the techniques developed for exact graph coloring algorithms can be extended to graph homomorphisms. By the celebrated result of Hell and Nesetril, for each fixed simple graph H, deciding whether a given simple graph G has a homomorphism to H is polynomial-time solvable if H is a bipartite graph, and NP-complete otherwise. The case where H is the cycle of length 5, is the first NP-hard case different from graph coloring. We show that for an odd integer k >= 5, whether an input graph G with n vertices is homomorphic to the cycle of length k, can be decided in time min {((n)([n/k])), 2(n/2)}center dot n(O(1)). We extend the results obtained for cycles, which are graphs of treewidth two, to graphs of bounded treewidth as follows: if His of treewidth at most t, then whether input graph G with n vertices is homomorphic to H can be decided in time (t + 3)(n) center dot n(O(1)).", "paper_title": "Exact algorithms for graph homomorphisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000247033500009"}
