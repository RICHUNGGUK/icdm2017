The stochastic variations of the coefficients around their unknown mean values are modeled through Gaussian white noise produced by the Wiener process. It is shown that using the proposed adaptive control the mean square of synchronization error converges to an arbitrarily small bound around zero depending on the controller feedback gain. Simulation results indicate that the proposed adaptive controller has a high performance in synchronization of chaotic Chua circuits in noisy environment. (C) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
