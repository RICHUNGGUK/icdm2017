Understanding this physical phenomenon and developing some strategies to effectively control the vibration have both theoretical and practical significance. This paper proposes a self-tuning active control scheme for controlling FSV in a class of mechanical systems. Our main technical contributions include: setup of a data mining based neuro-fuzzy system for modeling friction; learning algorithm for tuning the neuro-fuzzy system friction model using Lyapunov stability theory, which is associated with a compensation control scheme and guaranteed closed-loop system performance. A typical mechanical system with friction is employed in simulation studies. Results show that our proposed modeling and control techniques are effective to eliminate both the limit cycle and the steady-state error. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
