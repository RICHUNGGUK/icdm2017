In this paper, we address an approach for evaluating and monitor paper formation using images acquired with an especially designed sensor, in-line, in-situ and in real time, The methodology essentially consists of applying wavelet texture analysis to raw images, in order to compute a wavelet signature for each image, based on which their discrimination, according to the formation quality level. can be made. A PCA analysis Of Such features confirms the different formation quality levels defined a priori after Visual inspection, and, furthermore, suggests a new Subclass for abnormal samples, related to the bulkiness of fibre flocks. A multivariate statistical process control framework, based on Such PCA description (PCA-MSPC), is proposed to monitor formation quality, which provides quite good results when applied to the available images, as analyzed with the ROC curve for the method and confirmed with a Monte Carlo simulation Study using subimages with 1/4 of the size of the original ones.
