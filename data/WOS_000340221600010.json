It relies on knowledge expressed by numerous rules with homogeneous structure, extracted from various scientific publications in a specific domain. We propose a predictive approach that takes two stages: a reconciliation stage which identifies groups of rules expressing a common experimental tendency and a prediction stage which generates new rules, using both descriptions coming from experimental conditions and groups of reconciled rules obtained in stage one. The method has been tested with a case study related to food science and it has been compared to a classical approach based on decision trees. The results are promising in terms of accuracy, completeness and error rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
