Moreover, exposure of unprotected authentication data is a high risk threat for organizations with online presence. The challenge is how to ensure security of multi-factor authentication data without deteriorating the performance of an identity verification system? To solve this problem, we present a novel framework that applies random projections to biometric data (inherence factor), using secure keys derived from passwords (knowledge factor), to generate inherently secure, efficient and revocable/renewable biometric templates for users' verification. We evaluate the security strength of the framework against possible attacks by adversaries. We also undertake a case study of deploying the proposed framework in a two-factor authentication setup that uses users' passwords and dynamic handwritten signatures. Our system preserves the important biometric information even when the user specific password is compromised - a highly desirable feature but not existent in the state-of-the-art transformation techniques. We have evaluated the performance of the framework on three publicly available signature datasets. The results prove that the proposed framework does not undermine the discriminating features of genuine and forged signatures and the verification performance is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art benchmark results.
