We derive lower bounds for the expected number of color comparisons when the c(n) colorings are equally probable. We prove a general lower bound of c/3n - O(root n) for c >= 2; we prove the stronger particular bounds of 7/6n - O(root n) for c = 3, 54/35n - O(root n) for c = 4, 607/315n - O(root n) for c = 5, 1592/693n - O(root n) for c = 6, 7985/3003n - O(root n) for c = 7, and 19402/6435n - O(root n) for c = 8.", "paper_title": "Average-Case Lower Bounds for the Plurality Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000265882100003"}
