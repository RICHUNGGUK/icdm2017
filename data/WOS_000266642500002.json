Our algorithms achieve a running times of nearly O(n (2/3)), which is a significant improvement over the previous algorithms taking time O(n). We also initiate the study of a more general problem: counting primitive lattice points inside planar shapes. For rational polygons containing the origin, we obtain a running time proportional to D (6/7), where D is the diameter of the polygon.", "paper_title": "Order Statistics in the Farey Sequences in Sublinear Time and Counting Primitive Lattice Points in Polygons", "paper_id": "WOS:000266642500002"}
