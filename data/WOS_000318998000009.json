Method: Interpretive and longitudinal. Results: The paper illustrates empirically how the interdependencies of integrated systems result in escalation of the type, extent and degree of complexities that cuts across previously \"local\" systems and practices. This implies that a local workaround also becomes interdependent across practices. Conclusion: The analytical concept of information infrastructure proves useful in dismantling a local/global separation, as it supports an empirical strategy of tracing out the concrete manifestations of how, where and when the \"local\" and the \"global\" are interdependent.
