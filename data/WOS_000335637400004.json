By exploiting Wikipedia articles and their reference relations, our method is able to disambiguate terms in particularly short queries with few context words and to effectively expand queries for retrieval of short documents such as tweets. Our strategy can determine when a sequence of words should be treated as a single entity rather than as a sequence of individual entities. This work is part of a larger project to retrieve information graphics in response to user queries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
