We exploit the universality of the compressed sensing framework and show that the proposed method offers a refinable data reduction approach for volumetric datasets. The accurate reconstruction is obtained from partial Fourier measurements of the original data that are sensed without any prior knowledge of specific feature domains for the data. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of surfacelets for efficient representation of volumetric data. Moreover, we establish that the accuracy of reconstruction can further improve once a more effective basis for a sparser representation of the data becomes available.", "paper_title": "Volumetric Data Reduction in a Compressed Sensing Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000340597400012"}
