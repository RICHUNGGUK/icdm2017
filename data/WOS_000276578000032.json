Robustness is achieved by introducing a sign. term to the dynamic error. To simulate numerical experiments that closely approximate the reality, a dynamic oscillator is employed as a source of a time varying wind speed signal.", "paper_title": "ROBUST VARIABLE SPEED CONTROL OF A WIND TURBINE", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000032"}
