Yet, the joint visualization of multiple object features on 2D gel-like maps is rather limited in currently available proteomics software packages. We introduce a new, simple, and intuitive visualization method that utilizes spheres to represent proteomic objects on proteomic feature maps, and exploits the spheres size and color to provide simultaneous visualization of user-selected feature pairs. Our contribution, a unified and flexible visualization mechanism that can be easily applied at any stage of a 2-DE or a LC-MS based differential proteomics study, is demonstrated and discussed using five representative scenarios. The joint visualization of proteomic object features and their spatial distribution is a powerful tool for inspecting and comparing the proteomics analysis results, attracting the users attention to useful information, such as differential expression trends and patterns, and even assisting in the evaluation and refinement of a proteomics experiment.
