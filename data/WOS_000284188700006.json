For the distributed operation, we arrange each base station (BS) to allocate the resource such that its own utility gets maximized in a noncooperative way. We define the utility such that it incorporates both the weighted sum of the average rates in each cell and the induced interference to other cells, which helps to instigate implicit cooperation among the cells. Since the data rates of different cells are coupled through inter-cell interferences, the resource allocation taken by each BS evolves over iterations. We establish that the resource allocation converges to a unique fixed point under reasonable assumptions. We demonstrate through computer simulations that the proposed algorithm can improve the weighted sum of the average rates substantially without requiring any coordination among the base stations.", "paper_title": "Distributed Uplink Resource Allocation in Multi-Cell Wireless Data Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000284188700006"}
