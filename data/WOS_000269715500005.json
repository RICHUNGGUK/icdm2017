In this paper, we propose a regularization approach to demosaicking, making use of some prior knowledge about natural color images, such as smoothness of each single color component and correlation between the different color channels. Initially, a quadratic strategy is considered and a general approach is reported. Then, an adaptive technique is analyzed, in order to improve the reconstruction near the edges and the discontinuities of the image. This is performed using a novel strategy that avoids computational demanding iterations. The proposed approach provides good performances and candidates itself for many applications. Moreover, since the response of the pixel sensors can be taken into account, it can handle nonideal acquisition devices.", "paper_title": "Regularization Approaches to Demosaicking", "paper_id": "WOS:000269715500005"}
