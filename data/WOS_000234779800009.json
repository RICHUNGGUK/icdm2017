Still, the connections are not at the heart of these fields. Each of them is fairly independent of the others when attention is restricted to basic notions and main results. We show that connections can actually be made at a fundamental level, and result in a logic with parameters that needs topological notions for its early developments, and notions from learning theory for interpretation and applicability. One of the key properties of first-order logic is that the classical notion of logical consequence is compact. We generalize the notion of logical consequence, and we generalize compactness to beta-weak compactness where beta is an ordinal. The effect is to stratify the set of generalized logical consequences of a theory into levels, and levels into layers. Deduction corresponds to the lower layer of the first level above the underlying theory, learning with less than beta mind changes to layer beta of the first level, and learning in the limit to the first layer of the second level. Refinements of Borel-like hierarchies provide the topological tools needed to develop the framework. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
