By relaxing the stringent requirement of the classical rough sets, one can obtain probabilistic approximations. The LERS can be easily applied to induce probabilistic positive and boundary rules from probabilistic positive and boundary regions. This paper discusses several fundamental issues related to probabilistic rule induction with LERS, including rule induction algorithm, quantitative measures associated with rules, and the rule conflict resolution method.
