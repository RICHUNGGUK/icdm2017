However, in concurrent online auctions, where multiple auctions for identical items are running simultaneously, bidding behaviors become very complicated and difficult to be verified. Consequently, a shill bidder can easily disguise himself as a legitimate user in order to drive up the bidding price. The goal of this paper is to propose an efficient formal approach to verifying certain bidding behaviors, including shilling behaviors, in order to detect shill suspects in concurrent online auctions. We develop a data-driven auction model based on a model template for concurrent auctions. The auction model can be formally verified using a model checker according to a set of behavioral properties specified in pattern-based linear temporal logic. To illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we use a case study to demonstrate how shill suspects can be efficiently detected.", "paper_title": "Model checking bidding behaviors in internet concurrent auctions", "paper_id": "WOS:000250901500001"}
