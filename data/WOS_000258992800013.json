Particularly, the test pattern generator is being designed. The method is based on similar principles as are well known test pattern generator design methods, like bit-fixing and bit-flipping. The novelty comprises in proposing a brand new algorithm to synthesize the test pattern generator. In principle, we synthesize a combinational block - the decoder, transforming pseudo-random code words into deterministic test patterns pre-computed by an ATPG tool. The column-matching algorithm to design the decoder is proposed. Here the maximum of output variables of the decoder is tried to be matched with the decoder inputs, yielding the Outputs be implemented as mere wires, thus without any logic. No memory elements are needed to store the test patterns, which reduces the BIST area overhead. Our BIST exploits mixed-mode testing principles. The BIST execution is divided into two disjoint phases the pseudorandom phase and the deterministic phase. This enables to reach high fault coverage in a short test time and with a low area overhead. The choice of the lengths of the two phases directly influences the test time, BIST design time and BIST area overhead. A big effort has been put to a capability of trading-off the design criteria. The method allows for scaling the test time, BIST area overhead, BIST design time, etc. The time complexity of the algorithm is Studied and experimentally evaluated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
