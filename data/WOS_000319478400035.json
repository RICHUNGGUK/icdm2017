The optimization process of our method relies on a maximum-likelihood estimation with a density function measuring discrepancies between observed images and the corresponding synthetic images calculated from the progressively deformed 3D mesh. An input mesh is necessary and can be obtained from other methods or created by implementing a multiresolution scheme. We present a 3D shape model of an asteroid obtained by this method and compare it with the models obtained with two high-resolution 3D reconstruction techniques, stereophotogrammetry, and stereophotoclinometry.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional reconstruction using multiresolution photoclinometry by deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000319478400035"}
