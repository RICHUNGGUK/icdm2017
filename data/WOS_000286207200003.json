In this work, completing the study by Keerthi et al., we explore the applicability of the SMO algorithm for solving the LS-SVM problem, by comparing First Order and Second Order working set selections concentrating on the RBF kernel, which is the most usual choice in practice. It turns out that, considering all the range of possible values of the hyperparameters, Second Order working set selection is altogether more convenient than First Order. In any case, whichever the selection scheme is, the number of kernel operations performed by SMO appears to scale quadratically with the number of patterns. Moreover, asymptotic convergence to the optimum is proved and the rate of convergence is shown to be linear for both selections.", "paper_title": "First and Second Order SMO Algorithms for LS-SVM Classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000286207200003"}
