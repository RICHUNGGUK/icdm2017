As a solution to the k-hop minimum dominating set, our connectivity-based stretchable clustering (CSC) scheme aims to minimise the number of clusterheads which are responsible for maintaining the cluster backbone. Based on the cluster topology, we present a cluster-based hashing lookup service (CHLS) which eliminate the issues of the grid system. Our method uses a size-based hash function and allows multiple bindings between one node and lookup servers, in order to reduce query delay time. They are scattered evenly in the networks by the multiple anchor clusters distribution algorithm. The present study concludes with extensive experiments showing that the CSC scheme attains stability with low leaving rate and the CHLS scheme has low communication overhead with a reasonably small query delay time.", "paper_title": "Hashing-based lookup service in mobile ad-hoc networks with multi-hop stretchable clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000345236900006"}
