This note shows that a fault-free cycle of length of at least 2(n) - 2f(v) can be embedded in an n-dimensional hypercube with f(v) = 2n - 3 and n >= 5. This result not only enhances the previously best known result, and also answers a question in [J.-S. Fu, Fault-tolerant cycle embedding in the hypercube, Parallel Computing 29 (2003) 821-832].
