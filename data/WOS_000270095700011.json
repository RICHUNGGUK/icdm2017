In this work, we propose a new lightweight Group-based Trust Management Scheme (GTMS) for wireless sensor networks, which employs clustering. Our approach reduces the cost of trust evaluation. Also, theoretical as well as simulation results show that our scheme demands less memory, energy, and communication overheads as compared to the current state-of-the-art trust management schemes and it is more suitable for large-scale sensor networks. Furthermore, GTMS also enables us to detect and prevent malicious, selfish, and faulty nodes.", "paper_title": "Group-Based Trust Management Scheme for Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270095700011"}
