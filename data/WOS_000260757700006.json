We prove that these new classes of vector functions are characterized in such a way that every vector critical point is an efficient solution of a Multiobjective Programming Problem. We establish relationships between these new classes of functions and others used in the study of efficient and weakly efficient solutions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
