A new path planner addresses this problem by combining Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and a set representation of uncertain states. An idealized algorithm is presented first, before a description of one of its possible implementations, where compact sets are wrapped into boxes. The resulting path planner is then used for nonholonomic path planning in robotics.", "paper_title": "RELIABLE ROBUST PATH PLANNING WITH APPLICATION TO MOBILE ROBOTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000270854100004"}
