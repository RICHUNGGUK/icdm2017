In doing this, we contrast the set-theoretical approach based on the notion of an element/point with the mereological approach based on the notion of a part, hence, pointless. We address time aspect of the notion of a boundary and related notions as well as approximate notions defined in the realm of rough (approximate) mereology.(1)", "paper_title": "Boundaries, Borders, Fences, Hedges", "paper_id": "WOS:000330615900012"}
