However, an effort must still be made to render them usable, intelligent, highly adaptive and able to fulfill users' needs. When distinct users interact with such a system, their intentions are likely to be different, often resulting in conflicting situations, which the system ought to recognize and, if possible, resolve automatically. However, conflict detection and resolution in HBAS are not yet fully understood. This work aims at investigating conflict in Ambient Intelligence systems, namely those supported by HBAS. Our main contribution is a systematization and review of existing literature concerning conflict detection and resolution in these systems.", "paper_title": "Conflict detection and resolution in home and building automation systems: a literature review", "paper_id": "WOS:000351241600008"}
