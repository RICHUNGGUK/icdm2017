We show that the GMQD of a two-qubit state can be alternatively obtained through the singular values of a 3 x 4 matrix whose elements are the expectation values of Pauli matrices of the two qubits. By using Heisenberg picture, the analytic results of the GMQD is obtained for three typical kinds of the quantum decoherence channels. We compare the dynamics of the GMQD with that of the quantum discord and of entanglement. We show that a sudden change in the decay rate of the GMQD does not always imply that of the quantum discord, and vice versa. We also give a general analysis on the sudden change in behavior and find that at least for the Bell diagonal states, the sudden changes in decay rates of the GMQD and that of the quantum discord occur simultaneously.", "paper_title": "GEOMETRIC MEASURE OF QUANTUM DISCORD UNDER DECOHERENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000282921000009"}
