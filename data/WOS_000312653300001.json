It refers to the OSGi Remote Service Admin specification and describes its efficient implementation over message-oriented middleware. Scalability problems of several different approaches to implementation are identified, and a solution in a form of innovative Remote Service Admin model extension is proposed. The extension, named On-demand Remote Service Admin, is analyzed and validated in the context of a motivating scenario. Validation includes performance and scalability evaluation, which confirms that all assumed requirements have been satisfied by the constructed prototype. Finally, the presented research is compared with related works.
