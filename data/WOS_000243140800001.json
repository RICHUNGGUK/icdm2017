The unrestricted variant of Ring Grooming, referred to as Unrestricted Ring Grooming, seeks a partition {P-1, P-2,...,P-k } of {1,2,...,m} such that vertical bar P-i vertical bar <= g for each 1 <= i <= k and Sigma(k)(i=1) vertical bar boolean OR(r is an element of P i) A(r)vertical bar is minimized. The restricted variant of Ring Grooming, referred to as Restricted Ring Grooming, seeks a partition {P-1,P-2,...,P-[m/g]} of {1,2,...,m} such that vertical bar P-i vertical bar| <= g for each 1 <= i <=[m/g] and Sigma(k)(i=1) vertical bar boolean OR(r is an element of P i) A(r)vertical bar is minimized. If g = 2, we provide an optimal polynomial-time algorithm for both variants. If g > 2, we prove that both both variants are NP-hard even with fixed g. When g is a power of two, we propose an approximation algorithm called iterative matching. Its approximation ratio is exactly 1.5 when g = 4, at most 2.5 when g = 8, and at most g/2 in general while it is conjectured to be at most g/4 + 1/2. The iterative matching algorithm is also extended for Unrestricted Ring Grooming with arbitrary g, and a loose upper bound on its approximation ratio is [g/2] . In addition, set-cover based approximation algorithms have been proposed for both Unrestricted Ring Grooming and Restricted Ring Grooming. They have approximation ratios of at most 1 + log g, but running time in polynomial of m(g).", "paper_title": "On Ring Grooming in optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243140800001"}
