Few full-length courses exist on agent-based modelling, and a standard curriculum has not yet been established. But there is considerable demand to include agent-based modelling into simulation courses. Modelers often come to agent-based simulation (ABS) by way of self-study or attendance at tutorials and short courses. Although there is substantial overlap, there are many aspects of agent-based modelling that differ from discrete-event simulation and System Dynamics, including the applicable problem domains, the disciplines and backgrounds of students, and the underpinnings of its computational implementation. These factors make agent-based modelling difficult to include as an incremental add-on to existing simulation courses. This paper's contribution is to report on some approaches to teaching ABS that the authors have successfully used in a range of classes and workshops.
