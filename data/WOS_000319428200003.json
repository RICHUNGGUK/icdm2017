While the average genome coverage is frequently used within algorithms in computational genomics, the complete information available in coverage profiles (i.e. histograms over all coverages) is currently not exploited to its full extent. Thus, biases such as fragmented or erroneous reference genomes often remain unaccounted for. Making this information accessible can improve the quality of sequencing experiments and quantitative analyses. Results: We introduce a framework for fitting mixtures of probability distributions to genome coverage profiles. Besides commonly used distributions, we introduce distributions tailored to account for common artifacts. The mixture models are iteratively fitted based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We introduce use cases with focus on metagenomics and develop new analysis strategies to assess the validity of a reference genome with respect to (meta-) genomic read data. The framework is evaluated on simulated data as well as applied to a large-scale metagenomic study, for which we compute the validity of 75 microbial genomes. The results indicate that the choice and quality of reference genomes is vital for metagenomic analyses and that validation of coverage profiles is crucial to avoid incorrect conclusions.", "paper_title": "Analyzing genome coverage profiles with applications to quality control in metagenomics", "paper_id": "WOS:000319428200003"}
