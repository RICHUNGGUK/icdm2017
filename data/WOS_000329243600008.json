They are applicable to a range of monitoring tasks, from bridges to gas stations to the inside of industrial chemical tanks. Though a large body of existing work focuses on image and video processing techniques, very few address the usability of such systems or the implications of real-time video dissemination. In this article, we present our work on extending the LVDBMS prototype with a multifaceted object model to characterize objects in live video streams. This forms the basis for a cross-camera tracking framework which permits objects to be tracked from one video stream to another. With this infrastructure, real-time queries may be posed to monitor complex events that occur in multiple video streams simultaneously. This live video database environment provides a general-purpose platform for distributed live video computing with the goal of enabling rapid application development for camera networks.", "paper_title": "An informatics-based approach to object tracking for distributed live video computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000329243600008"}
