In particular, the instruction cache consumes more energy than any other processor module, especially with commonly used highly associative CAM-based implementations. Two energy-efficient approaches for highly associative CAM-based instruction Cache designs are presented by means of using a segmented wordline and a predictor-based instruction fetch mechanism. The latter is based on the fact that not all instructions in a given I-cache fetch are Used due to taken branches. The proposed Fetch Mask Predictor unit determines which instructions in a cache access will actually be Used to avoid fetching any of the other instructions. Both proposed approaches are evaluated for an embedded 4-wide issue processor in 100 nm technology. Experimental results show average I-cache energy savings of 48% and overall processor energy savings of 19%. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
