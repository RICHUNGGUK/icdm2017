In this paper we describe three different algorithms for performing this operation built from standard discrete Fourier transform operations, and derive theoretical operation counts. The algorithms compared consist of the most straightforward implementation and two that exploit techniques such as phase-shifts and knowledge of zero padding to reduce computational cost. Through a library implementation (TINTL) we explore the performance characteristics of these algorithms and the performance impact of different implementation choices on actual hardware. We present comparisons within the linear-scaling DFT code ONETEP where we replace the existing interpolation implementation with our library implementation configured to choose the most efficient algorithm. Within the ONETEP Fourier interpolation stages, we demonstrate speed-ups of over 1.55 x. (C) 2014 The Authors.
