It takes advantage of overhearing by waking up all nodes at the end of a transmission to send or receive packets without needing to transmit the long preamble before. In this work, detailed analytical models of the LWT-MAC and B-MAC protocols, for both saturated and unsaturated conditions, are presented. Moreover, the key LWT-MAC parameters are optimized in order to minimize the energy consumption, constrained to obtain the same throughput as the IEEE 802.11 (CSMA/CA) MAC protocol. From the behavior of the optimal LWT-MAC parameters, a heuristic configuration is proposed. Finally, the LWT-MAC is compared to B-MAC, in both single and multi-hop scenarios, showing improvements in energy consumption, throughput and delay.", "paper_title": "Taking Advantage of Overhearing in Low Power Listening WSNs: A Performance Analysis of the LWT-MAC Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000295534900010"}
