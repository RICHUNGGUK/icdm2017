First we define the concept of cell polarity, a formal property derived from epithelial cells, which present morphologically and functionally distinct regions of the plasma membrane. Then we show two preliminary results for this new model Of Computation: oil the theoretical side, we show that P systems with cell polarity are computationally (Turing) complete; oil the modelling side, we show that the transepithelial movement of glucose from the intestinal lumen into the blood call be described by such a Formal system. Finally, we define tissue P systems with cell polarity, where each cell has fixed connections to the neighbouring cells and to the environment, according to both the cell polarity and specific cell-cell junctions.", "paper_title": "(Tissue) P systems with cell polarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000273315500005"}
