In this study, preview-based disturbance feedforward control is investigated for load mitigation. Performance is evaluated assuming highly idealized wind measurements that rotate with the blades and compared to performance using more realistic stationary measurements. The results obtained using idealized, \"best case\" measurements show that excellent performance gains are possible with reasonable pitch rates. However, the results using more realistic wind measurements show that without further optimization of the controller and/or better processing of measurements, errors in determining the shear local to each blade can remove any advantage obtained by using preview-based feedforward techniques.
