Special cascade models based on Hammerstein system modeling have been developed. The total electron content (TEC) data evaluated from GPS measurements are vital in telecommunications and satellite navigation systems. Using the model, forecast of the TEC data in 10 minute intervals 1 hour ahead, during disturbed conditions have been made. In performance analysis an operation has been performed on a new validation data set by producing the forecast values. Forecast of GPS-TEC values have been achieved with high sensitivity and accuracy before, during and after the disturbed conditions. The performance results of the cascade modeling of the near Earth space process have been discussed in terms of system identification.", "paper_title": "Neural networks and cascade modeling technique in system identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000239585200010"}
