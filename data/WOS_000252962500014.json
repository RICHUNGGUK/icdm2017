This article introduces a language extension for SystemC along with a design methodology for describing and simulating dynamically reconfigurable systems at all levels of abstraction. The presented library provides maximum, freedom of description of reconfiguration behavior and its control, while featuring simulation of runtime configuration, removal, and exchange of custom modules as well as third-party IP-cores during the complete architecture refinement process. When designing at RT-level, the resulting hardware description can easily be synthesized by standard synthesis tools.", "paper_title": "ReChannel: Describing and simulating reconfigurable hardware in systemC", "paper_id": "WOS:000252962500014"}
