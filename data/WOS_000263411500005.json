Many schemes can be found in the literature, which have significant contributions in energy conservation. However, these schemes do not concentrate on reducing the end-to-end packet delay while at the same time retaining the energy-saving capability. Since a long delay can be harmful for either large or small wireless sensor networks, this paper proposes a TDMA-based scheduling scheme that balances energy-saving and end-to-end delay. This balance is achieved by an appropriate scheduling of the wakeup intervals, to allow data packets to be delayed by only one sleep interval for the end-to-end transmission from the sensors to the gateway. The proposed scheme achieves the reduction of the end-to-end delay caused by the sleep mode operation while at the same time it maximizes the energy savings. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
