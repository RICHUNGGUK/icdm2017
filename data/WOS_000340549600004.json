In order for the mobile manipulator robotic system (MMRS) to return to its initial state when the manipulator's end-effector is requested to execute cyclical tasks, a quadratic program (QP) based repetitive motion planning and feedback control (RMPFC) scheme is proposed and analyzed. Such an RMPFC scheme can not only mix motion planning and reactive control, but also consider the physical limits of the robotic system. Mathematically, the efficacy of the RMPFC scheme is verified via gradient dynamics analysis. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the RMPFC scheme, a kinematically redundant MMRS composed of a three degrees-of-freedom (DOF) planar manipulator and an omnidirectional mobile platform is designed, modeled and analyzed. Then, repetitive motion planning and feedback control for the designed omnidirectional MMRS is studied. Besides, a numerical algorithm is developed and presented to solve the QP and resolve the redundancy of the robotic system. Moreover, computer simulations are comparatively performed on such an omnidirectional MMRS, and simulation results substantiate the effectiveness, accuracy and superiority of the proposed RMPFC scheme.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Verification of Repetitive Motion Planning and Feedback Control for Omnidirectional Mobile Manipulator Robotic Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340549600004"}
