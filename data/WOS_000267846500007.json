Most existing techniques on blind deblurring are not capable of removing complex motion blurring from the blurred images of complex structures. One promising approach is to recover the clear image using multiple images captured for the scene. However, in practice it is observed that such a multi-frame approach can recover a high-quality clear image of the scene only after multiple blurred image frames are accurately aligned during pre-processing, which is a very challenging task even with user interactions. In this paper, by exploring the sparsity of the motion blur kernel and the clear image under certain domains, we propose an alternative iteration approach to simultaneously identify the blur kernels of given blurred images and restore a clear image. Our proposed approach is not only robust to image formation noises, but is also robust to the alignment errors among multiple images. A modified version of linearized Bregman iteration is then developed to efficiently solve the resulting minimization problem. Experiments show that our proposed algorithm is capable of accurately estimating the blur kernels of complex camera motions with minimal requirements on the accuracy of image alignment. As a result, our method is capable of automatically recovering a high-quality clear image from multiple blurred images. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
