Since the number of images in image databases can be large (millions in some cases) it is important to develop automated tools to search them. In this paper, we present a content based image retrieval system for a database of parasite specimen images. Unlike most content based image retrieval systems, where the database consists of objects that vary widely in shape and size, the objects in our database are fairly uniform. These objects are characterized by flexible body shapes, but with fairly rigid ends. We define such shapes to be FleBoRE (Flexible Body Rigid Extremities) objects, and present a shape model for this class of objects. We have defined similarity functions to compute the degree of likeness between two FleBoRE objects and developed automated methods to extract them from specimen images. The system has been tested with a collection of parasite images from the Harold W. Manter Laboratory for Parasitology. Empirical and expert-based evaluations show that query by shape approach is effective in retrieving specimens of the same class. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
