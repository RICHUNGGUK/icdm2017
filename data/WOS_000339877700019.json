However, P2P streaming systems still face free-riding problems, similar to those that have been observed in P2P file sharing systems. Thus, one important problem in providing streaming services is that of providing appropriate incentives for peers to contribute their upload capacity. To this end, we propose the use of advertisements as an incentive for peers to contribute upload capacity. In the proposed framework, peers enjoy the same quality of streamed media, with the difference in quality of service being achieved through different amounts of advertisements viewed, based on the resource contributions to the system. Moreover, since calculating peers' contributions accurately is important to successfully deploying such systems, we design a token-based framework to address this problem. An extensive simulation-based study is performed to evaluate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our approach provides appropriate incentives for peers to contribute their resources. Furthermore, we explore several characteristics of the token-based mechanism which can provide system developers with insight into efficient development of such systems.", "paper_title": "A comprehensive study of the use of advertisements as incentives in P2P streaming systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000339877700019"}
