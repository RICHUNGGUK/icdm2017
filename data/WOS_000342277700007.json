The implementation accurately calculates electronic stopping power, which characterizes the rate of energy transfer from a high-energy particle to electrons in materials. It has the potential to yield other scientific insights using quantum dynamics simulations at the electronic structure level.", "paper_title": "Quantum Dynamics Simulation of Electrons in Materials on High-Performance Computers", "paper_id": "WOS:000342277700007"}
