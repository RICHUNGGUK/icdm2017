In this setting, this paper provides an analytical and experimental study of stability. The notion of stability is defined in terms of the way in which small perturbations to the initial state of a system are likely to change the system's eventual behavior. At the stable end of the spectrum, there is likely to be no change; but at the unstable end, small perturbations take the system into a state that is probabilistically the same as a randomly selected state, similar to chaotic behavior in continuous dynamical systems.", "paper_title": "STABILITY AND CHAOS IN REACTION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309470000013"}
