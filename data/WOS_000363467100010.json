This article connects nuclear forensics and calibration. We present statistical analyses of a calibration experiment that connect several responses to the associated set of input values and then make a measurement' using the calibration model. Previous and upcoming real experiments involving production of PuO2 powder motivate this article. Both frequentist and Bayesian approaches are considered, and we report findings from a simulation study that compares different analysis methods for different underlying responses between inputs and responses, different numbers of responses, different amounts of natural variability, and replicated or non-replicated calibration experiments and new measurements.", "paper_title": "Statistical analysis for nuclear forensics experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000363467100010"}
