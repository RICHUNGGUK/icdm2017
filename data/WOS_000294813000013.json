In the case of a genome G at s containing exactly two copies of each gene, the genome halving problem is to find a perfectly duplicated genome D at d minimizing the rearrangement distance with G. We generalize the existing exact linear-time algorithm for genome halving to the case of a genome G with missing gene copies. In the case of a known ancestral duplicated genome D, we develop a greedy approach for computing the distance between G and D, called the double distance. Two algorithms are developed in both cases of a genome G containing exactly two copies of each gene, or at most two copies of each gene ( with missing gene copies). These algorithms are shown time-efficient and very accurate for both the rearrangement and DCJ distances.", "paper_title": "Genome Halving and Double Distance with Losses", "paper_id": "WOS:000294813000013"}
