From the view of cooperation evolution, based on spatial game theory, the individuals are classified into two types, and the micro-mechanism of individual choice is analyzed. At last, the model for social network structure evolving is built. The simulation is implemented by the multi-agent system simulation tool-Repast. By the criterion of degree distribution, clustering coefficient and average shortest path, the result is given. The conclusion shows that the evolving network has obvious small world property, and the cooperation evolution can explain why the real network forms like this to some extent. Another revelatory conclusion is that high social total profit will be gained through the improvement of the network structure even if the cooperators are few.", "paper_title": "Network evolution modeling and simulation based on SPD", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600112"}
