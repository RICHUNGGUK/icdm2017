Common data formats and appropriate architectures that will pave the way toward this challenging task must be defined. In this article a framework enabling mobile device users to search for and retrieve multimedia objects over a distributed P2P-based network is presented. The framework was an outcome of the research that took place within the VICTORY European Project. The proposed concept is to develop a P2P-based application that, having as a basis the state of the art in the field of 3D search algorithms, would be able to deliver search and retrieval functionalities to users on the move through mobile devices. Following a service-oriented approach, a framework able to deliver these functionalities to mobile user agents in a device-and application-independent way has been implemented.", "paper_title": "SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL OF OBJECTS OVER A DISTRIBUTED P2P NETWORK FOR MOBILE DEVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000271483400008"}
