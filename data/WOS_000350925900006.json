Essentially, a Bayesian weight solution is coupled with a center sliding scheme in feature space which provides an easy tuning capability for binary classification. The proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art binary classifiers in terms of their solution forms, decision thresholds and decision boundaries. Based on the center sliding Bayesian framework, a novel orthogonal polynomial classifier is subsequently developed. The orthogonal polynomial classifier is evaluated using two representative orthogonal polynomials for feature mapping. Our experimental results show promising potential of the orthogonal polynomial classifier since it achieves both desired accuracy and computational efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
