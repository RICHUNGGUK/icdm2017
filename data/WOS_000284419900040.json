The terminals are then allowed to communicate publicly with all such communication being observed by all the terminals. The objective is to generate a secret key shared by a given subset of terminals at the largest rate possible, with the cooperation of any remaining terminals. Secrecy is required from an eavesdropper that has access to the public interterminal communication. A (single-letter) formula for secret key capacity brings out a natural connection between the problem of secret key generation and a combinatorial problem of maximal packing of Steiner trees in an associated multigraph. An explicit algorithm is proposed for secret key generation based on a maximal packing of Steiner trees in a multigraph; the corresponding maximum rate of Steiner tree packing is thus a lower bound for the secret key capacity. When only two of the terminals or when all the terminals seek to share a secret key, the mentioned algorithm achieves secret key capacity in which case the bound is tight.", "paper_title": "Secret Key Generation for a Pairwise Independent Network Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000284419900040"}
