It is shown that for incompressible, multiphase LB methods, the divergence-free condition is not satisfied within the formal accuracy of the LB method, when the density ratio between the two phases is large enough. The discrete differentiation-by-parts rule is responsible for this error. A new multiphase LB method to resolve this issue is proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
