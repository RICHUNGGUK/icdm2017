This method first uses the training images of the claimed identity to represent the testing sample and then exploits the representation result to determine the verification result, that is, accept or reject. The proposed method not only has sound theoretical foundation but also is simple and easy to implement. Moreover, our method greatly outperforms previously image-based identity verification methods.", "paper_title": "Image-based face verification and experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200039"}
