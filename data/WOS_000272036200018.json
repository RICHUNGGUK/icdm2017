Our primary hypothesis is that this should be revealed from normal dental records by the use of data mining technique and a practice-based dentistry approach analysed in a scientifically sound way. Dental records from 1626 patients and altogether 19,892 restorations in three Finnish age cohorts were analysed. Survival curves (Kaplan-Meier) were drawn for each of the restorative materials. Median survival times for amalgam and resin-based composites were more than 15 years in older cohorts. More than 60% of silicate cement restorations were replaced within 5 years, and more than 50% of glass ionomers within 7 years. There was a significant reduction in the longevity of amalgams in the 1980 cohort. Data mining of digital oral heath documents would be a useful tool to analyse survival curves of new restorative materials in a practice-based manner in real-life conditions.
