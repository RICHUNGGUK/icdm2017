The UWB LNA achieves the measured power gain of 7.5 +/- 2.5 dB, minimum input matching of -8 dB, noise figure from 3.9 to 6.3 dB, and IIP3 from -8 to -1.9 dBm, while consuming only 9 mW over 3-10 GHz. It occupies only 0.55 x 0.4 mm(2) without RF and DC pads. The design uses only two on-chip inductors, one of which is such small that could be replaced by a bonding wire. The gain, noise figure, and matching of the amplifier are also analyzed. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
