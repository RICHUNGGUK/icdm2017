In this paper, a biomolecular computing model in vivo for solving the SAT problem is presented. A synthetic gene network is constructed by operon in Escherichia coli. This model explores the ability to solve hard problems based on the organism processing signals. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
