To provide theoretical understanding for these problems, their global optima are specified in the proposed definitions. Based on the definition, we propose theorems to prove that a min-max algorithm can be used to solve a max-min problem without any algorithmic changes. Based on the theorems, we propose a constraint-activated differential evolution to solve constrained min-max problems. The proposed method consists of three components, propagation, constraint activation, and inner level evolution. The propagation provides exploitation power of evolution. The constraint activation directly finds a solution which can best activate constraints. The inner level evolution provides continuous evolutionary behavior to prevent convergence premature. The simulation results show that the proposed method attains 100% success rates for all of the numerical benchmarks with an exploitative mutation strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
