Elaboration of the concept of sense-making allows a fundamental reframing of the notion of perception that does not rely on the pick up of information about a pre-given world. In rejecting the notion of the subject as an input/output system, it is also necessary to reframe the scientific account of skilled action. Taking speech as an exemplary domain, I here present the outline of an enactive account of skilled action that is continuous with the concept of sense-making. Extending this account to the rich domain of joint or synchronous speaking allows many of the principal themes of the emerging enactive account to be considered as they relate to a familiar and important human practice.", "paper_title": "Towards an enactive account of action: speaking and joint speaking as exemplary domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000320763400006"}
