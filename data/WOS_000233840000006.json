For the switching of IP packet flows different node architectures are considered that are based on current optical routing devices. The traffic performance of a mesh network is evaluated with the various node structures, assuming that nodes employ either shortest path routing or deflection routing to forward packets to the addressed destinations. The paper shows how the different node structures behave in terms of packet loss probability with different network configurations when the node parameters are varied. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
