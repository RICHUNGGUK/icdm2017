However, in packet coding algorithm, they use opportunistic coding scheme which didn't consider the queue state of the coding node and are equivalent to the conventional store-and-forward method in light traffic load condition because they never delay packets and there are no packets in the output queue of coding node, which results in no coding opportunity. In addition, most of the existing algorithms assume that all flows participating in the network have equal rate. This is unrealistic since multi-rate environments are often appeared. To overcome above problem and expand network coding to light traffic load scenarios, we present an enhanced coding-aware routing algorithm based on queue state and local topology (OQMCAR), which consider the queue state of coding node in packet coding algorithm where the control policy is of threshold-type. OQMCAR is a unified framework to merge single rate case and multiple rate case, including the light traffic load scenarios. Simulations results show that our scheme can achieve higher throughput and lower end-to-end delay than the current mechanisms using COPE-type opportunistic coding policy in different cases.", "paper_title": "OQMCAR: An enhanced network coding-aware routing algorithm based on queue state and local topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000364202200007"}
