In this paper, a new algorithm of decomposition and reconstruction in the discrete wavelet is presented. The algorithm can solve the frequency distortion in the high frequency subband in the process of decimation in each level. The simulation of numerical value example tests the validity of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "A new discrete wavelet transform fast algorithm with rational dilation factor", "paper_id": "WOS:000258297300007"}
