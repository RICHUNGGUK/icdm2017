We considered how three modes of delivery compare when increasingly deeper forms of learning are assessed and also student reaction to electronic delivery. Fifty-eight students in three groups took three topics of a human genetics module, one in each delivery style. Results indicated no overall greater efficacy of either delivery style when all question types were taken into account but significantly different delivery-specific results depending on which level of Bloom's taxonomy was assessed. That is, overall, questions assessing knowledge consistently achieved the highest marks followed by analysis, comprehension, evaluation and application. Students receiving traditional lectures scored significantly lower marks for comprehension questions. Students receiving Virtual Lectures scored high for knowledge, comprehension and application but significantly lower for analysis and evaluation questions. The e-Lectures scored high for knowledge questions and were the median for all question types except application. Questionnaire analysis revealed a preference for traditional lectures over computer-based but nevertheless an appreciation of the advantages offered by them. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
