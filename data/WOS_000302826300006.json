ARQ and HARQ schemes have their own weakness that results in low throughput and high delay in WiMAX systems. Although ARQ and HARQ schemes can complement with each other, they operate independently. Some studies focus on the benefits of the interaction between ARQ and HARQ schemes, but these studies have limitations. In this paper, we propose an adaptive ARQ and HARQ interworking scheme to provide reliable transmissions without performance degradation in WiMAX systems. The proposed scheme has five features that are designed to solve the weaknesses of the ARQ and HARQ schemes. We compare the proposed scheme with existing schemes that utilize the ARQ and HARQ interaction through simulations, and the simulation results show that the proposed scheme shows improved performance over existing schemes.
