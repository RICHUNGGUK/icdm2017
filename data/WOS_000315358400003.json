In this work, we go over the main points of recent papers on the timetabling problem. We concentrate on university timetabling and introduce hard and soft constraints as well as most currently used objective functions. We also discuss some solution methods that have been applied by researchers. Finally, we raise more questions to be explored in future studies. We hope the directions lead to new researches that cover all aspects of the problem and result in high-quality timetables.", "paper_title": "Solution approaches to the course timetabling problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000315358400003"}
