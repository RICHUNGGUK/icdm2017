It operates by coding the data with respect to local neighbors with non-linear weights. This locality is obtained as a consequence of the simultaneous sparsity and convexity constraints. Our method is demonstrated over several experiments, including a feature extraction and classification task, where it achieves better performances than the state-of-the-art factorization methods, with a shorter computational time.", "paper_title": "SAGA: sparse and geometry-aware non-negative matrix factorization through non-linear local embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000341431300010"}
