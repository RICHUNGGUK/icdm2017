This paper presents an optimised wind energy harvesting system which uses a specially designed ultra low power management for sustaining the operation of a wireless sensor node. The proposed system includes maximum power point tracking (MPPT) circuits, buck-boost converter, energy storage element, buck converter and wireless sensor node. It harvests energy from the wind by imposing the harvester to work close to its maximum power point and supply power to the wireless sensor node. In this paper we analyse the dynamics of the power losses of DC-DC converters while the wireless sensor node works under dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) scheme. And we propose a DCOPM (DC-dc Converter-aware Optimal Power Management) technique which aims at achieving optimal system performance under energy harvesting constraints. Experiment result shows that our system could work at its maximum efficiency with self-autonomous and achieves better survivability than the existing research.", "paper_title": "Efficient power management for wireless sensor node with wind energy harvesting", "paper_id": "WOS:000313883400004"}
