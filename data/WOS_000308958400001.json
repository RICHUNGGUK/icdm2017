For this, we need methods that move away from the single conformation description of binding events, toward a descriptive free energy landscape where different macrostates can coexist. Molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) methods provide an excellent approach for such a dynamic description of the binding events. An alternative to the standard method of the statistical reporting of such results is proposed.", "paper_title": "Macrostate Identification from Biomolecular Simulations through Time Series Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000308958400001"}
