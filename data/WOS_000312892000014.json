However, most existing local dimming algorithms are mostly motivated by simple implementation, and they often lack concern for visual quality. To fully realize the potential of LED-backlit LCDs and reduce the artifacts that often occur in current systems, we propose a novel local dimming technique that can achieve the theoretical highest fidelity of intensity reproduction in either l(1) or l(2) metrics. Both the exact and fast approximate versions of the optimal local dimming algorithm are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate superior performances of the proposed algorithm in terms of visual quality and power consumption.", "paper_title": "Optimal Local Dimming for LC Image Formation With Controllable Backlighting", "paper_id": "WOS:000312892000014"}
