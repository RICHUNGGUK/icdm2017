This study proposes a double-step block division plant-wide process monitoring method based on variable distributions and relevant features to overcome this limitation. First, the data distribution is considered, and the normality test method called the D-test is applied to classify the variables with the same distribution (i.e., Gaussian distribution or non-Gaussian distribution) in a block. Thus, the second block division is implemented on both blocks obtained in the previous step. The mutual information shared between two variables is used to generate relevant matrixes of the Gaussian and non-Gaussian blocks. The K-means method clusters the vectors of the relevant matrix. Principal component analysis is conducted to monitor each Gaussian subblock, whereas independent component analysis is conducted to monitor each non-Gaussian subblock. A composite statistic is eventually derived through Bayesian inference. The proposed method is applied to a numerical system and the Tennessee Eastman process data set. The monitoring performance shows the superiority of the proposed method.
