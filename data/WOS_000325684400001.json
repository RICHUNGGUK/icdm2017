The main difficulty in this study is that sensor faults, actuator faults, and stochastic noise that are governed by Brownian motion are taken into simultaneous consideration in a unified framework, and traditional fault-tolerant approaches are not effective to solve this research issue. A new descriptor fuzzy sliding-mode observer approach is presented in this paper to obtain the simultaneous estimates of system state, sensor fault, and actuator fault vectors. Based on the state estimates, an observer-based fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme is developed to stabilize the resulting closed-loop system. Finally, a simulation example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant approach.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy-Model-Based Fault-Tolerant Design for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems Against Simultaneous Sensor and Actuator Faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000325684400001"}
