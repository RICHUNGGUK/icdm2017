Under a scaled supply voltage and/or variations in process parameters, any possible delay errors appear only from the long paths that are designed to be less contributive to output quality. The proposed architecture allows a graceful degradation in the peak SNR (PSNR) under aggressive voltage scaling as well as extreme process variations. Results show that even under large process variations ( +/-3 sigma around mean threshold voltage) and aggressive supply voltage scaling (at 0.88 V, while the nominal voltage is 1.2 V for a 90-nm technology), there is a gradual degradation of image quality with considerable power savings (71% at PSNR of 23.4 dB) for the proposed architecture, when compared to existing implementations in a 90-nm process technology.", "paper_title": "Process-Variation Resilient and Voltage-Scalable DCT Architecture for Robust Low-Power Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000282843300007"}
