This paper proposes a new feature-based modeling mechanism-document-driven design-to enable batch mode geometry, construction for distributed CAD systems. A semantic feature model is developed to represent informative and communicative design intent. Feature semantics is explicitly captured as a trinary relation, which provides good extensibility and prevents semantics loss. Data interoperability between domains is enhanced by schema mapping and multiresolution semantics. This mechanism aims to enable asynchronous communication in distributed CAD environments with ease of design. alternative evaluation and reuse, reduced human errors, and improved system throughput and utilization.", "paper_title": "Document-driven design for distributed CAD services in service-oriented architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000238380100005"}
