In the presence of noise, the out-of-focus deblurring is an ill-posed problem. The two-dimensional bar code image has a very special form, making deblurring feasible. This paper proposes a fast deblurring algorithm called the Increment Constrained Least Squares filter that is specifically designed for two-dimensional bar code images. After analyzing the bar code image, the standard deviation of the Gaussian blur kernel is obtained. Then, the bar code image is restored through on iterative computations. In each iteration, the bi-level constraint of the bar code image is efficiently incorporated. Experimental results show that our algorithm can obtain better bar code image quality compared with existing methods. Our method can also improve the reading depth of field, which is an important performance parameter for bar code readers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
