In this study a large number of selected 174 aromatic compounds containing phenols, nitrobenzenes and benzonitriles are chosen as the training set to verify their toxic potency to Tetrahymena pyriformis in the light of electrophilicity. A systematic analysis has been made to find out the electron donation/acceptance nature of these model compounds by comparing their electronegativity values with those of the NA bases/DNA base pairs. The training sets are classified into two groups, viz., the electron donor group comprising 97 phenol derivatives and the electron acceptor group consisting of 77 nitrobenzenes and benzonitriles grouped together. Regression analysis in terms of correlation coefficient (R), variance adjusted to degrees of freedom (R(adj)(2)) and variance of leave-one-out cross-validation (R(CV)(2)) has been made for both the electron donor and acceptor aromatic groups to predict the toxicity values of these model compounds to Tetrahymena pyriformis. It is heartening to note that the global and local electrophilicity indices along with the total Hartree-Fock energy can explain more than 80% of cross-validation variance of data of those aromatic molecules.", "paper_title": "An electrophilicity based analysis of toxicity of aromatic compounds towards Tetrahymena pyriformis", "paper_id": "WOS:000235756100002"}
