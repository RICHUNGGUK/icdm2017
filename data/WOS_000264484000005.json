The goal is to minimize the total height of strip used. The best known algorithm is First Fit Shelf algorithm (Baker and Schwarz in SIAM J. Comput. 12(3): 508-525, 1983), which has an absolute competitive ratio of 6.99 under the assumption that the height of each rectangle is bounded from above by one. We improve the shelf algorithm and show an absolute competitive ratio of 7/2 + root 10 approximate to 6.6623 without the restriction on rectangle heights. Our algorithm also beats the best known online algorithm for parallel job scheduling.", "paper_title": "A note on online strip packing", "paper_id": "WOS:000264484000005"}
