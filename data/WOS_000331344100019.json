We define a new routing cost by considering both transmit and receive power consumption and remaining battery level in each node simultaneously and present an efficient route discovery procedure to investigate the proposed routing cost. Intensive simulation verifies that the proposed routing protocol has similar performance to the conventional routing protocols in terms of the number of transmission hops, transmission rate, and energy consumption while significantly improving the performance with respect to network lifetime.", "paper_title": "A New Energy-Aware Source Routing Protocol for Maximization of Network Lifetime in MANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100019"}
