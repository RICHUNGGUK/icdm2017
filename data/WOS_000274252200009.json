However, the unique characteristics of vehicular networks, such as linear topology and constrained movements of vehicles, are not considered in the conventional mobility management schemes. Using conventional schemes, unnecessary management messages are generated and the connections to roadside-installed base stations are not fully utilized. As the results, bandwidth is wasted and data delivery ratio is not maximized. In this paper, we propose a novel mobility management scheme to integrate vehicular ad hoc network and fixed IP networks more efficiently. The proposed scheme manages mobility of vehicles based on street layout as well as the distance between vehicles and base stations. Utilizing the unique characteristics of vehicular networks, the proposed scheme has substantially less mobility management overhead and higher data delivery ratio. The proposed scheme is simulated by SUMO (a vehicular traffic simulator) and QualNet (a data network simulator). The simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduced the mobility management overhead up to 63% and improved the data delivery ratio up to 90%.", "paper_title": "A Novel Mobility Management Scheme for Integration of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks and Fixed IP Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274252200009"}
