The kernel of the proposed cutting-plane algorithm is a separation procedure for generalized blossom inequalities. We show that the currently best known separation procedure of Letchford, Reinelt and Theis [A faster exact separation algorithm for blossom inequalities. In: Nemhauser 13, Bienstock D, editors, Integer programming and combinatorial optimization, vol. 3064. Berlin: Springer; 2004.
