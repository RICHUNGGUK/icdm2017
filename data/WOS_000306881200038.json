In this study, the KaaS is modeled as a framework of a knowledge cloud system which aims for the development of collaborative networks in medical service industry. The framework is applied in a case study of radiotherapy dynamic treatment service. The collaborative activities supported by knowledge cloud system are analysed. This study has investigated the essential components for the success of a private knowledge network for business network collaboration. This study shows the best practices of the formation of collaborative network facilitating by the knowledge cloud system in medical service industry which can be transferred to other industries.
