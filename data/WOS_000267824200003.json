We show that the superconvergence rate of the (composite) Newton-Cotes rules occurs at the zeros of a special function Phi(k)(tau) and prove the existence of the superconvergence points. The relation between Phi(k)(tau) and S(k)(tau) defined in Wu and Sun (Numer Math 109: 143-165, 2008) is established, and the efficient calculation of Cotes coefficients is also discussed. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "The superconvergence of composite Newton-Cotes rules for Hadamard finite-part integral on a circle", "paper_id": "WOS:000267824200003"}
