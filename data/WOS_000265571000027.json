Two variations of this idea are illustrated. The first approach is simply to power transform the original data and perform a correspondence analysis - this method is shown to converge to unweighted log-ratio analysis as the power parameter tends to zero. The second approach is to apply the power transformation to the contingency ratios, that is, the values in the table relative to expected values based on the marginals - this method converges to weighted log-ratio analysis, or the spectral map. Two applications are described: first, a matrix of population genetic data which is inherently two-dimensional, and second, a larger cross-tabulation with higher dimensionality, from a linguistic analysis of several books.
