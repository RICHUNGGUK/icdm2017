Our approach is based on a joint duty-cycle optimization and transmission power control. By simultaneously adapting both parameters, the node can maximize the number of transmitted packets while respecting the limited and time-varying amount of available energy. We obtain a high-packet delivery by using an original predictive transmission power control that can efficiently adapt the transmission power to the wireless channel conditions. To accurately model the wireless channel and the node communication hardware, a waveform-level radio frequency simulator has been developed. Simulation results show 6.5 times improvement in energy efficiency and a packet reception ratio which is 9 times more efficient than a recently published technique. A 15% increase in energy efficiency, with respect to a fixed transmission power configuration, has also been observed. Finally, the global power management strategy has been validated on a real wireless sensor networks platform. Experimental results are very similar to those obtained in simulations, and thus confirm the efficiency of our power management approach.", "paper_title": "A Joint Duty-Cycle and Transmission Power Management for Energy Harvesting WSN", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800008"}
