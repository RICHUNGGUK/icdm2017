Such objectives include maximizing network lifetime, guaranteeing connectivity and coverage, and maximizing throughput. In addition, some of these goals are in conflict such as network lifetime and throughput. Cross-layer design can be efficient in proposing network management techniques that can consider different network objectives and conflicting constraints. This can be highly valuable in challenging applications where multiple Quality of Service (QoS) requirements may be demanded. In this paper, a novel cross-layer framework for network management is proposed that particularly targets WSN with challenging applications. The proposed framework is designed using the tool known as Weighted Cognitive Map (WCM). The inference properties of WCMs allow the system to consider multiple objectives and constraints while maintaining low complexity. Methods for achieving different objectives using WCMs are illustrated, as well as how system processes can operate coherently to achieve common end-to-end goals. Using extensive computer simulations, the proposed system is evaluated. The results show that it achieves good performance results in metrics of network lifetime, throughput, and Packet Loss Ratio (PLR).", "paper_title": "A Cross-Layer Framework for Network Management in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Weighted Cognitive Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000316139700001"}
