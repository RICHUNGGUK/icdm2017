Furthermore, the original feature vectors may include redundancy such as high-order correlation which cannot be removed by manifold learning algorithms. To address the two problems, we first employ Gabor wavelet to remove intrinsic redundancies of images and obtain a set of over-completed feature vectors. Then a supervised manifold learning algorithm (ULLELDA) is applied to project Gabor-based data and out-of-the-samples into a common low-dimensional subspace. Experiments in two FERET face databases indicate that Gabors indeed help supervised manifold learning to remarkably improve the discriminant ability of low-dimensional subspaces.", "paper_title": "Classification with the hybrid of manifold learning and gabor wavelet", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000200"}
