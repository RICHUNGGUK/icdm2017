In particular, the coded video is inherently scalable with channel capacity, decoding complexity, display resolution, and quality. In this paper, we present compressive video sensing methods and demonstrate video scalability with such properties as graceful degradation, multi-resolution decoding.(c) 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.", "paper_title": "Scalable Video Coding Using Compressive Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000301489100010"}
