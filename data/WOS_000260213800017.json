Of the associated algorithms, the k-motif algorithm is one of the most effective and efficient. It is also widely used as a time series preprocessing routine for many other data mining tasks. However, the k-motif algorithm depends on the predefine of the parameter w, which is the length of the pattern. This paper introduces a novel k-motif-based algorithm that can solve the existing problem and, moreover, provide a way to generate the original patterns by summarizing the discovered motifs.
