These phenomena present unique challenges for traditional computational fluid dynamics methods. In this paper, the material point method (MPM) is extended to solve the dynamic behavior of sloshing liquids in a moving container and a numerical scheme is developed to calculate impact pressure based on a contact algorithm over background grids. Moreover, a weakly compressible equation of state which employs an artificial sound speed is incorporated into the MPM to compute the pressure field of the liquid phase and a special scheme is employed to apply harmonic excitation to the particle-discretized container. The performance of the improved MPM in prediction of liquid impact pressure is verified by modeling a water block dropping test onto an aluminum plate. To further validate the proposed scheme, liquid sloshing experiments in a partially filled tank are conducted. The slosh-induced impact pressures on the vertical walls of the tank obtained from the MPM simulation are in good agreement with the experimental results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
