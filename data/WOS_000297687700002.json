Users may search by keywords and by example, using schema fragments as query terms. Schemr uses a novel search algorithm, based on a combination of text search and schema matching techniques, coupled with a structurally-aware scoring metric. Schemr presents search results in a GUI that allows users to explore which elements match and how well they do. The GUI supports interactions, including panning, zooming, layout and drilling-in. This paper introduces Schemr as a new component of the information integration toolbox and discusses its benefits in several applications.", "paper_title": "Exploring Schema Repositories with Schemr", "paper_id": "WOS:000297687700002"}
