Rooted in market basket analysis, there are a great number of techniques developed for association rule mining. They include frequent pattern discovery, interestingness, complex associations, and multiple data source mining. This paper introduces the up-to-date prevailing association rule mining methods and advocates the mining of complete association rules, including both positive and negative association rules.
