The authors present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of state-of-the art replication and caching techniques used to host Web applications. Their analysis shows that selecting the best mechanism depends heavily on data workload and requires a careful review of the application's characteristics. They also propose a technique for Web practitioners to compare different mechanisms' performance on their own.", "paper_title": "Analysis of caching and replication strategies for Web applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000243262700010"}
