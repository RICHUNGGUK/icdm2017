Using a frustrated Heisenberg J(1)-J(2) model on a square lattice as an example, we implement the algorithm based on the compute unified device architecture (CUDA). For a single plaquette contraction with the bond dimensions C = 3 of each rank of the tensor, results are obtained 25 times faster on GPU than on a current CPU core. This makes it possible to simulate systems with the size 8 x 8 and larger, which are extremely time consuming on a single CPU. This technology successfully relieves the computing time dependence with C, while in the CPU serial computation, the total required time scales both with C and the system size. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
