We view the task of estimating visual saliency as searching the most conspicuous parts in an image and extract the saliency map by computing the dissimilarity between different regions. We simulate the moving of the center of human visual field, and describe how the center shift process works on visual saliency. Furthermore, multiscale analysis is adopted for improving the robustness of our model. Experimental results on three public image datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms 18 state-of-the-art methods for both salient object detection and human eye fixation prediction.
