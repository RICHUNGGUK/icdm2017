Large datasets of user activity are studied from Ciao and Epinions (two online platforms with an explicit notion of trust controlled by users), and Prosper (a micro-lending site where trust remains implicit). The implications of such findings are discussed, particularly regarding how to enable trust in online platforms and interaction, with implications for trust-based activities.", "paper_title": "Trust Networks Topology, Dynamics, and Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000364339800005"}
