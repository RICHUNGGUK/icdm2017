This structural layout has spread in the field of bridges, too, especially for steel and composite bridges. Against of the numerous applications there are no standard design formulas for the patch loading resistance of girders with trapezoidally corrugated steel webs. The focus of the current paper is the determination of its design value with nonlinear finite element analysis. Experimental research is conducted on 12 test specimens. Failure mode, load carrying capacity and post ultimate behaviour are analysed. Based on the executed experiments numerical model is developed, and the patch loading resistance is determined by nonlinear analysis using geometrical and material nonlinear analysis and imperfections. The applied imperfection shape and scaling factor used for the nonlinear analysis are investigated and its influence on the structural behaviour is determined. Based on the experiments and numerical investigations, recommendations are formulated for possible equivalent geometric imperfection shape and scaling factor for girders with corrugated webs.
