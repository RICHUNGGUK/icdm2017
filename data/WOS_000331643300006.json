Our construction gives codes that are up to four times shorter than Blayer and Tassa's, and up to two times shorter than the codes from koriA double dagger et al. Asymptotically, we achieve the theoretical optimal codelength for Tardos' distribution function and the symmetric score function. For large coalitions, our codelengths are asymptotically about 4.93% of Tardos' original codelengths, which also improves upon results from Nuida et al.", "paper_title": "Optimal symmetric Tardos traitor tracing schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000331643300006"}
