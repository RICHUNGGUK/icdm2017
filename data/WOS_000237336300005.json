It was found there is significant correlation between the Cl substitution position and some structural parameters such as alpha (r(2) = 0.9972), E-HOMO (r(2) = 0.8874) etc. Consequently the numbers of Cl substitution positions (N) were taken as theoretical descriptors to establish the novel QSPR model for predicting n-octanol/water partition coefficients (log K-ow) of all PCB congeners, which can be used directly without computation of their complex structural and thermodynamic parameters. The new model achieved in this work contains three variables, of which r(2) = 0.9497 and q(2) = 0.9465. In addition, the variation inflation factors (VIF) of variables in the present model are all less than 5.0, suggesting high accuracy of the log K-ow predicting model. And the results of cross-validation test and method validation (r(2) = 0.9640 and q(2) = 0.9606) also showed the models of this study exhibited optimum stability, convenience for use and better predictive power than that from AMI method.", "paper_title": "Estimation of n-octanol/water partition coefficients (K-ow) of all PCB congeners by ab initio and a Cl substitution position method", "paper_id": "WOS:000237336300005"}
