However, their proofs overlook the possibility that a mutant of the Boolean specifications under test may be equivalent. Hence, each of their fault relationships is either incorrect or has an incorrect proof. In this article, we give counterexamples to the incorrect fault relationships and provide new proofs for the valid fault relationships. Furthermore, a co-stronger fault relation is introduced to establish a new fault class hierarchy for general Boolean specifications.", "paper_title": "A Revisit of Fault Class Hierarchies in General Boolean Specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000294159500006"}
