Co--plexes and -plexes were first introduced in 1978 in the context of social network analysis. However, the study of co-k-plex vertex partitions or decomposing a graphs into degree bounded subgraphs can be at least dated back to the work of Lovasz (Studia Sci Math Hung 1:237-238, 1966). In this paper, we derive analogues for well-known results on the chromatic number, and present two algorithms for constructing co-2-plex vertex partitions. The first algorithm minimizes the number of partition classes while the second algorithm minimizes a weighted sum of the partition classes, where the weight of a partition class depends on the level of adjacency among its vertices.", "paper_title": "Co-2-plex vertex partitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000360388300020"}
