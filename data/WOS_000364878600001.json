Current solutions estimate the position of an in-front driving vehicle by measuring the distance with a radar sensor, a laser scanner, or a camera system. The perception range of these sensors can be extended by the exchange of GNSS information between the vehicles using an intervehicle communication link. One possibility is to transmit GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements and compute a highly accurate baseline vector that represents the relative position between two vehicles. Solving for the unknown integer ambiguity is specially challenging for low-cost single-frequency receivers. Using the well-known LAMBDA (Least-squares AMBiguity Decorrelation Adjustment) algorithm, in this paper, we present a method for tracking the ambiguity vector solution, which is able to detect and recover from cycle slips and cope with changing satellite constellations. In several test runs performed in real-world open-sky environments with two vehicles, the performance of the proposed Ambiguity Tracker approach is evaluated. The experiments revealed that it is in fact possible to track the position of another vehicle with subcentimeter accuracy over longer periods of time with low-cost single-frequency receivers.", "paper_title": "Precise Relative Positioning of Vehicles with On-the-Fly Carrier Phase Resolution and Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000364878600001"}
