In light of user and channel diversity, we first propose FLEC, a novel flexible channel cooperation scheme. It allows secondary users to freely optimize the use of channels for transmitting primary data along with their own, in order to maximize performance. Further, we formulate a unifying optimization framework based on Nash bargaining solutions to fairly and efficiently allocate resources between primary and secondary networks, in both decentralized and centralized settings. We present an optimal distributed algorithm and a suboptimal centralized heuristic, and verify their effectiveness via realistic simulations. Under the same framework, we also study conventional identical channel cooperation as the performance benchmark, and propose algorithms to solve the corresponding optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Resource Allocation with Flexible Channel Cooperation in Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319407200012"}
