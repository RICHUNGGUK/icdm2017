While such behaviour is excluded by polynomial interior point methods, we show that, by adding an exponential number of redundant inequalities, the central path can be bent along the edges of the Klee-Minty cube. More precisely, for an arbitrarily small delta, the central path takes 2(n) -2 turns as it passes through the delta-neighbourhood of all the vertices of the Klee-Minty cube in the same order as the simplex method does.", "paper_title": "The central path visits all the vertices of the Klee-Minty cube", "paper_id": "WOS:000238565300012"}
