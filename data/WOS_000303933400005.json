In particular, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the channel capacity for the general DMURC and then show that these the upper and lower bounds coincide for degraded DMURC. It is also shown that the capacity of the degraded DMURC can be achieved using two separate codebooks corresponding to the two UR states. While the UR is assumed to switch states symbol-by-symbol, the results in this paper is the same as when the UR switches states packet-by-packet.", "paper_title": "Capacity Bound for Discrete Memoryless User-Relaying Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000303933400005"}
