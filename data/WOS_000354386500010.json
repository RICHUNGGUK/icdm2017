Given a large dataset and a specified query item, we are interested in finding items in the dataset that are within certain range of correlation with the query item. Such a problem, known as the correlation range query, has been a common task in many application domains. In this paper, we identify piecewise monotone properties of the upper and lower bounds of the I center dot coefficient, and propose an efficient correlation range query algorithm, called CORAQ. The CORAQ algorithm effectively prunes many items without computing their actual correlation coefficients with the query item. CORAQ also attains completeness and correctness of the query results. Experiments with large benchmark datasets show that this algorithm is much faster than its brute-force alternative and scales well with large datasets. As case studies, real-world datasets from recommendation applications are analyzed to demonstrate that CORAQ can help effectively identify interesting items to recommend to users.", "paper_title": "Correlation range query for effective recommendations", "paper_id": "WOS:000354386500010"}
