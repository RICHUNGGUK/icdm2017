On linear elements, all the above schemes are one-dimensional in each natural coordinate direction. However, on curved elements, not all schemes can be reduced to a one-dimensional form, although the SD and CPR formulations remain one-dimensional by design. The efficiency and accuracy of various formulations are compared on highly skewed curved elements. Several benchmark problems are simulated to further evaluate the performance of these schemes.
