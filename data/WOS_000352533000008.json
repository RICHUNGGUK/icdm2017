In this paper, we describe a framework that simultaneously utilizes shared representation, reconstruction sparsity, and parallelism to enable real-time multiclass object detection with deformable part models at 5Hz on a laptop computer with almost no decrease in task performance. Our framework is trained in the standard structured output prediction formulation and is generically applicable for speeding up object recognition systems where the computational bottleneck is in multiclass, multi-convolutional inference. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency and task performance of our method on PASCAL VOC, subset of ImageNet, Caltech101 and Caltech256 dataset.", "paper_title": "Generalized Sparselet Models for Real-Time Multiclass Object Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000352533000008"}
