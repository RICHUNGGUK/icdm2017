However, the sensors on smart phones are prone to the unknown measurement errors, requiring automatic calibration among uncooperative participants. Current methods need either collaboration or explicit calibration process. However, due to the uncooperative and uncontrollable nature of the participants, these methods fail to calibrate sensor nodes effectively. We investigate sensor calibration in monitoring pollution sources, without explicit calibration process in uncooperative environment. We leverage the opportunity in sensing diversity, where a participant will sense multiple pollution sources when roaming in the area. Further, inspired by expectation maximization (EM) method, we propose a two-level iterative algorithm to estimate the source presences, source parameters and sensor noise iteratively. The key insight is that, only based on the participatory observations, we can \"calibrate sensors without explicit or cooperative calibrating process\". Theoretical analysis proves that, our method can converge to the optimal estimation of sensor noise, where the likelihood of observations is maximized. Also, extensive simulations show that, ours improves the estimation accuracy of sensor bias up to 20 percent and that of sensor noise deviation up to 30 percent, compared with three baseline methods.", "paper_title": "Calibrate without Calibrating: An Iterative Approach in Participatory Sensing Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000349769300003"}
