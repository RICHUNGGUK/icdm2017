An adaptive controller is designed to guarantee the global asymptotic synchronization of state trajectories for two different chaotic NNs with time delay. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present method.", "paper_title": "Adaptive synchronization between two different chaotic neural networks with time delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000250789100023"}
