For this type of inventory system, the optimization problem is a nonlinear integer programming (NLIP). Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate that the proposed heuristic algorithm is better than the previous genetic algorithm published based on three aspects: the total cost, the number of evaluations of the total cost function and computational time. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is simpler and can be implemented by any people. (C)0 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
