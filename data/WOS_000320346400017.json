Cardiorespiratory symptoms such as apnea, oxygen desaturation and bradycardia may be related to GER. Thus, the recommended diagnostic methodology in pediatric patients requires 24-h synchronized esophageal and cardiorespiratory monitoring. However, there is no computer tool available for this purpose and therefore, researchers and physicians are forced to seek for customized solutions. This paper presents an open source computer program for the analysis of symptom association. It allows a convenient visualization of the biological signals and implements the three main metrics for symptom association, that is, the symptom index, the symptom sensitivity index and the symptom association probability. This software represents a flexible solution and will facilitate caregivers an easy assessment of the existence of temporal association between GER and cardiorespiratory episodes. This would ideally reduce inappropriate medical and surgical treatments and would provide an early diagnosis of the medical condition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
