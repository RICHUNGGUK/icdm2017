This network is called the Y-channel and resembles an elemental ingredient of future wireless networks. The sum-capacity of this network is studied. A characterization of the sum-capacity within an additive gap of 2 bits, and a multiplicative gap of 4, for all values of channel gains and transmit powers is obtained. Contrary to similar setups where the cut-set bounds can be achieved within a constant gap, they cannot be achieved in our case, where they are dominated by our new genie-aided bounds. Furthermore, it is shown that a time-sharing strategy, in which at each time two users exchange information using coding strategies of the bidirectional relay channel, achieves the upper bounds to within a constant gap. This result is further extended to the K-user case, where it is shown that the same scheme achieves the sum-capacity within 2 log (K - 1) bits.", "paper_title": "Approximate Sum-Capacity of the Y-Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800033"}
