In health care, capabilities of both performing the correct recognition and reducing the wrong assignments are of high importance. The novelty of the proposed activity recognition approach lies in being able to assign a category to the incoming activity, while measuring the confidence score of the assigned category that reduces the false positives in the assignments. Multiple sensors deployed at different locations of a smart home are used for activity observations. For multi-class activity classification, we propose a binary solution using support vector machines, which simplifies the problem to correct/incorrect assignments. We obtain the confidence score of each assignment by estimating the activity distribution within each class such that the assignments with low confidence are separated for further investigation by a human operator. The proposed approach is evaluated using a comprehensive performance evaluation metrics. Experimental results obtained from nine publicly available smart home datasets demonstrate a better performance of the proposed approach compared to the state of the art. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
