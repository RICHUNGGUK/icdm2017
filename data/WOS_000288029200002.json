We motivate the choice of semantic domains by illustrating the complexities of the behaviour of the language, paying particular attention to the prialt (priority-alternation) construct of Handel-C. We then define the typed assertion traces over an abstract notion of actions, and demonstrate key properties of the key semantic operations on these. The denotational semantics is then given using traces with actions instantiated as state-transformers.", "paper_title": "A denotational semantics for Handel-C", "paper_id": "WOS:000288029200002"}
