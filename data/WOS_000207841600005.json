The rapid proliferation of sensors in various applications is a result of miniaturization and advancements in embedded systems technologies. Textiles are pervasive, customizable and familiar to users. Together, they all present a powerful framework - in the form of a wearable sensor network - for harnessing ambient intelligence in various domains ranging from healthcare to entertainment. The need for personalized mobile information processing is established using typical scenarios and the building blocks of an ambient intelligent system are presented. The importance of a platform for creating the wearable sensor network is discussed. Then, the dual roles of textiles as both a physical and an information infrastructure for the wearable sensor network are explored from the viewpoints of human factors and technology features. The realization of a fabric-based wearable sensor network is illustrated with the wearable motherboard, or smart shirt. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for furthering the wearable sensor network paradigm - from both technical and market acceptance viewpoints - for harnessing ambient intelligence are presented.", "paper_title": "Wearable sensor network: A framework for harnessing Ambient Intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000207841600005"}
