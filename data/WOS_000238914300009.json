To address these. problems, the authors adopt the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services in a service-oriented distributed data mining (DDM) platform to choreograph DDM component services and fulfill global data mining requirements. They also use the learning-from-abstraction methodology to achieve privacy-preserving DDM. Finally, they illustrate how localized autonomy on privacy-policy enforcement plus a bidding process can help the service-oriented system self-organize.", "paper_title": "Service-oriented distributed data-mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000238914300009"}
