To address this task, we develop a stochastic approach that relies on a fixed-grid, localized Radon transform for line segment extraction and a conditional random field model to incorporate local interactions and refine the extracted CLSs. We propose several different energy data terms, the appropriate choice of which allows us to process images with different noise and geometry properties. The contribution of this paper is the design of a flexible and robust elongated CLS extraction framework that is comparatively fast due to the use of a fixed-grid configuration and fast deterministic Radon-based line detector. We present several different applications of the developed approach, namely: 1) CLS extraction in mammographic images; 2) road networks extraction from optical remotely sensed images; and 3) line extraction from palmprint images. The experimental results demonstrate that the method is fairly robust to CLS curvature and can accurately extract blurred and low-contrast elongated CLS.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Extraction of Elongated Curvilinear Structures With Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000345088000006"}
