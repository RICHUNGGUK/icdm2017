It allows to extract different parts of the input mesh at different levels of detail during the decompression. A smooth transition without artefacts is generated between adjacent regions decompressed at different levels of detail. Our approach allows selective decompression with low delay and compares favourably to previous random accessible and progressive schemes in terms of compression rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
