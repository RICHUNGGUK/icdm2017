By using the Banach fixed point theorem, an existence of exact solution of this model is proved under the condition root 2 mu k(b)root 1 + r(2) < 1. An iterative algorithm for solving this simplified model is constructed and the convergence of the sequence generated by the algorithm is discussed. A numerical example is also given to get an accurate solution for Ho's stiff string model under some suitable assumptions.", "paper_title": "Solutions of the Stiff-String Model with an Iterative Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000315700100003"}
