The main goal of this tutorial is to provide a framework, or perspective, within which current work on preference handling-representation, reasoning, and elicitation-can be understood. Our intention is not to provide a technical description of the diverse methods used but rather to provide a general perspective on the problem and its varied solutions and to highlight central ideas and techniques.", "paper_title": "Preference Handling-An Introductory Tutorial", "paper_id": "WOS:000264564800004"}
