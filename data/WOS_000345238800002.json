As such, there is a gap in the literature regarding Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for IQM. This article presents 11 CSFs for effective IQM as identified through seven case studies and one ethnographic study. The CSF framework for IQM presented in this article adds to extant Information Systems (IS) theory, and may aid practitioners in the development of more effective IQM strategies.", "paper_title": "A Critical Success Factor Framework for Information Quality Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000345238800002"}
