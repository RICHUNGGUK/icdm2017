Our approach goes beyond trying to relate the biometrical signature of voice with a possible neural activity that might generate alterations in voice production. A total of 68, acoustical, glottal and biomechanical parameters were extracted from neutral and stressed speeches. The importance of the parameters was evaluated using t-test, entropy, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) and Wilcoxon methods and support vector machines algorithms for classification. The emotion under study is the stress produced when a speaker has to defend an idea opposite to his/her thoughts or feelings, and this stress is compared to self-consistent speech. The results show tremor in the vocal folds to be the most relevant feature.", "paper_title": "Towards the search of detection in speech-relevant features for stress", "paper_id": "WOS:000367356500007"}
