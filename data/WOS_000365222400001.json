To reduce the communication energy consumption, we invoke low-swing signals for transmitting data, as well as data encoding techniques, for minimizing both self and coupling switching capacitance activity factors. To maintain the communication reliability of communication at low-voltage swing, an error control coding (ECC) technique is exploited. The decision about end-to-end or hop-to-hop ECC schemes and the proper number of detectable errors are determined through high-level mathematical analysis on the energy and reliability characteristics of the techniques. Based on the analysis, the extended single error correction double-error detecting end-to-end coding technique with three bits of error detection is used in the network layer. For minimization of the self and coupling switching capacitance activity factors, the odd, even, full invert scheme is employed in the data link layer. This coding has an inherent error detection probability for the flits, which is exploited in the suggested technique. The efficiency of the scheme is studied by using both synthetic and real traffic scenarios. The study reveals savings of up to 43% and 58%, for power dissipation and energy consumption, respectively, without any significant performance degradation and overhead in the network interface.", "paper_title": "Low Energy yet Reliable Data Communication Scheme for Network-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000365222400001"}
