Many researchers proposed methods to resolve this problem, such as FSG, gSpan, and CloseGraph. But we discovered that the result set generated by these methods contains many repetitive structures. In this article, we propose a new method called Frequent Structure Mining Algorithm ( FSMA) to find frequent structure in graph database, and prove corresponding theoretics to guarantee the accuracy of FSMA. The power of FSMA comes from the resolution of finding different structures and the storage of the graph set; it guarantees the completeness of mining results.", "paper_title": "Frequent mining of subgraph structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241787300007"}
