This paper discusses the important issue of energy optimization in hierarchically-clustered wireless sensor networks to minimize the total energy consumption required to collect data. We propose a comprehensive energy consumption model for multi-tier clustered sensor networks, in which all the energy consumptions not only in the phase of data transmissions but also in the phase of cluster head rotations are taken into account. By using this new model, we are able to obtain the solutions of optimal tier number and the resulted optimal clustering scheme on how to group all the sensors into tiers by the suggested numerical method. This then enables us to propose an energy-efficiency optimized distributed multi-tier clustering algorithm for wireless sensor networks. This algorithm is theoretically analyzed in terms of time complexity. Simulation results are provided to show that, the theoretically calculated energy consumption by the new model matches very well with the simulation results, and the energy consumption is indeed minimized at the optimal number of tiers in the multi-tier clustered wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "An Energy Efficient Clustering Scheme for Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000318509400017"}
