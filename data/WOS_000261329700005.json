It is established a sharp lower bound 2n on the communication complexity of recognizing the 2n-dimensional orthant, on the other hand the probabilistic communication complexity of recognizing it does not exceed 4. A polyhedron and a union of hyperplanes are constructed in R(2n) for which a lower bound 2n on the probabilistic communication complexity of recognizing each is proved. As a consequence this bound holds also for the EMPTINESS and the KNAPSACK problems.", "paper_title": "PROBABILISTIC COMMUNICATION COMPLEXITY OVER THE REALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261329700005"}
