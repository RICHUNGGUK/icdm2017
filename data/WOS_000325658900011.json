Due to its salient features of reliability and cost effectiveness, cloud computing has changed the paradigms of development for mobile pervasive services, effectively permeating the market. While most types of best effort mobile pervasive applications can be seamlessly migrated to cloud computing infrastructures, we need to consider specialized elements to make cloud computing infrastructures more effective in real-time healthcare applications. The client side of those applications dramatically increases its transmission rate whenever it detects an abnormal event. However, the existing server side mechanisms have limitations in adaptively allocating necessary computing resources in order to handle these various data volumes over time. In this article, we propose a novel server-side auto-scaling mechanism to autonomously allocate virtual resources on an on-demand basis. The mechanism is tested in an Amazon EC2, and the results show how the proposed mechanism can efficiently scale up and down the virtual resources, depending on the volume of requested real-time tasks.", "paper_title": "An Auto-Scaling Mechanism for Virtual Resources to Support Mobile, Pervasive, Real-Time Healthcare Applications in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000325658900011"}
