The program then identifies conserved sequence tags (CSTs) in these homologous regions and provides a prediction of their coding or non-coding nature. The analysis is carried out through three steps: (1) definition of sequence regions homologous to the query sequence in the selected target genomes by a fast BLAT alignment; (2) identification of CSTs by a more sensitive BLAST-like alignment between the query and the homologous regions in the target genomes and (3) assessment of the coding or non-coding nature of detected CSTs through the computation of a suitable coding potential score. GenoMiner allows the user to search the query sequence against a number of vertebrate genome assemblies in a single run providing a user-friendly graphical output.", "paper_title": "GenoMiner: a tool for genome-wide search of coding and non-coding conserved sequence tags", "paper_id": "WOS:000235277300018"}
