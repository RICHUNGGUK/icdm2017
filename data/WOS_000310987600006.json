Inspired by the special molecular channel characteristics, we reveal the communication theoretical analogs with and differences from well-known wireless communications, particularly channel coding, intersymbol interference, multiple-input multiple-output, and new design concepts in this article.", "paper_title": "A NEW FRONTIER OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATION THEORY: DIFFUSION-BASED MOLECULAR COMMUNICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310987600006"}
