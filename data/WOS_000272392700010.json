We first show the pitfall of Tsai et al.'s approach. We then further investigate the properties of eigenvalues of covariance matrices of three different types of curves and point out a mistake made by Tsai et al.'s method. Finally, we propose a modification of using eigenvalues as a measure of significance for corner detection to remedy their defect. The experiment results show that under the same conditions of the test patterns, in addition to correctly detecting all true corners, the spurious corners detected by Tsai et al.'s method disappear in our modified measure of significance.", "paper_title": "Revision of Using Eigenvalues of Covariance Matrices in Boundary-Based Corner Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000272392700010"}
