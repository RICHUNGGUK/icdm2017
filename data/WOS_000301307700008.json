This phenomenon affects most the thin walled products. The usual die design practice considers only the linear shrinking of the product during the cooling as a consequence of the difficult to take in account also the geometrical deformations. In this essay a simple finite element design strategy that allows the designer to improve the die shape is presented. The proposed approach uses an automatic iterative optimization technique based on a heuristic algorithm, which could be easily applied to most of the Finite Element (FE) commercial software: the basic concept of the method is simply to move the nodes defining the die surface in the opposite direction to the error due to the cooling phenomena. An automotive component has been selected as a case study: the aim was to improve the planarity tolerance of a planar surface of the casted product. Results show the efficiency of the proposed method that, despite its simplicity, is able to provide an optimal solution with a small number of iterations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
