This nonphysical phenomenon has to be avoided, or at least controlled, in order to achieve reliable solutions. In this article, a method to control these fictitious velocities via lattice refinement is proposed, which is based on interface thickness control for which both the spurious currents and the physical fluid-fluid interface thickness vanishes as the spatial resolution increases. It has been found that a proper interface thickness adjustment is required as the lattice refinement is applied, or an increase in spurious currents, instead of a reduction, can occur. By combining the new method with an appropriate multiphase flow initialization, the overall stability for high density O(1000) and viscosity O(100) ratios is greatly improved. Although this research has been conducted with a Rothman and Keller type lattice Boltzmann model, it is believed that other types of multiphase lattice Boltzmann models could benefit from the basic ideas underlying this research.
