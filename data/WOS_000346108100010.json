This is a new problem that arises in designing crypto systems using Abelian varieties of dimension larger than 1. We discuss what is behind this phenomenon. In particular, we discuss the question of given an absolutely simple abelian variety over a number field, whether it has simple specializations at a set of places of positive Dirichlet density? A conjectural answer to this question was given by Murty and Patankar, and we explain some recent progress towards proving the conjecture. Our result ([14], Theorem 1.1) is based on the classification of pairs (G, V) consisting of a semi-simple algebraic group G over a non-archimedean local field and an absolutely irreducible representation V of G such that G admits a maximal torus acting irreducibly on V.", "paper_title": "SPLITTING OF ABELIAN VARIETIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000346108100010"}
