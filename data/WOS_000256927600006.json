We prove that for 0 <= i <= k - 1, [GRAPHICS] [GRAPHICS] This improves the bound of k(O(s)) proved by Barvinok ( in Math. Z. 225: 231-244, 1997). This improvement is made possible by a new approach, whereby we first bound the Betti numbers of non-singular complete intersections of complex projective varieties defined by generic quadratic forms, and use this bound to obtain bounds in the real semi-algebraic case.", "paper_title": "A sharper estimate on the Betti numbers of sets defined by quadratic inequalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000256927600006"}
