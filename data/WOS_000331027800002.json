DP requires the partitioning of the layout patterns into two different masks, a procedure called layout decomposition. Layout decomposition is a key computational step that is necessary for double patterning technology. Existing works on layout decomposition are all single-threaded, which is not scalable in runtime and/or memory for large industrial layouts. This paper presents the first window-based parallel layout decomposition methods for improving both runtime and memory consumption. Experimental results are promising and show the presented parallel layout decomposition methods obtain upto 21 x speedup in runtime and upto 7.5 x reduction in peak memory consumption with acceptable solution quality.
