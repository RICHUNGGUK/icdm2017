Adopting computer aided algorithms in predicting cancer risk using its risk factors can serve in limiting the clinical screenings to people with higher risks. In the present study, we show that the application of an advanced classification method, the Minimum Classification Error, could considerably enhance the classification performance in comparison to the logistic regression model and the variable structure fuzzy neural network, as the latest successful methods. The results yield the accuracy of 89.65% for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and 88.42% for squamous dysplasia risk prediction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
