This usually involves new dedicated fabrication machines incurring costly capital additions, maintenance and materials. In the current paper, an approach is proposed where rapid layered prototypes are fabricated using standard generic 2D machining systems and commonly available sheet materials. The process necessitates the decomposition of a computer aided design (CAD) object into cross-sectional pro. le layers. From these machined pro. les, they are then constituted to form the prototype. Several prototypes of varying sizes having quite complex internal and external pro. les have been fabricated. A discussion into the merits and potential limitations of this approach is also made.", "paper_title": "Layer decomposition and constitution modelling for rapid prototyping", "paper_id": "WOS:000246903100006"}
