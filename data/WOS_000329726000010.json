Based on PubMed data, a general framework is constructed to study the development of molecular research in the context of nervous system diseases. It is shown which molecular substances are the centre of attention and which have passed their peak. Year-based h-indices have the following interesting features for representing changes in a field or discipline: flexibility, sensitivity to dynamic changes, fluctuation detection and trend detection.", "paper_title": "Describing the development of molecular research in the context of nervous system diseases using year-based h-cores", "paper_id": "WOS:000329726000010"}
