From videos acquired by an uncalibrated stationary camera, the foreground likelihood map is obtained by using the Codebook background modeling algorithm, and the multiple moving objects are tracked by a combined tracking algorithm. Then, we compute vanishing line of the ground plane and the vertical vanishing point of the scene, and extract the head feature points and the feet feature points in each frame of video sequences. Finally, we apply a single view mensuration algorithm to each of the frames to obtain height measurements and fuse the multi-frame measurements using RANSAC algorithm. Compared with other popular methods, our proposed algorithm does not require calibrating the camera, and can track the multiple moving objects when occlusion occurs. Therefore, it reduces the complexity of calculation and improves the accuracy of measurement simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective and robust to occlusion.", "paper_title": "Video-based Height Measurements of Multiple Moving Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000345333600014"}
