Unlike prior test compression methods. the proposed approach considers the unknown responses during test pattern generation procedure, and then selectively encodes, the less specified bits (either Is or Os) in each scan slice for compression while at the same time masks the unknown responses before sending them to the response compactor. The proposed test scheme could dramatically reduce test data volume as well as the number of required test channels by using only c tester channels to drive N internal scan chains, where c = inverted right perpendicular log(2) N inverted left perpendicular + 2. In addition, because all the unknown responses could be exactly masked before entering into the response compactor, test loss due to unknown responses would be eliminated. Experimental results oil both benchmark circuits and larger designs indicated the effectiveness of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "A Unified Test Compression Technique for Scan Stimulus and Unknown Masking Data with No Test Loss", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800014"}
