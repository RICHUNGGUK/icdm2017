In order to enhance the estimate performance in terms of accuracy and reliability, we present a partial least-squares-based extreme learning machine (called PLS-ELM) in this paper. The partial least squares (PLS) regression is applied to the ELM framework to improve the algebraic property of the hidden output matrix, which can be ill-conditional due to the high multicollinearity of the hidden layer output. The main idea behind our proposed PLS-ELM is to achieve a robust generalization performance by extracting a reduced number of latent variables from the hidden layer and using orthogonal projection operations. The results from a case study of a municipal wastewater treatment plant show that the PLS-ELM can effectively capture the input-output relationship with favorable performance against the conventional ELM.", "paper_title": "Estimation of effluent quality using PLS-based extreme learning machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000314844300010"}
