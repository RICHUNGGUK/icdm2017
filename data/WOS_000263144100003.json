Thus, we refer to such technology as decisional trust. For us, decisional trust can be achieved through the use of elements such as the decisional DNA, reflexive ontologies, and security models; and therefore, we present in this article a framework that was used for the implementation of a decisional trust system.", "paper_title": "IMPLEMENTING DECISIONAL TRUST: A FIRST APPROACH FOR SMART RELIABLE SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000263144100003"}
