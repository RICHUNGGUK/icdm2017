Researchers can often benefit from access to real-world data sets against which to evaluate new approaches and algorithms. Whilst more than a dozen data sets are currently publicly available, their use of heterogeneous mark-up impedes widespread and easy use. We describe PI-the Perceiver and semantic Interpreter-which offers a workbench API for the querying, re-structuring and re-purposing of a range of diverse data formats currently in use. The use of a single API reduces cognitive overload, improves access, and supports integration of generic and domain-specific information within a common framework.", "paper_title": "Perceiving and interpreting smart home datasets with PI", "paper_id": "WOS:000209332400012"}
