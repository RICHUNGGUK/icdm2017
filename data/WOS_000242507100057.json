The solenoid valves controlled by an algorithm with delta sigma modulation showed the sufficient capability. Then, we developed a system for presenting a movie together with scents. We actually made a movie with scents and evaluated it using questionnaire survey. It was found that the scene with smell attracted the experimental subjects' attention and. moreover, the contrast of the pleasant smell with the offensive one emphasized their attention. Furthermore, we established several guidelines for producing movies with scents.", "paper_title": "Movie with scents generated by olfactory display using solenoid valves", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100057"}
