Symbols are represented as 2D kernel densities and their similarity is measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Symbol orientation is found by gradient-based angle searching or independent component analysis. Experimental results show the outstanding performance of this approach in various situations.", "paper_title": "Symbol recognition with kernel density matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000241195700010"}
