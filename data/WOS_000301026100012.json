There are many uncertainties, such as system parameter uncertainties, external load disturbance, friction force and model uncertainty. These are always reducing the performance quality of the system. To deal with these problems, we propose a control algorithm that is made by taking advantage of adaptive based model reference and state feedback. The Lyapunov theory is used to verify the asymptotical stable of the closed-loop system even in the present of persistent and other kind of disturbances. An application to control the permanent magnet linear synchronous motors and inverted pendulum systems is a good example for verifying this method.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE GLOBAL ASYMPTOTIC STABLE BASED ON MODEL REFERENCE AND DISTURBANCE ATTENUATION FOR MIMO UNCERTAIN LINEAR SYSTEMS WITH PERSISTENT DISTURBANCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000301026100012"}
