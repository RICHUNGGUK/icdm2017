The main countermeasure against these attacks is the use of protocols capable of measuring the round trip time of single challenge-response bit. In this paper, we consider a modification of these protocols applying a new feature; the 'void challenges'. This way, the success probability for an adversary to access to the system decreases. We use as reference-point the most popular of this kind of protocols, the Hancke and Kuhn's protocol, to show the improvements achieved when different cases are analysed.
