We distinguish two variants of the whole golf swing termed as hitting problem and stopping problem. For the hitting problem arising from backswing and downswing, we map the task into the output of a target dynamic system-a harmonic oscillator-under energy control. For the stopping problem that arises from follow-through, we propose a Proportional plus Gravity and Coupling Torque Compensation (PGCTC) feedback controller. Preliminary simulation study shows the proposed controllers solve the hitting problem and the stopping problem respectively. The controllers are implemented on a physical robot. Experimental results indicate the robot is able to perform desired golf swing-backswing, downswing, and follow-through. We also give a preliminary analysis on the proposed method to understand its merits and weaknesses.", "paper_title": "Motion Control of a Golf Swing Robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000269913300002"}
