A foundry production plan involves two dependent stages: (1) determining the alloys to be merged and (2) determining the lots that will be produced. The purpose of this study is to draw up plans of minimum production cost for the lot-sizing problem for small foundries. As suggested in the literature, the proposed heuristic addresses the problem stages in a hierarchical way. Firstly, the alloys are determined and, subsequently, the items that are produced from them. In this study, a knapsack problem as a tool to determine the items to be produced from furnace loading was proposed. Moreover, we proposed a genetic algorithm to explore some possible sets of alloys and to determine the production planning for a small foundry. Our method attempts to overcome the difficulties in finding good production planning presented by the method proposed in the literature. The computational experiments show that the proposed methods presented better results than the literature. Furthermore, the proposed methods do not need commercial software, which is favorable for small foundries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
