The proposed scheme, called TCP-BCL, aims to handle various OBS bursty conditions that negatively affect TCP throughput performance and fairness. The basic design principle of the scheme is to tune the congestion control parameters alpha and beta such that the congestion window sizes in the corresponding TCP senders can be adjusted with an explicit notification from the OBS edge node. The performance impact on TCP in terms of burst dropping due to random contention, which is also known as false congestion detection is considered and investigated. An analytical model is developed and further verified through extensive simulation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
