MUL-trees have applications in biogeography, the study of host-parasite cospeciation, gene evolution studies, and computer science. Here, we consider the problem of inferring a consensus MUL-tree that summarizes a given set of conflicting MUL-trees, and present the first polynomial-time algorithms for solving it. In particular, we give a straightforward, fast algorithm for building a strict consensus MUL-tree for any input set of MUL-trees with identical leaf label multisets, as well as a polynomial-time algorithm for building a majority rule consensus MUL-tree for the special case where every leaf label occurs at most twice. We also show that, although it is NP-hard to find a majority rule consensus MUL-tree in general, the variant that we call the singular majority rule consensus MUL-tree can be constructed efficiently whenever it exists.", "paper_title": "Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Building a Consensus MUL-Tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000308746300007"}
