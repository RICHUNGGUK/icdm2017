The suggested system uses a uWDL workflow service scenario describing a user's situation information as service execution constraints to support context-aware home services. The suggested system consists of a context handler and a context mapper. The context handler represents contexts described in a uWDL document as a context subtree, which expresses not only context data but also relation information among services into the fields of its node. The context mapper uses a context comparison algorithm for context comparison between context subtrees and user's situation information. The algorithm can distinguish contexts that have the same values but different types with user's contexts and selects a context that has all together values and types entirely equal to those of user's contexts.", "paper_title": "A home-network service system based on user's situation information in ubiquitous environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200145"}
