Our purpose is to create a virtual model of the robot so that different motions and tasks can be tested in different environments. This will be the first step before testing the motion patterns in the real HOAP-3. We use the OpenHRP3 platform for the creation and validation of the robot model and tasks. The procedure followed to reach this goal is detailed in this article. In order to validate our experience, different walking motions are tested and the simulation results are compared with the experimental ones.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Simulation of the Humanoid Robot HOAP-3 in the OpenHRP3 Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000324904000003"}
