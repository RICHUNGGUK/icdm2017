It is assumed that the exact solution trajectory hits non-tangentially, and numerical techniques guaranteeing that the trajectory approaches from one side only (i.e., does not cross it) are studied. Methods based on Runge Kutta schemes which arrive to in a finite number of steps are proposed. The main motivation of this paper comes from integration of discontinuous differential systems of Filippov type, where location of events is of paramount importance.", "paper_title": "One-sided direct event location techniques in the numerical solution of discontinuous differential systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000366634300006"}
