However, a number of questions about Cloud-deployed applications inter operability and cross-integration, stemming from multiple areas of Computer Science domains, have also been raised from a Platform-as-a-Service angle. In this paper, we present CARL, a novel, cutting-edge, interoperative and integration-oriented language based on Semantic Technologies. We provide a formal model and semantics to enable Complex Application management and integration in PaaS environments, together with a thorough demonstration of the breakthroughs being provided by CARL.", "paper_title": "CARL: A Complex Applications Interoperability Language based on Semantic Technologies for Platform-as-a-Service Integration and Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000311622100004"}
