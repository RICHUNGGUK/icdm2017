Moreover, to ensure the quality of service for each UE, we guarantee each a minimal transmission rate. To achieve the above HWN control objective, we have to make an efficient matching among UEs, RANs, and RRUs, which is formulated as a binary linear optimization problem. Due to its NP-hard complexity, we develop a rate-power efficiency based HWN control algorithm with low computational complexity. We verify the performance of our HWN control scheme through simulation. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the advantage of our HWN control method in saving the uplink transmission power and guaranteeing the UE transmission rate requirement.", "paper_title": "Exploiting transmission opportunities in heterogeneous wireless networks: a transmission power saving perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000330681500013"}
