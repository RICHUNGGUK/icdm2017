The approach is based on the use of time-delay-predicted values as the sampling times of the NCS. We use a one-step-ahead prediction algorithm based on an adaptive time delay neural network. The application of pole placement and linear quadratic regulator methods to compute the feedback gains taking into account the estimated time delays is investigated.", "paper_title": "Variable Sampling Approach to Mitigate Instability in Networked Control Systems with Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000302703700011"}
