Images are reconstructed based on magnetic flux density distribution induced by an externally applied probing current, together with a resultant surface potential value. The induced magnetic flux density distribution is measured using magnetic resonance current density imaging techniques. In this study, MRCTI data acquisition is experimentally implemented and anisotropic conductivity images of test phantoms are reconstructed using recently proposed MRCTI reconstruction algorithms.", "paper_title": "Practical Realization of Magnetic Resonance Conductivity Tensor Imaging (MRCTI)", "paper_id": "WOS:000316213500010"}
