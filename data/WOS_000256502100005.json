The multi-dimensional limiting process (MLP) which was successfully proposed in two-dimensional case [K.H. Kim, C. Kim, Accurate, efficient and monotonic numerical methods for multi-dimensional compressible flows. Part 11: Multi-dimensional limiting process, J. Comput. Phys. 208 (2) (2005) 570-615] is modified and refined for three-dimensional application. For computational efficiency and easy implementation, the formulation of MLP is newly derived and extended to three-dimensional case without assuming local gradient. Through various test cases and comparisons, it is observed that the newly developed MLP is quite effective in controlling numerical oscillation in multi-dimensional flows including both continuous and discontinuous regions. In addition, compared to conventional TVD approach, MLP combined with improved flux functions does provide remarkable increase in accuracy, convergence and robustness in steady and unsteady three-dimensional compressible flows.
