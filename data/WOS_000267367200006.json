In particular, this paper focuses on the design, optimization and testability of predistortion functions suitable for the linearization of narrowband and wideband transmitters developed with a hybrid DSP/FPGA platform. To select the best algorithm for the identification of the predistortion function, singular value decomposition, recursive least squares (RLS), and QR-RLS algorithms are implemented on the same digital signal processor; and, the computation complexity, time, accuracy and the required resources are studied. The hardware implementation of the predistortion function is then carefully performed, in order to meet the real time execution requirements.", "paper_title": "Wireless Communications Transmitter Performance Enhancement Using Advanced Signal Processing Algorithms Running in a Hybrid DSP/FPGA Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000267367200006"}
