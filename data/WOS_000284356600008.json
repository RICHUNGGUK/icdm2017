We show how to modify the previous MAGMA GEMM kernels in order to make a more efficient use of the Fermi's new architectural features, most notably their extended memory hierarchy and memory sizes. The improved kernels run at up to 300 GFlop/s in double precision and up to 645 GFlop/s in single precision arithmetic (on a C2050), which is correspondingly 58% and 63% of the theoretical peak. We compare the improved kernels with the currently available version in CUBLAS 3.1. Further, we show the effect of the new kernels on higher-level dense linear algebra (DLA) routines such as the one-sided matrix factorizations, and compare their performances with corresponding, currently available routines running on homogeneous multicore systems.", "paper_title": "An Improved Magma Gemm For Fermi Graphics Processing Units", "paper_id": "WOS:000284356600008"}
