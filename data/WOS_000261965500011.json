A new shunt-shunt peaking technique is used at the input transimpedance stage, which is followed by a gain stage and a capacitive degeneration stage. The amplifier achieves a wide bandwidth with only one inductor; hence a smaller silicon area is maintained. The proposed TIA has a measured transimpedance gain of 50 dB Ohm and a -3 dB bandwidth of 6.5 GHz for 0.25 pF input photodiode capacitance. It consumes DC power of 14 mW from a 1.8 V supply voltage and occupies only 0.09 mm(2) silicon area.", "paper_title": "Area-efficient CMOS transimpedance amplifier for optical receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000261965500011"}
