And recently large MoCap databases are available. As a kind of emerging multimedia data, 3D human motion has its own specific data form and standard format. But to the best of our knowledge, only a few approaches have been explored for 3D MoCap data feature representation and reusing. This paper proposes a group of novel approaches for posture feature representation, motion sequence segmentation, key-frame extraction and content-based motion retrieval, which are all very important for MoCap data reusing and benefit to the efficient animation production. To validate these approaches, we set up a MoCap database and implemented a prototype toolkit. The experiments show that the proposed algorithms could achieve the approvable results.", "paper_title": "A group of novel approaches and a toolkit for motion capture data reusing", "paper_id": "WOS:000275800200003"}
