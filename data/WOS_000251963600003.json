The data are related to an oncological study on breast cancer and are given by 2D electrophoresis gels carrying expression intensity of proteins in cancer cells. The gels have been classified by a physician according to the clinical course of the tumor gels ha disease. A research task is aimed on search for significant relations between protein spot intensities and respective clinical presentation. The task was solved by the GUHA method of data, mining.", "paper_title": "Guha analysis of proteomic oncological data", "paper_id": "WOS:000251963600003"}
