It is defined as the expected False Discovery Proportion (FDP), that is, the expected fraction of false positives among rejected hypotheses. When the hypotheses are independent, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure achieves FDR control at any pre-specified level. By construction, FDR control offers no guarantee in terms of power, or type II error. A number of alternative procedures have been developed, including plug-in procedures that aim at gaining power by incorporating an estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of a class of plug-in procedures based on kernel estimators of the density of the p-values, as the number m of tested hypotheses grows to infinity. In a setting where the hypotheses tested are independent, we prove that these procedures are asymptotically more powerful in two respects: (i) a tighter asymptotic FDR control for any target FDR level and (ii) a broader range of target levels yielding positive asymptotic power. We also show that this increased asymptotic power comes at the price of slower, non-parametric convergence rates for the FDP. These rates are of the form m(-k/(2k+1)), where k is determined by the regularity of the density of the p-value distribution, or, equivalently, of the test statistics distribution. These results are applied to one-and two-sided tests statistics for Gaussian and Laplace location models, and for the Student model.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Results on Adaptive False Discovery Rate Controlling Procedures Based on Kernel Estimators", "paper_id": "WOS:000320709300008"}
