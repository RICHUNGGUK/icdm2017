This paper presents two main approaches for the semi-automatic methods based on discrete dynamic contour and optimal surface detection. They operate in 3-D and require a minimal user interaction. They are considered both alone or sequentially combined, with and without postregularization, and applied on anisotropic and isotropic volumes. Their performance, using different metrics, has been evaluated on a set of 28 3-D images by comparison with two expert delineations. For the most efficient algorithm, the symmetric average surface distance was found to be 0.77 mm.", "paper_title": "Prostate Segmentation in HIFU Therapy", "paper_id": "WOS:000287862300021"}
