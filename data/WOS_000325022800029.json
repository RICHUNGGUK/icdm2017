Although the use of modern micro-architectures has increased the performance of processors, this increment is only part of speeding up in responding such these demands. In fact, the need of some applications to parallel systems in large scales makes these systems more popular. Therefore, these systems are only the possible way of performing enormous computing power for applications with high performance computing. This paper comprehensively studies the topological properties of a class of n-D networks that are called HyperX from different aspects. In this paper we are going to provide a detailed description of HyperX topology in an algebraic framework with basic features (such as regularity, symmetry, etc.). The important parameters in this topology are evaluated parametrically and compared with other topologies. Having expressed this fact, we emphasize that our study is among the very few attempts reported in the literature to analyze the important parameters that can capture the performance behavior of HyperX topology. Since HyperX has many advantages of high radix switch components, it becomes a serious competitor against the other topologies and high radix networks. Hence, this study leads to finding an optimum topology for these kinds of networks.", "paper_title": "On the topological properties of HyperX", "paper_id": "WOS:000325022800029"}
