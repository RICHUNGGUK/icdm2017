A special user software was written. It uses a linear and a polynomial approximation for defining edges of selected protector structures. A higher order polynomial approximation is also used for pixel to metric units transformation. The accuracy, the repeatability and especially the usability of automated visual inspection system was verified with protectors, previously measured with the reference measurement method. The verification procedure showed that the measurement accuracy is in the range of +/- 0.02 mm. The time necessary for frame capturing, image processing and displaying the measurement results is less than a second. The comparison measurements showed that this system can not be used as a replacement for the current measurement system of monitoring switch-off temperatures in a oven. However, the presented visual inspection system can be used as a dimensional measurement and control system in the company testing laboratory. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
