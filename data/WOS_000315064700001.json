The excess pore pressure and degree of consolidation were compared with Hansbo's results. The factors affecting the calculation results were also investigated. Some conclusions were drawn regarding the distribution of the excess pore water pressure along the ground depth and the extent of consolidation considering the varied discharge capacity.
