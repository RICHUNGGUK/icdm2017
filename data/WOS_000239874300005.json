In our algorithm, the behavior of region automata is encoded as Boolean formulas, and hence any SAT solver can be used to explore the region graph efficiently. Although our SAT-based algorithm performs better than other algorithms in flaw detection, it is less effective in proving properties. To overcome the problem, we incorporate a complete inductive method in our algorithm to improve the performance when the property is satisfied. We implement both algorithms in a tool called xBMC and report experimental results. The experiments show that the combination of efficient encoding and inductive methods offers an effective and practical method for the analysis of timing behavior.", "paper_title": "Sat-based model checking for region automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000239874300005"}
