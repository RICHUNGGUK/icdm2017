The software deals with laminar and turbulent situations in steady-state or transient regime. An overview is given on the theoretical principles and on the utilization of the program, Results for some test cases are presented and compared with benchmarking solutions. Although EasyCFD is mainly oriented for educational purposes, it may be a valuable tool for a first analysis of practical situations EasyCFD is available at www.easycfd.net.
