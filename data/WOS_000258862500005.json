In particular, we consider his recent idea for generating normally distributed variates without relying on a source of uniform random numbers and compare it with more conventional methods for generating normal random numbers. Implementations of Wallace's idea can be very fast (approximately as fast as good uniform generators). We discuss the statistical quality of the output, and mention how certain pitfalls can be avoided.", "paper_title": "Some comments on C. S.
