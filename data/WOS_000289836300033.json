In particular, the transport capacity under a multiple unicast traffic pattern is studied for a 1-D network of regularly spaced nodes on a line and for a 2-D network of nodes placed on a hexagonal lattice. The considered deterministic models are: (i) P/P, a model with exclusive transmission and reception, (ii) P/M, a model with simultaneous reception of the sum of the signals transmitted by all nearby nodes, (iii) B/P, a model with simultaneous transmission to all nearby nodes but exclusive reception, and (iv) B/M, a model with both simultaneous transmission and simultaneous reception. All four deterministic models are considered under half-duplex constraints. For the 1-D scenario, it is found that the transport capacity under B/M is twice that under P/P. For the 2-D scenario, it is found that the transport capacity under B/M is at least 2.5 times, and no more than six times, the transport capacity under P/P. The transport capacities under P/M and B/P fall between these bounds.", "paper_title": "Line and Lattice Networks Under Deterministic Interference Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000289836300033"}
