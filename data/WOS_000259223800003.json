To select the best manufacturing technology that achieves most of the company requirements, it is necessary to use an appropriate selection approach that takes into consideration the different quantitative and qualitative factors of company objectives and AMT benefits. In this paper, a methodology for the selection of AMT is presented to assist the decision maker in selecting technologies that meet their needs. The suggested methodology combines two databases for the manufacturing company and AMT information, and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tools (analytical hierarchy process and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process). The developed methodology is tested and validated using a real application from Saudi Arabian Industry.", "paper_title": "A methodology for selection and evaluation of advanced manufacturing technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000259223800003"}
