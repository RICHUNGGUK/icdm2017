We concentrate on the moment estimation methods based on the second order characteristics of the point process in question. These methods represent a simulation-free faster-to-compute alternative to the computationally intense maximum likelihood estimation. We give an overview of the available methods, discuss their properties and applicability. Further we present results of a simulation study in which performance of these estimating methods was compared for planar point processes with different types and strength of clustering and inter-point interactions.", "paper_title": "MOMENT ESTIMATION METHODS FOR STATIONARY SPATIAL COX PROCESSES - A COMPARISON", "paper_id": "WOS:000312568700013"}
