In this paper, we describe how Semantic Computing can enhance biological and medical intelligence. Specifically, we show how Structured Natural Language (SNL) can express many problems in BMI with a finite number of sentence patterns, and show how biological tools, OLAP, data mining tools and statistical analysis tools may be linked to solve problems related to biomedical data.", "paper_title": "Towards Semantic Biomedical Problem Solving", "paper_id": "WOS:000374167100001"}
