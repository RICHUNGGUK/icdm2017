In particular, our contribution is twofold: (i) we provide a formalism to deal with both qualitative and quantitative \"periodicity-dependent\" constraints between repeated events, considering user-defined periodicities as well; and (ii) we propose an intensional approach to temporal reasoning, which is based on the operations of intersection and composition. Such a comprehensive approach, to the best of our knowledge, represents an innovative contribution that integrates and extends results from both the artificial intelligence and the temporal databases literature.
