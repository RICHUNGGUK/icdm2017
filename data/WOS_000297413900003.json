In a previous paper, an ILP formulation and a partial polyhedral study were presented, and a preliminary branch-and-cut algorithm that produced some promising computational results was implemented. In this article, we present further results for this problem. We describe several newfacet-inducing inequalities obtained from the WRPP, as well as some inequalities that have to be satisfied by any optimal solution. We present an enhanced branch-and-cut algorithm that takes advantage of both these new inequalities and high quality min-max K-WRPP feasible solutions obtained by a metaheuristic. Computational results on a large set of instances are also reported. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
