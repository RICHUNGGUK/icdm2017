In particular we provide a formalisation of a domain involving rigid objects, holes and a string within a reasoning about actions and change framework. Therefore, this work investigates the formalisation and reasoning about flexible objects and void space (holes) in a single domain. Preliminary results of automated reasoning within this domain are also presented.", "paper_title": "Strings and holes: An exercise on spatial reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000242128100046"}
