Agents are not present in the definition of the rough sets. Now we will show that a set of conflicting agents or active set can be used to model inconsistent decision in rough set theory. Agent models give us the logic structure of the rough set theory. We think that vagueness in rough sets can be evaluated by a true, false complex structure of agents and classes. With the active set the logic evaluation of a rough set is a structured set of classical logic values as true and false. We show that many valued logic and lattices modelled by active sets are used to create class operations in rough sets. By active sets, relations in rough sets are modelled by matrices of classical logic values. This clarifies the deeper meaning of the decision rules in rough sets.", "paper_title": "Agents and rough sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000325810500013"}
