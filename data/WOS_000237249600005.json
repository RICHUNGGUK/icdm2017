In this paper, we focus on a regularization approach for semi-supervised classification. The label information graph is first defined to keep the pairwise label relationship and can be incorporated with neighborhood graph which reflects the intrinsic geometry structure of P-X. Then we propose a novel regularized semi-supervised classification algorithm, in which the regularization term is based on the modified Graph Laplacian. By redefining the Graph Laplacian, we can adjust and optimize the decision boundary using the labeled examples. The new algorithm combines the benefits of both unsupervised and supervised learning and can use unlabeled and labeled examples effectively. Encouraging experimental results are presented on both synthetic and real world datasets.", "paper_title": "Regularized semi-supervised classification on manifold", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600005"}
