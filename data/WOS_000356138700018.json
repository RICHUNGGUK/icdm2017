Traditional MAC protocols with CSMA often assume that a transmission must be deferred if the channel is busy, so they focus more on the optimization of serial transmission performance. Recent advances in physical layer, however, allows a receiver to reengage onto a stronger incoming signal from an ongoing transmission or interference, and thus shows the potential of parallel transmissions. Indeed, even if the channel is busy, a node has opportunities to carry out a successful transmission. In this study, we propose opportunistic concurrency (OPC), a new MAC layer scheme, which enables sensor nodes to capture the opportunistic concurrency and carry out parallel transmissions instead of always waiting for a clear channel. Based on local concurrency map, which encodes the interactions among different links, OPC utilizes concurrency control algorithm to make transmission decision distributedly. Our experiments on a testbed consisting of 60 TelosB sensor motes identify the transmission opportunities in WSNs with OPC. Evaluation results show that OPC achieves a 17 percent reduction in packet latency, a 9.4 percent addition in throughput and a 10 percent reduction in power consumption compared with existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Opportunistic Concurrency: A MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356138700018"}
