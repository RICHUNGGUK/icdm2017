In this paper, we minimize the station randomness to access the control architecture introducing a collisions-free access scheme. We propose a synchronous protocol according which at the end of the propagation delay each station applies a distributed algorithm for packet transmission following the data channel collisions and the receiver collisions avoidance algorithms. We introduce two data transmission stages. The time difference between them is one packet transmission time. At the end of the first stage all data channels are free and can be reused by the remaining data packets during the second stage. The proposed protocol ensures a totally collisions-free performance. The main advantage is that the data channels reuse strategy applied during the second stage provides enhanced transmission probability to the rejected packets during the first stage. This allows the data packets to try retransmission in the same cycle without requiring control packets re-coordination that increases propagation delay. Thus, we achieve large number of data packets transmission, even more than the data channels number, providing throughput improvement and delay reduction, comparing with other studies.
