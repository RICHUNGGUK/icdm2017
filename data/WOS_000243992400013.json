Optimization of the probe selection process is required for arrays that are designed to probe specific genomic regions in very high resolution without compromising probe quality constraints. Results: In this paper we describe a well-defined optimization problem associated with the problem of probe selection for high-resolution aCGH arrays. We propose the whenever possible is an element of-cover as a formulation that faithfully captures the requirement of probe selection problem, and provide a fast randomized algorithm that solves the optimization problem in O(n logn) time, as well as a deterministic algorithm with the same asymptotic performance. We apply the method in a typical high-definition array design scenario and demonstrate its superiority with respect to alternative approaches.
