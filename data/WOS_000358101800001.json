This extension can be done either by adding fluctuations to the equations of the model or by using Markov kinetic schemes' formalism. We are presenting a new extension of the model. This modification simplifies computational complexity of the neuron model especially when considering a hardware implementation. The hardware implementation of the extended model as a system on a chip using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is demonstrated in this paper. The results confirm the reliability of the extended model presented here.", "paper_title": "THE STOCHASTIC, MARKOVIAN, HODGKIN-HUXLEY TYPE OF MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE NEURON", "paper_id": "WOS:000358101800001"}
