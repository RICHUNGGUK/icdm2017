LDAGs generalize earlier proposals for allowing local structures in the conditional probability distribution of a node, such that unrestricted label sets determine which edges can be deleted from the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) for a given context. Several properties of these models are derived, including a generalization of the concept of Markov equivalence classes. Efficient Bayesian learning of LDAGs is enabled by introducing an LDAG-based factorization of the Dirichlet prior for the model parameters, such that the marginal likelihood can be calculated analytically. In addition, we develop a novel prior distribution for the model structures that can appropriately penalize a model for its labeling complexity. A non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm combined with a greedy hill climbing approach is used for illustrating the useful properties of LDAG models for both real and synthetic data sets.", "paper_title": "Labeled directed acyclic graphs: a generalization of context-specific independence in directed graphical models", "paper_id": "WOS:000349369300007"}
