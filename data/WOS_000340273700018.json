We present new upper bounds on the cardinality/rate of binary block codes that correct errors within this model. All our bounds, except for one, are obtained using combinatorial arguments based on hypergraph fractional coverings. The exception is a bound derived via an information-theoretic argument. Our bounds significantly improve upon existing bounds from the prior literature.", "paper_title": "Upper Bounds on the Size of Grain-Correcting Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000340273700018"}
