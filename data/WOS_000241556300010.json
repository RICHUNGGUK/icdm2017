Hence, an artificial enlargement of the training set has been proposed as a solution for the problem. In this paper, the error sources in the statistical shape model based segmentation were analyzed and the optimization processes were improved. The method was evaluated with 3D cardiac MR volume data. The enlargement method based on non-rigid movement produced good results - with 250 artificial modes, the average error for four-chamber model was 2.11 mm when evaluated using 25 subjects.", "paper_title": "Artificially enlarged training set in image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300010"}
