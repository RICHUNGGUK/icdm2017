However, when device-to-device (D2D) communication underlying the cellular layer is supported, an objective function that considers the power consumption is more suitable. We find that BPC remains optimal for D2D communications when the weight of the overall power consumption in the utility function is bounded. Building on this insight, we propose a simple near-optimal extended BPC scheme and compare its performance with a recently proposed utility optimal iterative scheme using a realistic multicell simulator. Our results indicate that a near optimal D2D performance can be achieved without lengthy iterations or complex signaling mechanisms.", "paper_title": "A Binary Power Control Scheme for D2D Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000377706800024"}
