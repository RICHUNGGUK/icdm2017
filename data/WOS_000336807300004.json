However, although image clustering is a problem that has been treated extensively in both Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) and Text-Based Image Retrieval (TBIR) systems, event detection within image management is a relatively new area. Having this in mind, we propose a novel approach for event extraction and clustering of images, taking into account textual annotations, time and geographical positions. Our goal is to develop a clustering method based on the fact that an image may belong to an event cluster. Here, we stress the necessity of having an event clustering and cluster extraction algorithm that are both scalable and allow online applications. To achieve this, we extend a well-known clustering algorithm called Suffix Tree Clustering (STC), originally developed to cluster text documents using document snippets. The idea is that we consider an image along with its annotation as a document. Further, we extend it to also include time and geographical position so that we can capture the contextual information from each image during the clustering process. This has appeared to be particularly useful on images gathered from online photo-sharing applications such as Flickr. Hence, our STC-based approach is aimed at dealing with the challenges induced by capturing contextual information from Flickr images and extracting related events. We evaluate our algorithm using different annotated datasets mainly gathered from Flickr. As part of this evaluation we investigate the effects of using different parameters, such as time and space granularities, and compare these effects. In addition, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm with respect to mining events from image collections. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our STC-based algorithm in extracting and clustering events.", "paper_title": "A scalable algorithm for extraction and clustering of event-related pictures", "paper_id": "WOS:000336807300004"}
