This research applies the means-end chain methodology to analyze the relation between instructors' personal values and the functionalities of the e-learning system. This research finds that the most critical functional requirements of the e-learning system for instructors can be categorized to two dimensions - instruction presentation and student learning management. The instruction presentation requirement includes e-syllabus and electronic whiteboard, while student learning management requirement are fulfilled by online forum, online roll call, threaded discussions, and assignment management. This research discovers that instructors develop sense of accomplishment, self-fulfillment, and fun and enjoyment of life through using the e-learning system with the aforementioned functionalities, which motivate them to continue using the system for instruction. Our research findings provide practical implications for the design and implementation of successful e-learning systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
