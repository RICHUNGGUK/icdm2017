Our results are as follows: -) For graphs of bounded tree-width there is an OBDD of size O(log n) for f(G) that uses encodings of size O(log n) for the vertices; -) For graphs of bounded clique-width there is an OBDD of size O(n) for f(G) that uses encodings of size O(n) for the vertices; -) For graphs of bounded clique-width such that there is a reduced term for G (to be defined below) that is balanced with depth O(log n) there is an OBDD of size O(n) for f(G) that uses encodings of size O(log n) for the vertices; -) For cographs, i.e. graphs of clique-width at most 2, there is an OBDD of size O(n) for f(G) that uses encodings of size O(log n) for the vertices.
