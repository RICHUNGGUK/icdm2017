The graph is the natural one defined by the configurations of the NTM. All methods in the literature have required time linear in the size S of this graph. This paper presents a new simulation method that runs in time (O) over tilde(root S). The search savings exploit the one-dimensional nature of Turing machine tapes. In addition, we remove most of the time dependence on nondeterministic choices of states and tape head movements.
