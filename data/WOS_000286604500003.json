Closed patterns are powerful representatives of frequent patterns, since they eliminate redundant information. Our approach is based on an advantageous representation of trees and a low-complexity notion of relaxed closed trees, as well as ideas from Galois Lattice Theory. More precisely, we present three closed tree mining algorithms in sequence: an incremental one, INCTREEMINER, a sliding-window based one, WINTREEMINER, and finally one that mines closed trees adaptively from data streams, ADATREEMINER. By adaptive we mean here that it presents at all times the closed trees that are frequent in the current state of the data stream. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work on mining closed frequent trees in streaming data varying with time. We give a first experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Mining frequent closed trees in evolving data streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000286604500003"}
