We propose the multispectral neural networks (MSNN) to learn features from multicolumn deep neural networks and embed the penultimate hierarchical discriminative manifolds into a compact representation. The low-dimensional embedding explores the complementary property of different views wherein the distribution of each view is sufficiently smooth and hence achieves robustness, given few labeled training data. Our experiments show that spectrally embedding several deep neural networks can explore the optimum output from the multicolumn networks and consistently decrease the error rate compared with a single deep network.", "paper_title": "Learning Deep and Wide: A Spectral Method for Learning Deep Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345518900016"}
