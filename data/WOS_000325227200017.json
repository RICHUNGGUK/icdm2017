With the interpin skew compensation, the printed circuit board traces of the data and the strobe signals are allowed to have unequal length. The prototype implemented in a 0.13-mu m standard CMOS process shows that the interpin skew is reduced to be less than 26 ps for a 3.2-Gb/s/pin x8 parallel interface.", "paper_title": "Skew Compensation Technique for Source-Synchronous Parallel DRAM Interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000325227200017"}
