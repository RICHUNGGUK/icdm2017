However, there still remain major challenges to overcome before an advanced clinical implant is created. These include efficient wireless power and data transmission, multichannel stimulation with minimal crosstalk, effective and safe stimulation, an accurate modulation scheme, dynamic and adaptive feedback, device miniaturization, electrode fabrication and packaging. This paper provides a review of the development in vestibular prostheses to date, and uses a specific example to demonstrate the problems in designing the implantable circuits for such a neuroprosthetic device.", "paper_title": "Vestibular prosthesis design for restoring balance", "paper_id": "WOS:000327321000002"}
