We apply this approach to both static and dynamic local binary pattern (LBP) descriptors. For static-texture description, we present LBP histogram Fourier (LBP-HF) features, and for dynamic-texture recognition, we present two rotation-invariant descriptors computed from the LBPs from three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) features in the spatiotemporal domain. LBP-HF is a novel rotation-invariant image descriptor computed from discrete Fourier transforms of LBP histograms. The approach can be also generalized to embed any uniform features into this framework, and combining the supplementary information, e. g., sign and magnitude components of the LBP, together can improve the description ability. Moreover, two variants of rotation-invariant descriptors are proposed to the LBP-TOP, which is an effective descriptor for dynamic-texture recognition, as shown by its recent success in different application problems, but it is not rotation invariant. In the experiments, it is shown that the LBP-HF and its extensions outperform noninvariant and earlier versions of the rotation-invariant LBP in the rotation-invariant texture classification. In experiments on two dynamic-texture databases with rotations or view variations, the proposed video features can effectively deal with rotation variations of dynamic textures (DTs). They also are robust with respect to changes in viewpoint, outperforming recent methods proposed for view-invariant recognition of DTs.", "paper_title": "Rotation-Invariant Image and Video Description With Local Binary Pattern Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000302181800004"}
