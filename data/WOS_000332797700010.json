A number of strategies are introduced and investigated on a symmetric two-route traffic network over the past decade. To evaluate the strategies in a more general scenario, this paper conducts eight prevalent strategies on an asymmetric two-route traffic network with different slowdown behaviors on alternative routes. The results show that only mean velocity feedback strategy (MVFS) is able to equalize travel time, i.e. approximate user optimality (UO); while the others fail due to incapability of establishing relations between the feedback parameters and travel time. The paper helps better understand these strategies, and suggests MVFS if the authority intends to achieve user optimality.", "paper_title": "Route guidance strategies revisited: Comparison and evaluation in an asymmetric two-route traffic network", "paper_id": "WOS:000332797700010"}
