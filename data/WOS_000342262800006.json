This class of systems under consideration is described by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. The goal of the paper is to design fuzzy state-feedback controllers such that systems with partly unknown transition rates are not only regular, impulse-free and stochastically stable, but also satisfy a prescribed H-infinity performance for all delays no larger than a given upper bound in terms of linear matrix inequalities. And systems with completely known transition rates can be viewed as a special case of the one we consider here. Finally numerical examples are given to illustrate the merit and usability of the approach proposed in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
