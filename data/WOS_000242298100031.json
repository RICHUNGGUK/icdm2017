Thermodynamic functions were calculated from first principle molecular computations on deoxyribose models and the disulfide congener. The gas reaction of one of the disulfides turned out to be the closest to the thermoneutral process. Solvation study caused a relatively minor energetic modification. The disulfides were subjected to docking studies, and the stabilities of the complexes obtained were further analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. Only one of the two atropic disulfide enantiomers was the matching partner of the chiral DNA double helix, and therefore this remained in the major groove of the DNA. The other enantiomer dissociated from the major groove as it was incapable of forming a stable complex with the chiral double helix. A mechanistic scheme for the reaction has been investigated.", "paper_title": "Role of aromacity, ring strain, and stereochemistry of selected disulfides and their congeners in the oxidative linkage of DNA strands at the major groove.
