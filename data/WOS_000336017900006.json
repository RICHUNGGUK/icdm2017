The black-and-white coloring problem asks if there exist disjoint sets of vertices B and W with vertical bar B vertical bar = b and vertical bar W vertical bar = w such that no vertex in B is adjacent to any vertex in W. In this paper we show that the problem is polynomial when restricted to cographs, interval graphs, permutation graphs, distance-hereditary graphs, and strongly chordal graphs. We show that the problem is NP-complete on splitgraphs.
