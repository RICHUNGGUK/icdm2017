The circuit requires a small number of transistors, with a bandwidth exceeding 100 MHz. Two-phase and three-phase oscillators based on cascaded sections of the proposed filter are constructed followed by a generic multiphase oscillator. Simulation results, using AMS 0.35 mu BiCMOS technology parameters, and experimental results are given.", "paper_title": "Novel approximate square-root domain all-pass filter with application to multiphase oscillators", "paper_id": "WOS:000235671900013"}
