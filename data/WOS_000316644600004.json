Suitable usage of voluntary disconnected operations with pre-fetching of data in mobile environments can effectively save energy and money for mobile devices in wireless pervasive computing. In this paper, we analyze energy expenditure, including voluntary disconnected operations, to evaluate the energy efficiency of mobile computing. We estimate the energy expenditure using various parameters. The results of our analysis will assist efficient employment of disconnected operations and performance prediction.", "paper_title": "VOLUNTARY DISCONNECTED OPERATIONS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT MOBILE DEVICES IN PERVASIVE COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000316644600004"}
