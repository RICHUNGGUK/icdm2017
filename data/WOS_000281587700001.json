Parallel dose-response studies are conducted, customarily ,in preclinical and phase 1,2 clinical trials for this purpose. Practical constraints on dose range, dose levels and dose proportions are intrinsic issues in the design of dose response studies because of drug toxicity, efficacy, FDA regulations, protocol requirements, clinical trial logistics, and marketing issues.We provide a free on-line software package called Controlled Optimal Design 2.0 for generating controlled optimal designs that can incorporate prior information and multiple objectives, and meet multiple practical constraints at the same time. Researchers can either run the web-based design program or download its stand-alone version to construct the desired multiple-objective controlled Bayesian optimal designs. Because researchers often adopt ad-hoc design schemes such as the equal allocation rules with out knowing how efficient such designs would be for the design problem, the program also evaluates the efficiency of user-supplied design", "paper_title": "Controlled Optimal Design Program for the Logit Dose Response Mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000281587700001"}
