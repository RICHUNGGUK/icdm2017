A Krylov-accelerated interface multigrid approach (IMG) solves the discretization efficiently. Stability and convergence are proved in one dimension, while an extensive array of numerical experiments with complex interfaces and large coefficient transitions demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the method in two dimensions.
