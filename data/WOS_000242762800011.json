We present a modeling scheme based on (1) a multiresolution representation, called the vertex-based nonmanifold multitessellation, (2) a compact and dimension-independent data structure, called the Simplified Incidence Graph (SIG), and (3) an atomic mesh update operator, called vertex-pair contraction/vertex expansion. We propose efficient algorithms for performing the vertex-pair contraction on a simplicial mesh encoded as a SIG, and an effective representation for encoding this multiresolution model based on a compact encoding of vertex-pair contractions and vertex expansions.", "paper_title": "A dimension-independent representation for multiresolution nonmanifold meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000242762800011"}
