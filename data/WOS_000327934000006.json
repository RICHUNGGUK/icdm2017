An important requirement of this process is that results must be reproducible so that other researchers can replicate, validate, and extend existing work. We look at the landscape of simulators for research in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks by conducting a survey of a combined total of over 280 papers from before and after 2007 (the year of the last survey in this area), and comment on the large quantity of research using bespoke, closed-source simulators. We propose a set of criteria that P2P simulators should meet, and poll the P2P research community for their agreement. We aim to drive the community towards performing their experiments on simulators that allow for others to validate their results.", "paper_title": "The State of Peer-to-Peer Network Simulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000327934000006"}
