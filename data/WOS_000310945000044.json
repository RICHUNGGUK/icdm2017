The conventional risk priority number (RPN) method has been criticized to have many deficiencies and various risk priority models have been proposed in the literature to enhance the performance of FMEA. However, there has been no literature review on this topic. In this study, we reviewed 75 FMEA papers published between 1992 and 2012 in the international journals and categorized them according to the approaches used to overcome the limitations of the conventional RPN method. The intention of this review is to address the following three questions: (i) Which shortcomings attract the most attention? (ii) Which approaches are the most popular? (iii) Is there any inadequacy of the approaches? The answers to these questions will give an indication of current trends in research and the best direction for future research in order to further address the known deficiencies associated with the traditional FMEA.
