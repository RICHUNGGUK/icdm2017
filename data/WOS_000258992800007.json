Transaction level modeling understandably expedites the design simulation and verification. During the verification process, generating good test cases plays a significant role in determining the quality of the design. Inadequate test cases May Cause bugs to remain. In this paper, first, in order to generate test cases for a TL model, we present a Control-Transaction Graph (CTG) which describes the behavior of a TL Model. A Control Graph is a control flow graph of a module in the design and transactions represent the interactions such as synchronization between modules. Second, we define dependent paths (DePaths) on the CTG as test cases for a transaction level model, which can find communication errors in Simulation. We also give coverage metrics for a TL model to measure the quality of the generated test cases. Finally, we apply our method on the SystemC model of AMBA-AHB bus and JPEG encoder and generate test cases based on the CTG of these models. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.
