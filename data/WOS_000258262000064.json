We present an optimization-based computational framework for design and digital reconstruction of surfaces which can be produced by curved folding. Our work not only contributes to applications in architecture and industrial design, but it also provides a new way to study the complex and largely unexplored phenomena arising in curved folding.", "paper_title": "Curved folding", "paper_id": "WOS:000258262000064"}
