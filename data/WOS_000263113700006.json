One proposed circuit employs two current conveyors, two grounded capacitors and two resistors, wherever the other proposed circuit employs two current conveyors, two grounded capacitors and two multi-input, multi-output Operational Transconductance Amplifiers(OTA) as variable resistor for tuning the cutoff frequency of realized filters. Without changing the passive elements, the proposed circuits employ features of multifunctional, convenient for integration, low sensitivities and simple in structure.", "paper_title": "Tunable frequency versatile filters implementation using minimum number of passive elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000263113700006"}
