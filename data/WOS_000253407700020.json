This method works by evaluating the function under a nonstandard interpretation, lifting reals to multivariate power series. Multivariate power series, with potentially an infinite number of terms with nonzero coefficients, are represented using a lazy data structure constructed out of linear terms. A complete implementation of this method in SCHEME is presented, along with a straightforward exposition, based on Taylor expansions, of the method's correctness.", "paper_title": "Lazy multivariate higher-order forward-mode AD", "paper_id": "WOS:000253407700020"}
