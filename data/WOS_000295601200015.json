We consider the generative power of restricted cancel minimal linear grammars: the grammars have only one nonterminal symbol C except the start symbol S, and their productions consist of context-free type productions, the left-hand side of which is S and the right-hand side contains at most one occurrence of S, and a unique cancellation production C-m --> epsilon that replaces the string C-m by the empty string epsilon. We show that, for any given positive integer in, the class of languages generated by cancel minimal linear grammars with C-m --> epsilon, is properly included in the class of linear languages. Conversely, we show that for any linear language L, there exists some positive integer in such that a cancel minimal linear grammar with C-m --> epsilon generates L. We also show how the generative power of cancel minimal linear grammars with a unique cancellation production C-m --> epsilon vary according to changes of m and restrictions imposed on occurrences of terminal symbols in the right-hand side of productions.", "paper_title": "On the Generative Power of Cancel Minimal Linear Grammars with Single Nonterminal Symbol except the Start Symbol", "paper_id": "WOS:000295601200015"}
