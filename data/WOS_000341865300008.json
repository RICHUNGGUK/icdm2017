Ortho, meta and para Mg2+ configurational polymorphs were defined. The theoretical vibration frequencies of OH groups depend significantly on the nature of the cations they are joined with. Theoretical values are spread out over narrow ranges: 3,612-3,626 cm(-1) for v(AlOHMg), 3,604-3,606 cm(-1) for v(AlOHAl), and 3,657-3,660 cm(-1) for v(MgOHMg); 803-830 cm(-1) for delta(AlOHMg), 877 cm(-1) for delta(AlOHAl), and 693-711 cm(-1) for delta(MgOHMg), in agreement with known experimental values. From the intensities of the XOHY bands, we observe that the vibrational adsorptivities of the v(OH) vibrations are not the same for all XOHY groups, and that v(MgOHMg) absorptivity is much lower than that of v(AlOHAl). These theoretical results should be taken into account in quantitative analysis of experimental vibrational studies in clay minerals, introducing different molar extinction coefficients in the Lambert-Beer law to determine the relative concentrations of both cationic arrangements.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study on the influence of the Mg2+ and Al3+ octahedral cations on the vibrational spectra of the hydroxy groups of dioctahedral 2:1 phyllosilicate models", "paper_id": "WOS:000341865300008"}
