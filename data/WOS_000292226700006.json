The algorithm is an octree-based version of the Cocone reconstruction algorithm [4], allowing independent processing of small subsets of the total input point set. When the points are sufficiently sampled from a smooth surface, the global guarantee of topological correctness of the original algorithm is preserved, together with the geometric accuracy guarantees.
