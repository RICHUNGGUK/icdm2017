The inherent heterogeneity of Web resources, the vast amount of information on the Web, and its non-specific nature requires a semantically rich tool for extracting the essence of Web source content. The OntoBuilder project [5] supports the extraction of ontologies from Web interfaces, ranging from simple Search Engine forms to multiple-pages, complex reservation systems. Ontologies from similar domains are then matched to identify ontology mappings. Given a sample form, filled by the user, and given a new form, from another Web site, OntoBuilder finds the best mapping between the two forms. This, in turn, can serve a system in automatically filling the fields, a sort of a query rewriting. Unlike systems such as Protege [2] OntoBuilder enables fully-automatic ontology matching, and therefore falls within the same category as GLUE [1]. The use of ontologies, as opposed to relational schema or XML, as an underlying data model allows a flexible representation of metadata, that can be tailored to many different types of applications. OntoBuilder contains several unique matching algorithms, that can match concepts (terms) by their data types, constraints on value assignment, and above all, the sequencing of concepts within forms (termed precedence), capturing sequence semantics that reflect business rules.", "paper_title": "OntoBuilder: Fully automatic extraction and consolidation of ontologies from web sources using sequence semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200042"}
