Current approaches to address these changing demands include manual tailoring by end-users and automatic adaptation of single user tools or for individual users. Few systems use context as a basis for adapting collaborative work environments, mostly focusing on document recommendation and awareness provision. In this paper, we present, firstly, a generic four layer framework for modeling and exploiting context. Secondly, a generic adaptation process translating user activity into state, deriving context for a given focus, and executing adaptation rules on this context. Thirdly, a collaboration domain model for describing collaboration environments and collaborative situations. Fourthly, examples of exploiting our approach to support context-based adaptation in four typical collaboration situations: co-location, co-access, co-recommendation, and co-dependency.", "paper_title": "MODELING AND EXPLOITING CONTEXT FOR ADAPTIVE COLLABORATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000278951800003"}
