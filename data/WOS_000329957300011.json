Combining with the ever expanding market penetration of mobile phones, the onboard sensors are driving the sensing community towards a new paradigm called participatory sensing in which ordinary citizens voluntarily collect and share information from their local environment using personal mobile devices. The inherent openness of this platform is a double-edged sword. While encouraging user participation on the one hand, it also makes it easy to contribute corrupted data. As such, data trustworthiness becomes a key issue which needs to be addressed to ensure sustainable development of this emerging paradigm. In this paper, we propose a reputation system in which a reputation score is calculated for each device as a reflection of the trustworthiness of its sensor data. We adopt the Gompertz function as a fundamental building block of our system, since it is better suited to deal with the unique characteristics of participatory sensing. We present an application-agnostic implementation of the system, which can work with a wide variety of participatory sensing applications. We evaluate the performance of our reputation system in the context of two real-world participatory sensing applications. Our results show that the proposed reputation system outperforms existing solutions by up to a factor of six. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
