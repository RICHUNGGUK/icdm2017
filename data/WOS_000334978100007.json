The last step of this test, the interpretation of immunofluorescent images by trained experts, represents a potential source of errors and could theoretically be replaced by automated methods. Here we present a fully automatic method for recognition of types of immunofluorescent images produced by the ANA HEp-2 medical test. The proposed method makes use of the difference in number, size, shape and localization of cell regions that are targeted by the antinuclear antibodies - the humoral components of immune system that bind human antigens as a result of the immune system malfunction. The method extracts morphological properties of stained cell regions using a combination of thresholding-based and thresholding-less approaches and applies a conventional machine-learning algorithm for image classification.
