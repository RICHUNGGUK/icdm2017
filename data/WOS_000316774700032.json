To maintain their competitiveness, enterprises should safeguard their information and try to eliminate the risk of information being compromised or reduce this risk to an acceptable level. This paper proposes an information security risk-control assessment model that could improve information security for these companies and organizations. We propose an MCDM model combining VIKOR, DEMATEL, and ANP to solve the problem of conflicting criteria that show dependence and feedback. In addition, an empirical application of evaluating the risk controls is used to illustrate the proposed method. The results show that our proposed method can be effective in helping IT managers validate the effectiveness of their risk controls. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
