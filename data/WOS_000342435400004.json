To overcome the limitations of conventional active shape model (ASM) on shape modeling of micro-drill bits, six key landmarks are defined for the initialization and optimization of ASM, and a novel method based on projection profiles is also proposed for these key landmarks detection. In addition, to involve the local shape feature, a bag of shape segment (BoSS) model is developed. Based on the improved ASM and BoSS, a new shape representation of micro-drill bits is proposed for phase identification. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional ASM and can improve the phase identification accuracy of micro-drill bits.", "paper_title": "Automatic optical phase identification of micro-drill bits based on improved ASM and bag of shape segment in PCB production", "paper_id": "WOS:000342435400004"}
