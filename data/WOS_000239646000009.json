API uses mean packet loss ratio and mean queue length as control error to adaptively adjust packet drop probability in order to expedite congestion control. The extensive simulations validate that API achieves faster control response and improved performance in terms of goodput, average queue length, and packet loss ratio.", "paper_title": "An adaptive algorithm for active queue management", "paper_id": "WOS:000239646000009"}
