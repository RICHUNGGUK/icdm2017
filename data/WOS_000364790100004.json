It was found that with modern computers, most of these methods provide results in a fraction of a second, even for high values of c and N. We also show that the traditional methods for dealing with infinite buffers lead to double integrals, a problem that is avoided by using a novel method we suggest.", "paper_title": "Efficient Methods to find the Equilibrium Distribution of the Number of Customers in GI/M/c Queues", "paper_id": "WOS:000364790100004"}
