The project exploits recent Web standards and technologies such asWeb services and ontologies to export data from autonomous data providers as reusable services, and proposes the use of service composition as a viable solution to answer data integration needs on the fly. The project proposed new composition algorithms and service/ composition execution models that preserve privacy of data manipulated by services and compositions. The proposed integration system was demonstrated at EDBT 2013 and VLDB 2011.", "paper_title": "PAIRSE: A Privacy-Preserving Service-Oriented Data Integration System", "paper_id": "WOS:000325846500005"}
