Then, the fuzzy extensions for safety first models are proposed. These models are generally formulated as stochastic and fuzzy programming problems. Since they are not well-defined problems due to random and fuzzy variables and it is difficult to solve them directly and analytically, introducing the probability and possibility chance constraints, they are equivalently transformed into 0-1 mixed linear programming problems and the efficient solution methods are constructed. Furthermore, a numerical example of Portfolio selection problem is provided to compare proposed models with the basic model.", "paper_title": "SAFETY FIRST MODELS OF PORTFOLIO SELECTION PROBLEMS CONSIDERING THE MULTI-SCENARIO INCLUDING FUZZY RETURNS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269685400002"}
