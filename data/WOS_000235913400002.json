From this model, simulation formulas for electrical and optical properties are calculated. These formulas incorporate both time dependence and voltage dependence. They make it possible to optimize display properties since the model is built up with physical parameters. Results are shown that prove that this model is indeed capable of complete optical and electrical transient simulation. The importance of centrifugation during display manufacturing is proven as a way to improve the switching speed of the display. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
