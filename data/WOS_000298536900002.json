The Object Management Group has recently developed the systems modeling language (OMG SysML (TM)). This visual modeling language provides a comprehensive set of diagrams and constructs for modeling many common aspects of systems engineering problems, such as system requirements, structures, functions, and behaviors. Complementing these SysML constructs, the MODELICA language has emerged as a standard for modeling the continuous dynamics of systems in terms of hybrid discrete-event and differential algebraic equation systems. In this paper, the synergy between SysML and Modelica is explored at three different levels: the definition of continuous dynamics models in SysML, the use of triple graph grammar based transformations to map between these SysML constructs and the corresponding Modelica models, and the integration of simulation experiments with other SysML constructs to support MBSE. Throughout the paper, an example of a car suspension is used to demonstrate these contributions.
