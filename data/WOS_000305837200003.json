The solution at hand is to distribute both data and requests onto multiple computers. Apart from storage, the annotation of data with machine-processable semantics is essential for realizing the vision of the Semantic Web. Reasoning on web-scale data faces the same requirements as storage. Swarm-based approaches have been shown to produce near-optimal solutions for hard problems in a completely decentralized way. We propose a novel concept for reasoning within a fully distributed and self-organized storage system that is based on the collective behavior of swarm individuals and does not require any schema replication. We show the general feasibility and efficiency of our approach with a proof-of-concept experiment of storage and reasoning performance. Thereby, we positively answer the research question of whether swarm-based approaches are useful in creating a large-scale distributed storage and reasoning system.", "paper_title": "Large-Scale Storage and Reasoning for Semantic Data Using Swarms", "paper_id": "WOS:000305837200003"}
