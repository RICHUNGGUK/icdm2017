In contemporary global market, a successful semiconductor manufacturer has to excel in multiple performance indices, consequently qualified scheduling approaches should provide efficient and holistic management of wafer products, information and manufacturing resources and make adaptive decisions based on real-time processing status to reach an overall optimized system performance. To cope with this challenge, a timed extended object-oriented Petri nets (EOPNs) based multiple-objective scheduling and real-time dispatching approach is proposed in this paper. Four performance objectives pursued by semiconductor manufacturers are integrated into a priority-ranking algorithm that serves as the initial scheduling guidance, and then all wafer lots will be dynamically dispatched by the hybrid real-time dispatching control system. A set of simulation experiments validate the proposed multiple-objective scheduling and real-time dispatching algorithm may achieve satisfactory performances. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
