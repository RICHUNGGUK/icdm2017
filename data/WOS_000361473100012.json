A well-understood subclass of hyperbolicity cones is that of spectrahedral cones and it is conjectured that every hyperbolicity cone is spectrahedral. In this paper we prove a weaker version of this conjecture by showing that every smooth hyperbolicity cone is the linear projection of a spectrahedral cone, that is, a spectrahedral shadow.", "paper_title": "Smooth hyperbolicity cones are spectrahedral shadows", "paper_id": "WOS:000361473100012"}
