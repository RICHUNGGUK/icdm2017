This scheme is slightly inspired on the vertebrate olfactory system, and its goal is to recognize spatiotemporal patterns produced in a two-dimensional cellular automaton that would represent the olfactory bulb activity when submitted to odor stimuli. The recognition occurs through a multi-layer Kohonen network that would represent the olfactory cortex. The recognition is invariant to rotations of the patterns, even when a noise lower than 1% is added.", "paper_title": "Rotation-invariant pattern recognition: A procedure slightly inspired on olfactory system and based on Kohonen network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200046"}
