It features a unified and low-overhead pipeline flush design, a common-case oriented and efficient single-instruction repeating design, and retimed and single-cycle address generation. The asynchronous DSP is implemented using 130 nm CMOS process and is completely standard-cell based. Pre-layout simulation results demonstrate an equivalent speed of 61.5 MIPS and energy dissipation of 54.5 mu W/MIPS @ 1.2 V running a Radix 2 FFT benchmark program, and a 30.0% energy reduction compared to the clock-gated synchronous counterpart.
