Therefore, how to provide consumers with the right amount of information becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an electronic programming guide (EPG) recommender based on natural language processing techniques, more specifically, text classification. This recommender has been implemented as a service on a home network that facilitates the personalized browsing and recommendation of TV programs on a portable remote device. Evaluations of our Maximum Entropy text classifier were performed on multiple categories of TV programs, and a near 80% retrieval rate is achieved using a small set of training data.", "paper_title": "Content classification and recommendation techniques for viewing electronic programming guide on a portable device", "paper_id": "WOS:000250955100011"}
