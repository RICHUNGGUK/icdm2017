The model proposes a three-dimensional approach to the behavioural modelling of technical artefacts using definitions based mainly on the meta-ontology DOLCE as concepts of behaviour. The present work aims to show how these terms and those from the NIST functional basis can complement each other in functional design. It is assumed that this model achieves similar objectives with behaviours to those obtained by the NIST functional basis with functions, i.e. the representation of behaviours in CAD and KBS, a scheme for the modelling of behaviours and a universal set of behaviours. The modelling language IDEF was adapted to be able to produce a graphic example of the modelling of technical artefacts in the FBS framework using B-Cube terminology at the behaviour level.
