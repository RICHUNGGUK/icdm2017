It can simultaneously map quantitative trait loci (QTL) with individual effects, epistasis and QTLenvironment interaction. Currently, it is able to handle data from F-2, backcross, recombinant inbred lines and double-haploid populations, as well as populations from specific mating designs (immortalized F-2 and BCnFn populations). The Windows version of QTLNetwork was developed with a graphical user interface. Alternatively, the command-line versions have the facility to be run in other prevalent operating systems, such as Linux, Unix and MacOS.", "paper_title": "QTLNetwork: mapping and visualizing genetic architecture of complex traits in experimental populations", "paper_id": "WOS:000253746400021"}
