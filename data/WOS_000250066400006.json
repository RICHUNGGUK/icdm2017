However, when developing a software application by statically integrating components at implementation time it is difficult to modify the system after it has been deployed. Re-configuration, addition, removal or replacement of components may require significant changes to the application source-code. Such changes have proven to be error-prone, time consuming and expensive. Therefore, statically composed software development is suited to well-defined applications with small user-bases that change rarely. This is an uncommond scenario in the software development industry. In this paper we propose a reconfigurable plug and play software framework and platform that eases application composition and reconfiguration. This framework and platform realize the concept of 'model once, generate anywhere'.", "paper_title": "A dynamically reconfigurable Voice User Interface (VUI) framework and platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000250066400006"}
