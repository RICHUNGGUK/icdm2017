We first decompose all non-quadrangular facets into quadrilaterals. The tangential and second-order derivative vectors are then estimated on each vertex of the quads. A least-square adjustment algorithm based on the homogeneous form of G(2) continuity condition is applied to achieve curvature continuity. Afterwards, the boundary curves, the first- and the second-order cross-boundary derivative curves are constructed fulfilling G(2) continuity and compatibility conditions. Coons B-spline patches are finally generated using these curves as boundary conditions. In this paper, the upper bound of the rank of G(2) continuity condition matrices is also strictly proved to be 2n - 3, and the method of tangent-vector estimation is improved to avoid petal-shaped patches in interpolating solids of revolution. Several examples demonstrate its feasibility. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "G(2) B-spline interpolation to a closed mesh", "paper_id": "WOS:000287109800004"}
