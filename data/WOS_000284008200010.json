However, most previous researchers only address the challenge in homogeneous environments. Considering the increasing popularity of heterogeneous systems, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm for PM of heterogeneous soft real-time clusters. It is built on simple but effective mathematical models. When deployed to a new platform, the software incurs low configuration cost because no extensive performance measurements and profiling are required. To strive for efficiency, a threshold-based approach is adopted. In this paper, we systematically study this approach and its design decisions.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Threshold-Based Power Management Mechanism for Heterogeneous Soft Real-Time Clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000284008200010"}
