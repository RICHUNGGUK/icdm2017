Design/methodology/approach - The character of semicycles, periodicity, global stability and boundedness of positive solutions of the mentioned difference equation are investigated. Findings - It is deduced that, when q < 1, then the positive equilibrium of this equation is globally asymptotically stable and, when q > 1, then this difference equation possesses unbounded solutions. Originality/value - The paper investigates some of the characteristics of nonlinear difference equations.", "paper_title": "Some characteristics of solutions of a class of rational difference equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000257527800008"}
