In this paper, we report a context-based secondary structure potential (CSSP) for assessing the quality of predicted protein secondary structures generated by various prediction servers. CSSP is a sequence-position-specific knowledge-based potential generated based on the potentials of mean force approach, where high-order inter-residue interactions are taken into consideration. The CSSP potential is effective in identifying secondary structure predictions with good quality. In 56% of the targets in the CB513 benchmark, the optimal CSSP potential is able to recognize the native secondary structure or a prediction with Q3 accuracy higher than 90% as best scored in the predicted secondary structures generated by 10 popularly used secondary structure prediction servers. In more than 80% of the CB513 targets, the predicted secondary structures with the lowest CSSP potential values yield higher than 80% Q3 accuracy. Similar performance of CSSP is found on the CASP9 targets as well. Moreover, our computational results also show that the CSSP potential using triplets outperforms the CSSP potential using doublets and is currently better than the CSSP potential using quartets.
