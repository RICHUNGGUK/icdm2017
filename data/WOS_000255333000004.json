Hydraulic system dynamics are taken into account during the setpoint assignment step which consists in controlling gates for large operating conditions. For hydraulic systems subjected to strong disturbances, transfer delays are variable, thus different operating modes must be considered. A multimodelling method, associated to a selection technique of transfer delay, allowing for the determination of the number of models, is proposed. The simulation results on the first reach of the Neste canal show the effectiveness of the HCA strategy.", "paper_title": "Hybrid control accommodation for water-asset management of hydraulic systems subjected to large operating conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333000004"}
