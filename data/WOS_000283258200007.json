Recent approaches automate the tuning and control of the parameters that govern this balance. We propose a new technique to dynamically control the behavior of operators in an EA and to manage a large set of potential operators. The best operators are rewarded by applying them more often. Tests of this technique on instances of 3-SAT return results that are competitive with an algorithm tailored to the problem.", "paper_title": "Autonomous operator management for evolutionary algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000283258200007"}
