The soil structure is modeled as several dissimilar strata placed one on top of the other, composing a sandwich-like profile. Any of these layers may contain components of the foundations. Each region occupied by a soil layer or by a foundation component is handled as a 3D isotropic, elastic and homogeneous domain, and is analyzed by BEM. As a consequence of the positioning of the various subregions in this model, the technique of successive rigidity can be applied directly, resulting in a considerable reduction in the volume of data being stored and manipulated throughout the analysis.
