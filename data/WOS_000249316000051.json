The marginal densities are well-known nonparametric survival models and the joint density is constructed via a mixture. Our construction also defines a copula and the properties of this new copula are studied. We also consider the model in the presence of covariates and, in particular, we find a simple generalisation of the widely used frailty model, which is based on a new bivariate gamma distribution.
