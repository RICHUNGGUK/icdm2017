The interactions between these systems create exquisite multitiered networks, with each component in nonlinear contact with many interaction partners. These networks aren't just complicated, they're complex. Understanding, quantifying, and handling this complexity is one of the biggest scientific challenges of our time. Computer science provides the language needed to study and understand these systems. Computer system architectures reflect the same laws and organizing principles used to build individualized biomedical systems, which can account for variations in physiology, treatment, and drug response.", "paper_title": "From molecule to man: Decision support in individualized e-Health", "paper_id": "WOS:000241907100007"}
