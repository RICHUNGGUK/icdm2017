The PML construction is performed in Laplace-Fourier space via a modal analysis and can be viewed as a complex change of variables. The mixed derivatives cause the presence of waves with opposite phase and group velocities, which has previously been shown to cause instability of layer equations in certain types of hyperbolic problems. Nevertheless, here the PML is stable if the absorption function a lies below a specified threshold. The PML construction and analysis are carried out for the linear part of the system. Numerical tests are then performed in both the linear and nonlinear regimes checking convergence of the error with respect to the layer width and showing that the PML performs well even in many nonlinear simulations.
