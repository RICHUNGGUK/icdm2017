The tag's information is easily read by anyone. So far, there are many schemes proposed to protect the user privacy for using MD. In general, user. privacy includes data privacy and location privacy. Most of the proposed schemes just provide the protection for data privacy. Recently, the scheme proposed by Lee can protect both data privacy and location privacy. Our scheme is based on the scheme proposed by Lee, and we improve Lee's weakness and make it can apply on someone sells his MUD system in security, to make our scheme achieves the property of ownership transfer.", "paper_title": "NONIDENTIFIABLE RFID PRIVACY PROTECTION WITH OWNERSHIP TRANSFER", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500030"}
