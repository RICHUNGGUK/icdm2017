The package uses powerful algebro-geometric methods, as implemented in the free computer algebra system Singular, but requires no knowledge of the mathematics upon which it is based. A series of easy-to-use Mathematics modules are provided which can be used both in string theory and in more general applications requiring fast polynomial computations. The use of these modules is illustrated throughout with simple examples.

Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU GPL No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 31050 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 163 832 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: \"Mathematics\" syntax Computer: Home and office spec desktop and laptop machines, networked or stand alone Operating system: Windows XP (with Cygwin), Linux, Mac OS, running Mathematica V5 or above RAM: Varies greatly depending on calculation to be performed Classification: 11.1 External routines: Linux: The program \"Singular\" is called from Mathematica. Windows: \"Singular\" is called within the Cygwin environment from Mathematics. Nature of problem: A central problem of string-phenomenology is to find stable vacua in the fourdimensional effective theories which result from compactification. Solution method: We present an algorithmic method, which uses techniques of algebraic geometry, to find all of the vacua of any given string-phenomenological system in a huge class. Running time: Varies greatly depending on calculation requested. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "STRINGVACUA.
