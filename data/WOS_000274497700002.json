We define TCGFs, and prove that TCGFs possess a pure strategy Nash-equilibrium. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm for the computation of such equilibrium. We also provide a specialized, simpler, algorithm for the case in which all resources are identical.", "paper_title": "Taxed congestion games with failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000274497700002"}
