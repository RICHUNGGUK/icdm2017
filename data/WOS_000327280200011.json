Smart Door Porch uses cameras, an RFID (radio-frequency identification) reader, and a touch panel for home security as well as the at-home awareness of each family member. The home portal uses Open Services Gateway initiative (OSGi) framework and Java EE as the middleware to provide services including home activity, home calendar, and home collaboration map. The home collaboration map, based on the Google map, shows the locations of family members on the map with the aid of the GPS-enabled mobile devices carried by them. With the mobile devices, the proposed system supports ubiquitous collaboration among family members. Experimental results based on scenario simulations confirm that the proposed system is able to provide better services for family members in home collaboration.", "paper_title": "Smart Door: A Ubiquitous Collaboration System for Home Activities in the Smart Home", "paper_id": "WOS:000327280200011"}
