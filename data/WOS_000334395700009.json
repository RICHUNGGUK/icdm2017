While existing static routing schemes such as destination-mod-k (D-mod-k) routing are load-balanced and effective for full bisection bandwidth fat-trees, they incur significant load imbalance in many slimmed fat-trees. In this work, we propose a static load balanced routing scheme, called Round-Robin Routing (RRR), for 2- and 3-level extended generalized fat-trees (XGFTs), which represent many fat-tree variations including slimmed fat-trees. RRR achieves near perfect load-balancing for any such XGFT in that links at the same level of a tree carry traffic from almost the same number of source-destination pairs. Our evaluation results indicate that on many slimmed fat-trees, RRR is significantly better than D-mod-k for dense traffic patterns due to its better load-balancing property, but performs worse for sparse patterns. We develop a combined routing scheme that enjoys the strengths of both RRR and D-mod-k by using RRR in conjunction with D-mod-k. The combined routing is a robust load-balanced routing scheme for slimmed fat-trees: it performs similar to D-mod-k for sparse traffic patterns and to RRR for dense patterns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
