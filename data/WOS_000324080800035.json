A large scale randomized controlled trial was conducted to study the efficacy of a web-based intelligent tutoring system to deliver the structure strategy to improve content area reading comprehension. We present our theory of change focusing on the theoretical framework: structure strategy, delivery approach of web-based intelligent tutoring systems, and contextual conditions for successful adoption of the tool with fidelity. Results from the optimal implementation schools show statistically significantly better performance by ITSS classrooms compared to their control counterparts with moderate to large effect sizes. Conditions for implementing technology-based interventions with fidelity in schools are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
