The paper focuses on interactive recommendation in which assistance is provided in a context-sensitive manner when the mashup plan can't be determined in advance. The paper analyzes the problem with a motivating scenario of mashup building for criminal investigation. Inspired by the observation that there exist dataflow patterns for certain integration functionalities, a dataflow-pattern- based recommendation framework is proposed to solve the problems. The framework can not only recommend data services by discovering similar situations, but also recommend mashup patterns and target data services. We propose a method to analyze the relationships between data services and dataflow patterns through both mining history logs and matching the input/output parameters. Further, to recommend target data services, we propose a method to transform the data mashup plans into mixed graphs and apply the graph-based substructure pattern mining (gSpan) algorithm on them. Experiments show that the dataflow-pattern- based recommendation approach for data service mashup is effective and efficient.", "paper_title": "A Dataflow-Pattern-Based Recommendation Framework for Data Service Mashup", "paper_id": "WOS:000367007100007"}
