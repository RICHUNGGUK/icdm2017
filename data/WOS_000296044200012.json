The comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA) studies have been performed with a training set of 317 compounds, estimating three superimposition methods. The best CoMFA and CoMSIA models, derived from superimposition I, shows leave-one-out cross-validation correlation coefficients (Q(2)) of 0.571 and 0.592 as well as the conventional correlation coefficients (R-ncv(2)) of 0.814 and 0.834, respectively. In addition, the satisfactory results, based on the bootstrapping analysis and 10-fold cross-validation, further indicate the highly statistical significance of the optimal models. The external predictive abilities of these models were evaluated using a prediction set of 80 compounds, producing the predicted correlation coefficients (R-pred(2)) of 0.664 and 0.668, respectively. The key amino acid residues were identified by molecular docking, and the stability and rationality of the derived molecular conformations were also validated by MD simulation. The good concordance between the docking results and CoMFA/CoMSIA contour maps provides helpful clues about the rational modification of molecules in order to design more potent P2Y(12) antagonists. We hope the developed models could provide some instructions for further synthesis of highly potent P2Y(12) antagonists.", "paper_title": "Combined 3D-QSAR, Molecular Docking, and Molecular Dynamics Study on Piperazinyl-Glutamate-Pyridines/Pyrimidines as Potent P2Y(12) Antagonists for Inhibition of Platelet Aggregation", "paper_id": "WOS:000296044200012"}
