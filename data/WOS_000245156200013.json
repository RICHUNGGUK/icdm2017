Average opening time and energy distribution of the signal can be obtained directly by this method. The method can also be used when the signal is corrupted by noise. By contrast, the conventional frequency domain analysis method-power spectral density-is less effective. Power distribution fraction will therefore give more useful information in analysis of experimental ion channel signals, principally by giving values of the mean channel opening time. The method may be applied to distinguish different ion channels more efficiently and to find their reactions to drugs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
