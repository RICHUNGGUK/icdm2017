In this study, we propose the extended Advogato trust metric that facilitates the identification of trustworthy users associated with each individual user. By incorporating the strength of social relationships, we recursively diffuse a capacity of a target user throughout his/her personal network. Based on the capacity propagation, this paper also presents the capacity-first maximum flow method capable of finding the strongest path pertinent to discovering an ordered set of reliable users and preventing unreliable users from accessing personal networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach has advantages over existing representative methods in terms of both the discovery of reliable users and the preventability of unreliable users.
