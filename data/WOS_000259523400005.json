The spotty coverage of WLAN access points, however, confines the applicability of many real-time services such as VoIP within the boundary of the WLAN service area. In this paper, we investigate the problem of enhancing VoIP service for ubiquitous communication in a WLAN with spotty service area. We consider a university campus that has an established infrastructure for supporting SIP-based VoIP service through either wired or wireless data networks. The campus WLAN service does not have 100% full coverage, and hence users cannot make untethered VoIP calls anywhere on campus. The goal of this paper is to overcome the limitations of such \"dead spots\" for motivating the use of campus IP telephony service. To proceed, we start with two approaches called one-hop extension and dual-mode communication. The first approach uses multi-hop relay to extend the WLAN coverage, while the second approach leverages the availability of dual-mode handsets for ubiquitous voice communication. We implement the two approaches, and evaluate their performance in the campus testbed environment. We find that while the two approaches can effectively allow voice communication in WLAN dead spots, they have one common problem as the potential lack of support for voice call continuity that can cause degradation of the speech quality to an active call. We adopt a cross-layer solution based on signal processing algorithms to address the problem, thus achieving seamless voice call continuity while enabling ubiquitous voice communication on campus. Testbed evaluation shows promising results for future research along the proposed direction. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
