Image priors are commonly learned to regularize the, otherwise, seriously ill-posed SR problem, either using external LR-HR pairs or internal similar patterns. We propose joint SR to adaptively combine the advantages of both external and internal SR methods. We define two loss functions using sparse coding-based external examples, and epitomic matching based on internal examples, as well as a corresponding adaptive weight to automatically balance their contributions according to their reconstruction errors. Extensive SR results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing state-of-the- art methods, and is also verified by our subjective evaluation study.", "paper_title": "Learning Super-Resolution Jointly From External and Internal Examples", "paper_id": "WOS:000360066700012"}
