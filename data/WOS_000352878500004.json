Our work consists of four parts. First, we consider the discrete memoryless (DM-MAC-WT) case of the model and derive inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region under both of the secrecy constraints. Second, the results are extended to the Gaussian memoryless case [Gaussian multiple-access channel WT (GMAC-WT)] in detail and are used to illustrate numerically that the secrecy rate region is enlarged by increasing the power of the interference signal which is known noncausally at the encoder. Third, we analyze the strong interference regime as an important regime in GMAC with side information and show that under collective secrecy constraint, we can achieve the secrecy capacity region of the single-sided channel asymptotically for a special case in which the signal and noise powers satisfy specific constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this capacity region is the first one obtained for GMAC-WT. Finally, we show that our results include previous works as its special cases for both the single-sided and two-sided channel models.", "paper_title": "On the Secrecy Rate Region of Multiple-Access Wiretap Channel With Noncausal Side Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000352878500004"}
