In several recent publications, the g-extra connectivity of an n-dimensional folded hypercube was determined for g <= 3 and some specific n (see, for example, Chang, Tsai, and Hsieh (2014) [4]). In this paper, an extension of the above results to all 0 <= g <= n + 1 and n >= 7 is presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
