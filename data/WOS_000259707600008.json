Because of the loosely coupled, autonomic and dynamic nature of services, the operation and the performance evaluation of business process meet some challenges, such as the definition of the key performance indicators (KPIs) and the alignment of business performance and IT performance. In this paper, we address these challenges. First, the definition and the characteristics of an SOBP are presented with a motivating scenario. Then a service-oriented business performance evaluation model is described, which integrates the performance of strategy, layer, business process layer, business activity layer, service composition layer and IT infrastructure layer. The KPIs corresponding to each layer are also defined with their formal representations. The qualitative and quantitative performance analysis methods, based on the proposed model, are presented, respectively. Finally, the improved analytic hierarchy process is explicated to calculate the correlation between different KPIs and select the most suitable service. An online-shopping example is taken to prove the soundness and the feasibility of the method.
