We extend our previous work on Lucx, an Intensional Programming Language extended with context as first class object, to support coordination activities in a distributed network of agents. We study coordination constructs which can be applied to sequential programs and distributed transactions. We give formal syntax and semantics for coordination constructs. The semantics for transaction expressions is given on top of the existing operational semantics in Lucx. The extended Lucx can be used for Intern-based agent applications.", "paper_title": "An intensional programming approach to multi-agent coordination in a distributed network of agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000237045600013"}
