The existing solution for sensor Plug-and-Play (P&P) for WSN nodes is the IEEE 1451 set of standards developed for smart transducers. The serious drawback of this solution is that it cannot be used with the most widespread plain transducers without adding multiple external components. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel mechanism that allows implementation of P&P connection to WSN nodes for commercially available off-the-shelf sensors with the most widespread wired plain digital interfaces (SPI, I2C, 1-wire etc.) without any single external component utilisation.", "paper_title": "Plug-and-play mechanism for plain transducers with wired digital interfaces attached to wireless sensor network nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000324298900006"}
