In practice, suppliers may require purchasers to pay a fraction of the order's cost in advance and sometimes allow them to divide the prepayment into multiple equal-sized parts to be paid during a fixed lead time. In this paper, an EOQ model with multiple prepayments under three different conditions: (a) no shortage, (b) full backordering and (c) partial backordering, are developed. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed models and solution method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
