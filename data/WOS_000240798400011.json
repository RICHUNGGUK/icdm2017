Less recognized but no less valid is that bond strain also fundamentally affects the chemical reactivity of the atoms involved in the bonding. This dual role of bond strain is clearly brought out in the present simulations. Stress-strain response of dry silica to the point of structural instability is studied using a classical inter-atomic potential model, whereas transition-state pathway sampling of water-silica reaction is performed using molecular orbital theory. Although not as accurate as possible from the standpoint of existing methods of simulation, the results nevertheless illustrate the physical insights into chemo-mechanical processes one can extract through multi-scale modeling and simulation.", "paper_title": "Atomic scale chemo-mechanics of silica: nano-rod deformation and water reaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000240798400011"}
