Mechanics of collisional motion of granular materials. Part 1: General hydrodynamic equations. J Fluid Mech 1995;282:75-114], and an energy loss term accounting for inelastic collisions. We study the hydrodynamics of blast waves in granular gases by means of a fifth-order accurate scheme that resolves the evolution under different restitution coefficients. We have observed and analyzed the formation of a cluster region near the contact wave using the one-dimensional and two-dimensional versions of our code. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
