In this paper, we study a three-dimensional off-lattice protein AB model with two species of monomers, hydrophobic and hydrophilic, and present a heuristic quasi-physical algorithm. By elaborately simulating the movement of the smooth elastic balls in the physical world, the algorithm finds low-energy configurations for a given monomer chain. A subsequent '' off-trap '' strategy is proposed to trigger a jump for a stuck situation in order to get out of local minima. The methods have been tested in the off-lattice AB model. The computational results show promising performance. For all sequences with 13 to 55 monomers, the algorithm finds states with lower energy than previously proposed putative ground states. Furthermore, for the sequences with 21, 34 and 55 monomers, new putative ground states are found, which are different from those given in present literature.", "paper_title": "Quasi-physical algorithm of an off-lattice model for protein folding problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000248356900010"}
