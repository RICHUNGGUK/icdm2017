However, due to the limitations of bandwidth and storage of the mobile devices, most of the existing authenticated key agreement protocols are not suitable for wireless mobile communication. Quite recently, Sui et al. have presented an efficient authenticated key agreement protocol based on elliptic curves cryptography and included their protocol in 3GPP2 specifications to improve the security of A-Key distribution. However, in this paper, we show that Sui et al.'s protocol can't resist the off-line password guessing attack, and therefore present an enhanced authenticated key agreement protocol. At the same time, we also consider including our enhanced protocol in 3GPP2 specifications. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
