This challenges the whole field of unconventional computation in the most fundamental way. The present study is a response to this challenge. Putnam's theorem is revisited in the context of unconventional computation where the emphasis is on the practical use of a system for a computation. The main goal of this study is to identify an algorithm that can solve the following (natural computability) problem: Given a physical system, identify the automaton (automata) that it naturally implements. A rigorous definition of the concept of natural computation is suggested: The natural implementation results in the largest computing power and has the lowest realisation cost. These ideas are formalized using rigorous mathematical reasoning. A generic algorithm for identifying the automata of interest is presented.", "paper_title": "A Perspective on Putnam's Realizability Theorem in the Context of Unconventional Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000352670600006"}
