Most existing coverage and connectivity algorithms work to form tree networks when sensor nodes do not have location information of themselves. However, a tree topology network does not perform well in terms of energy efficiency and scalability if compared with a cluster network. In this paper, a novel topology control algorithm called Adaptive Random Clustering (ARC) is proposed to form a cluster network with required coverage and connectivity without location information. The performance of its coverage intensity and connectivity is analyzed based on the characteristics of cluster topology, and their proper parameters are determined. ARC inherits an excellent energy efficiency from cluster topology and avoids the collisions and overhearing of data packets. A good scalability can be achieved as only a limited number of channels are needed in ARC for a large-scale network. Furthermore, ARC can adjust the number of active nodes adaptively according to the required coverage to balance the energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that required coverage and connectivity can be satisfied and network lifetime is prolonged significantly.
