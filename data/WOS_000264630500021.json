To overcome this difficulty, the integration of gray-system theory and sliding-mode control is proposed in this paper. This way, the prediction capabilities of the former and the robustness of the latter are combined to regulate optimal wheel slip depending on the vehicle forward velocity. The design approach described is novel, considering that a point, rather than a line, is used as the sliding control surface. The control algorithm is derived and subsequently tested on a quarter vehicle model. Encouraged by the simulation results indicating the ability to overcome the stated difficulties with fast convergence, experimental results are carried out on a laboratory setup. The results presented indicate the potential of the approach in handling difficult real-time control problems.", "paper_title": "A Dynamic Method to Forecast the Wheel Slip for Antilock Braking System and Its Experimental Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264630500021"}
