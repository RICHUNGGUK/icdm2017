To protect the privacy of subjects visible in video sequences, prior research suggests using ad hoc obfuscation methods, such as blurring or pixelation of the face. However, there has been little investigation into how obfuscation influences the usability of images, such as for classification tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that at high obfuscation levels, ad hoc methods fail to preserve utility for various tasks, whereas at low obfuscation levels, they fail to prevent recognition. To overcome the implied tradeoff between privacy and utility, we introduce a new algorithm, k-Same-Select, which is a formal privacy protection schema based on k-anonymity that provably protects privacy and preserves data utility. We empirically validate our findings through evaluations on the FERET database, a large real world dataset of facial images.", "paper_title": "Integrating utility into face de-identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000239416100015"}
