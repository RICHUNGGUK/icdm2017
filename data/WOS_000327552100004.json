I describe the birth and growth of this collaboration and give a snapshot of its current state. My involvement started with a two-way collaboration on inductive theorem proving between my group in Edinburgh and Siekmann's group in Saarbrucken, but this grew to broaden both in research area and geographical area. It focused on several series of workshops/conferences, research grants and bilateral lab visits, and established both new applications and collaborations with researchers outwith automated reasoning.", "paper_title": "European collaboration on automated reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000327552100004"}
