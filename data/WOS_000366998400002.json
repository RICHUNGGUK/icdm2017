The multi-objective optimization advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization are utilized to solve the optimal threshold vector of the spectrum sensing problem in OFDM cognitive radio sensor networks. So the network can get a larger throughput under the condition of small interference. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can make larger throughput while keeping the interference is smaller in OFDM cognitive radio sensor networks. Thus the spectrum resources are used more effectively.", "paper_title": "A Linear Weighted Sum Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm Based on PSO for Wideband Spectrum Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000366998400002"}
