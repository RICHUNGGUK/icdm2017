The aim of Three Way is too ff er a suit of functions for handling three- way arrays. In particular, the most relevant available functions are T3 and CP, which implement, respectively, the Tucker3 and Candecomp/ Parafac methods. They are the two most popular tools for summarizing three-way arrays in terms of components. After briefly recalling both techniques from a theoretical point of view, the functions T3 and CP are described by considering three real life examples.", "paper_title": "Three-Way Component Analysis Using the R Package ThreeWay", "paper_id": "WOS:000340586400001"}
