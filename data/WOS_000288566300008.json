Most previous studies on evaluating MAC protocols are based on prolonged simulations and do not account for the multiple access interference due to multipath delay spread. In this work, we develop CTU, an analytical framework for Capturing the Throughput dependencies in UWB networks, while taking into account the PHY layer effects. The key attributes of CTU are: 1) It is modular; it can be easily modified to provide a basis for evaluating a wide range of MAC protocols for impulse-based UWB networks. The only requirements are that the MAC protocol under study be based on time-hopping and the modulation scheme be pulse position modulation; these are common design decisions in UWB networks. 2) It considers the channel characteristics in addition to MAC layer effects; CTU correlates probabilistically the multipath delay profile of the channel with the packet error rate. We employ CTU to evaluate the performance of different generic medium access procedure. We compare the results with those from extensive simulations and show the high accuracy of CTU. We use CTU to assess the impact of various system parameters on the MAC layer performance; we make several interesting observations that are discussed in depth.", "paper_title": "MAC Layer Throughput Estimation in Impulse-Radio UWB Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000288566300008"}
