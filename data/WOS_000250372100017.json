The sampling is not required to be periodic, and the only assumption is that the distance between any two consecutive sampling instants is less than a given bound. By using the input delay approach, the T-S fuzzy system with variable uncertain sampling is transformed into a continuous-time T-S fuzzy system with a delay in the state. Though the resulting closed-loop state-delayed T-S fuzzy system takes a standard form, the existing results on delay T-S fuzzy systems cannot be used for our purpose due to their restrictive assumptions on the derivative of state delay. A new condition guaranteeing asymptotic stability of the closed-loop sampled-data system is derived by a Lyapunov approach plus the free weighting matrix technique. Based on this stability condition, two procedures for designing state-feedback control laws are given: one casts the controller design into a convex optimization by introducing some overdesign and the other utilizes the cone complementarity linearization idea to cast the controller design into a sequential minimization problem subject to linear matrix inequality constraints, which can be readily solved using standard numerical software. An illustrative example is provided to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed controller design methodology.", "paper_title": "Stabilization of Nonlinear systems under variable sampling: A fuzzy control approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000250372100017"}
