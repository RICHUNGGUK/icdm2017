Comput. Phys. 1996; 126:202-228) including anti-diffusive flux corrections, the mapped WENO scheme, and modified smoothness indicator are tested for the Euler equations. The TVD Runge-Kutta explicit time-integrating scheme is adopted for unsteady flow computations and lower-Upper symmetric-Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) implicit method is employed for the computation of steady-state solutions. A numerical flux of the variant WENO scheme in flux limiter form is presented, which consists of first-order and high-order fluxes and allows for a more flexible choice of low-order schemes. Computations of unsteady oblique shock wave diffraction over a wedge and steady transonic flows over NACA 0012 and RAE 2822 airfoils are presented to test and compare the methods. Various aspects of the variant WENO methods including contact discontinuity sharpening and steady-state convergence rate are examined. By using the WENO scheme with anti-diffusive flux corrections, the present solutions indicate that good convergence rate can be achieved and high-order accuracy is maintained and contact discontinuities are sharpened markedly as compared with the original WENO schemes on the same meshes.
