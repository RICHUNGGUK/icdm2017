In this paper, a second order Taylor series expansion model is presented as the simplification of the popular used exponential recovery dynamic load model. Then, a frequency weighted least-squares based Hartley modulating functions (HMF) method is developed to estimate parameters of the load model, which effectively attenuates the effect of noises in the process of parameter identification. Case studies are conducted using simulation data and laboratory measurements to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for the identification of the dynamic load model in the presence of noticeable additive measurement noises.", "paper_title": "A CONTINUOUS-TIME IDENTIFICATION METHOD FOR PARAMETER ESTIMATION OF NONLINEAR DYNAMIC LOAD MODELS OF POWER SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310118200019"}
