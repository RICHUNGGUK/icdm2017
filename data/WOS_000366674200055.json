First, the tires are identified according to the widths and diameters by using the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. Second, the shapes of the hubs are used to distinguish the tires with similar dimensions. Finally, a two-layered fuzzy scheme is designed to identify the tires. Experimental results show that the two-layered fuzzy scheme is more effective than the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. And the proposed indirect tire identification method can achieve an accuracy of above 99.9% in the assembly line of tires.", "paper_title": "An indirect tire identification method based on a two-layered fuzzy scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200055"}
