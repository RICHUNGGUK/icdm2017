Many solutions compete in the different existing vehicular networking systems. However, one solution to suit all purposes has not been determined. While vehicle-to-infrastructure communication methods, such as standardized GPRS, HSPA, and LTE are currently used, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside units are more or less under construction. In addition to connections to server/traffic centers, connections to local sensors and traffic signs are needed to obtain actual local information in changing environments. In this paper, we describe the results of tests using wireless sensor network (WSN) radios of different kinds to communicate with moving vehicles. Our aim is to provide measured background information about different kinds of vehicular networking methodologies in order to find an optimal solution for different kinds of usage scenarios.", "paper_title": "Vehicle in a cognitive network", "paper_id": "WOS:000357256900003"}
