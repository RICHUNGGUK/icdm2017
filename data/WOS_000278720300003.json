The proposed mechanism improves the efficiency of the previously-developed rigid block mechanisms to account for eccentric loading condition in restricted bearing capacity problems. The comparisons show a good agreement between the results obtained using the present method and those of the known solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed mechanism was examined through investigating the bearing capacity of eccentrically loaded strip footings over thin layer foundation soils. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
