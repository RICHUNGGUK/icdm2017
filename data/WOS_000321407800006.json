The elaborated model is suitable for simulation and is adapted to the generator mode. In addition, it includes the magnetic circuit saturation effect. The aim of the control is to maintain the output voltage magnitude constant when the load and/or the speed of the rotor vary. Simulation results and experiments validate the approach. The electrical parameters of the laboratory prototype machine are identified prior to the control test. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
