Indeed, it is widely accepted that the unstoppable growth of Internet users is producing two well-known problems: (1) depletion of addresses, motivated by a design limitation of the currently deployed addressing scheme, and (2) the semantic overload of addresses. The main negative consequences of these problems may be summarized as: (i) exacerbating the geometrical growth of the routing tables, and (ii) affecting other network features, such as traffic engineering and mobility, in terms of resilience and disruption tolerant communications. The relevant consequences that addressing brings to the overall network operation is pushing the networking community to study and propose new addressing architectures that may limit or even remove the negative effects (affecting network performance) stemmed from the currently deployed addressing architecture. To this end, researchers working on this area must have a perfect understanding of the weaknesses and limitations coming up from the nowadays architecture as well as a comprehensive knowledge of the alternatives proposed so far along with the most appealing research trends. Aligned to this scenario, this paper comes up with the aim of assisting the reader to both: (i) get insights about the most prominent limitations of the currently deployed addressing architecture, and (ii) survey the existing proposals based on ID/Locator Split Architectures (ILSAs) including an analysis of pros and cons, as well as a taxonomy aiming at formulating a design space for evaluating and designing existing and future ILSAs.
