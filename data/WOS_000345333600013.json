In this paper, a novel accurate image alignment algorithm for aerial electronic image stabilization (EIS) is described. The feature points are first selected using optimal derivative filters based Harris detector, which can improve differentiation accuracy and obtain the precise coordinates of feature points. Then we choose the Delaunay Triangulation edges to find the matching pairs between feature points in overlapping images. The most \"useful\" matching points that belong to the background are used to find the global transformation parameters using the projective invariant. Finally, intentional motion of the camera is accumulated for correction by Sage-Husa adaptive filtering. Experiment results illustrate that the proposed algorithm is applied to the aerial captured video sequences with various dynamic scenes for performance demonstrations.", "paper_title": "Improved image alignment algorithm based on projective invariant for aerial video stabilization", "paper_id": "WOS:000345333600013"}
