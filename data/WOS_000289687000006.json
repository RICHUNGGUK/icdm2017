However it may fail to converge if the limit state surface at the design point is highly nonlinear. In this paper, an easy iterative algorithm, which introduces a \"new\" step length to control the convergence of the sequence and can be named as finite-step-length iterative algorithm, is present. It is proved that the HL-RF method is a special case of this proposed algorithm when the step length tends to infinity and the reason why the HL-RF diverges is illustrated. This proposed algorithm is much easier than other optimization schemes, especially than the modified HL-RF algorithm, because the process of line search for obtaining the step length is not needed. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective and as simple as the HL-RF but more robust.", "paper_title": "A robust iterative algorithm for structural reliability analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000289687000006"}
