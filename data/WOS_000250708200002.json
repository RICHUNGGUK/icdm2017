Literature focusing on the operator allocation problem does not consider the difference in operation skill requirement, which is often a constraint for practical applications. This research considered the mixed-skill multi-line operator allocation problem as a mixed integer programming formulation. A case study from Thin Film Transistor Liquid Crystal Display inspection and packaging process is adopted for empirical investigation. The results for the methodology showed promise in solving practical applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
