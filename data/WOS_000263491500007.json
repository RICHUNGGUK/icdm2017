Recently, increasing interest is engaged in research to come up with solutions that provide wide-area autonomous surveillance systems for object characterization and situation awareness, which involves portable, wireless, and/or Internet connected radar, digital video, and/or infrared sensors. The prominent research problems associated with multisensor integration for wide-area surveillance are modality selection, sensor planning, data fusion, and data exchange (communication) among multiple sensors. Thus, the requirements and constraints to be addressed include far-field view, wide coverage, high resolution, cooperative sensors, adaptive sensing modalities, dynamic objects, and uncontrolled environments. This article summarizes a new survey and analysis conducted in light of these challenging requirements and constraints. It involves techniques and strategies from work done in the areas of sensor fusion, sensor networks, smart sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), photogrammetry, and other intelligent systems where finding optimal solutions to the placement and deployment of multimodal sensors covering a wide area is important. While techniques covered in this survey are applicable to many wide-area environments such as traffic monitoring, airport terminal surveillance, parking lot surveillance, etc., our examples will be drawn mainly from such applications as harbor security and long-range face recognition.", "paper_title": "Survey and Analysis of Multimodal Sensor Planning and Integration for Wide Area Surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000263491500007"}
