Based on these abstract terms, intelligent autonomous systems, such as a robot, should be able to make inferences according to a specific knowledge base, so that they can better handle the complexity and uncertainty of the real world. We propose to realize this framework by combining Markov logic networks (MLNs) and data driven MCMC sampling, because the former are a powerful tool for modeling uncertain knowledge and the latter provides an efficient way to draw samples from unknown complex distributions. Furthermore, we show in detail how to adapt this framework to a certain task, in particular, semantic robot mapping. Based on MLNs, we formulate task-specific context knowledge as descriptive soft rules. Experiments on real world data and simulated data confirm the usefulness of our framework.
