In the past, a number of AGKE protocols based on the identity (ID)-based public key system (IDPKS) have been proposed, called ID-AGKE protocols. In the IDPKS system, users' identities are viewed as the public keys to eliminate certificate management of the traditional certificate-based public key system. Nevertheless, any certificate-based public key systems or IDPKS systems must provide a revocation mechanism to revoke misbehaving/compromised users from the public key systems. However, there was little work on studying the revocation problem of the IDPKS system. Quite recently, Tseng and Tsai presented a new ID-based encryption scheme and its associated revocation mechanism to solve the revocation problem efficiently, called revocable ID-based public key system (R-IDPKS). In this paper, we follow Tseng and Tsai's R-IDPKS system to propose the first revocable ID-AGKE (RID-AGKE) protocol. Security analysis is made to demonstrate that the proposed RID-AGKE protocol is a provably secure AGKE protocol and can resist malicious participants. As compared to the recently proposed ID-AGKE protocols, the proposed RID-AGKE protocol is provably secure and has better performance while providing an efficient revocation mechanism.
