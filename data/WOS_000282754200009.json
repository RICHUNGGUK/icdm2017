Traditionally this process has just been carried out by the executive staff but recently it has started to be based on opinions of different appraisers, being called integral evaluation. In such an evaluation process, the appraisers provide their opinions according to their own perceptions, knowledge and feelings regarding the evaluated employee. Such knowledge is then, vague and subjective. Consequently, its modelling by means of linguistic information is more flexible and suitable than a crisp modelling. Due to the fact that different types of experts could have different degree of knowledge about the evaluated employee, in this paper is proposed an integral evaluation model capable of dealing with multiple linguistic scales in a precise way by using extended linguistic hierarchies.", "paper_title": "An Extended Hierarchical Linguistic Model for Managing Integral Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000282754200009"}
