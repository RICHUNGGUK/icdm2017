Its main feature is that it allows determining the best design solution (with respect to prescribed criteria) while explicitly considering the unavoidable effects of uncertainty. In general, the application of this methodology is numerically involved, as it implies the simultaneous solution of an optimization problem and also the use of specialized algorithms for quantifying the effects of uncertainties. In view of this fact, several approaches have been developed in the literature for applying this methodology in problems of practical interest. This contribution provides a survey on approaches for performing Reliability-based Optimization, with emphasis on the theoretical foundations and the main assumptions involved. Early approaches as well as the most recently developed methods are covered. In addition, a qualitative comparison is performed in order to provide some general guidelines on the range of applicability on the different approaches discussed in this contribution.", "paper_title": "A survey on approaches for reliability-based optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000281861400001"}
