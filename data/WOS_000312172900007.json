To do this, Zhang et al's neural-dynamic method is employed to derive and design such an ARMP scheme. Such a scheme is then reformulated as a quadratic program (QP). To solve this QP problem online, a simplified linear-variational-inequality based primal-dual neural network (i.e., S-LVI-PDNN) is designed. With simple piecewise-linear dynamics and global exponential convergence to the optimal solution, such an S-LVI-PDNN solver can handle the strictly convex QP problem in an inverse-free manner. Finally, three given tasks, i.e., rhombic path, straight-line path and square path tracking tasks, are fulfilled by three-link, four-link and five-link planar robot arms, respectively. Computer-simulation and physical experiment results validate the physical realizability, efficacy and accuracy of the ARMP scheme and the corresponding S-LVI-PDNN solver. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
