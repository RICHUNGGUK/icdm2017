How should the agent merge these items of information into a single, consistent piece? Taking our lead from the contraction + expansion approach to belief revision, we envisage a two-stage approach to this problem. The first stage consists of weakening the individual pieces of information into a form in which they can be consistently added together. The second, trivial, stage then consists of simply adding together the information thus obtained. This paper is devoted mainly to the first stage of this process, which we call social contraction. We consider both a postulational and a procedural approach to social contraction. The latter builds on the author's framework of belief negotiation models. With the help of Spohn-type rankings we provide two possible instantiations of this extended framework. This leads to two interesting concrete families of social contraction functions.
