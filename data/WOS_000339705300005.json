Based on the evolutionary game theory, this paper proposes a proactive defense model for wireless sensor networks, in which we emphasize that the node has a limited ability to learn the evolution of rationality from different attack strategies of the attacker, and can dynamically adjust their strategies to achieve the most effective defense. Following this approach, the cost (e.g., energy consumption and wastage of machinery) has been greatly saved and the life cycle of the nodes has been extended as well. By employing the proposed model, the whole wireless sensor network can be implemented in an effective way. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
