The input to this problem is a directed graph G whose edges have non-negative weights. A cycle in this graph is actually a cycle in the underlying undirected graph with edges traversable in both directions. A {-1, 0, 1} edge incidence vector is associated with each cycle: edges traversed by the cycle in the right direction get I and edges traversed in the opposite direction get -1. The vector space over Q generated by these vectors is the cycle space of G. A minimum cycle basis is a set of cycles of minimum weight that span the cycle space of G. The current fastest algorithm for computing a minimum cycle basis in a directed graph with m edges and n vertices runs in (O) over tilde (m(omega+1)n) time (where omega < 2.376 is the exponent of matrix multiplication). Here we present an O(m(3)n + m(2)n(2) log n) algorithm. We also slightly improve the running time of the current fastest randomized algorithm from O(m 2 n log n) to O(m(2)n + mn(2) log n).", "paper_title": "A faster deterministic algorithm for minimum cycle bases in directed graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500023"}
