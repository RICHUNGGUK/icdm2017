In this paper, a two-stage object segmentation method is proposed. In the starting frame a global search algorithm is invoked, in which the candidate regions are extracted using motion, size and color, and the candidate regions are confirmed using Discriminative Map (DM) and Adaboost classifier. Only when the output of global searching is true, the local searching algorithm is invoked in the following frame, in which object is searched and segmented using DM and Adaboost classifier in a local area. If the output of the local search algorithm is positive, it will be used in the next frame; otherwise the global search algorithm is re-invoked. The experimental results using basketball videos show that our method is effective and robust to complex back-grounds and the blurred contour of object in motion.", "paper_title": "A ROBUST OBJECT SEGMENTATION METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000260923100026"}
