Unlike traditional delay-robust control systems that guarantee passive communication channel through the transmission of wave variables, the new approach uses the concept of absolute stability for the physically expressive Lawrence's four-channel structure for transmitting the standard power variables, i.e., force and position. By incorporating kinesthetic performance requirements, we derive an absolutely stable four-channel controller that is transparent when time delay is negligible. Experimentally, the study evaluates and compares the performance of the proposed controller with that of a benchmark wave variable-based controller. The results indicate contact stability for large delays, a lack of position drift, and improved position and force tracking in both the free motion and rigid contact regimes for small delays.", "paper_title": "Robust Stability of Teleoperation Systems with Time Delay: A New Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000319877500009"}
