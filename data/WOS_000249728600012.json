As one of the mainstream identification technologies, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology makes possible all products uniquely identifiable across factories. By taking advantage of data capacity stored in an RFID tag, critical manufacturing information on a product can be locally stored with the product. RFID technology provides a means for a product to rapidly retrieve its needed information as it advances through shop floors. A corresponding framework to enable the instant delivery of pertinent data and information on a uniquely identifiable job/product at point-of-need across factories is proposed. A small-scale manufacturing application is presented to show how the proposed approach can be implemented on the shop floor. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
