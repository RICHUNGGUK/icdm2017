Adapted optical measurement instruments like the laser scanning Doppler vibrometer (SLDV) exist to perform this task. The result of this high spatial resolution measurement is that a large amount of data is available. The processing of this data - i.e. extracting modal parameters from the FRFs - can be a time consuming task. On the other hand, when measuring on real-life structures, a portion of the FRFs is corrupted with high levels of noise (this is caused by laser drop outs which result in outliers in the measurements). In this article a data reduction method will be introduced which can be used to reduce the amount of data in order to limit the computation time. The method is based on a robust singular value decomposition (SVD). In contrast to existing SVD based techniques, outliers in the data can be handled efficiently. A validation of the technique is performed both on a simulation and on scanning laser vibrometer measurements of a car door and a circuit board. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
