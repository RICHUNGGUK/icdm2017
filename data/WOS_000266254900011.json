The inverter is controlled by a dead-band based controller, and achieves voltage tracking by synthesizing the desired voltage profile across a capacitor. The load is connected across this capacitor, and thus, the same voltage is experienced by the load as well. The inverter may feed various types of static linear and non-linear loads including AC motors. In this paper, the dynamic performance of the inverter, controlled by the above strategy, is investigated for different types of loads. A brief analysis is presented to facilitate the selection of the 'voltage control band' to achieve successful voltage tracking. Extensive simulations based on PSPICE have confirmed satisfactory dynamic performance of the inverter. Sample results from simulation have been compared by prototype experimentation confirming the usefulness of such inverters. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
