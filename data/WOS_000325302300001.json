We want to show how database hosting can benefit from this technology better, together with analysis on some of the causes and concerns of hosting databases in the Cloud. A graphical presentation is illustrated, where input is obtained from database workloads to gauge the adequacy of the resource, and plan for future. The essence of the proposal is based on linear regression correlation between workloads' execution time and corresponding server load. This paper strives to address the requirement prior to resource contention, so that underlying hardware planning in the Private Cloud can be carried out in orderly fashion and with adequate timeline. Subsequently Fuzzy Logic concept is utilized to represent the variables' relationship in the proposal, to ease the deterministic calculation in the algorithm during development phase. A supervisory mechanism to ensure validity of SQL response time used as input to the algorithm is proposed, so to ensure solidarity on the input parameters. The objective is to ensure credible transactions can run freely without hardware resource constraint throughout the tenure of the application offering, in association with the Cloud computing technology.", "paper_title": "Harnessing Cloud Computing for Dynamic Resource Requirement by Database Workloads", "paper_id": "WOS:000325302300001"}
