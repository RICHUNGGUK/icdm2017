Two new features based on this entropy are devised to cater the highly uncertain database found at the surveillance site. To handle the erroneous scores we have proposed Refined Score (RS) method and applied it on individual IR face, ear and iris modalities under both constrained and the unconstrained conditions for the authentication of users and also used for the score level fusion of these modalities using the proposed entropy based features. The entropy features show good performance under the constrained and unconstrained databases whereas the conventional entropies do not fare well on the unconstrained databases. RS based classifier always outperforms the EC (Euclidean classifier) and RS based score level fusion has an edge over the conventional score level fusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
