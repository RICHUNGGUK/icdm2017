These influencing factors can be categorized into emotion-related and cognition-related components. We present a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) denotative model to describe how the factors of individual emotions and cognition influence each other. We adjust the weight matrix of causal relationships between these factors by using a so-called nonlinear Hebbian learning method. Based on this FCM model, we can implement individual decision rules against possible infections for disease propagation studies. We take the simulation of influenza A [H1N1] spreading on a campus as an example. We find that individual decision making against infections (frequent washing, respirator usage, and crowd contact avoidance) can significantly decrease the at-peak number of infected patients, even when common policies, such as isolation and vaccination, are not deployed.", "paper_title": "Individual Decision Making Can Drive Epidemics: A Fuzzy Cognitive Map Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000334178800003"}
