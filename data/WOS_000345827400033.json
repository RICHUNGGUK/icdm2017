Irreproducible research decreases the efficiency of basic biological research and drug discovery and impedes experimental data reuse. A major contributing factor to irreproducibility is difficulty in interpreting complex experimental methodologies and designs from written text and in assessing variations among different experiments. Current bioinformatics initiatives either are focused on computational research reproducibility (i.e. data analysis) or laboratory information management systems. Here, we present a software tool, ProtocolNavigator, which addresses the largely overlooked challenges of interpretation and assessment. It provides a biologist-friendly opensource emulation-based tool for designing, documenting and reproducing biological experiments.", "paper_title": "ProtocolNavigator: emulation-based software for the design, documentation and reproduction biological experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000345827400033"}
