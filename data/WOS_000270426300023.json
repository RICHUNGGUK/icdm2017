According to the transmissibility of signal discontinuity under different resolution of wavelet transform, and the appearance of valley values at multiples of pitch period in the average magnitude difference function (AMDF), a new method for pitch detection based on the above is presented in this paper. In this method, a wavelet transform is used for enhancing the periodicity of noisy speech, then, the pitch is estimated by locating the most suitable valley value in the circular average magnitude difference function of the low frequency coefficients. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm, possesses lower calculation complexity, better pitch detection precision under strong back-ground noise, and the capability for real time implementation.", "paper_title": "PITCH DETECTION USING CIRCULAR AVERAGE MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE FUNCTION BASED ON WAVELET TRANSFORM", "paper_id": "WOS:000270426300023"}
