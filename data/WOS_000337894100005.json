COMBINING ALGORITHMIC AND ARCHITECTURAL OPTIMIZATIONS, THEY ACHIEVE A BALANCED UTILIZATION OF VARIOUS SYSTEM RESOURCES ( COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC, LOCAL BUFFERS, AND MEMORY BANDWIDTH), WITH NONE BECOMING PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS. THE DATAFLOW DESIGN PROVIDES PERFORMANCE EQUIVALENT TO 72 INTEL CPU CORES AND ACHIEVES 10 x HIGHER POWER EFFICIENCY THAN THE MULTICORE CPU ARCHITECTURE.", "paper_title": "SCALING REVERSE TIME MIGRATION PERFORMANCE THROUGH RECONFIGURABLE DATAFLOW ENGINES", "paper_id": "WOS:000337894100005"}
