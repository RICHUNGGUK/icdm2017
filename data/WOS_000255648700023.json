By integrating members, roles, and tasks in a workflow, three sorts of knowledge demands are gained. Based on knowledge demand information, a knowledge supply model is proposed for the purpose of delivering the right knowledge to the right persons. Knowledge grid, acting as a platform for implementing the knowledge supply, is also discussed mainly from the view of knowledge space. A prototype system of knowledge supply has been implemented and applied in product development.", "paper_title": "Knowledge grid based knowledge supply model", "paper_id": "WOS:000255648700023"}
