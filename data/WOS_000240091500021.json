No work has given a formal comparison between E(A)G(LE) and CTL on semantics, though it is said that the capability of representing the \"intentional\" aspects of goals and the possibility of dealing with failure are the main new features of E(A)G(LE) w.r.t. CTL. According to the formal semantics for E(A)G(LE) and CTL, we prove that all the EAGLE formulas in which only LV1 operators (i.e. the operators representing the \"intentional\" aspects of goals) appear and some E(A)G(LE) formulas including LV(2) operators (i.e. the operators dealing with failure and qualitative preferences) can be replaced by some CTL formulas without any change on semantics. Finally, we also find some basic and important goals in non-deterministic domains that exceed the expressive ability of EAGLE.", "paper_title": "Comparison between two languages used to express planning goals: CTL and E(A)G(LE)", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500021"}
