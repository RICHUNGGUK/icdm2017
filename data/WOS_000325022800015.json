Two cache coherence protocols are the mainstream applied to current CMPs. The token-based protocol (Token) provides high performance, but it generates a prohibitive amount of network traffic, which translates into excessive power consumption. The directory-based protocol (Directory) reduces network traffic, yet trades off with the storage overhead of the directory as well as entails comparatively low performance caused by indirection limiting its applicability for many-core CMPs. In this work, we present DP&TB, a novel cache coherence protocol particularly suited to future many-core CMPs. In DP&TB, cache coherence is maintained at the granularity of a page, facilitating to filter out either unnecessary coherence inspections for blocks inside private pages or network traffic for blocks inside shared pages. We employ Directory to detect private and shared pages and Token to maintain the coherence of the blocks inside shared pages. DP&TB inherits the merit of Directory and Token and overcome their problems. Experimental results show that DP&TB comprehensively beyond Directory and Token with improvement by 9.1 % in performance over Token and by 13.8 % in network traffic over Directory. In addition, the storage overhead of DP&TB is less than half of that of Directory. Our proposal can fulfill the requirement of many-core CMPs to achieve high performance, power and area efficiency.", "paper_title": "DP&TB: a coherence filtering protocol for many-core chip multiprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000325022800015"}
