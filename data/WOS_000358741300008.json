The measure can be a non-product measure on the Cantor space, on the other hand, it can also be the Bernoulli measure. We consider the constructive dimensions for the points which are random with respect to the measure. We examine limit frequencies of the outcome of 0 for such random points.", "paper_title": "Random Sequences with Respect to a Measure Defined by Two Linear Fractional Transformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000358741300008"}
