The service computing paradigm has so far been neutral to the specific features of search applications and services. To address this weakness, search computing advocates a new approach in which search, join, and ranking are the central aspects for service composition.", "paper_title": "Search Computing Managing Complex Search Queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000283945400004"}
