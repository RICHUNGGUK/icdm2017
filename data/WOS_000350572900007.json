Even for the concurrent transmission over mmWave networks, the use of directional antenna is highly recommended to guarantee high modulations and to overcome short propagation range caused to high path loss in mmWave frequency. Nevertheless the directional antenna has many advantages, users may suffer from performance degradation due to coverage limitation of wide beamwidth, when the concurrent transmission supports the multicast communication for the target applications such as conference room, wireless displays and room gaming. In this paper, we propose a multihop-based opportunistic concurrent directional transmission (M-OCDT) scheme for the directional multicast communication where the relay mechanism is generated depending on the locations of multicast users to maximize the sum rate. The proposed M-OCDT scheme is designed based on the IEEE 802.15.3c standard and supports the optimized searching algorithm for the relay users. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the M-OCDT scheme can improve the average overall throughput by 81 to 89 % compared with the conventional non-relay directional multicast procedure.", "paper_title": "Multi-hop-based opportunistic concurrent directional transmission in 60 GHz WPANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000350572900007"}
