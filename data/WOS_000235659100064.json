But the workflow is not programmable, and is not flexible enough for users as well. In this paper, a Distributed Programmable Grid System (DPGS) is put forward. In DPGS, a course-grained parallel programming interface CridPPI is implemented. Through it, user could couple multiple web services in DPGS to completed complicated requests. Based on Globus Toolkit 3.9.3, the DPGS provides a simply organized, extendable and scalable grid environment for grid designer to design and deploy traditional or new applications.", "paper_title": "DPGS: A distributed programmable grid system", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100064"}
