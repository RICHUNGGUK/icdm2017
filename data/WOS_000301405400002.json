However, all previous proposals must employ a large number of virtual servers to be effective, resulting in two severe problems. First, they incur excessive overheads. Secondly, they induce significant inconsistency in DHT routing state due to node churn. To solve the problems, we propose the inclusion of virtual server management strategies and an active stabilization mechanism. The virtual server management strategies intelligently manage the discard and creation of virtual serves. In our more aggressive virtual server discard strategy, the overheads of virtual server-based systems can be made to approach that of non-virtual-server-based systems, with a slight increase in workload imbalance. In our adaptive virtual server management strategy, it can maintain a level of virtual servers depending on system utilization, and system workload can be made to be as balanced as that in previous proposals that employ more virtual servers. Coupled with the active stabilization mechanism, our proposal solves the routing state inconsistency problem, while reducing the operating overheads significantly. All of our proposals can improve query success performance, as we always employ less virtual servers.", "paper_title": "IMPROVING ROUTING STATE CONSISTENCY AND REDUCING OVERHEAD FOR MIGRATION-BASED LOAD BALANCE SYSTEMS IN STRUCTURED OVERLAY NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405400002"}
