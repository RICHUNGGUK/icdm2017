The remeshing operation only occurs along the crack path. Mesh size is refined merely at the crack-tip super-element. The stress intensity factors are solved semi-analytically by the scaled boundary finite element method, sufficient accuracy can be ensured. The cohesive tractions are treated as side-face forces, and the induced displacement field can be sought as a particular solution to the governing differential equations. Numerical examples validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
