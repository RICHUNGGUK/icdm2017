As a result, ensemble systems are becoming an important resource, since they permit the use of simpler classifiers and the integration of different knowledge in the learning process. However, many text-classification ensemble approaches have an extremely high computational burden, which poses limitations in applications in real environments. Moreover, state-of-the-art kernel-based classifiers, such as support vector machines and relevance vector machines, demand large resources when applied to large databases. Therefore, we propose the use of a new systematic distributed ensemble framework to tackle these challenges, based on a generic deployment strategy in a cluster distributed environment. We employ a combination of both task and data decomposition of the text-classification system, based on partitioning, communication, agglomeration, and mapping to define and optimize a graph of dependent tasks. Additionally, the framework includes an ensemble system where we exploit diverse patterns of errors and gain from the synergies between the ensemble classifiers. The ensemble data partitioning strategy used is shown to improve the performance of baseline state-of-the-art kernel-based machines. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed framework outperforms standard methods both in speed and classification.", "paper_title": "Distributed Text Classification With an Ensemble Kernel-Based Learning Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000276683400005"}
