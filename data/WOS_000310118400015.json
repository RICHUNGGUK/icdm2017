The algorithm assigns weight values for satellites, firstly builds inter-satellite links of the satellite whose weight value is biggest, guarantees longest link duration, meanwhile, chooses links in which link delay is least to build, reduces link transmission delay, and then completes the rebuilding of inter-satellite links. The article constructs network topology and the link-reconfiguration scenario by STK simulation software, and then completes simulation verification of the algorithm performance by NS2 simulation software. The result to the simulation has shown that the link-reconfiguration algorithm extends the duration of new links by a large range, and reduces the end-to-end link delay in satellite network.", "paper_title": "LINK-RECONFIGURATION ALGORITHM OF LOW-ORBIT INTRA-LAYER INTER-SATELLITE LINK BASED ON WEIGHT VALUE", "paper_id": "WOS:000310118400015"}
