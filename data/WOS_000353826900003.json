The event refinement structure (ERS) approach augments Event-B with a graphical notation which is capable of explicit representation of control flows and refinement relationships. In previous work, the ERS approach has been evaluated manually in the development of two large case studies, a multimedia protocol and a spacecraft sub-system. The evaluation results helped us to extend the ERS constructors, to develop a systematic definition of ERS, and to develop a tool supporting ERS. We propose the ERS language which systematically defines the semantics of the ERS graphical notation including the constructors. The ERS tool supports automatic construction of the Event-B models in terms of control flows and refinement relationships. In this paper we outline the systematic definition of ERS including the presentation of constructors, the tool that supports it and evaluate the contribution that ERS and its tool make. Also we present how the systematic definition of ERS and the corresponding tool can ensure a consistent encoding of the ERS diagrams in the Event-B models.", "paper_title": "Language and tool support for event refinement structures in Event-B", "paper_id": "WOS:000353826900003"}
