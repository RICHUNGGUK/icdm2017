At the moment, this information cannot be explored to its full potential due to the lack of software tools to reliably collect, process and display that information in a way that life scientists can quickly analyze genes of interest and search for potential interaction networks. Commercial tools can perform a similar job, but results appear to be less informative than those obtained using contextual information. Results: The Gene Interaction Miner (GIM) could successfully uncover complex network structures of protein-protein interactions for a test dataset composed of genes already related to Alzheimer's disease. That same set, when examined using two other analysis tools, namely STRING and Pathway Studio, resulted in incomplete protein-protein interaction networks, which indicate that the use of curated databases only gives a partial picture of the biological processes behind the disease.", "paper_title": "The Gene Interaction Miner: a new tool for data mining contextual information for protein-protein interaction analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000273696900025"}
