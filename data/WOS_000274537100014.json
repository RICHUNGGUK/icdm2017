We show that the adaptive projected subgradient method (Yamada, 2003) realizes the multi-domain adaptive learning by employing (i) a projected gradient operator with respect to a 'fixed' proximity function reflecting the time-invariant specifications and (ii) a subgradient projection with respect to 'time-varying' objective functions reflecting the time-varying specifications. The resulting algorithm is Suitable for real-time implementation, because it requires no more than metric projections onto closed convex sets each of which accommodates the specification in each domain. A convergence analysis and numerical examples are presented.", "paper_title": "Multi-Domain Adaptive Learning Based on Feasibility Splitting and Adaptive Projected Subgradient Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537100014"}
