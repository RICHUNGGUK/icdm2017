In this paper, an access control scheme, namely FEAC, is presented for CPS. FEAC cannot only provide the ability to control access to data in normal situations, but also adaptively assign emergency-role and permissions to specific subject; and inform subjects without explicit access requests to handle emergency situations in a proactive manner. In FEAC, emergency-group and emergency-dependency are introduced. Emergencies are processed in sequence within the group and in parallel among groups. A priority and dependency model called PD-AGM is used to select optimal response-action execution path aiming to eliminate all emergencies that occurred within the system. Fault-tolerant access control policies are used to address failure in emergency management. A case study of the hospital medical care application shows the effectiveness of FEAC.", "paper_title": "A FAULT-TOLERANT EMERGENCY-AWARE ACCESS CONTROL SCHEME FOR CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288887600004"}
