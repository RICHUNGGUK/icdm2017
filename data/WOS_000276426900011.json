This paper proposes an effective hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm for polypropylene (PP) batch industries to minimize the maximum completion time, which is modeled as a complex generalized multi-stage flow shop scheduling problem with parallel units at each stage and different inventory storage policies In HPSO. a novel encoding scheme based on random key representation, a new assignment scheme STPT (smallest starting processing time) by taking the different intermediate storage strategies into account, an effective local search based on the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic, as well as a local search based on simulated annealing with an adaptive meta-Lamarckian learning strategy are proposed Simulation results based on a set of random instances and comparisons with several adaptations of constructive methods and meta-heuristics demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HPSO (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
