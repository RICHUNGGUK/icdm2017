After a state-scaling transformation, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed for the nonholonomic chained systems. The proposed MPC scheme employs a general projection neural network (GPN) to iteratively solve a quadratic programming (QP) problem over a finite receding horizon. The GPN employed in this paper is proved to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov, and its global convergence to the optimal solution is guaranteed for the reformulated QP. A simulation study is performed to show stable and convergent control performance under the proposed method, irrespective of whether the control input u(1) vanishes or not.", "paper_title": "Model Predictive Control of Nonholonomic Chained Systems Using General Projection Neural Networks Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000361751100002"}
