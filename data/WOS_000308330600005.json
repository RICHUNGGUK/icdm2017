The architecture consists of a conventional broadcast-and-select all-optical switching fabric, composed of Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOAs), and a hardware-based Serial Processing Unit (SPU) that uses an on-the-fly processing mechanism to forward optical packets. The proposed SPU avoids the use of memory units and uses a small number of logic gates that facilitate a straightforward all-optical implementation using photonic logic gates. The SPU also supports flexible wavelength multicasting by allowing each incoming wavelength to be forwarded to any number of output ports. Contention resolution is provided by the introduction of an Optical Delay Line (ODL) that provides a single-packet optical buffer if the output channel is occupied.", "paper_title": "Design proposal of a photonic multicast Bloom filter node", "paper_id": "WOS:000308330600005"}
