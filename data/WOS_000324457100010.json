The formulation is cast as a pair of linear programs with interval coefficients. We discuss when sharp collapse load bounds occur when the interval parameters are at the extreme limits of their respective intervals. A mixed 0-1 programming approach is first proposed to compute the minimum collapse limit, and, more importantly, we then develop a pair of robust and efficient nonlinear programming schemes that capture maximum collapse loads in one case and minimum collapse loads in the other.
