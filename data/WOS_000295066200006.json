An Adaptive Height-Modified Histogram Equalization (AHMHE) algorithm is proposed as a compensation technique for backlight images. It simultaneously enhances contrast in both the dark and the bright areas without creating regions of degraded local contrast. Moreover AHMHE is an adaptive algorithm: thus it requires minimal user input, and its reduced computational requirement makes it suitable for real-time application. In addition to AHMHE, a chroma correction technique was applied to chroma components in the YCbCr color space to produce more vivid color images. A series of subjective and index evaluations were conducted to measure the resultant image quality improvements by the AHMHE and the chroma correction algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
