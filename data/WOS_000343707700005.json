By taking some idiomatic standard binary images in the field of image processing as typical test objects, and by comparing our proposed NAMCEP representation with linear quadtree (LQT), binary tree (Bintree), non-symmetry and anti-packing model (NAM) with K-lines (NAMK), and NAM representations, we show that NAMCEP can not only reduce the average node, but also simultaneously improve the average compression. We also present a novel NAMCEP-based algorithm for area calculation and show experimentally that our algorithm offers significant improvements.", "paper_title": "A novel binary image representation algorithm by using NAM and coordinate encoding procedure and its application to area calculation", "paper_id": "WOS:000343707700005"}
