We perform our investigations on the multimodal LAST MINUTE corpus with records from naturalistic interactions. First, we used textual transcripts to analyse interaction styles and discourse structures. We found indications that younger subjects prefer a more technical style in communication with dialog systems. Next, wemodel the subject's internal success state with a hidden Markov model trained using the observed sequences of system feedback. This reveals that younger subjects interact significantly more successful with technical systems. Aiming on automatic detection of specific subjects's reactions, we then semi-automatically annotate SDEs-phrases indicating an irregular, i.e. not-task-oriented subject behavior. We use both acoustic and linguistic features to build several trait-specific classifiers for dialog phases, which showed pronouncedly different accuracies for diverse age and gender groups. The presented investigations coherently support age-dependence of both expressiveness and problem-solving ability. This in turn induces design rules for future automatic designated \"companion\" systems.", "paper_title": "Analysis of significant dialog events in realistic human-computer interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000337753000007"}
