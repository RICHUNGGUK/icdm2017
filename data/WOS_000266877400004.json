The IGBT were subjected to thermal over-stress tests using a transistor test board until device latch-up. The collector-emitter current, transistor case temperature, transient and steady state gate voltages, and transient and steady state collector-emitter voltages were monitored in-situ during the test. Pre- and post-aging characterization tests were performed on the IGBT. The aged parts were observed to have shifts in capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements as a result or trapped charge in the gate oxide. The collector-emitter ON voltage V(CE(ON)) showed a reduction with aging. The reduction in the V(CE(ON)) was found to be correlated to die attach degradation, as observed by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) analysis. The collector-emitter voltage, and transistor turn-off time were observed to be precursor parameters to latch-up. The monitoring of these precursor parameters will enable the development of a prognostic methodology for IGBT failure. The prognostic methodology will involve trending precursor data, and using physics of failure models for prediction of the remaining useful life of these devices.", "paper_title": "Precursor Parameter Identification for Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) Prognostics", "paper_id": "WOS:000266877400004"}
