In this paper, based on the structural information of dimers, the simplest model of aggregation state, classical QSAR, was used for the investigation of the relationship between aggregation state and bioactivity. Aided by the template of crystal structure of Teflubenzuron, two dimer descriptors of Delta E and Delta R-g which could describe parts of the aacyregation state characters were used to establish the models. QSAR research implicates that the bioactivity may strongly depend on the molecular aggregation state.", "paper_title": "Quantitative aggregation - Activity supermolecular view, dimer as the and monomolecule relationship (QAAR): simplest aggregation state", "paper_id": "WOS:000247608400001"}
