We prove that the equality of interpretations in PCoh characterizes the operational indistinguishability of programs in PCF with a random primitive. This is the first result of full abstraction for a semantics of probabilistic PCF. The key ingredient relies on the regularity of power series. Along the way to the theorem, we design a weighted intersection type assignment system giving a logical presentation of PCoh.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Coherence Spaces are Fully Abstract for Probabilistic PCF", "paper_id": "WOS:000331120500027"}
