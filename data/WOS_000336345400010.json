We establish a new generalized Halanay inequality for the asymptotic stability of the zero solution for such systems under more relaxed conditions than the existing ones. We also apply the theoretical results to the analysis of self synchronization in networks of delayed differential systems and obtain a more general sufficient condition for self synchronization.
