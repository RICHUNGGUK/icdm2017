However, providing QoS support is a challenging issue due to highly resource constrained nature of sensor nodes, unreliable wireless links and harsh operation environments. In this paper, we focus on the QoS support at the MAC layer which forms the basis of communication stack and has the ability to tune key QoS-specific parameters, such as duty cycle of the sensor devices. We explore QoS challenges and perspectives for wireless sensor networks, survey the QoS mechanisms and classify the state of the art QoS-aware MAC protocols together with discussing their advantages and disadvantages. According to this survey, we observe that instead of providing deterministic QoS guarantees, majority of the protocols follow a service differentiation approach by classifying the data packets according to their type (or classes) and packets from different classes are treated according to their requirements by tuning the associated network parameters at the MAC layer. Design tradeoffs and open research issues are also investigated to point out the further possible research directions in the field of QoS provisioning in wireless sensor networks at the MAC layer.
