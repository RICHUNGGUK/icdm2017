FastICA is a common offline method to identify artifact and interference from their mixtures such as electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). Therefore, it is valuable to implement FastICA for real-time signal processing. In this paper, the FastICA algorithm is implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), with the ability of real-time sequential mixed signals processing by the proposed pipelined FastICA architecture. Moreover, in order to increase the numbers precision, the hardware floating-point (FP) arithmetic units had been carried out in the hardware FastICA. In addition, the proposed pipeline FastICA provides the high sampling rate (192 kHz) capability by hand coding the hardware FastICA in hardware description language (HDL). To verify the features of the proposed hardware FastICA, simulations are first performed, then real-time signal processing experimental results are presented using the fabricated platform. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented hardware FastICA as expected.", "paper_title": "Implementation of pipelined FastICA on FPGA for real-time blind source separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000256670500004"}
