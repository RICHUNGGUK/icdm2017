However, conventional two-dimensional (2D) and nonsemantic three-dimensional (3D) models cannot handle the topological analysis of 3D objects that is required by BIM, especially with regard to building elements. This article describes a new schema, termed the graph data model (GDM) that can be used to employ semantic information, to extract, analyze, and present the topological relationships among 3D objects in 3D space, and to perform topological queries faster. This GDM uses weighted graph principles for simplicity and incorporates an industry foundation classes (IFC)-based algorithm for automatic deduction of topological relationships. A prototype of GDM is implemented in a C# platform and verified using two types of queries in a case study of a commercial building.", "paper_title": "IFC-Based Graph Data Model for Topological Queries on Building Elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000353891500001"}
