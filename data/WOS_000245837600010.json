An emerging solution is grid technology, which allows organization to make better use of existing computing resources by providing them with a single, transparent, aggregated source of computing power. Equally, bioinformatics analysis often involves many web services, allowing shared access to information and helping the biologist to design, describe, record complex experiments. A new generation of grid infrastructure. where web services are building blocks, allow managent of a web services workflow. This work shows a tool for the identification and functional annotation of 'Conserved Sequence Tags' (CSTs) through cross-species genome comparisons, deployed on a Grid System Architecture, based on Web Services concepts and technologies.
