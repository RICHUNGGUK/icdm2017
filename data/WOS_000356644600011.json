As 2-MCFL5 form a class of languages that is included in both the IO and OI hierarchies, and as O-2 is the group language of a simple presentation of Z(2) we exhibit here the first, to our knowledge, non-virtually-free group language (i.e. non-context-free group language) that is captured by the IO and OI hierarchies. Moreover, it was a long-standing open problem whether MIX was a mildly context sensitive language or not, and it was conjectured that it was not, so we close this conjecture by giving it a negative answer.
