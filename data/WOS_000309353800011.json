This offers great advantages in terms of usability and resource utilization; however, handling a large amount of clients in the most efficient manner poses important challenges. Especially deciding how many clients to handle on one server, and where to execute the user applications at each time is important. Assigning too many users to one server leads to customer dissatisfaction, while assigning too little leads to higher investments costs. We study different aspects to optimize the resource usage and customer satisfaction. The results of the paper indicate that the resource utilization can increase with 29% by applying the proposed optimizations. Up to 36.6% energy can be saved when the size of the online server pool is adapted to the system load by putting redundant hosts into sleep mode.", "paper_title": "Efficient resource management for virtual desktop cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000309353800011"}
