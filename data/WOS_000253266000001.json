For each method, numerical implementation is explicited in addition to convergence arguments and algorithmic complexity. Numerical examples are then given over three state space models: the Kalman filter case, the canonical stochastic volatility model and the infinite dimension explicit filter introduced in [Genon-Catalot, V., 2003, A non linear explicit filter.
