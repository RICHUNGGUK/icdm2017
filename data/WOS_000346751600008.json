It is especially suitable for large-scale network in roaming scenario. With our newly designed group signature scheme as a building block, a timestamp can be embedded to user secret key. No expired key can be used to authenticate, and hence naturally revoked users (e.g., due to contract expiration) are not required to be put into the revocation list. This makes our protocol much faster than previous roaming protocols in terms of revocation checking, which is a main part in verification.", "paper_title": "Time-Bound Anonymous Authentication for Roaming Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000346751600008"}
