This tutorial paper outlines the structure of an interactive DVB-H platform and presents in brief the technical advances of the new specification. It also discusses some interesting scenarios of interactive and non-interactive services which can be directly deployed with the use of the DVB-H technology either as a stand-alone broadcast network or as a complement to existing cellular (2G/3G/WLAN) infrastructures.", "paper_title": "Broadband multimedia on the move with DVB-H", "paper_id": "WOS:000251658600008"}
