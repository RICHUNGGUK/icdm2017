In this paper, based on a recent result on deterministic learning theory, a deterministic framework is proposed for rapid recognition of dynamical patterns. First, it is shown that a time-varying dynamical pattern can be effectively represented in a time-invariant and spatially distributed manner through deterministic learning. Second, a definition for characterizing similarity of dynamical patterns is given based on system dynamics inherently within dynamical patterns. Third, a mechanism for rapid recognition of dynamical patterns is presented, by which a test dynamical pattern is recognized as similar to a training dynamical pattern if state synchronization is achieved according to a kind of internal and dynamical matching on system dynamics. The synchronization errors can be taken as the measure of similarity between the test and training patterns. The significance of the paper is that a completely dynamical approach is proposed, in which the problem of dynamical pattern recognition is turned into the stability and convergence of a recognition error system. Simulation studies are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Deterministic learning and rapid dynamical pattern recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000246423400001"}
