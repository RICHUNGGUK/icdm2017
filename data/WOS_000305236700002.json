In order to solve this problem, P2P reputation systems are proposed to evaluate the trustworthiness of peers and to prevent the selfish, dishonest, and malicious peers' behaviors, which collects local reputation scores and aggregates them into the global reputation. In this paper we propose a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) trust overlay network (DHTON) to model the network structure and the storage of reputation information. We also design a robust and distributing reputation system, DHTrust, which takes full advantage of the DHT to distribute local reputation to trade-off the damage of fake reputation information by genuine reputation information. By using the trust evaluation towards two reputation scores, we can also distinguish and evaluate the fundamental behaviors of peers in the P2P network, i.e. providing service and issuing reputation scores. To adapt to the dynamic P2P networks, we take dynamic node mechanism into account. Our scheme can assure convergence effectiveness and robustness, when nodes enter or leave the system. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of DHTrust. The results show that our system makes significant improvement in convergence speed and aggregation accuracy. Moreover, it is robust to malicious peers.
