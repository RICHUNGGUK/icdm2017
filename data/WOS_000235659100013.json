Up to now how to provide meta modeling support in an XML based data integration has not yet been addressed systematically This paper describes the most distinguished features of meta modeling from the traditional OO modeling and the key issues in the meta modeling enabled XML based data integration applications. Two algorithms: a semantic constraint parsing algorithm and an XML Schema mapping algorithm are discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "Meta modeling approach for XML based data integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100013"}
