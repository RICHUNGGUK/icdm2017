We seek to approximate the solution on a smooth submanifold M subset of Q of dimension 0 <= d(1) <= d. With the right-hand side belonging to C(r)(Q), and the error being measured in the Loo (M) norm, we prove that the nth minimal quantum error is (up to logarithmic factors) of order n(-min((r+2m)/d1.r/d+ 1)). For comparison, in the classical deterministic setting the nth minimal error is known to be of order n(-r/d), for all d(1), while in the classical randomized setting it is (up to logarithmic factors) n(-min((r+2m)/dt,r/d+ 1/2)).
