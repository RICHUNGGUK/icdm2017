We describe an efficient algorithm for computing the highest degree coefficients of the weighted Ehrhart quasi-polynomial for a rational simple polytope in varying dimension, when the weights of the lattice points are given by a polynomial function h. Our technique is based on a refinement of an algorithm of A. Barvinok in the unweighted case (i.e., ha parts per thousand 1). In contrast to Barvinok's method, our method is local, obtains an approximation on the level of generating functions, handles the general weighted case, and provides the coefficients in closed form as step polynomials of the dilation. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we report on computational experiments which show that even our simple implementation can compete with state-of-the-art software.", "paper_title": "Computation of the Highest Coefficients of Weighted Ehrhart Quasi-polynomials of Rational Polyhedra", "paper_id": "WOS:000306433100002"}
