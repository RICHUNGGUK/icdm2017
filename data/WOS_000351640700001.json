To calculate cross citation indicators, papers were retrieved from the WOS database and patent data from the USPTO during the period between 1991 and 2010, resulting in a total of 20,758 papers and 8112 patents. This study shows that there is a gradually increasing convergence between science and technology, particularly of science linkage in recent years. Papers citing patents are more time-sensitive than patents citing papers. Academic institutions are more likely to cite papers and patents published by other academic institutions.
