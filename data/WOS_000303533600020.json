The methodology also permits measurement of the intensity and direction of the regional flows of knowledge in public-private collaborations. The aim is to provide a diagnostic instrument for regional and national policy makers, which could add to existing ones to plan interventions for re-balancing sectorial public supply of knowledge with industrial absorptive capacity, and maximizing appropriability of knowledge spillovers. The methodology is applied to university-industry collaborations in the hard sciences in all Italian administrative regions.", "paper_title": "A bibliometric tool to assess the regional dimension of university-industry research collaborations", "paper_id": "WOS:000303533600020"}
