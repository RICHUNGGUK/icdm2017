PSO methods are popular because they are easy to implement and use, and seem increasingly capable of solving complicated problems without requiring any assumption on the objective function to be optimized. We modify PSO techniques to find minimax optimal designs, which have been notoriously challenging to find to date even for linear models, and show that the PSO methods can readily generate a variety of minimax optimal designs in a novel and interesting way, including adapting the algorithm to generate standardized maximin optimal designs.", "paper_title": "Minimax optimal designs via particle swarm optimization methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000358784100008"}
