The EPR is necessary to support the complex communication tasks of the innovative concept of 'Developmental, Family-Centred, Individual Care of Premature Infants and Newborns' established for the Department of Neonatology at Heidelberg University Hospital. Methods: The data to be documented was analysed and modelled using the five step openEHR data modelling approach (odma). Results: The analysis revealed a total of 1818 items, which could be arranged into 70 clinical concepts. The items and concepts were then mapped to 132 openEHR archetypes. Fifty-eight of these archetypes could be reused either directly or via specialisation. from the existing openEHR archetypes. A further 67 archetypes were newly developed. To combine and constrain archetypes for local settings 16 templates were developed. Conclusion: By using the five step openEHR data modelling approach, semantic interoperability, and a reduced need for repeated documentation of the same data can be realised. This is of major importance within the hospital as well as for trans-institutional data exchange. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
