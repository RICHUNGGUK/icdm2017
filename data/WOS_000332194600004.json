In such studies, subtle changes in signal as the subject moves in the presence of a bias field can be a significant confound for BOLD signal analysis. The proposed method avoids the need for a specific tissue model or assumptions about tissue homogeneity by making use of the multiple views of the underlying bias field provided by the subject's motion. A parametric bias field model is assumed and a regression model is used to estimate the basis function weights of this model. Quantitative evaluation of the effects of motion and noise in motion estimates are performed using simulated data. Results demonstrate the strength and robustness of the new method compared to the state of the art 4D nonparametric bias estimator (N4ITK). We also qualitatively demonstrate the impact of the method on resting state neuroimage analysis of a moving adult brain with simulated motion and bias fields, as well as on in vivo moving fetal fMRI.
