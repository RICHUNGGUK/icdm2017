The proposed method enables artists to create complex and realistic marbling textures that can be used for design purposes. Our algorithm is unique in that the marbling paint on the surface of water is represented as an enclosed contour and is advected by fluid flow to deform the marbling silhouette. In contrast to previous methods, in which the shape is tracked with a concentration density field in Eulerian grids, our approach facilitates greater complexity that is free from grid resolution and per-pixel computation while retaining real-time performance. To forestall the propagation of large vertices, we adaptively resample the contours, exploiting the curvature and the turbulence of the fluid as criteria. At the convection phase, we parallelly advect contour particles on a Graphics Processing Unit (CPU) in addition to applying volume corrections. Finally, we quickly remove extremely thin lines in shapes to remove dozens of vertices. We performed our method with an interactive prototype to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in several scenarios. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
