In our model, agents change behaviours/opinions on the basis of information collected from their neighbours in a time interval of bounded size whereas agents are assumed to have unbounded memory in previously studied scenarios. In our mathematical framework, one is given a network G = (V, E), an integer value t(v) for each node v is an element of V, and a time window size lambda. The goal is to determine a small set of nodes (target set) that influences the whole graph. The spread of influence proceeds in rounds as follows: initially all nodes in the target set are influenced; subsequently, in each round, any uninfluenced node v becomes influenced if the number of its neighbours that have been influenced in the previous rounds is greater than or equal to t(v). We prove that the problem of finding a minimum cardinality target set that influences the whole network G is hard to approximate within a polylogarithmic factor. On the positive side, we design exact polynomial time algorithms for paths, rings, and trees. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
