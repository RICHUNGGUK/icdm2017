Then the simple central-upwind schemes based on central weighted essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions are proposed in this paper for computing the one- and two-dimensional steady and unsteady models. Since the non-uniform width of the different local Riemann fans is calculated more accurately, the central-upwind schemes enjoy a much smaller numerical viscosity as well as the staggering between two neighboring sets of grids is avoided. Synchronously, due to the central-upwind schemes are combined with the fourth-order central weighted essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions, the schemes have the non-oscillatory behavior. The numerical results show the desired accuracy, high-resolution, and robustness of our methods. (c) 2005 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
