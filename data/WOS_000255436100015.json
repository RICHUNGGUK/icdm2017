Similar to LOF, they also aim to find local outliers. However, LDBOD/LDBOD+ detects local outliers from the viewpoint of local distribution, which is characterized through three proposed measurements, local-average-distance, local-density, and local-asymmetry-degree. Several experiments were conducted to demonstrate the advantages of LDBOD/LDBOD+ compared with LOF. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
