The first case has been studied in [Camacho, L.M., Gomez. J.R., Gonzalez, A.J., Omirov, B.A., 2006. Naturally graded 2-filiform Leibniz Algebra and its applications, preprint, MA1-04-X106] and now, we complete the classification of naturally graded quasi-filiform Leibniz algebras. For this purpose we use the software Mathematica (the program used is explained in the last section). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
