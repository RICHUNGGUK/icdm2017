This could lead to a savings in bandwidth for data transmission and storage. In this paper, we apply this idea of Vanstone and Zuccherato for reducing the storage requirement of RSA public moduli to integer factoring based public-key schemes with their moduli of the form p(r)q. More precisely, we explicitly propose two efficient methods for specifying high-order bits of prime factors of their public-keys. We also consider the security of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "The Vanstone-Zuccherato schemes revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700030"}
