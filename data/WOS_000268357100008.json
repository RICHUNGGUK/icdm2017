Existing feature extraction techniques for classification attempt to classify all the classes included. However sometimes it is more important to better recognize certain specific classes rather than to discriminate all the classes. A feature extraction method based on subjective-classification was proposed to discriminate the specific classes, which the classification priority was given subjectively, and each of the other classes was separated at the same time. The method includes data reduction by principal component analysis (PCA), data normalization by whitening transformation and derivation of projecting vectors for subjective-classification, etc. The data in the analysis were collected from PTB diagnostic ECG database. The results show that the proposed method can obtain a small number of effective features from 12-lead ECGs to better classify classes with priority, and the other classes can be classified at the same time.
