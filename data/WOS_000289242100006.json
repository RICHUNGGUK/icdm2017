Known efficient planarization algorithms exist only for restrictive wireless network models: unit-disk graphs with accurately known location information. In this paper, we study efficient planarization of wireless sensor networks, and present a novel planarization method for a more general network model, where sensors can have non-uniform transmission ranges and no location information is needed. Our planarization algorithms also include a (2+epsilon)-approximation algorithm and an FPT algorithm for the bipartite planarization problem.", "paper_title": "On the Planarization of Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289242100006"}
