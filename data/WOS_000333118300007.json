Their structures are simpler than the equivalent inhibition Petri nets. To analyze them, a vector matching method has been given. In this paper a subclass of LPNs is proposed and its properties are analyzed. It can be used to model and simulate e-commerce systems well. Its special structures and relationships among its logical transitions are discussed. Based on them, a reachability tree is constructed and the state equations are used to analyze its properties, that is, reachability, liveness, conservativeness, and reversibility. The proposed analysis method significantly lowers the computational efforts in comparison with the existing method for LPNs.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Application of Logical Petri Nets to E-Commerce Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000333118300007"}
