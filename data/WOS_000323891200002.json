Virtual machine (VM) consolidation, where multiple VMs share a physical host, has seen rapid adoption in practice, with increasingly large numbers of VMs per machine and per CPU core. Our investigations, however, suggest that the increasing degree of VM consolidation has serious negative effects on the VMs' TCP performance. As multiple VMs share a given CPU, the scheduling latencies, which can be in the order of tens of milliseconds, substantially increase the typically submillisecond round-trip times (RTTs) for TCP connections in a datacenter, causing significant degradation in throughput. In this article, we propose a lightweight solution, called vPRO, that (a) offloads the VM's TCP congestion control function to the driver domain to improve TCP transmit performance; and (b) offloads TCP acknowledgment functionality to the driver domain to improve the TCP receive performance. Our evaluation of a vPRO prototype on Xen suggests that vPRO substantially improves TCP receive and transmit throughputs with minimal per-packet CPU overhead. We further show that the higher TCP throughput leads to improvement in application-level performance, via experiments with Apache Olio, a Web 2.0 cloud application, and Intel MPI benchmark.", "paper_title": "Protocol Responsibility Offloading to Improve TCP Throughput in Virtualized Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000323891200002"}
