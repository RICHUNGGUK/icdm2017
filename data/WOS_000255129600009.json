The core of the proposed method is to treat the clustering problem as a weighted clustering problem so as to find better initial cluster centers based on the hierarchical approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach needs less iteration time compared with existing approaches and has better performance in terms of convergence speed and ability to reduce the impact of noises.
