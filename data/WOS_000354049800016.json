It is observed that semantic dependencies naturally exist between features and opinion words, even among features or opinion words themselves. In this article, we employ a corpus statistics association measure to quantify the pairwise word dependencies and propose a generalized association-based unified framework to identify features, including explicit and implicit features, and opinion words from reviews. We first extract explicit features and opinion words via an association-based bootstrapping method (ABOOT). ABOOT starts with a small list of annotated feature seeds and then iteratively recognizes a large number of domain-specific features and opinion words by discovering the corpus statistics association between each pair of words on a given review domain. Two instances of this ABOOT method are evaluated based on two particular association models, likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) and latent semantic analysis (LSA). Next, we introduce a natural extension to identify implicit features by employing the recognized known semantic correlations between features and opinion words. Experimental results illustrate the benefits of the proposed association-based methods for identifying features and opinion words versus benchmark methods.", "paper_title": "An Association-Based Unified Framework for Mining Features and Opinion Words", "paper_id": "WOS:000354049800016"}
