Cascading outages are complex dynamics of power systems, and One cause of them is the interaction between swing, dynamics of synchronous machines and protection operation of relays and circuit breakers. This paper uses hybrid dynamical systems as a mathematical model for cascading outages caused by the interaction. Hybrid dynamical systems can combine families of flows describing swing dynamics with switching rules that are based on protection operation. This paper refers to data on a cascading outage in the September 2003 blackout in Italy and shows a hybrid dynamical system by which propagation of outages reproduced is consistent with the data. This result Suggests that hybrid dynamical systems can provide an effective model for the analysis of cascading outage, in power systems.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Model for Cascading Outage in a Power System: A Numerical Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000265630900024"}
