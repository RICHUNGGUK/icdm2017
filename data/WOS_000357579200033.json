Smart TV devices facilitate the curation of content by combining Internet-based information with content from TV providers. Many techniques, such as those that focus on speech, gestures, and eye movement, have been used to develop various human computer interfaces for Smart TVs. However, as suggested by several researchers, user scenarios and user experiences should be incorporated with development techniques to meet user demands on Smart TVs. Thus, this study applies the service design approach for scenario planning and user experience analysis of multimodal interaction development for Smart TVs. This research begins with the service design process and derives the Quality Function Deployment matrix (QFD Matrix) for initial decision-making. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is then applied to evaluate the priority and relevance of features proposed in the QFD Matrix. Research results show the service design approach is an efficient way for an interdisciplinary team to communicate. The proposed two-stage decision-making processes provide qualitatively analyze and quantitatively measure the priority and relevance of features derived from the service design process. The technique team can then develop prototypes that facilitate multimodal humancomputer interaction on Smart TVs.", "paper_title": "Service Design for Developing Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction for Smart Tvs", "paper_id": "WOS:000357579200033"}
