For remote entanglement preparation, entanglement is necessary. We find that for some shared resources having the same amount of entanglement, when Bell measurement is used, the entanglement remotely prepared can be different, and more discord in the resources actually decreases the entanglement prepared. We also find that for some resources with more entanglement, the entanglement remotely prepared may be less. Therefore, we conclude that entanglement is a necessary resource but may not be the only resource responsible for the entanglement remotely prepared, and discord does not likely to assist this process. Also, for the preparation of discord, we find that some states with no entanglement could outperform entangled states.", "paper_title": "THE IMPACT OF RESOURCE ON REMOTE QUANTUM CORRELATION PREPARATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000380117800008"}
