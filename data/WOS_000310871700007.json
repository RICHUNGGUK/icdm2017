Our pattern class is the simple, but appealing subclass of simple conjunctive queries. Our algorithm, called Conqueror(+), is capable of detecting previously unknown functional and inclusion dependencies that hold on the database relations as well as on joins of relations. These newly detected dependencies are then used to prune redundant queries. We propose an efficient database-oriented implementation of our algorithm using SQL and provide several promising experimental results.", "paper_title": "Mining frequent conjunctive queries in relational databases through dependency discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000310871700007"}
