In the study, fault diagnosis of sensor by chaos particle swarm optimization algorithm and support vector machine is presented in the paper, where chaos particle swarm optimization is chosen to determine the parameters of SVM. Chaos particle swarm optimization is a kind of improved particle swarm optimization, which can not only avoid the search being trapped in local optimum and but also help to search the optimum quickly by using chaos queues. The wireless sensor is employed as research object, and its four fault types including shock, biasing, short circuit and shifting are applied to test the diagnostic ability of CPSO-SVM compared with other diagnostic methods. The diagnostic results show that CPSO-SVM has higher diagnostic accuracy of wireless sensor than PSO-SVM and BP neural network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
