Design/methodology/approach - In order to resolve the inconsistency phenomenon which systematically occurs in the standard SPH method at the domain's boundaries of the studied structure, the classical kernel function and its spatial derivatives were modified by the use of Taylor series expansion. The well-known tensile instabilities inherent to the Eulerian SPH formulation were attenuated by the use of the Total Lagrangian Formulation (TLF). Findings - In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present improved SPH method, several numerical applications involving geometrically nonlinear behaviors were carried out using the explicit dynamics scheme for the time integration of the PDEs. Comparisons of the obtained results using the present SPH model with analytical reference solutions and with those obtained using ABAQUS finite element (FE) commercial software, show its good accuracy and robustness. Practical implications - An additional application including a multilayered composite structure and involving buckling and delamination was investigated using the present improved SPH model and the results are compared to the FE results, they confirmed both the efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed method. Originality/value - An efficient 2D-continuum SPH model for the geometrically nonlinear analysis of thin and thick structures is proposed. Contrarily to the classical SPH approaches, here the constitutive material relations are used to link naturally the stresses and strains. The Total Lagrangian approach is investigated to alleviate the tensile instabilities problem, allowing at the same time to avoid the updating procedure of the neighboring particles search and therefore reducing CPU usage. The proposed approach is valid for isotropic and multilayered composites structures undergoing large transformations. CPU time savings and better results with the new 2D-continuum SPH formulation compared to the classical continuum SPH. The explicit dynamic scheme was used for time integration allowing a fast resolution algorithm even for highly nonlinear problems.", "paper_title": "Geometrically nonlinear analysis of two-dimensional structures using an improved smoothed particle hydrodynamics method", "paper_id": "WOS:000355829900011"}
