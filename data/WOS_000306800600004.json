Pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors are employed in sensing human activities. For capturing the characteristics of human normal and abnormal activities, three modules of a direction-sensitive PIR sensor are organized using a distributed sensing structure. The advantage of using the distributed sensing paradigm is that the synergistic motion patterns of head, upper-limb and lower-limb can be efficiently encoded and thus the more discriminative features can be captured. This is the new consideration of using PIR sensors in building a full detection system. In addition, a two-layer hidden Markov model is developed for recognizing a fall event based on the multidimensional signals of the distributed infrared sensing system. Experimental studies are conducted to validate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Elderly-falling detection using distributed direction-sensitive pyroelectric infrared sensor arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000306800600004"}
