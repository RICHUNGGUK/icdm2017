In this paper a method is proposed to optimal design of microstrip interconnects containing additional discrete coupling capacitors. A suitable error function along with some constrained conditions is defined to determine optimal values of both interconnect parameters and the additional coupling capacitors. The method is verified using a comprehensive example.", "paper_title": "Optimization of microstrip interconnects containing additional capacitive coupling using least mean square method", "paper_id": "WOS:000242269300002"}
