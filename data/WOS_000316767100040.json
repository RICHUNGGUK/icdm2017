Histogram thresholding technique is applied in the formation of all possible cells, used to split the image into multiple homogeneous regions. The merging technique is applied to merge perceptually close homogeneous regions and obtain better initialization for the Fuzzy C-means clustering approach. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed scheme could obtain promising segmentation results, with 12% average improvement in clustering quality and 63% reduction in classification error compared with other existing segmentation approaches.
