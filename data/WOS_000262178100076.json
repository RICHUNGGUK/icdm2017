Thus, it is difficult to obtain covariance matrix from tens thousands of genes within a number of samples. Feature selection and extraction is critical to remove noisy features and reduce the dimensionality in microarray analysis. This study aims to fill the gap by developing a data mining framework with a proposed algorithm for cluster analysis of gene expression data, in which coefficient correlation is employed to arrange genes. Indeed, cluster analysis of microarray data can find coherent patterns of gene expression. The output is displayed as table list for convenient survey. We adopt the breast cancer microarray dataset to demonstrate practical viability of this approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
