To do that, we took 10 common clustering algorithms and tested them over four known datasets, used in the literature as baselines with agreed upon clusters. One additional method, Binary-Positive. developed by our team, was added to the analysis. The results affirm the unpredictable nature of the clustering process, point to different assumptions taken by different methods. One conclusion of the study is to carefully choose the appropriate clustering method for any given application. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
