Transient faults caused by electrical noise or external interference are resulting in soft errors which should be detected online. The effectiveness of the residue codes in the self-checking implementation of the modulo multipliers has been rarely explored. In this paper, an efficient hardware implementation of the self-checking modulo 2(n) + 1 multiplier is proposed based on the residue codes. Different check bases in the form 2(c) -1 or 2(c) + 1 (c is an element of N) are selected for various values of the input operands. In the implementation of the modulo generators and modulo multipliers, novel multiplexor-based compressors are applied for efficient modulo 2(n) + 1 multipliers with less area and lower power consumption. In the final addition stage of the modulo multipliers and modulo generators, efficient sparse-tree-based inverted end around carry adders are used. The proposed architecture is capable of online detecting errors caused by faults on a single gate at a time. The experimental results show that the proposed self-checking modulo 2(n) + 1 multipliers have less area overhead and low performance penalty.", "paper_title": "Efficient Online Self-Checking Modulo 2(n)+1 Multiplier Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000293289500012"}
