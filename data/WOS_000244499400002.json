The state feedback controller is designed via the networked control system (NCS) theory. The stability of the overall fuzzy system using GCNC is also established. Network-induced delay in network transmission and packet dropout are analyzed. Some deductions are also extended to uncertain systems. Simulation results show the validity of the present control scheme.", "paper_title": "Guaranteed cost networked control for T-S fuzzy systems with time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000244499400002"}
