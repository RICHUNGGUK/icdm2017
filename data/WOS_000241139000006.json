We give some heuristic arguments which suggest that there are only about z(1/2+ o(1)) of MNT curves with complex multiplication discriminant up to z. We also show that there are very few finite fields over which elliptic curves with small embedding degree and small complex multiplication discriminant may exist (regardless of the way they are constructed).", "paper_title": "Elliptic curves with low embedding degree", "paper_id": "WOS:000241139000006"}
