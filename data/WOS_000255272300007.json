Instead of using different equations for each problem, all the calculi are based on the equations used to obtain the direct transformation. These equations are also more accurate than previous ones and can be extended to an arbitrary width. This paper also explains how the Gauss-Krger projection may satisfy the needs and requirements of civil engineers as well as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) users, particularly if extended beyond its usual 4 longitudinal range, and therefore can be used as a global reference system for GIS.", "paper_title": "Gauss Kruger projection for areas of wide longitudinal extent", "paper_id": "WOS:000255272300007"}
