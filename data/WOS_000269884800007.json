This paper studies the scheduling and assignment problems that minimize the total energy caused by both instruction processing and switching activities for applications with loops on multi-core, multi-Functional-Unit (multi-FU) architectures. An algorithm, EMPLS (Energy Minimization with Probability using Loop Scheduling), is proposed to minimize the total energy (E) while satisfying timing constraint (L) with guaranteed probability (P). We perform scheduling and assignment simultaneously. Our approach shows better performance than the approaches that consider scheduling and assignment in separate phases. Compared with previous work, our algorithm exhibits significant improvement in total energy reduction.", "paper_title": "Energy-Aware Loop Scheduling and Assignment for Multi-Core, Multi-Functional-Unit Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000269884800007"}
