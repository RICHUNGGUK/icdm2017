We propose a performance evaluation and a comparison methodology. This methodology is applied to a recently introduced class of interconnection networks (Multistage Chordal Ring Based multistage interconnection network). These networks are compared to the well known Omega network of comparable architectural characteristics. The methodology is expected to serve in the evaluation of the use of multistage interconnection networks as an intercommunication medium in today's multi-processor systems. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
