This new setting increases the number of applications in which rough set theory can be used. An important feature of the presented framework is that the user may represent explicit preferences among the objects in a decision system, by associating a particular adjoint triple with any pair of objects. Moreover, we verify mathematical properties of the model, study its relationships to multi-adjoint property-oriented concept lattices and discuss attribute selection in this framework.
