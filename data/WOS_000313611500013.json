Biometric encryption systems based on fuzzy vault scheme are suitable for stand-alone security and authentication devices in the form of system-on-chip (SoC). However, the current fuzzy vault scheme has too many compute-intensive processes to make this feasible for SoC implementation. The most critical but compute-intensive function in the fuzzy vault scheme is the chaff generation which produces noise (chaff) points that hide the valid points inside the vault template. In this paper, we propose a new chaff generation algorithm which is computationally fast and viable for hardware acceleration by employing simple arithmetic operations. Complexity study shows that our algorithm has a complexity of O(n(2)), which is a significant improvement over the existing method that exhibits O(n(3)) complexity. Our experimental results show that, to generate 500 chaff points, the proposed algorithm gives a performance speed-up of over 140 times over existing Clancy's algorithm. With the new chaff generation algorithm, it becomes much more amenable to implement the fuzzy vault scheme in the resource-constrained environment of system-on-chip. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
