To treat the cavitating flow and suppress the possible spurious oscillations in the vicinity of the cavitation boundary, the TVB limiter is used as an indicator to detect the \"troubled cells\" and hence take the advantage of utilizing the WENO reconstruction for the freedoms of the RKDG methods. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the viability of these procedures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
