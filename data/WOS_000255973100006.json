Based on the queuing network theory of human performance [Liu 1996; 1997] and current discoveries in cognitive and neural science, this article extends and applies the Queuing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP [Liu et al. 2006]) to model 32 transcription typing phenomena. The queuing network model of transcription typing offers new insights into the mechanisms of cognition and human-computer interaction. Its value in proactive ergonomics design of user interfaces is illustrated and discussed.", "paper_title": "Queuing network modeling of transcription typing", "paper_id": "WOS:000255973100006"}
