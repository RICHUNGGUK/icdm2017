Unlike results in the nonuniform setting, their result does not provide a continuous trade-off between worst-case hardness and pseudorandomness, nor does it explicitly establish an average-case hardness result. In this paper: We obtain an optimal worst-case to average-case connection for EXP: if EXP not subset of BPTIME(t(n)), then EXP has problems that cannot be solved on a fraction 1/2 + 1/t'(n) of the inputs by BPTIME(t'(n)) algorithms, for t' = t(Omega(1)). We exhibit a PSPACE-complete self-correctible and downward self-reducible problem. This slightly simplifies and strengthens the proof of Impagliazzo and Wigderson, which used a #P-complete problem with these properties. We argue that the results of lmpagliazzo and Wigderson, and the ones in this paper, cannot be proved via \"black-box\" uniform reductions.", "paper_title": "Pseudorandomness and average-case complexity via uniform reductions", "paper_id": "WOS:000252462800002"}
