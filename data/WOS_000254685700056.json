The SDWLS technique, originally developed for second-order variable reconstruction by Mandal and Subramanian (Appl. Numer Math., 2007; DOI: 10.1016/j.apnuin.2007.02.003), is further extended to third-order reconstruction with compact stencils involving only the nearest neighbors. The new schemes are applied to solve a few numerical test examples, involving scalar conservation laws and the system of non-linear gas dynamics equations, in order to study their performance. Significant improvements in solution accuracy have been achieved with the second- and third-order SDWLS reconstruction techniques.
