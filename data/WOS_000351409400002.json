Aiming to find logics that can handle inconsistency and graded truth at once, in this paper we explore the notion of paraconsistent fuzzy logic. We show that degree-preserving fuzzy logics have paraconsistency features and study them as logics of formal inconsistency. We also consider their expansions with additional negation connectives and first-order formalisms and study their paraconsistency properties. Finally, we compare our approach to other paraconsistent logics in the literature.", "paper_title": "Paraconsistency properties in degree-preserving fuzzy logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000351409400002"}
