Numerical tests oil two- and three-dimensional channel flows across a Step using this boundary condition oil the bottom wall are performed. The influence of the friction parameter oil the flow field is Studied and the results are explained according to the physics of the flow. Due to the stretching and tilting of vortices, the three-dimensional results differ in many respects from the two-dimensional ones.
