Even- or odd-degree characteristics with symmetrically or asymmetricaly prescribed attenuation poles and group-delay equalization pairs may be generated using this recursive method, from which a normalized coupling matrix may be synthesized for a singly terminated network, followed by its reduction into folded form, which can then be used to realize high-pass filter in RF technology. Denormalization of the coupling matrix enables us to obtain an actual coupling matrix, which will have elements representing the coupling coefficients between resonators. This technique can be used in the design of high-pass filters for high-frequency applications.
