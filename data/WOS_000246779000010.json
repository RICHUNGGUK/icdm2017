A real-life set of data is employed. Design/methodology/approach - After a practical problem is presented in the first section, the paper focuses on the grey systems method of evaluation in the second section. As an application, it employs the method established in the second section to finish evaluating the proposed national economic strength. Findings - Through a detailed analysis, all necessary questions, such as the national standing among nations with similar economic and political backgrounds and main factors influencing national economic strength, are answered definitely. Practical implications - This work can be directly applied to similar situations with evaluation components. Originality/value - This work shows how the theory of grey information can be applied in a great range of areas.", "paper_title": "National economic strength evaluated using grey systems theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000246779000010"}
