The system integrated with agent and Semantic Web technologies to provide tourist information for the tourist. The tourist's geographical information is gathered by GPS receiver. The GPS Agent migrates to the tourist information center and retrieves the related tourist information with respect to the user's location. We defined an upper-level travel ontology by using Web Ontology Language (OWL). By using such system, tourists could browse the relevant information based on their interest and location.", "paper_title": "iJADE FreeWalker: An ontology-based tourist guiding", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600083"}
