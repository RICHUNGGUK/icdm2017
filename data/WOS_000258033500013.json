A cooperative wireless communication system (CW,CS) is proposed to follow the same principle, aiming at improving the overall performance of a wireless system with the support of advanced beam-hopping techniques. In this article, we propose a multiloop radio resource management mechanism for the CWCS based on the organized beam-hopping (OBH) technique. The proposed RRM mechanism enhances the robustness of the CWCS, based on the OBH technique working with fast temporal-spatial variant traffic. The results show that the system performance can be further improved by hybrid transmission and event-driven access management techniques.", "paper_title": "Radio resource management for cooperative wireless communication systems with organized beam-hopping techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000258033500013"}
