The existence and uniqueness for solutions of the class of equation systems have not been investigated yet. In this paper, we present a solution to the class of partial differential-integral equation system via the Markov skeleton process theory and then obtain the existence of the solutions to such equation systems. Furthermore, we prove that the solution is the minimal nonnegative solution of a linear equation system.", "paper_title": "MARKOV SKELETON PROCESS APPROACH TO A CLASS OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL-INTEGRAL EQUATION SYSTEMS ARISING IN OPERATIONS RESEARCH", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500013"}
