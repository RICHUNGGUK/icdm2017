Based on cut metric on graphs proposed by Boykov and Kolmogorov, an NBBGC method is devised to compute the local minimization of GAC. An extension to an iterative manner, namely, INBBGC, is developed for less sensitivity to the initial curve. The INBBGC method is similar to graph-cuts-based active contour (GCBAC) presented by Xu et al., and their differences have been analyzed and discussed. We then integrate the region force into GAC. An improved INBBGC (IINBBGC) method is proposed to optimize the GACWRF model, thus can effectively deal with the concave region and complicated real-world images segmentation. Two region force models such as mean and probability models are studied. Therefore, the GCBAC method can be regarded as the special case of our proposed IINBBGC method without region force. Our proposed algorithm has been also analyzed to be similar to the Grabcut method when the Gaussian mixture model region force is adopted, and the band region is extended to the whole image. Thus, our proposed IINBBGC method can be regarded as narrow-band-based Grabcut method or GCBAC with region force method. We apply our proposed IINBBGC algorithm on synthetic and real-world images to emphasize its performance, compared with other segmentation methods, such as GCBAC and Grabcut methods.", "paper_title": "Iterative Narrowband-Based Graph Cuts Optimization for Geodesic Active Contours With Region Forces (GACWRF)", "paper_id": "WOS:000298325500024"}
