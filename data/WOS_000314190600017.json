In this paper, we utilize extended Petri net to address the issue of modeling and verifying system with probability and nondeterminism besides function aspects. Using probabilistic Petri net as reference, we propose a new mixed model NPPN (Nondeterministic Probabilistic Petri Net) system, which can model and verify systems with qualitative and quantitative behaviours. Then we develop a kind of process algebra for NPPN system to interpret its algebraic semantics, and an action-based PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic) to interpret its logical semantics. Afterwards we present the rules for compositional operation of NPPN system based on NPPN system process algebra, and the model checking algorithm based on the action-based PCTL. In order to put the NPPN system into practice, we develop a friendly and visual tool for modeling, analyzing, simulating, and verifying NPPN system using action-based PCTL. The usefulness and effectiveness of the NPPN system are illustrated by modeling and model checking an elaborate model of travel arrangements workflow.", "paper_title": "Nondeterministic Probabilistic Petri Net - A New Method to Study Qualitative and Quantitative Behaviors of System", "paper_id": "WOS:000314190600017"}
