The medium access control being the main source of energy wastage, energy-efficiency has always been kept in mind while designing the communication stack embedded in spread sensors. Especially, versatile protocols have emerged to offer a suitable solution over multiple deployment characteristics. In this study, we observe to what extent versatility applies to dynamic scenarios in which communications do not respect specific communication paradigms. We first provide a performance evaluation of two well-reputed versatile protocols (B-MAC (Polastre et al., 2004[17]) and X-MAC (Buettner et al., 2006 [4])) under the conditions of such a scenario. The obtained results convinced us to propose more than versatility and pre-configured solutions, that is auto-adaptation. We then introduce the main contribution of this paper, an auto-adaptive algorithm that allows one to adjust the previously mentioned protocols while the network is operating. We analyze to what extent it outperforms the previously obtained results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
