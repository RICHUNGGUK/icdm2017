To meet these challenges, we propose two novel complex spreading code sets. For this purpose, a cost function is defined as the ratio of the power leaked to the adjacent primary band to the power transmitted to the band allowed for CR operation. The cost function is shown to be convertible to a trace ratio problem. The two complex spreading code sets are determined by deploying two different standard solutions. The first is the conventional but approximate solution based on generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) method, and the other is an iterative algorithm that converges to the optimal solution and hence outperforms the GEVD based solution. Simulation results show that by a slight decrease in number of users, the code set yielded by iterative algorithm suppresses the leaked power to almost zero. The applicability of the proposed code sets in different scenarios is discussed.
