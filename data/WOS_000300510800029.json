We have enforced our bases to have the shortest possible support subject to some design constraints to maximize efficiency. While the resulting snakes are versatile enough to provide a good approximation of any closed curve in the plane, their most important feature is the fact that they admit ellipses within their span. Thus, they can perfectly generate circular and elliptical shapes. These features are appropriate to delineate cross sections of cylindrical-like conduits and to outline bloblike objects. We address the implementation details and illustrate the capabilities of our snake with synthetic and real data.", "paper_title": "Snakes With an Ellipse-Reproducing Property", "paper_id": "WOS:000300510800029"}
