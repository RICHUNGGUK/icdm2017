The measured output current DC level can be up to 100 mA with oscillation frequency tunable from 150 to 660 MHz while the modulated amplitude up to 100 mA peak to peak, respectively. The current switching parameters about rising time tr is measured as 0.64 ns whereas the falling time tf as 0.58 ns. Besides, the activated or disable of built in HFM circuitry can be controlled through control signal. The novel LDD has been simulated and fabricated using TSMC 5 V 0.35 mu m CMOS technology with overall chip size of 0.783 mm(2). Experimental results have successfully proven the characteristics of this design and exhibited the capability to satisfy the wide tunable oscillated frequency and modulated swing which is suitable for low noise requirement of CD/DVD-Dual/RAM read mode operation.", "paper_title": "A high frequency and amplitude modulated CMOS laser diode driver for low noise readout applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000363940900009"}
