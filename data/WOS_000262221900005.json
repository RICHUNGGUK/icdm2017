The problem cannot be solved by extending the 2-D wavelet coefficients weighting method directly and then applying the result to 3-D wavelet coefficients, since this approach does not consider the complicated pixel connectivity that results from the lifting-based MCTF process. In this paper, we propose a novel weighting method, which takes account of the pixel connectivity, to solve the problem and derive the effect of the quantization error of a subband on the reconstruction error of a group of pictures. We employ the proposed method on a 2-D + t structure with different temporal filters, namely the 5-3 filter and the 9-7 filter. Experiments on various coding parameters and sequences show that the proposed approach improves the bit-allocation performance over that obtained by using the weightings derived without considering the pixel connectivity in the MCTF process.", "paper_title": "Subband Weighting With Pixel Connectivity for 3-D Wavelet Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000262221900005"}
