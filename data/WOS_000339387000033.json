It requires seamless integration of different parts of two or more images into a single image. Existing image composition techniques only change the local contents of the resulting image while in many cases local changes may also require some global effects as well. For example, if the image of sun from one image is transferred to another image, the global brightness pattern should also be transferred. Unfortunately existing techniques cannot handle global effects of local content manipulations. This paper describes a novel image composition technique which captures global effects associated with a specific local content from one image and incorporates in the second image. In our proposed technique, all images are transformed to the frequency domain. The composite image is created in frequency domain by mixing different frequencies from multiple images and then transformed back to the spatial domain. We have experimented the proposed technique to shift the image of sun along with its global brightness pattern, the global effects of rain and also for transferring global texture pattern from one image to the other. In most of the cases the results produced by our algorithm appear far close to real images than state of the art existing image composition techniques.", "paper_title": "An image composition algorithm for handling global visual effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387000033"}
