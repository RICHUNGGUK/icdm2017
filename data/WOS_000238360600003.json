In this paper, the effect of explicit filtering on the numerical error related to the spatial discretization of the convection term and the exact SGS term is studied a priori in the turbulent fully developed channel flow. As the filter width is increased the grid resolution is kept constant. Also filtering in the inhomogeneous wall-normal direction is discussed. The main conclusions are related to two approaches to explicit filtering. In the traditional approach, the whole velocity field is filtered explicitly while in the alternative approach, only the non-linear convection term of the Navier-Stokes equations is filtered explicitly. Based on the results presented in the paper it seems that the first approach leads to an unphysical situation. However, the later approach works in the desired way, and the numerical error becomes clearly smaller than the SGS term. The main difference between the two approaches seems to be the interpretation of the resolved non-linear term in the filtered Navier-Stokes equations.
