We study the large-sample asymptotic behavior of the total power-weighted length of the ONG on uniform random points in (0, 1)(d). In particular, for d = 1 and weight exponent alpha > 1/2, the limiting distribution of the centered total weight is characterized by a distributional fixed-point equation. As an ancillary result, we give exact expressions for the expectation and variance of the standard nearest-neighbor (directed) graph on uniform random points in the unit interval.
