Steps for developing the item pool are described. Students from one major university in the south- eastern US were recruited. The sample (n = 440) was randomly split into equivalent halves for an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The EFA showed that the wHITBI items were loaded in a way consistent with the four theoretical constructs: perceived benefits, concerns of HIV risk, perceived stigma, and availability/ accessibility. CFA using LISREL 8.7 confirmed the structure of the inventory indicated by good model- fit indices (chi(2)/d.f. = 1.79; root mean square error of approximation = .06; non- normed fit index =. 89; comparative fit index =. 90; incremental fit index =. 91; root mean square =. 07), with all factors loaded significantly (p < .001). The composite reliability ranged from .67 to .76. The results also showed that these scales can distinguish well among HIV-tested and never-tested students. The validated wHITBI has implications on future applications for the development and evaluation of HIV prevention and education programs delivered via the Internet.", "paper_title": "The structure of a web-based HIV testing belief inventory (wHITBI) for college students: The evidence of construct validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000248007000001"}
