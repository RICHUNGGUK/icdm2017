Design/methodology/approach - The study presents both a statistical descriptive analysis of document type, subject areas, authors, source titles, publication years, languages, countries and keywords of publications extracted from the WOS database, as well as a thorough content analysis of keywords and abstracts extracted from the WOS database. Findings - The main results suggest that the term information literacy has various characteristics in an additional and interesting context: health and medicine. This finding may reflect a tendency of association between information literacy and health and medicine and stresses people's need for information literacy in this specific context. Originality/value - The current study emphasises the notion that information literacy is no longer an issue for librarians or educators only.", "paper_title": "Information literacy in the professional literature: an exploratory analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000280509400003"}
