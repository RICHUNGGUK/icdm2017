Further flexibility of demand and supply quantity should also be taken into account. Moreover the fuzzy goal about total transportation cost is considered in place of minimizing the total transportation cost directly. So we consider two criteria. One is to maximize the minimal satisfaction degree with respect to the flexibility and fuzzy goal. The other is to maximize the minimal satisfaction degree among routes used in transportation. But usually there exists no solution that optimizes both objectives at a time. So we seek some non-dominated solutions after defining a non-domination.", "paper_title": "Transportation problems on a fuzzy network", "paper_id": "WOS:000255957800010"}
