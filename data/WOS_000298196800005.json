For that purpose, the use of optimization algorithms, where the objective function is evaluated using a reservoir simulator, is needed. Furthermore, for complex reservoir geologies with high heterogeneities, the optimization problem requires algorithms able to cope with the non-regularity of the objective function. In this paper, we propose an optimization methodology for determining optimal well locations and trajectories based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) which is recognized as one of the most powerful derivative-free optimizers for continuous optimization. In addition, to improve the optimization procedure, two new techniques are proposed: (a) adaptive penalization with rejection in order to handle well placement constraints and (b) incorporation of a meta-model, based on locally weighted regression, into CMA-ES, using an approximate stochastic ranking procedure, in order to reduce the number of reservoir simulations required to evaluate the objective function. The approach is applied to the PUNQ-S3 case and compared with a genetic algorithm (GA) incorporating the Genocop III technique for handling constraints. To allow a fair comparison, both algorithms are used without parameter tuning on the problem, and standard settings are used for the GA and default settings for CMA-ES. It is shown that our new approach outperforms the genetic algorithm: It leads in general to both a higher net present value and a significant reduction in the number of reservoir simulations needed to reach a good well configuration. Moreover, coupling CMA-ES with a meta-model leads to further improvement, which was around 20% for the synthetic case in this study.", "paper_title": "Well placement optimization with the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and meta-models", "paper_id": "WOS:000298196800005"}
