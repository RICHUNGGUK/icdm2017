The CYBERLEGs Alpha-Prosthesis is part of the CYBERLEGs FP7-ICT project, which combines a prosthesis system to replace a lost limb in parallel with an exoskeleton to assist the sound leg, and sensory array to control both systems. The prosthesis attempts to produce a natural level ground walking gait that approximates the joint torques and kinematics of a non-amputee while maintaining compliant joints, which has the potential to decrease impulsive losses, and ultimately reduce the end user energy consumption. This first prototype consists of a passive knee and an active ankle which are energetically coupled to reduce the total power consumption of the device. Here we present simulations of the actuation system of the ankle and the passive behavior of the knee module with and without the energy transfer effects, the mechanical design of the prosthesis, and empirical results from testing of the physical device with amputee subjects.
