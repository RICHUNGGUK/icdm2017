The joint source-channel coding theorem reveals the existence of a code for the pair of the source and the channel under the condition that the error probability is smaller than or equal to epsilon asymptotically. The separation theorem guarantees that we can achieve the optimal coding performance by using the two-stage coding. In the case that epsilon = 0, Han showed the joint source-channel coding theorem and the separation theorem for general sources and channels. Furthermore the epsilon-coding theorem (0 <= epsilon < 1) in the similar setting was studied. However, the separation theorem was not revealed since it is difficult in general. So we consider the separation theorem in this setting.", "paper_title": "On the Condition of epsilon-Transmissible Joint Source-Channel Coding for General Sources and General Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773700040"}
