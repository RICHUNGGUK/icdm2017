Using self-reported data from a primarily US-based sample, analysed elements of the online gambling site stimulus included high and low task-relevant cues, financial trust, and gambling value. Demographic characteristics were found to moderate the relationship between the stimulus and internal satisfaction, with demographic group differences found among all stimulus constructs. Results emphasise the significant role that atmospherics and functional qualities play in generating positive behaviours from online gamblers, with additional implications in marketplace competitiveness and in responsible gambling practices.", "paper_title": "Impact of virtual atmospherics and functional qualities on the online gambler's experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000359603100006"}
