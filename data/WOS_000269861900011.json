However, the multi-criteria and imprecise nature of the fire safety attributes in buildings has caused difficulties in quantifying the fire safety level. Further to the previous works, the author presented a fuzzy synthetic evaluation system for computing the fire risk ranking of buildings. It could serve for multi-level fire safety assessment framework. Linguistic terms were adopted instead of subjective numerical values. A two-level evaluation model, including fuzzy optimal classification model and linear weighted mean model, was developed to facilitate the synthetic process. A case of fire safety ranking in high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong was presented for illustration purpose. The evaluation result was analyzed by the maximum membership degree principle method.", "paper_title": "On the use of fuzzy synthetic evaluation and optimal classification for computing fire risk ranking of buildings", "paper_id": "WOS:000269861900011"}
