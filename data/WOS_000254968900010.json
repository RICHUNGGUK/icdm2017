It is an example of integration of many of the innovative features that this grid infrastructure offers. The application itself simulates and visualizes the evolution of the plasma inside a stellarator fusion device. The followed approach implies the simulation of a great number of trajectories of particles, whose positions are calculated among a large number of nodes in the Grid. The graphical interface allows the user to see and modify the physical and computational parameters of the simulation interactively, making this application a valuable tool for researchers in plasma physics.", "paper_title": "Fusion plasma simulation in the interactive grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000254968900010"}
