Our strategy is based on a \"micro-macro\" decomposition, which leads to a system of equations that couple the macroscopic evolution (diffusion) to a microscopic kinetic contribution for the fluctuations. A semi-implicit discretization provides a numerical scheme which is stable with respect to the small parameter e (mean free path) and which possesses the following properties: (i) it enjoys the asymptotic preserving property in the diffusive limit; (ii) it recovers a standard discretization of the Wigner-Poisson equation in the collisionless regime. Numerical experiments confirm the good behavior of the numerical scheme in both regimes. The case of a spatially dependent e(x) is also investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
