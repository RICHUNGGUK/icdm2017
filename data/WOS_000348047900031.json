In order to map data with higher priority onto the most significant bits of QAM constellation points, a priority sorting method categorizes different data partitions according to the unequal importance factor of encoded video data in one group of pictures by evaluated the average distortion. Then we propose a hierarchical quadrature amplitude modulation arrangement with adaptive constellation distances, which takes into account the unequal importance of encoded video data and the channel status. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the received video quality by about 2 dB in PSNR comparing with the state-of-the-art unequal error protection scheme, and outperforms EEP scheme by up to 5 dB when the average channel SNR is low.", "paper_title": "Priority-based Unequal Error Protection Scheme of Data partitioned H.264 video with Hierarchical QAM", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047900031"}
