In this paper, we propose a new parallel debugging environment based on grid services, which support the information sharing and resource interoperation. Some new debugging functionalities oriented to Grid applications are appended. The architecture of the proposed debugging environment has high portability and scalability.", "paper_title": "Grid service based parallel debugging environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100135"}
