Indeed, regulators or decision makers have to carry out difficult tasks, which involves the assistance of a decision support system (DSS). The current paper presents the main part of this DSS, i.e. a regulation strategy generator and evaluator. Thus, a new hybrid approach is proposed using a fuzzy logic and evolutionary algorithm. It treats the regulation problem as an optimization one and provides the regulator with classified effective decisions by taking into account his/her preferences.", "paper_title": "A novel approach to developing and evaluating regulation strategies for urban transport disrupted networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000257069100013"}
