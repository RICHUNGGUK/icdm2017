They are either stand alone or connected to a fixed infrastructure such as 3G. They are useful in situations such as natural disasters, and their use is gaining more and more momentum. This paper proposes a framework for service provisioning in stand-alone MANETs. It focuses on the invocation and execution phases of the service life cycle. The framework is based on SIP servlets and comprises a novel business model and an overlay network. The business model enables service invocation and execution. The overlay network is used for service execution and is based on a distributed SIP servlets engine. Validation aspects are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
