An upwind discretization of the equations that include the turbulent term is carried out. A method to reduce the excess of numerical viscosity (or diffusion) produced by the upwinding of the flux term is proposed. Two different discretizations of the turbulent term are compared, and results for uniform distributions of the viscosity are presented. Finally, two discretizations of the time derivative which are more efficient than Euler's are proposed and compared.
