In addition to being very efficient in logic execution, the proposed filter restores corrupted images with 1-99% levels of salt-and-pepper impulse noise to satisfactory ones. Without any iteration for noise detection, it intuitively and simply recognizes impulse noises, while keeping the others intact as nonnoises. Depending on different noise ratios at an image, two different sets of masked pixels are employed separately for the adoption of candidates for median finding. Furthermore, no limit to the size of mask windows assures that a proper median can be found. The simple logic of the proposed algorithm achieves significant milestones on the fidelity of a restored image. Moreover, the very fast execution speed of the proposed filter is very suitable for being applied to real-time processing. Relevant experimental results on subjective visualization and objective digital measure are reported to validate the robustness of the proposed filter. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
