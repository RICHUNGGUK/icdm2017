The identification procedure is done into two consecutive steps: In the first step, the physical parameters of the gyroscope (stiffness, damping, and actuator parameters) are estimated via continuous time Extended and Unscented Kalman filter. In the second step, a separate Kalman filter is dedicated to estimate the time varying rotation rate, using the output of the first step. Using numerical simulations, it is found that by introducing an artificial noise in the observer equations and tuning its variance, arbitrary temporal variation of angular velocity can be well tracked by the proposed observer.
