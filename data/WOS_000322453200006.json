Due to their open environment, the P2Ps usually employ reputation systems to provide guidance in selecting trustworthy resource providers for high reliability and security; however, node collusion impairs the effectiveness of reputation systems in trustworthy node selection. Although some reputation systems have certain mechanisms to counter collusion, the effectiveness of the mechanisms is not sufficiently high. In this paper, we leverage social networks to enhance the capability of reputation systems in combating collusion. We first analyzed real trace of the reputation system in the Overstock online auction platform, which incorporates a social network. The analysis reveals the impact of the social network on user purchasing and reputation rating patterns. We, thus, identified suspicious collusion behavior patterns and propose a social network-based mechanism, SocialTrust, to counter collusion. SocialTrust adaptively adjusts the weight of ratings based on the social distance and interest relationship between peers. Experiment results show that SocialTrust can significantly strengthen the capability of current reputation systems in combating collusion.", "paper_title": "Leveraging Social Networks to Combat Collusion in Reputation Systems for Peer-to-Peer Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322453200006"}
