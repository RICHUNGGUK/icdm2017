We apply the methodology on a two-dimensional flow over a cavity with smoothed corners. Instead of the full flow field obtained from, for example a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), we use a reduced model based on global modes to obtain the aeroacoustic sources. Global modes are eigenmodes to the Navier-Stokes equations, linearized about a steady base flow. In a reduced model the perturbations from a steady state are approximated by a linear combination of the eigenmodes. The time dependence is determined by the corresponding eigenvalues. Curie's equation is used to calculate the acoustic field, and by studying the source terms in Curie's equation, mechanisms for sources of sound are identified. Results of acoustic pressure in the far-field and source strengths for different superpositions of eigenmodes are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
