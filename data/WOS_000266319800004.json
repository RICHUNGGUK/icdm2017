In this paper, we propose a new approach to improve Web services performance. Focusing on avoiding traditional XML parsing and Java reflection at runtime, this paper develops a service-specific SOAP Processor to accelerate execution. Moreover, SOAP Processor embeds several cache implementations and uses a novel adaptive cache mechanism, which can choose an optimized cache implementation dynamically in the runtime. Through our experiments in this paper, we observed that our approach can achieve a huge performance gain by incorporating the SOAP Processor into the SOAP engine.
