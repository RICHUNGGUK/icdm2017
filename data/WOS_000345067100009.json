However, a major limiting factor to implementing on-chip inductive DC-DC converters is the large area overhead induced by spiral inductors. Thus, we propose using through-silicon-vias (TSVs), a critical enabling technique in three-dimensional (3D) integrated systems, to implement on-chip inductors for DC-DC converters. While existing literature show that TSV inductors are inferior compared with conventional spiral inductors due to substrate loss for RF applications, in this article, we demonstrate that it is not the case for DC-DC converters, which operate at relatively low frequencies. Experimental results show that by replacing conventional spiral inductors with TSV inductors, with almost the same efficiency and output voltage, up to 4.3x and 3.2x inductor area reduction can be achieved for the single-phase buck converter and the interleaved buck converter with magnetic coupling, respectively.", "paper_title": "Novel Through-Silicon-Via Inductor-Based On-Chip DC-DC Converter Designs in 3D ICs", "paper_id": "WOS:000345067100009"}
