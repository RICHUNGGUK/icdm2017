The objective of this study was to develop a subject-specific model of the knee that is kinematically driven to predict the forces in the major ligaments at high flexion angles. The geometry of the femur, tibia, and fibula and the load-elongation curves representing the structural properties of the ACL, PCL, LCL, and MCL served as inputs to the model, which represented each ligament as a nonlinear elastic spring. To drive the model, kinematic data was obtained while loads were applied to the same cadaveric knee at four flexion angles. The force in each ligament during the recorded kinematic data allowed an optimization procedure to determine the location of the ligament attachment sites on each bone and their reference lengths. The optimization procedure could successfully minimize the differences between the experimental and predicted forces only when the kinematics at 90A degrees, 120A degrees, and 140A degrees of flexion were utilized. This finding suggests that the ligaments at the knee function differently at high-flexion angles compared to low flexion angles and separate models must be used to examine each range of motion. In the future, the novel experimental and computational methodology will be used to construct additional models and additional knee kinematics will be input to help elucidate mechanisms of injury during tasks performed in kneeling or squatting postures.", "paper_title": "Development of a subject-specific model to predict the forces in the knee ligaments at high flexion angles", "paper_id": "WOS:000282830000002"}
