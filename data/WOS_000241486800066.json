Usually this is done by selecting two frames from the sequence and fixing the length of their base-line. In this paper a quality measure, that is based on the uncertainty of the reconstructed scene points, for the selection of such a stable image pair is proposed. Based on this quality measure a fully automatic initialization phase for simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms is derived. The proposed algorithm runs in real-time and some results for synthetic as well as real image sequences are shown.", "paper_title": "Determining an initial image pair for fixing the scale of a 3d reconstruction from an image sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000241486800066"}
