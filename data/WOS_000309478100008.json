It is particularly useful for capturing moment-to-moment changes with regard to a state space defined by two orthogonal axes, as in studies involving the interpersonal circumplex or the mood circumplex. A joystick monitoring program (free, downloadable, executable software available at www.wlu.ca/science/psadler) is used. While watching a recorded interaction displayed on the computer screen, an observer moves the joystick to indicate a target person's moment-to-moment behavior, and the X-Y coordinates are written frequently (e.g., twice per second) to a data file. The authors describe the software and the nature of the data obtained. The authors also suggest possible applications, such as studying subtle patterns of interpersonal behavior during interactions and studying individual differences in the perception of moment-to-moment variations in a target person's affect.", "paper_title": "Capturing the Stream of Behavior: A Computer-Joystick Method for Coding Interpersonal Behavior Continuously Over Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000309478100008"}
