The ability to provide seamless and adaptive QoS guarantees is key to the success of 4C systems. This paper proposes the novel concept of the elastic security QoS provisioning and the autonomous context transfer scheme in the future wireless networks, taking into account the specific requirements for highly dynamic vehicular users. We designed Mobile Manager that can make the autonomous and user transparent decision for the context-aware secure handover. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed security mechanism, we also analyze the performance of our handover scheme by using the multi-class queuing network model. Our scheme can obtain the performance improvement of seamless security services and can be used as an intelligent add-on model to existing networking systems like mobile networks for telematics applications and home networks for efficient mobility-aware applications.", "paper_title": "Elastic security QoS provisioning for telematics applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000236882500010"}
