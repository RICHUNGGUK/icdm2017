A Sturmian word sa,. is also defined as a coding over a two- letter alphabet of the orbit of point. under the action of the irrational rotation R alpha : x -> x + a ( mod 1). A substitution fixes a Sturmian word if and only if it is invertible. The main object of the present paper is to investigate Rauzy fractals associated with two- letter invertible substitutions. As an application, we give an alternative geometric proof of Yasutomi's characterization of all pairs ( a, p) such that s(alpha,p) is a fixed point of some non- trivial substitution.", "paper_title": "On substitution invariant sturmian words: An application of rauzy fractals", "paper_id": "WOS:000249978900006"}
