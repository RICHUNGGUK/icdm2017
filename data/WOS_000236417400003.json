In [J. Comput. Phys. 164 (2000) 228-237], Scardovelli and Zaleski presented analytical relations connecting linear interfaces and volume fractions in rectangular grids. Here, we present analytical relations connecting linear interfaces and volume fractions in triangular and tetrahedral grids. For computing the volume of fluid in an arbitrary polygonal or polyhedral fluid element, we also cite some of the most efficient formulas for polygon area and polyhedron volume computations. Simple test cases show that this analytic method of interface reconstruction is about 18 times faster than an iterative method in two dimensions, and four to six times faster in three dimensions. The results can be in general applied to other fields as well. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
