To detect features for localization, 2D laser range-finders traditionally scan a plane parallel to the floor. This work hypothesizes the existence of a \"low frequency cross-section\" of the 3D Workspace where cluttered and dynamic environments become \"more regular\" and \"less dynamic\". The contribution of the article is twofold. First, an \"unevenness index\" U is introduced to quantitatively measure the complexity of the environment as it would be perceived if the laser range-finder were located at different heights from the floor. The article shows that, by choosing the laser scanning plane to statistically minimize U (in most cases, above the heads of people), it is possible to deal more efficiently with non-linearities in the measurement model, moving objects and occluded features. Second, it is demonstrated that, when adopting an extended Kalman filter for position tracking (a very common and widely used technique in real-world scenarios), the a posteriori covariance of the estimated robot pose converges faster, on average, when U is lower, which leads to better localization performance. Experimental results show hours of continuous robot operation in real-world, cluttered and crowded environments.", "paper_title": "How the Location of the Range Sensor Affects EKF-based Localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000310432300004"}
