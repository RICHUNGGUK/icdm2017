The computational intensity and model accessibility of the coupled models are addressed in this paper. Multithreaded programming is used to improve the computational efficiency. As a result, the total running time of the coupled models is reduced by 80%, from one hour for a sequential run to twelve minutes with an eight-core desktop machine, running the model in parallel. To make the coupled models publicly accessible, a web-based application of the coupled models is implemented in the Hadoop-based cloud computing environment, which allows users to access and execute the model simultaneously without an increase in latency. This study presents a case of cyberinfrastructure design for complex watershed management problems, especially to parallelize computational models and provide model accessibility with user scalability.
