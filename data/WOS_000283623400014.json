Because the electrostatic atomization includes large deformation of a drop of water, it is difficult to analyze with conventional fluid analysis methods such as the finite differences method, the finite element method (FEM) and so on. Design/methodology/approach - In this method, electrostatic field equation is coupled with Navier-Stokes equation of a drop of water, employing the moving particle semi-implicit method and FEM. The validity of the method is verified through the measurement. Findings - It was found that the difference between calculated and measured results becomes large as the voltage increases. Research limitations/implications - In order to improve the accuracy, it is necessary to improve the way to calculate surface tension and the analysis condition. Originality/value - This paper confirms the usefulness of the numerical method to elucidate electrostatic atomization.", "paper_title": "Analysis method of negative ion by electrostatic atomization", "paper_id": "WOS:000283623400014"}
