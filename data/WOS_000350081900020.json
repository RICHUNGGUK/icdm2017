In this paper, a Genetic Programming framework that addresses the electoral redistricting problem is proposed. The method uses new genetic operators, called geometric semantic genetic operators, that employ semantic information directly in the evolutionary search process with the objective of improving its optimization ability. The system is compared to several different redistricting techniques, including evolutionary and non-evolutionary methods. The simulations were made on ten real data-sets and, even though the studied problem does not belong to the classes of problems for which geometric semantic operators induce a unimodal fitness landscape, the results we present demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.
