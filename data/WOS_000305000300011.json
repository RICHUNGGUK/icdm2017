The user's effort is reduced to placing only a single click where a cut is desired. Such a simple interface is made possible by a directional search strategy supported by a concavity-aware harmonic field and a robust voting scheme that selects the best isoline as the cut. With a concavity-aware weighting scheme, the harmonic fields gather dense isolines along concave regions which are natural boundaries of semantic components. The voting scheme relies on an isoline-face scoring mechanism that considers both shape geometry and user intent. We show by extensive experiments and quantitative analysis that our tool advances the state-of-the-art segmentation methods in both simplicity of use and segmentation quality.", "paper_title": "Dot Scissor: A Single-Click Interface for Mesh Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000305000300011"}
