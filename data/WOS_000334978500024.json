This study considers a CID translation strategy and proposes two CID-translated forwarding schemes for IEEE 802.16 multi-hop relay networks. The basic CID-translated forwarding scheme does not require to append the relay MAC header of the tunnel-based scheme to the broadcast messages. The enhanced CID-translated forwarding scheme further divides a broadcast message into a common part and a specific part and forwards these parts in a multicast manner and a broadcast manner, respectively. Simulation results validate that the basic CID-translated forwarding scheme uses fewer resources than the tunnel-based forwarding scheme. Moreover, the enhanced CID-translated forwarding scheme outperforms the basic CID-translated forwarding scheme in terms of the system resources used and transmission latency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
