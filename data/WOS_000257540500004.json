Barenco, Bennett, Cleve, Di Vincenzo, Margolus and Shor [Phys. Rev. A 52 ( 1995) 3457] have given the general construction methods, and explicit results for up-to-four-qubits controlled unitary gates. We extended their calculation and gave two analytic expressions for the construction of general n-qubit controlled unitary gates in terms of one-qubit and two-qubit CNOT gates. There are two expressions - one is exponential in the qubit number which is efficient for up to ten qubits, and the other is polynomial in the qubit number, which is efficient for more than ten qubits.", "paper_title": "Analytic one-bit and CNOT gate constructions of general n-qubit controlled gates", "paper_id": "WOS:000257540500004"}
