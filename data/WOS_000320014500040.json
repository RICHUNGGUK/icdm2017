In the deblocking filter part, HEVC inherits the basic property of H.264/AVC and gives some new features. Based on this variation, this paper introduces a novel dual-mode deblocking filter architecture which could support both of the HEVC and H.264/AVC standards. For HEVC standard, the proposed symmetric unified-cross unit (SUCU) based filtering scheme greatly reduces the design complexity. As a result, processing a 16 x 16 block needs 24 clock cycles. For H.264/AVC standard, it takes 48 clock cycles for a 16 x 16 macro-block (MB). In synthesis result, the proposed architecture occupies 41.6k equivalent gate count at frequency of 200 MHz in SMIC 65 nm library, which could satisfy the throughput requirement of super hi-vision (SHV) on 60 fps. With filter reusing scheme, the universal design for the two standards saves 30% gate counts than the dedicated ones in filter part. In addition, the total power consumption could be reduced by 57.2% with skipping mode when the edges need not be filtered.", "paper_title": "A Dual-Mode Deblocking Filter Design for HEVC and H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000320014500040"}
