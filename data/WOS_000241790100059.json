Based on this linear form and by using the stability theory of linear differential difference equations and the tool of M-matrix, delay-dependent and delay-independent stability algebraic criteria are obtained. All results obtained in this paper need only to compute the eigenvalues of some matrices or to examine the matrices to be M-matrix or to verify some inequalities to be holden.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent and delay-independent stability conditions of delayed cellular neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100059"}
