It is well known that it is very difficult to obtain the values of Ramsey numbers. In this work, a theoretical chemical/biological solution is presented in terms of membrane computing for the decision version of Ramsey number problem, that is, to decide whether an integer n is the value of Ramsey number R(k, l), where k and l are integers.", "paper_title": "COMPUTATION OF RAMSEY NUMBERS BY P SYSTEMS WITH ACTIVE MEMBRANES", "paper_id": "WOS:000286612200003"}
