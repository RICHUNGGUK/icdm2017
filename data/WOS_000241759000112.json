The detailed formulas of the error bound between the nonlinear function to be approximated and the FNN system designed based on the input-output data are derived.", "paper_title": "Approximation accuracy of table look-up scheme for fuzzy-neural networks with bell membership function", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000112"}
