In particular, we define and study a construction which we call the periodic power of a structure, and define a periomorphism of a structure to be a homomorphism from the periodic power of the structure to the structure itself. Our preservation theorem states that, over an N-0-categorical structure, a relation is positive Horn definable if and only if it is preserved by all periomorphisms of the structure. We give applications of this theorem, including a new proof of the known complexity classification of quantified constraint satisfaction on equality templates.", "paper_title": "AN ALGEBRAIC PRESERVATION THEOREM FOR N-0-CATEGORICAL QUANTIFIED CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000317894100006"}
