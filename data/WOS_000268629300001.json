In this paper we raise the question of whether, on the contrary, it could be considered a key tool in increasing intelligence in biological structures. A possible way of answering this question in a mathematical context is shown, formulating a proposition that suggests a link between intelligence and contradiction. A concrete approach is presented in the well-defined setting of cellular automata. Here we define the models of \"observer\", \"entity\", \"environment\", \"intelligence,\" and \"contradiction\". These definitions, which roughly correspond to the common meaning of these words, allow us to deduce a simple but strong result about these concepts in an unbiased, mathematical manner. Evidence for a real-world counterpart to the demonstrated formal link between intelligence and contradiction is provided by three computational experiments. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
