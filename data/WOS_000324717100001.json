Documents related to Dublin Core research were identified in authoritative and comprehensive databases of Web of Science, and subject terms were extracted from the relevant documents. These raw terms were regularized, and the multidimensional scaling (MDS) visualization analysis method was applied to reveal semantic relationships among subject terms. The temporal analysis on the related subject terms added a unique dimension to the study. Three periods (from 1997 to 2001; from 2002 to 2006; and from 2007 to 2011), in addition to the entire period (from 1997 to 2011), were analysed and compared in the visual contexts. Obsolete topics, newly emerging topics, and basic topics on Dublin Core research were identified and analysed in temporal subject analysis. Topic changes in the three periods are shown. The findings of this study reveal the hidden patterns of subject associations, illustrate themes of Dublin Core research and their dynamics over time, and shed light on the understanding of Dublin Core research.", "paper_title": "Visual Subject Analysis for Dublin Core Research", "paper_id": "WOS:000324717100001"}
