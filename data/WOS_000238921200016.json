Voronoi cells play a fundamental role in the least squares estimation of the integer unknowns of the model. In this paper, we first develop a method to construct Voronoi cells and study how to fit figures of simple shape to a Voronoi cell, both from inside and outside. We then derive a number of new lower and upper bounds on the probability that the integers of the model are correctly estimated. Finally, we discuss the tests of two hypotheses on the integer mean.", "paper_title": "Voronoi cells, probabilistic bounds, and hypothesis testing in mixed integer linear models", "paper_id": "WOS:000238921200016"}
