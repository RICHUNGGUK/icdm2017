We consider the problem of computing the partition function of the system on a bounded degree graph. Based on the self-avoiding tree, we prove the system exhibits strong correlation decay under the condition that the absolute value of inverse temperature is small. Due to strong correlation decay property, an FPTAS for the partition function is presented and uniqueness of Gibbs measure of the two-state spin system on a bounded degree infinite graph is proved, under the same condition. This condition is sharp for Ising model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
