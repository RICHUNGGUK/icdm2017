The resizing is performed on warping a triangular mesh over the image, which captures the image saliency information as well as the underlying image features. The warped triangular mesh and the horizontal and vertical scales of all triangles are simultaneously obtained by a quadratic optimization which can be achieved by solving a sparse linear system. Our approach can preserve the shapes of curved features in the resized images. The resizing operation can be performed in an interactive rate which makes the proposed approach practically useful for realtime image resizing. To guarantee a foldover free resizing result, we modify the optimization to a standard quadratic programming. A number of experimental results have shown that our approach has obtained pleasing results and outperforms the previous approaches.", "paper_title": "Nonhomogeneous scaling optimization for realtime image resizing", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800037"}
