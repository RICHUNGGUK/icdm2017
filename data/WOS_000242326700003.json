Furthermore, the energy barriers of the tautomerizations in which the carboxylic H-atom takes part are several times lower than those in which the LA OH group assists the proton transfer.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study of the intermolecular H-bonding and intermolecular proton transfer between isocytosine tautomeric forms and R,S-lactic acid", "paper_id": "WOS:000242326700003"}
