Surprisingly, this formula is none other than the Erlang delay formula. It provides an upper bound on the probability a flow of given peak rate suffers degradation when bandwidth sharing is max-min fair. Apart from the flow rate, the only relevant parameters are link capacity and overall demand. We explain why this result is valid under a very general and realistic traffic model and discuss its significance for network engineering.", "paper_title": "Internet and the Erlang Formula", "paper_id": "WOS:000299325100003"}
