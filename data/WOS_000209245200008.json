SiGe power HBTs with total emitter area of similar to 1460 mu m(2) are fabricated in a commercial BiCMOS process, and irradiated with proton at different fluences from 1 x 10(12) p/cm(2) to 5 x 10(13) p/cm(2). Experimental characterizations are conducted for pre-and post-radiation devices at room temperature, cryogenic temperature and high temperature. The results demonstrate that the proton-irradiated SiGe power HBTs are naturally suitable for electronic operations at extreme temperatures. Specifically, investigation of proton radiation on SiGe power HBTs at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) indicates a significant potential for space applications. In addition, SiGe power HBTs show better tolerance of proton radiation at high temperature of 120 degrees C (junction temperature over 160 degrees C). SiGe power HBTs demonstrate great potential in power amplification for wireless communication systems under severe radiation and extreme temperature environment (cryogenic and high temperatures) even without any intentional radiation hardening.", "paper_title": "EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION OF PROTON RADIATED SiGe POWER HBTs AT EXTREME TEMPERATURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000209245200008"}
