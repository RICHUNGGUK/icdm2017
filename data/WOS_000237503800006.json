Data provided by these devices, however, tend to be unreliable. The data must, therefore, be cleaned before an application can make use of them, leading to additional complexity for application development and deployment. Here we present Extensible Sensor stream Processing (ESP), a framework for building sensor data cleaning infrastructures for use in pervasive applications. ESP is designed as a pipeline using declarative cleaning mechanisms based on spatial and temporal characteristics of sensor data. We demonstrate ESP's effectiveness and ease of use through three real-world scenarios.", "paper_title": "Declarative support for sensor data cleaning", "paper_id": "WOS:000237503800006"}
