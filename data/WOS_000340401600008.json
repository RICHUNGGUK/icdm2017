The hole array wavelength filter that consists of metallic thin film and dielectric enables to transmit narrow bandwidth light. It is known that transmission spectrum can be changed not only by the periodicity of hole array but also by the shape of holes. For optimizing the hole shape, the level set method is used in this study. In the ordinary level set method, the boundaries are implicitly expressed by the zero level set of a scalar function, called the level set function, within a fixed mesh. Therefore, the material interpolation becomes numerically awkward within the elements across the implicit zero level set because those elements inevitably take on intermediate material properties even if the boundary of zero level set are mathematically clear. As the result, the optimization is likely to yield wrong solution. Here, a new level set optimization method incorporating Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method is proposed to eliminate intermediate values on the interfaces perfectly. As a result, the proposed method can successfully perform the structural optimization of hole shape without intermediate values.", "paper_title": "A level set-based topology optimization incorporating arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method for wavelength filter using extraordinary optical transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000340401600008"}
