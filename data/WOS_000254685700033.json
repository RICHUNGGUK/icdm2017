If is shown that the sampling-based dynamic procedure, in combination with an appropriate truncation error model, can be used as a technique to increase the numerical accuracy of a discretization. The technique is resemblant to Richardson extrapolation. The procedure is tested on a 2D lid-driven cavity at Re=400 using a finite difference method. Promising results are obtained.
