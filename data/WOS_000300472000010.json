Two cross-coupled NMOS pairs with different bias points are employed. These NMOS pairs realize an impulse-like current waveform to improve the phase noise in the low supply conditions. The proposed VCO was implemented in a standard 0.18 mu m CMOS technology, which oscillates at a carrier frequency of 4.5 GHz with a 0.2-V supply voltage. The measured phase noise is 104 dBc/Hz@ 1 MHz-offset with a power consumption of 114 mu W, and the FoM is -187 dBc/Hz.", "paper_title": "A Dual-Conduction Class-C VCO for a Low Supply Voltage", "paper_id": "WOS:000300472000010"}
