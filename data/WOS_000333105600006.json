However, it has recently been shown that the measure is fundamentally incoherent, in the sense that it treats the relative severities of misclassifications differently when different classifiers are used. The H measure overcomes this by allowing a researcher to fix the distribution of relative severities to a classifier-independent setting on a given problem. This note extends the discussion, and proposes a modified standard distribution for the H measure, which better matches the requirements of researchers, the Beta(pi(1) + 1, pi(0) + 1) distribution.
