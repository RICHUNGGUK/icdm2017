One of the key factors to ensure high communication quality is an efficient assessment scheme for risks and trust of choosing next potential cooperative nodes. Trust model, an abstract psychological cognitive process, is one of the most complex concepts in social relationships, involving factors such as assumptions, expectations and behaviors. All of the above make it difficult to quantify and forecast trust accurately. in this paper, based on the theories of fuzzy recognition with feedback, SCGM(1, 1) model and Markov chain, we present a pattern of prediction making. The analysis and experimental computation show that this scheme is efficient in trust prediction for ad hoc networks. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.
