For the problem under the l(infinity)-norm, an O(n log n)-time algorithm is presented. For the problem under the Hamming distance, we first show that it has an Omega (n log n)-time lower bound in the comparison model; and then. we present an O(n log n)-time algorithm. Both of the presented algorithms improve the previous upper bounds from O(n(2)). (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
