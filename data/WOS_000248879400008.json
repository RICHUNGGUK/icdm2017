Here, CuPc is used as hole buffer layer, NPB as hole transport layer, TPBi as host and exciton block layer, Btp(2)Ir(acac) as dopant, Alq as electron transport layer, and LiF/Al is compound cathode. The high external quantum efficiency of 2.1%, power efficiency of 0.89 lm/W, and current efficiency of 2.43 cd/A, are achieved at the driven current density of 4 mA/cm(2) by optimizing the thickness of light-emitting layer (EML) of the device. For the device with the EML thickness of 20 nm, the maximum brightness is high up to 4798 cd/m(2) at 600 mA/cm(2). The influences of changing EML thickness on the decrease of device efficiency have been discussed in detail. It's suggested that, triplet-triplet annihilation (T-T annihilation) restrains seriously the enhancement of device efficiency, when the EML thickness of the device is less than 15 nm, and the invalid light-emitting layer, should be mainly responsible for the decline of device efficiency, when the EML thickness is more than 21 nm.
