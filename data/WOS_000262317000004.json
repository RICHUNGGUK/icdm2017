Primarily designed for monitoring purposes, many sensor applications require continuous collection and processing of sensed data. Due to the limited power supply for sensor nodes, energy efficiency is a major performance concern in query processing. In this paper, we focus on continuous kNN query processing in object tracking sensor networks. We propose a localized scheme to monitor nearest neighbors to a query point. The key idea is to establish a monitoring area for each query so that only the updates relevant to the query are collected. The monitoring area is set up when the kNN query is initially evaluated and is expanded and shrunk on the fly upon object movement. We analyze the optimal maintenance of the monitoring area and develop an adaptive algorithm to dynamically decide when to shrink the monitoring area. Experimental results show that establishing a monitoring area for continuous kNN query processing greatly reduces energy consumption and prolongs network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Localized monitoring of kNN queries in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262317000004"}
