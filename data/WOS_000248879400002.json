Tile IPS (interlaced/progressive scan) method as a new driving method was proposed and its efficiency was proven by experiments. This method selects a used scan method from interlaced and progressive scan methods in each subfield, according to the input image pattern. From these experimental results, the IPS driving method used less power consumption than the conventional scan method at the special image pattern as a horizontal alternative ON/OFF line pattern. We obtained the maximum decreasing rate of 18.2% regarding power consumption at a special image pattern. In addition, this method improved circuits' reliance and lowered the amount of heating loss, because this is the driving waveforms of the address electrodes decreased switching noise. which is the high induced overshoot voltage in scan and sustain electrodes or high impulse displacement current in address electrodes. Therefore, we can expect the lower power consumption and reduction of switching noise, which is the overshoot voltage or impulse displacement current, when the proposed IPS driving method is applied to a driving PDP.
