Despite these algorithms are developed using software implementations, their implementations in hardware are required to achieve real-time operation. This paper describes the development of an embedded system for video de-interlacing. The algorithm for video de-interlacing uses three fuzzy logic-based systems to tackle three relevant features in video sequences: motion, edges, and picture repetition. The proposed strategy implements the algorithm as a hardware IP core on a FPGA-based embedded system. The paper details the proposed architecture and the design methodology to develop it. The resulting embedded system is verified on a FPGA development board and it is able to de-interlace in real-time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
