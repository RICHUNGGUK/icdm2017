Given a rectangular region R and a set S of rectangles within R, the REP is to choose a direction for each rectangle to escape to the boundary of R, such that the resultant maximum density over R is minimized. We prove that the REP is NP-complete, and show that it can be formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP). A provably good approximation algorithm for the REP is developed by applying linear programming (LP) relaxation and a special rounding technique to the ILP. In addition, an iterative refinement procedure is proposed as a postprocessing step to further improve the results. Our approximation algorithm is also shown to work for more general versions of REP: weighted REP and simultaneous REP. Our approach is tested on a set of industrial PCB bus escape routing problems. Experimental results show that the optimal solution can be obtained within several seconds for each of the test cases.", "paper_title": "NP-Completeness and an Approximation Algorithm for Rectangle Escape Problem With Application to PCB Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000307974800005"}
