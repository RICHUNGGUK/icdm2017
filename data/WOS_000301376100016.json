Frequency self-adaptive load technique is proposed to increase the divider's operating frequency range and sensitivity. Furthermore, the circuits operation principle and theory are analysized in detail. Measurement results exhibits that the proposed divider's input sensitivity is enhanced, the operating frequency ranges from 150-MHz to 16.734-GHz, and the power consumption is 15 mW when input frequency is 16.734-GHz. The chip is implemented on a standard 0.13 mu m CMOS process with 1.2 V supply voltage.", "paper_title": "High sensitivity, ultra-wide band divide-by-two circuit with frequency self-adaptive techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000301376100016"}
