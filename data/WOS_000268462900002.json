In laser processing, the molten flow from the hole wall occurs; and in the model study, the hole wall velocity resembling the molten flow should be accounted for. In the present study, gas jet impingement onto tapered hole with elevated temperature is considered and the heat transfer rates as well as skin friction at the hole wall surface are predicted. The velocity of molten flow from the hole wall determined from the previous study is adopted in the simulations and the effect of hole wall velocity on the heat transfer rates and skin friction is also examined. It is found that the Nusselt number and skin friction at the hole wall in the regions of hole inlet and exit attain high values. The influence of hole wall velocity on the Nusselt number and skin friction is found not to be very significant.
