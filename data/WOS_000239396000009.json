We show that controlled two-qudit gates can be implemented without ancillas and prove that the gate library containing arbitrary local unitaries and one two-qudit gate, CINC, is exact-universal. A recent paper [S.Bullock, D.O'Leary, and G.K. Brennen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 230502 (2005)] describes quantum circuits for qudits which require O(d(n)) two-qudit gates for state synthesis and O(d(2n)) two-qudit gates for unitary synthesis, matching the respective lower bound complexities. In this work, we present the state-synthesis circuit in much greater detail and prove that it is correct. Also, the [(n - 2)/(d - 2)] ancillas required in the original algorithm may be removed without changing the asymptotics. Further, we present a new algorithm for unitary synthesis, inspired by the QR matrix decomposition, which is also asymptotically optimal.", "paper_title": "Efficient circuits for exact-universal computation with qudits", "paper_id": "WOS:000239396000009"}
