Different from available comparable ones, the new protocol realizes implicit authentication without bilinear pairings which makes it more efficient. The security of proposed protocol can be reduced to the standard Computational Diffie-Hellman problem. Two variants of the protocol are also given, with one achieving the security-efficiency trade-off and the other providing authenticated key agreement between users of different domains.", "paper_title": "Identify-Based Authenticated Key Agreement Protocols without Bilinear Pairings", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800055"}
