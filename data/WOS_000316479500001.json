This system is designed to display humanlike behavior within UT2004, which provides a good environment for comparing human and embodied AI behavior without the cost and difficulty of full humanoid robots. Using a biologically inspired approach, the architecture is loosely based on theories about the high-level control circuits in the brain, and it is the first neural implementation of a global workspace that has been embodied in a complex dynamic real-time environment. NeuroBot's humanlike behavior was tested by competing in the 2011 BotPrize competition, in which human judges play UT2004 and rate the humanness of other avatars that are controlled by a human or a bot. NeuroBot came a close second, achieving a humanness rating of 36%, while the most human human reached 67%. We also developed a humanness metric that combines a number of statistical measures of an avatar's behavior into a single number. In our experiments with this metric, NeuroBot was rated as 33% human, and the most human human achieved 73%.", "paper_title": "A Neurally Controlled Computer Game Avatar With Humanlike Behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000316479500001"}
