For example, multiple base stations may be employed in some wireless sensor networks, or multiple trusts may be distributed among multiple routing nodes in multi-hop routing protocol. Most of the previously proposed multicast/broadcast authentication protocols assume a single source of trust. With multiple trust sources, it becomes difficult to design resource-efficient authentication protocols for multicast/broadcast services. Simply extending traditional approaches will result in increased bandwidth and memory consumptions in proportion to the number of trust sources. In this paper, we propose a new scheme utilizing Combined Key Chains. If there are m trust sources, our scheme generates m+1 key chains, where m of them are distributed among the m source nodes and the last one is used as a Verification Key Chain in all the receiver nodes. The communication overhead is small and constant, and the memory requirement at a verifier node is also minimal.
