A time-frequency analysis technique of the extracted vibration signals is proposed to carry out knee joint diagnosis. The performance of the ICA technique is verified experimentally. Statistical pattern classification screening accuracy is 82.5% in VAG. The results confirm that ICA is a feasible approach for the noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of articular cartilage pathology.", "paper_title": "EXTRACTION AND SCREENING OF KNEE JOINT VIBROARTHROGRAPHIC SIGNALS USING THE INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000311584500001"}
