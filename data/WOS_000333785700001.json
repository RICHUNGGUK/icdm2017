We propose a new taxonomy merging algorithm called A(TOM) that, given as input two taxonomies and a match mapping between them, can generate an integrated taxonomy in a largely automatic manner. The approach is target-driven, i.e. we merge a source taxonomy into the target taxonomy and preserve the target ontology as much as possible. In contrast to previous approaches, A(TOM) does not aim at fully preserving all input concepts and relationships but strives to reduce the semantic heterogeneity of the merge results for improved understandability. A(TOM) can also exploit advanced match mappings containing is-a relationships in addition to equivalence relationships between concepts of the input taxonomies. We evaluate A(TOM) for synthetic and real-world scenarios and compare it with a full merge solution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
