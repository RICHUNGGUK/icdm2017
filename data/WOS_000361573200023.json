The proposed approach is based on the calculation of the eigenmodes part by part by using shift-and-invert iterative procedure and by utilizing the iterative approach to solve linear equations to compute eigenmodes expansion coefficients. As practical implementation, the iterative modal methods based on polynomials and trigonometric functions as well as on finite-difference scheme are developed. Alternatives to the scattering matrix (S-matrix) technique which are based on pure iterative or mixed direct-iterative approaches allowing to markedly reduce the number of required numerical operations are discussed. Additionally, the possibility of diminishing the memory demand of the whole algorithm from second to first power of the number of modes by implementing the iterative approach is demonstrated. This allows to carry out calculations up to hundreds of thousands eigenmodes without using a supercomputer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
