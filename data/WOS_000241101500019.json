These libraries not only address the problem of loss of content due to tape deterioration, but also improve disclosure of the content. However, switching to a digital file-based library involves many new concerns and problems for content providers. This paper will discuss one of them, namely the metadata. Metadata is additional information that is required in order to be able to search, retrieve, and play out the stored content. Different standards for metadata are currently available, each having its own field of application and characteristics. In this paper, we introduce an objective framework that one can use in order to select the appropriate metadata standard for its particular type of application. This framework is applied to four well-known metadata standards, namely Dublin Core, MPEG-7, P/Meta, and SMEF.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of metadata standards in the context of digital audio-visual libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500019"}
