In this paper, at first we define three new operations on bipolar fuzzy graphs, viz. direct product, semi strong product and strong product. Likewise, sufficient conditions for each one of them to be complete are given. Also, it is proved that any of the products of strong bipolar fuzzy graphs are strong bipolar fuzzy graphs.", "paper_title": "A study on bipolar fuzzy graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366900008"}
