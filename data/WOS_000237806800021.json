We have further found that higher-order (1st- to 3rd-order) models tend to work better for music retrieval than 0th-order ones owing to the richer context they capture. However, there is a serious performance cost due to the large size of such models and the present paper reports on some attempts to reduce dimensionality while retaining the general robustness of the method. We find that some simple reduced-dimensionality models, if their parameter settings are carefully chosen, do indeed perform almost as well as the full 24-dimensional versions. Furthermore, in terms of recall in the top 1000 documents retrieved, we find that a 6-dimensional 2nd-order model gives even better performance than the full model. This represents a potential 64-times reduction in model size and search-time, making it a suitable candidate for filtering a large database as the first stage of a two-stage retrieval system.", "paper_title": "Dimensionality reduction in harmonic modeling for music information retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000237806800021"}
