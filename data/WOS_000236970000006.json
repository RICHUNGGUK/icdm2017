Traditional methods for sensor scheduling use either sensing coverage or network connectivity, but rarely both. In this paper, we deal with a challenging task: Without accurate location information, how do we schedule sensor nodes to save energy and meet both constraints of sensing coverage and network connectivity? Our approach utilizes an integrated method that provides statistical sensing coverage and guaranteed network connectivity. We use random scheduling for sensing coverage and then turn on extra sensor nodes, if necessary, for network connectivity. Our method is totally distributed, is able to dynamically adjust sensing coverage with guaranteed network connectivity, and is resilient to time asynchrony. We present analytical results to disclose the relationship among node density, scheduling parameters, coverage quality, detection probability, and detection delay. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our joint scheduling method.", "paper_title": "Random coverage with guaranteed connectivity: Joint scheduling for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000236970000006"}
