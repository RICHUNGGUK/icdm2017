In this paper, we establish to which extent several distance measures for the comparison of evolutionary networks are metrics for galled trees, and hence, when they can be safely used to evaluate galled tree reconstruction methods.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Galled Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000286146600013"}
