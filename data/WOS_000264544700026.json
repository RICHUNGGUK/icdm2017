Using modal analysis, we are able to identify parts of the shape that tend to move rigidly. We define a deformation energy on the shape, enabling modal analysis to find the typical deformations of the shape. We then find a decomposition of the shape such that the typical deformations can be well approximated with deformation fields that are rigid in each part of the decomposition. We optimize for the best decomposition, which captures how the shape deforms. A hierarchical refinement scheme makes it possible to compute more detailed decompositions for some parts of the shape. Although our algorithm does not require user intervention, it is possible to control the process by directly changing the deformation energy, or interactively refining the decomposition as necessary. Due to the construction of the energy function and the properties of modal analysis, the computed decompositions are robust to changes in pose as well as meshing, noise, and even imperfections such as small holes in the surface.", "paper_title": "Shape Decomposition using Modal Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000264544700026"}
