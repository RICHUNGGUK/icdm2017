The role of MLTE (Multi-Layer Traffic Engineering) is to cut these long wavelength paths into parts (fragments) that allow better routing at the upper layer (fragmentation), or to concatenate two or more fragments into longer paths (defragmentation) when the network load is low and therefore less hops are preferred. In this paper we present a new model (CC: Grooming Graph) and an algorithm for this model that supports Fragmentation and DeFragmentation of wavelength paths making the network always instantly adapt to changing traffic conditions. We introduce the notion of shadow capacities to model \"lightpath tailoring\". We implicitly assume that the wavelength paths carry such, e.g., IP traffic that can be interrupted for a few microseconds and that even allows minor packet reordering. To show the superior performance of our approach in various network and traffic conditions we have carried out an intensive simulation study.", "paper_title": "Multi-layer traffic engineering through adaptive lambda-path fragmentation and de-fragmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800060"}
