This paper proposes an H.264/AVC decoder that employs three techniques to reduce external memory access events: efficient distribution of reference frame data, on-chip cache memory, and frame memory recompression. The distribution of reference frame data is optimized to reduce the number of row activations during SDRAM access. The novel cache organization is proposed to simplify tag comparisons and ease the access to consecutive 4x4 blocks. A recompression algorithm is modified to improve compression efficiency by using unused storage space in neighboring blocks as well as the correlation with the neighboring pixels stored in the cache. Experimental results show that the three techniques together reduce external memory access time by an average of 90%, which is 16% better than the improvements achieved by previous work. Efficiency of the frame memory recompression algorithm is improved with a 32x32 cache, resulting in a PSNR improvement of 0.371 dB. The H.264/AVC decoder with the three techniques is fabricated and implemented as an ASIC using 0.18 mu m technology.", "paper_title": "An H.264/AVC Decoder with Reduced External Memory Access for Motion Compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000289921900007"}
