Spectral discrepancy and spatial distortion are used as quality measures. Empirical results lead to some recommendations on the wavelet filter parameters for use in remote sensing image fusion applications.", "paper_title": "Multisensor remote sensing image fusion using stationary wavelet transform: Effects of basis and decomposition level", "paper_id": "WOS:000254425100003"}
