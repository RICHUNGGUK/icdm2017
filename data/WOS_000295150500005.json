Although HUP mining extracts important knowledge from databases. it requires long calculations and multiple database scans. Therefore, HUP mining is often unsuitable for real-time data processing schemes such as data streams. Furthermore, many HUPs may be unimportant due to the poor correlations among the items inside of them. Hence,the fast discovery of fewer but more important HUPs would be very useful in many practical domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to introduce a very useful measure, called frequency affinity, among the items in a HUP and the concept of interesting HUP with a strong frequency affinity for the fast discovery of more applicable knowledge. Moreover, we propose a new tree structure, utility tree based on frequency affinity (UTFA), and a novel algorithm, high utility interesting pattern mining (HUIPM), for single-pass mining of HUIPs from a database. Our approach mines fewer but more valuable HUPs, significantly reduces the overall runtime of existing HUP mining algorithms and is applicable to real-time data processing. Extensive performance analyses show that the proposed HUIPM algorithm is very efficient and scalable for interesting HUP mining with a strong frequency affinity.
