Making use of the stochastic version of Razumikhin theorem of stochastic functional differential equation, Lyapunov direct methods and matrix analysis,almost sure exponential stability on interval neural networks perturbed by white noises with time varying delays is examined, and some sufficient algebraic criteria which only depend on the systems' parameters are given. For well designed deterministic neural networks, the results obtained in the paper also imply that how much tolerance against perturbation they have.", "paper_title": "Almost sure exponential stability on interval stochastic neural networks with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000024"}
