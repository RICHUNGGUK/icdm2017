We begin by computing a benchmark test case to validate the code. Next, the flow with steady inflow conditions are computed on several different grids. The resolution of the boundary layer as well as the amount of the artificial dissipation is studied to establish the necessary resolution requirements. We propose an accuracy test based on the weak imposition of the boundary conditions that does not require a grid refinement. Finally, we compute the vortex-airfoil interaction and calculate the lift and drag coefficients. It is shown that the viscous terms add the effect of detailed small scale structures to the lift and drag coefficients. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
