Recent developments in indentation testing and inverse modeling allow estimation of this parameter with the eardrum in situ. These approaches are challenging because of the curved shape of the pars tensa which requires special care during experimentation to keep the indenter perpendicular to the local surface at the point of contact. Moreover, they involve complicated contact modeling. An alternative computer-based method is presented here in which pressurization is used instead of indentation. The Young's modulus of a thin-shell model of the eardrum with subject-specific geometry is numerically optimized such that simulated pressurized shapes match measured counterparts. The technique was evaluated on six healthy rat eardrums, resulting in a Young's modulus estimate of 22.8 +/- 1.5 MPa. This is comparable to values estimated using indentation testing. The new pressurization-based approach is simpler to use than the indentation-based method for the two reasons noted above. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
