We derive the stability condition of the extended model by considering a small perturbation around the homogeneous flow solution with finding that the improvement in the stability of the traffic flow is obtained by taking into account the relative current, which is also confirmed by direct simulations. Moreover , from the nonlinear analysis to the extended models, the relative current dependence of the propagating kink solutions for traffic jam is obtained by deriving the modified KdV equation near the critical point by using the reductive perturbation method.", "paper_title": "Stabilization analysis and modified KdV equation of lattice models with consideration of relative current", "paper_id": "WOS:000259546600002"}
