The past decade has witnessed a significant advancement of the symbolic techniques developed specifically for large analog integrated circuits. The key methodology introduced is a data structure called binary decision diagram (BDD) which was established originally for logic design and verification. The application of the BDD technique for analog circuit analysis has the following features: (1) It is a compact data structure so that data redundancy in symbolic analysis can be eliminated. (2) It provides a mechanism for implicit enumeration method so that exhaustive enumeration commonly performed in symbolic analysis can be avoided. (3) Numerical evaluation on a BDD can be made extremely efficient, making it an excellent means for repetitive analysis. More advanced features are yet to be explored. This survey brings together the significant research results published in the past decade and provides a tutorial overview on the basic principles of applying BDD to analog circuit analysis. Some new directions that are potentially valuable for developing future analog design automation tools are discussed and a design example is given to illustrate the application of symbolic techniques.", "paper_title": "A survey on binary decision diagram approaches to symbolic analysis of analog integrated circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000313722700003"}
