PC internet users, and passive online users Dual media users are likely to spend more time on information searching, perceive greater levels of media richness in online media, and share common motives for accessing internet media via both mobile and PC The findings are consistent with our theoretical expectations Research limitations and implications - Any exploratory clustering of consumers is by definition a snapshot that depends on time and place Consequently the findings would very likely have been different if the underlying data had been sampled at another time of in different locations Despite this limitation the findings corroborate some of the basic tenets of theories of media competition and complementarity Practical implications - The fact that almost a third of online media users access internet content via both mobile and PC suggests the increasing importance of cross-media strategies Originality/value - This is a pioneering study that examines media competitions and complementarity between the mobile internet and the PC internet", "paper_title": "Online media rivalry A latent class model for mobile and PC internet users", "paper_id": "WOS:000277111500006"}
