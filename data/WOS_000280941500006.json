Shuffled complex evolution (SCE) is a population-based stochastic optimization technique combining the competitive complex evolution with the controlled random search, the implicit clustering, and the complex shuffling. Back-calculation of pavement layer moduli is an ill-posed inverse engineering problem, which involves searching for the optimal combination of pavement layer stiffness solutions in an unsmooth, multimodal, complex search space. SCE is especially considered a robust and efficient approach for global optimization of multimodal functions. A desirable characteristic of the SCE algorithm is that it uses information about the nature of the response surface, extracted using the deterministic Simplex geometric shape, to direct the search into regions with higher posterior probability. The hybrid back-calculation system described in this paper combines the robustness of the SCE in global optimization with the computational efficiency of neural networks and advanced pavement system characterization offered by employing finite-element models. This is the first time the SCE approach is applied to real-time nondestructive evaluation of pavement systems required in the routine maintenance and rehabilitation activities for sustainable transportation infrastructure.", "paper_title": "Global Optimization of Pavement Structural Parameters during Back-Calculation Using Hybrid Shuffled Complex Evolution Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000280941500006"}
