The proposed hybrid method takes advantage of the differential evolution (DE) ability to find global optimum in problems with complex design spaces while directly enforcing feasibility of constraints using a modified augmented Lagrangian multiplier method. The basic steps of the proposed method are comprised of an outer iteration, in which the Lagrangian multipliers and various penalty parameters are updated using a first-order update scheme, and an inner iteration, in which a nonlinear optimization of the modified augmented Lagrangian function with simple bound constraints is implemented by a modified differential evolution algorithm. Experimental results based on several well-known constrained numerical and engineering optimization problems demonstrate that the proposed method shows better performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms.
