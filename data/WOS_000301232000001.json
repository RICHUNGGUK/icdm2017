In addition to the usual functions that evaluate the density, distribution and quantile functions or generate random variates, a function designed to be specifically useful for larger simulation studies has been added. After describing the set of densities and the usage of the package, a small toy example of a simulation study conducted using the benchden package is given.", "paper_title": "The benchden Package: Benchmark Densities for Nonparametric Density Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000301232000001"}
