Channel availability is a key parameter for an effective design of channel selection strategies as well as routing metrics in cognitive radio networks. In static scenarios, the availability of a channel depends only on the primary user's activity. Differently, in mobile scenarios, the availability of a channel dynamically varies in time due to the changes of the users' relative positions. In this paper, we design a channel-availability estimation strategy by explicitly accounting for the features of mobile scenarios. The simulation results reveal the benefits of adopting the proposed strategy in cognitive radio networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
