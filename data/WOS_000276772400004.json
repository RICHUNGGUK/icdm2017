The procedure automates the selection of mechanism topology as characterized by the number and connectivity of the links as well as the nature of the connections between them, the mechanism shape as characterized by the shapes of the individual links, and the mechanism dimensions which include the locations of the joints and the cross-sectional dimensions of the links. The synthesis task is posed as a constrained optimization problem and is solved by a hybrid, elite-preserving genetic algorithm. Three examples of compact mechanisms that trace different non-smooth paths in response to a single, monotonic and bounded force input are used to illustrate the synthesis capability of the procedure. Prototypes of the designs are built and tested to verify their performance. It is observed that in all three examples, partially compliant mechanism designs offer better conformance with design intent than either rigid body or fully compliant mechanisms.", "paper_title": "Unified synthesis of compact planar path-generating linkages with rigid and deformable members", "paper_id": "WOS:000276772400004"}
