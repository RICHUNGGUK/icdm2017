This study presents a classification tool called MicroCBR that uses the case-based reasoning paradigm and incorporates a novel filtering technique based on statistical methods, a new clustering technique that uses ESOINN (Enhanced Self-Organizing Incremental Neuronal Network), and a knowledge extraction technique based on the J48 algorithm. MicroCBR has been applied to classify 91 CLL patients and the results obtained are shown in this paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
