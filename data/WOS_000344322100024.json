And the problem of enabling nodes of WSNs to determine their locations in a hostile environment has become more and more important in WSNs applications. In this article, we propose a novel Dempster-Shafer based secure localization algorithm to diminish the effect of the unreliable beacons that provide false localization information in the WSNs. First, the framework of trust evaluation is established on the basis of evidence theory. According to the characteristics of time and space of beacons, we set up the basic probability assignment (BPA) values and BPA evidences of beacons. Then, an improved Dempster-Shafer method is utilized to resolve the conflicts among the BPA evidences and to integrate the trust values of beacons. The max_mass function is used to decide which beacon is attacked, and then, we eliminate the attacked beacons before the localization stage. Finally, we employ the weighted Taylor-series least squares method to estimate the normal nodes coordinates. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is robust and effective.
