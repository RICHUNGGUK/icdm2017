This paper makes an investigation on disposing product development iterations in a dynamic environment. Firstly, the uncertain factors, such as task durations, output branches of tasks, and resource allocations, existing in product development are discussed. Secondly, a satisfaction degree-based feedback control approach is put forward. Such an approach includes two scenarios: identifying a satisfaction degree and monitoring and controlling of iteration process. The former is used to represent the accepted iterative development process and the latter is realized by a resource regulating matrix based on feedback control theory. Finally, an example of a crane development project is provided to illustrate and verify the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "RESEARCH ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ITERATIONS BASED ON FEEDBACK CONTROL THEORY IN A DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601400010"}
