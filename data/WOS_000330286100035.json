Cyclotomy over a residue class ring Z(v) can be divided into classical cyclotomy or generalized cyclotomy, depending on v prime or composite. In this paper, we introduce a generalized cyclotomy of order d over Z(p1)(p2)(e1)(e2), ..., p(n)(en), which includes Whiteman's and Ding-Helleseth's generalized cyclotomy as special cases. Here, p(1), p(2), ..., p(n) are pairwise distinct odd primes satisfying d vertical bar(p(i) - 1) for all 1 <= i <= n and e(1), e(2),..., en are positive integers. We derive some basic properties of the corresponding cyclotomic numbers and obtain a general formula to compute them via classical cyclotomic numbers. As applications, we completely solve an open problem and a conjecture on Whiteman's generalized cyclotomy of order four over Z(p1p2). Besides, we also construct an infinite series of near-optimal codebooks over Z(p1p2), as well as some infinite series of asymptotically optimal difference systems of sets over Z(p1)(p2)(e1)(e2), ..., p(n)(en).", "paper_title": "A Unified Approach to Whiteman's and Ding-Helleseth's Generalized Cyclotomy Over Residue Class Rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000330286100035"}
