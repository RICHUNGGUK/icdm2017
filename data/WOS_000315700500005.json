We obtain the order of simultaneous approximation and a Voronovskaja-type result with quantitative estimate for these complex Schurer-Stancu operators attached to analytic functions on compact disks. More important, our results show the overconvergence phenomenon for these complex operators.", "paper_title": "Approximation by Complex Schurer-Stancu Operators in Compact Disks", "paper_id": "WOS:000315700500005"}
