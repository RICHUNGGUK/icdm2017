The proposed controller is based on a spatially discrete model of the farm, which delivers an approximation of wind speed in the vicinity of each wind turbine. The control algorithm determines the reference signals for each individual wind turbine controller in two scenarios based on low and high wind speed. In low wind speed, the reference signals for rotor speed are adjusted, taking the trade-off between power maximization and load minimization into account. In high wind speed, the power and pitch reference signals are determined while structural loads are minimized. To the best of authors' knowledge, the proposed dynamical model is a suitable framework for control, since it provides a dynamic structure for behavior of the flow in wind farms. Moreover, the controller has been proven exceptionally useful in solving the problem of both power and load optimization on the basis of this model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
