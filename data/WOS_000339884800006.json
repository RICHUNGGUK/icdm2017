The hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET), and single electron transfer followed by proton transfer (SET-PT) mechanisms of gallic acid with some radicals ((OO-)-O-center dot, (OH)-O-center dot, and CH3OO center dot) were investigated using the corresponding thermodynamic quantities: bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE), ionization potential (IP), and proton affinity (PA). Namely, the Delta H-BDE, Delta H-IP, and Delta H-PA values of the corresponding reactions in some solvents (water, DMSO, pentylethanoate, and benzene) are investigated using an implicit solvation model (SMD). An approach based on the reactions enthalpies related to the examined mechanisms is applied. This approach shows that a thermodynamically favored mechanism depends on the polarity of reaction media and properties of free radical reactive species. The most acidic 4-OH group of gallic acid is the active site for radical inactivation. The results of this investigation indicate that the SPLET mechanism can be a favored reaction pathway for all three radicals in all solvents, except for (OH)-O-center dot in the aqueous solution. In water, gallic acid can inactivate (OH)-O-center dot by the HAT mechanism.", "paper_title": "Influence of different free radicals on scavenging potency of gallic acid", "paper_id": "WOS:000339884800006"}
