First, the combination of an augmented Lyapunov functional and the free-weighting-matrix technique yields a new delay-independent stability criterion that includes the widely used one as a special case. This criterion is then extended to a new delay-dependent stability criterion by employing an integral inequality. Based on that, a stabilisation approach to design a state feedback controller is presented that requires no parameter tuning, as is needed with some existing methods. Finally, numerical examples illustrate that the method is effective and is an improvement over existing ones.", "paper_title": "Further results on stability and stabilisation of linear systems with state and input delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000262632300001"}
