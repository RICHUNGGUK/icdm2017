Network-layer approaches such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) exist, but require considerable setup and management which hinder the establishment of ad-hoc collaborative environments: trust needs to be established, cryptographic keys need to be exchanged, and private network tunnels need to be created and maintained among end users. In this paper, we propose a novel system architecture which leverages existing social infrastructures to enable ad-hoc VPNs which are self-configuring, self-managing, yet maintain security amongst trusted and untrusted third parties. The key principles of our approach are: (1) self-configuring virtual network overlays enable seamless bi-directional IP-layer connectivity to socially connected parties; (2) online social networking relationships facilitate the establishment of trust relationships among peers; and (3) both centralized and decentralized databases of social network relationships can be securely integrated into existing public-key cryptography (PKI) implementations to authenticate and encrypt end-to-end traffic flows. The main contribution of this paper is a new peer-to-peer overlay architecture that securely and autonomously creates VPN tunnels connecting social peers, where online identities and social networking relationships may be obtained from centralized infrastructures, or managed in a decentralized fashion by the peers themselves. This paper also reports on the design and performance of a prototype implementation that embodies the SocialVPN architecture. The SocialVPN router builds upon IP-over-P2P (IPOP) virtual networks and a PKI-based tunneling infrastructure, which integrates with both centralized and decentralized social networking systems including Facebook, the Drupal open-source content management system, and emailing systems with PGP support. We demonstrate our prototype's ability to support existing, unmodified TCP/IP applications while transparently dealing with user connectivity behind Network Address Translators (NATs). We also present qualitative and quantitative analyses of functionality and performance based on wide-area network experiments using PlanetLab and Amazon EC2. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
