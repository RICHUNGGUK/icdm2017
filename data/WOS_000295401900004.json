This agent is capable of learning and remembering events and any related information such as corresponding procedures, stimuli and their emotional valences. In our model, emotions play a role in the encoding and remembering of events. This allows the agent to improve its behaviour or by remembering previously selected behaviours which were influenced by its emotional mechanism. Moreover, the architecture incorporates a realistic memory consolidation process based on a data mining algorithm.", "paper_title": "Human-like learning in a conscious agent", "paper_id": "WOS:000295401900004"}
