Design/methodology/approach - A bibliographic entity consisting of a work and item is represented by bibliographic records. A random sample of records is converted into a sample of progenitor works and bibliographic families for each progenitor are constructed. Findings - 25.75 per cent of progenitor works are derivative; successive derivations with 67.02 per cent appear most frequently. The size of bibliographic families ranges from 1 to 16; older progenitors have larger families. The majority of families have one type of relationship; there is one case with four types. A large proportion, 59.06 per cent, of derivative relationships is not expressed explicitly by catalogue. Research limitations/implications - Research of bibliographic records representing more than one work is needed. It is also important to find out what catalogue users are looking for: a work or an item? Practical implications - A model for COBIB is suggested; it enables an equal identification of works, items and relationships. A cataloguer must create an authority record for each work and link it with corresponding bibliographic records for items. Originality/value - Information about relationships should be incorporated into the catalogue and corresponding records linked. Explicit control of derivative relationships would be of great help to catalogue users and would make information retrieval improved and more precise; it would also allow more efficient use of knowledge and library materials.", "paper_title": "Derivative bibliographic relationships in the Slovenian online catalogue COBIB", "paper_id": "WOS:000246242400007"}
