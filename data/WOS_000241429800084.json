A more realistic 3D facade model is developed by employing the multiple projection planes using sparsely distributed feature points and the sharp corner detection using perpendicular distances between a vertical plane and its feature points. In addition, the location-based image indexing enables stable providing of the 3D image mosaics in X3D format over the Web, using tile segmentation and direct reference to memory address for the selective retrieval of the image-slits around user's location.", "paper_title": "X3D web service using 3D image mosaicing and location-based image indexing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800084"}
