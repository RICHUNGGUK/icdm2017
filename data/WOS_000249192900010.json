In this paper, we propose RSVP extensions for real-time services to guarantee the QoS with RSVP in heterogeneous wireless networks. We set an inter-system, \"QoS Manager,\" between the gateways of wireless local area networks (WLANs) and cellular networks to manage the mobility of mobile users, and use the scheme of resource pre-reservation to reduce the delay time of re-routing while handoff occurs and guarantee the QoS of real-time services efficiently. Simulation results show that our proposed approach can reduce 52% waste of the whole network resources as the number of the WLANs is set to 40. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
