AFS (axiomatic fuzzy set) algebra was proposed by Liu [X Liu, The fuzzy theory based on AFS algebras and AFS structure, journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 217 (1998) 459-478; X. Liu, The topology on AFS algebra and AFS structure, journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications 217 (1998) 479-489], which is a semantic methodology relating to the fuzzy theory. Combining above two theories, we propose AFS formal concept, which can be viewed as the generalization and development of monotone concept proposed by Deogun and Saquer (2003). Moreover, we show that the set of all AFS formal concepts forms a complete lattice. AFS formal concept can be applied to represent the logic operations of queries in information retrieval. Furthermore, we give an approach to find the AFS formal concepts whose intents (extents) approximate any element of AFS algebra by virtue of rough set theory. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
