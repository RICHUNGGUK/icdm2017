Forward-looking reverse order fault simulation is an efficient static test compaction process similar to reverse order fault simulation, but with the advantage that it results in test sets that do not contain any unnecessary tests. The application of test compaction procedures to n-detection test sets is important since the test sets are larger than conventional test sets. We demonstrate that forward-looking reverse order fault simulation produces smaller test sets than reverse order fault simulation and measure the quality of the resulting test sets by their bridging fault coverage.", "paper_title": "Forward-Looking Reverse Order Fault Simulation for n-Detection Test Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000269155200012"}
