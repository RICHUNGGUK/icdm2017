Significant binding of arginine through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds of the arginine guanidinium protons to the TiO2 surface oxygen atoms is observed, allowing attachment of proteins to titania surfaces in the construction of bio-sensitized solar cells. GIAO-B3LYP/6-31G(d) NMR calculation of a three-layer model based on the experimental structure of this TiO2 modification gives an excellent reproduction of the experimental value (-927 ppm) within +/- 7 ppm, however, the change in relative chemical shifts, EFGs and CSA suggest that the effect of the electrostatic arginine binding might be too small for experimental detection.", "paper_title": "Arginine interactions with anatase TiO2 (100) surface and the perturbation of Ti-49 NMR chemical shifts - a DFT investigation: relevance to Renu-Seeram bio solar cell", "paper_id": "WOS:000291041800024"}
