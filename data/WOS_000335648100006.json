MB is flexible, movable and a powerful replacement for static beacons. The path of a MB within a field of interest is a determining factor of the success of an algorithm. In static paths, the path is determined a priori, often following a fixed pattern and potentially limited by the concrete terrain of the field. Conversely a dynamic path, which is based on the demand of sensors in the field in a real time, is more flexible and applicable in practice. In this paper, a localisation algorithm that is based on a MB dynamic path is proposed which avoids typical complications and heavy computations to save energy in sensors. Simulation results show that the algorithm can settle sensors within a short walking distance of autonomous MB.", "paper_title": "Dynamic path of mobile beacon in localisation of wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000335648100006"}
