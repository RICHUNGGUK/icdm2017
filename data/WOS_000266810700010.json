The combination of these methods is often complicated since hybridization requires a discrete approximation of the time derivative whereas with the MOL, it should remain continuous. In this paper, we use the new mass lumping technique developed in Younes et al. [Younes, A., Ackerer, R, Lehmann, F., 2006. A new mass lumping scheme for the mixed hybrid finite element method. International journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 67, pp. 89-107.] for the MHFE method. With this formulation, the MOL is easily implemented and sophisticated time integration packages can be used without significant amount of work. Numerical simulations are performed on both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media to show the efficiency and robustness of the developed scheme. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
