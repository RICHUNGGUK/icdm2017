The tautologies, which we use, are natural combinatorial principles: the Least Number Principle (LNPn) and a variant of the Induction Principle (IPn). LNPn is known to be easy for resolution. We prove that its relativisation is hard for resolution, and, more generally, the relativisation of LNPn iterated d times provides a natural separation between Res (d) and Res (d + 1). We prove the same result for the iterated relativisation of Ip(n) if the tree-like proof system Res* (d) is considered instead of Res (d).", "paper_title": "Relativisation provides natural separations for resolution-based proof systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200017"}
