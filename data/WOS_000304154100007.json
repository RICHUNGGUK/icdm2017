As it turns out, multi-perspective modelling is primarily a new methodology, using existing modelling techniques but extending the modelling hierarchy with a new epistemological level which integrates the different perspectives. The methodology will be presented in some detail, and its use will be demonstrated by analyzing an example taken from a socio-political context.", "paper_title": "Multi-perspective modelling of complex phenomena", "paper_id": "WOS:000304154100007"}
