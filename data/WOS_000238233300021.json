In this scheme the flip-flops are grouped into N scan chains. At any time, only one scan chain is active during scan test. Therefore, both average power and peak power are reduced compared with conventional full scan test methodology. This paper also proposes a tabu search-based approach to minimize test application time. In this approach we handle the information during deterministic test efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach drastically reduces both average power and peak power dissipation at a little longer test application time on various benchmark circuits.", "paper_title": "A low power deterministic test using scan chain disable technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233300021"}
