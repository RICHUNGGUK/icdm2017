Our proposed method fuses simple audiovisual features, and measures the \"tempos\" of a movie directly, especially that of long-term ones. These tempos form a curve that catches the high-level semantics of a movie, indicating the events of interests named as \"story intensity.\" Through tempo, the proposed algorithm provides a natural way that segments a movie into manageable parts. As our experimental results demonstrate, the condensed skimming clips efficiently extract semantic content that contains the most interesting and informative parts of the original movie.", "paper_title": "Movie story intensity representation through audiovisual tempo analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000267487100003"}
