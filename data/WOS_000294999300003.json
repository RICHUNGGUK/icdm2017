In particular, we support to split an application such that various parts of it are moved to different clouds. This split can be done manually or by support of optimization algorithms. The split application is then automatically provisioned in the different target clouds. A metamodel for such applications supporting the proposed method is introduced. The architecture of a supporting tool is described. Experiences from the usage of the proposed method are reported.", "paper_title": "MOVING APPLICATIONS TO THE CLOUD: AN APPROACH BASED ON APPLICATION MODEL ENRICHMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000294999300003"}
