The main aim of the course is learning to solve a real problem by developing a real system. The students learn skills to adapt this system to new scenarios. The system consists of a wireless module, a microcontroller and an application for smartphones to control lights by wireless communications. In order to motivate students, JavaME and Android, the important technologies for today's smartphones were chosen. As a result of the course, following the Bologna guidelines, the students worked cooperatively, like in a real scenario. Each group member worked in a complementary manner by analyzing the division of tasks for each student. We followed project-based methodology has provided an incremental learning to students. According to results, students responded to the course survey that they are knowledgeable on how embedded systems work after taking the course. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
