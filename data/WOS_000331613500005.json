In the protocol, the helper selection process is divided into the priority differentiation phase and the contention resolution phase for the helpers with the same priority. A higher priority helper can choose an earlier minislot in the priority differentiation phase to send a busy tone. As a result, the protocol promptly selects all the highest priority helpers. The contention resolution phase of the same priority helpers consists of k round contention resolution procedures. The helpers that had sent the first busy tone and are now sending the longest busy tone can continue to the next round, and then the other helpers that sense the busy tone withdraw from the contention. Therefore, it can select the unique best helper from the highest priority helpers with high probability. A packet piggyback mechanism is also adopted to make the high data rate helper with packet to send transmit its data packets to its recipient without reservation. It can significantly decrease the reservation overhead and effectively improve the cooperation efficiency and channel utilization. Simulation results show that the maximum throughput of CRP-CMAC is 74%, 36.1% and 15% higher than those of the 802.11 DCF, CoopMACA and 2rcMAC protocols in a wireless local area network (WLAN) environment, and 82.6%, 37.6% and 46.3% higher in an ad hoc network environment, respectively.", "paper_title": "CRP-CMAC: A Priority-Differentiated Cooperative MAC Protocol with Contention Resolution for Multihop Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000331613500005"}
