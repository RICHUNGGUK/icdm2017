Thus, the nonlinear optical coefficients of a series of macrocyclic thiophene derivatives (C[3T_DA] (n) with C (n) symmetry) were studied, and their electronic structures, UV-Vis spectra and static second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities (beta (0)) were computed. The calculated results showed that Delta E (H-L) increased and the UV-Vis spectrum redshifted as the number of C[3T_DA] units increased (one C[3T_DA] unit consists of trithiophene and diacetylene). The value of beta (0) calculated by either the ZINDO-SOS or the FF method showed the same trend: the absolute value of beta (0) increased as the number of units increased. The value of beta (0) predicted by ZINDO-SOS was an order of magnitude larger than that predicted by the FF method. However, the results suggest that macrocyclic thiophene compounds potentially exhibit large static second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities.", "paper_title": "Computational study of the electronic structures, UV-Vis spectra and static second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of macrocyclic thiophene derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000298756500037"}
