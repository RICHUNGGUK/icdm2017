Our approach extends the triple product algorithm by using local-frame parameterization, spherical wavelets, per-pixel shading and visibility textures. Storing BRDFs with local-frame parameterization allows us to handle complex BRDFs and incorporate bump mapping more easily. In addition, it greatly reduces the data size compared to storing BRDFs with respect to the global frame. The use of spherical wavelets avoids uneven sampling and energy normalization of cubical parameterization. Finally, we use per-pixel shading and visibility textures to remove the need for fine tessellations of meshes and shift most computation from vertex shaders to more powerful pixel shaders. The resulting system can render scenes with realistic shadow effects, complex BRDFs, bump mapping and spatially-varying BRDFs under varying complex illumination and changing view at real-time frame rates on modern graphics hardware.", "paper_title": "Real-time triple product relighting using spherical local-frame parameterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000240381000011"}
