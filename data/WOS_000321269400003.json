From the beginning, we assume that the logical layer network has the same structure as the lower physical layer network, and then we use link-removal strategy in which a fraction of links with maximal product (k(i) * k(j)) are removed from the logical layer, where k(i) and k(j) are the degrees of node i and node j, respectively. Traffic load is strongly redistributed from center nodes to noncenter nodes. The traffic capacity of whole complex system is enhanced several times at the expense of a little average path lengthening. In two-layer network model, the physical layer network structure is unchanged and the shortest path routing strategy is used. The structure of upper layer network can been constructed freely under our own methods. This mechanism can be employed in many real complex systems to improve the network traffic capacity.", "paper_title": "ENHANCING TRAFFIC CAPACITY OF TWO-LAYER COMPLEX NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000321269400003"}
