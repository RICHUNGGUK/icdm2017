The production process turns out to provide a physical analogy for projection filters in topology optimization. Blueprints supplied by the designers cannot be directly used as inputs to lithographic processes due to the proximity effect which causes rounding of sharp corners and geometric interaction of closely spaced design elements. Therefore, topology optimization is applied as a tool for proximity effect correction. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the robust projection filter can be used to account for uncertainties due to lithographic production processes which results in manufacturable blueprint designs and eliminates the need for subsequent corrections.", "paper_title": "On the similarities between micro/nano lithography and topology optimization projection methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000325080700003"}
