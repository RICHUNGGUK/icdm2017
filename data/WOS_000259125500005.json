To enable agents to deal with dynamism and change, adaptive task assignment approaches are needed. In this paper, we study two approaches for adaptive task assignment that are characteristic for two classical families of task assignment approaches. FiTA is a field-based approach in which tasks emit fields in the environment that guide idle agents to tasks. DynCNET is a protocol-based approach that extends Standard Contract Net (CNET). In DynCNET, agents use explicit negotiation to assign tasks. We compare both approaches in a simulation of an industrial automated transportation system. Our experiences show that: (1) the performance of DynCNET and FiTA are similar, while both outperform CNET; (2) the complexity to engineer DynCNET is similar to FiTA but much more complex than CNET; (3) whereas task assignment with FiTA is an emergent solution, DynCNET specifies the interaction among agents explicitly allowing engineers to reason on the assignment of tasks, (4) FiTA is inherently robust to message loss while DynCNET requires substantial additional support. The tradeoff between (3) and (4) is an important criteria for the selection of an adaptive task assignment approach in practice.", "paper_title": "A field-based versus a protocol-based approach for adaptive task assignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000259125500005"}
