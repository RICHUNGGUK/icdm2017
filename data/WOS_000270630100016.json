We employ techniques and methods from computational geometry to design an optimization algorithm and an efficient 1/2-approximation algorithm for the problem, and employ the optimization algorithm to design a PTAS based on the shifting strategy [Hochbaum DS, Maass W. Approximation schemes for covering and packing problems in image processing and VLSI. Journal of the ACM 1985:32:130-6]. As a byproduct we improve the algorithm for placing obnoxious facilities given by Katz et al. [Improved algorithms for placing undesirable facilities.
