The remaining six duality states are possible in linear semi-infinite programming whereas two of them are precluded in linear programming as a consequence of the existence theorem and the non-homogeneous Farkas Lemma. This paper characterizes the linear programs and the continuous linear semi-infinite programs whose duality state is preserved by sufficiently small perturbations of all the data. Moreover, it shows that almost all linear programs satisfy this stability property.", "paper_title": "Primal-dual stability in continuous linear optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000256964400008"}
