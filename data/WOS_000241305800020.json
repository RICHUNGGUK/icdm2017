In both cases, the goal is to prevent unauthorized copying of copyrighted material, by tracing at least one guilty user when illegal copies appear. The most well-known collusion-secure code is due to Boneh and Shaw (1995/98). In this paper we improve the decoding algorithm by using soft output from the inner decoder, and we show that this permits using significantly shorter codewords.", "paper_title": "Soft decision decoding of Boneh-Shaw fingerprinting codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241305800020"}
