Sparse representation based classification (SRC) algorithm was developed and successfully used for classification. In this paper, a kernel sparse representation based classification (KSRC) algorithm is proposed. Samples are mapped into a high dimensional feature space first and then SRC is performed in this new feature space by utilizing kernel trick. Since samples in the high dimensional feature space are unknown, we cannot perform KSRC directly. In order to overcome this difficulty, we give the method to solve the problem of sparse representation in the high dimensional feature space. If an appropriate kernel is selected, in the high dimensional feature space, a test sample is probably represented as the linear combination of training samples of the same class more accurately. Therefore, KSRC has more powerful classification ability than SRC. Experiments of face recognition, palmprint recognition and finger-knuckle-print recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of KSRC.
