Complete and user-friendly software for fast and bias-free automated analysis has not been reported yet. Results: We developed a framework for the automated detection, tracking and analysis of individual GUVs on digital microscopy images. Our tool is suited to quantify protein binding to membranes as well as several aspects of membrane permeabilization on single vesicles. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach by comparing alternative activation methods for Bax, a pore-forming protein involved in mitochondrial permeabilization during apoptosis.", "paper_title": "Automated analysis of giant unilamellar vesicles using circular Hough transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000338109200052"}
