We propose two new mix designs based on the Binomial mix which can host not one but multiple message selection algorithms. The MBSP mix runs a single and randomly chosen binomial-based algorithm at a time, which selects messages from the mix's single pool. The MBIP mix concurrently runs multiple algorithms and associates each with a separate pool. By comparing the proposed mix designs with the standard CDF-based Binomial mix and multiple other mixes, we show a significant improvement in security and performance: the strongest known (n - 1) blending attack and the known passive attack on the Binomial mix are rendered impractical; mixing traffic with different latency/security requirements is made possible; and predicting the behaviour of a mix is made more difficult.
