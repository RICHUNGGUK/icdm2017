It is possible that an employee of an organization needs to access resource of another organization. While languages like XACML are very good for access control of a single organization, they are not able to address interoperability issues of such federations. Lack of interoperability of access control policies does not allow someone to access remote resources. In this paper we propose an approach by augmenting with knowledge-base. Ontology that will facilitate access control policies to provide resources of remote organizations. In addition, we introduce a new effect of the rule, partial permit in our application domain (Geo-Spatial). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
