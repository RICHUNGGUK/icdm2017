We transform an RNA secondary structure into linear sequences not only differentiating paired bases from free bases but also considering the stacks and loops of the RNA secondary structure. Then we use two suitable distance measures based on the relative information between the linear sequences using Lempel-Ziv complexity, the pair-distance matrix thus obtained can be used to construct, phylogenetic trees. The proposed approach does not require sequence alignment. The algorithm has been successfully constructed phylogenies for two data sets.", "paper_title": "Comparisons of RNA Secondary Structures Based on LZ Complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000275842600019"}
