We present a survey of algorithms that perform dictionary learning and sparse coding and make three contributions. First, we compare our overcomplete dictionary learning algorithm (FOCUSS-CNDL) with overcomplete independent component analysis (ICA). Second, noting that once a dictionary has been learned in a given domain the problem becomes one of choosing the vectors to form an accurate, sparse representation, we compare a recently developed algorithm (sparse Bayesian learning with adjustable variance Gaussians, SBL-AVG) to well known methods of subset selection: matching pursuit and FOCUSS. Third, noting that in some cases it may be necessary to find a non-negative sparse coding, we present a modified version of the FOCUSS algorithm that can find such non-negative codings. Efficient parallel implementations in VLSI could make these algorithms more practical for many applications.", "paper_title": "Learning sparse overcomplete codes for images", "paper_id": "WOS:000243559800008"}
