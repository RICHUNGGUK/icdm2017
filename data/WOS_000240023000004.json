Test vector compression has been an active area of research, yielding a wide variety of techniques. This article summarizes and categorizes these techniques, explaining how they relate to one another. The goal is to provide a framework for understanding the theory and research in this area.", "paper_title": "Survey of test vector compression techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000240023000004"}
