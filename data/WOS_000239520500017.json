Each player offers new software components or services to support their technology. In these multi-vendor environments there is a genuine need for integration and interoperability. Integration and interoperability is a first step, once this is achieved components can seamlessly use services from different providers, and that is when service policies come into play. A policy mechanism allows fine grained control over the service usage. The OSGi Service Platform allows seamless integration of components and services but lacks a well defined mechanism for dynamic service policy management. Two approaches are presented for enhancing the OSGi Service Platform with policies. The first approach extends the platform while the second one adapts the plug-in components. Finally they are compared and evaluated against multiple requirements; usability, performance, transparency and backward compatibility.", "paper_title": "Service policy enhancements for the OSGi service platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000239520500017"}
