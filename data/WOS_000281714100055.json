Chromaligner resolves peak shifts by a constrained chromatogram alignment. For a collection of chromatograms and a set of defined peaks, Chromaligner aligns the chromatograms on defined peaks using correlation warping (COW). Chromaligner is faster than the original COW algorithm by k(2) times, where k is the number of defined peaks in a chromatogram. It also provides alignments based on known component peaks to reach the best results for further chemometric analysis.", "paper_title": "Chromaligner: a web server for chromatogram alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000281714100055"}
