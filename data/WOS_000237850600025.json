In both cases, the algorithms already described in the literature often require a huge number of elementary operations. In this paper, we describe a class of velocity selective filters which yield an accurate detection of the edges moving in the sequence. We first present a filtering scheme based on a convolution operation computed on a finite size neighborhood and describe its properties in the spatiotemporal and frequency domains. Then. we show that filters with similar properties can be implemented recursively, i.e., as convolutions computed on infinite-size neighborhoods. As an example, we finally show the filters responses in the case of two superimposed translational motions.", "paper_title": "Velocity selective filters recursively implemented in the spatiotemporal domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000237850600025"}
