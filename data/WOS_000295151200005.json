We specifically focus on two vulnerabilities that current trust and reputation systems have: the change of identity and multiple identities problems. As a result, we provide a privacy preserving solution to these vulnerabilities which integrates the explored relationships among identity, privacy, trust and reputation. We also provide a prototype of our solution to these vulnerabilities and an application scenario. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
