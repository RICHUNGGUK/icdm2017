A novel adaptive neural control scheme is presented for this class of systems, based on a combination of the Razumikhin functional approach, the backstepping technique and the neural network (NN) parameterization. The proposed adaptive controller guarantee that all the error variables are 4-Moment semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in a compact set while the system output converges to a small neighborhood of the reference signal. Two simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
