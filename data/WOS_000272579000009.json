The directional-gradient concentration method has been applied to the pleura surface and combined with a morphological opening-based procedure to generate a list of nodule candidates. Each nodule candidate is characterized by 12 morphological and textural features, which are analyzed by a rule-based filter and a neural classifier. This detection system has been developed and validated on a clataset of 42 annotated CT scans. The k-fold cross validation has been used to evaluate the neural classifier performance. The system performance variability due to different ground truth agreement levels is discussed. In particular, the poor 44% sensitivity obtained on the ground truth with agreement level I (nodules annotated by only one radiologist) with six FP per scan grows up to the 72% if the underlying ground truth is changed to the agreement level 2 (nodules annotated by two radiologists).
