We study algorithms which are based on a characterization of edge-weighted trees by distances to LCAs (Least Common Ancestors). This characterization enables a direct application of ultrametric reconstruction techniques to trees which are not necessarily ultrametric. A simple and natural neighbor joining criterion based on this observation is used to provide a family of efficient neighbor-joining algorithms. These algorithms are shown to reconstruct a refinement of the Buneman tree, which implies optimal robustness to noise under criteria defined by Atteson. In this sense, they outperform many popular algorithms such as Saitou and Nei's NJ. One member of this family is used to provide a new simple version of the 3-approximation algorithm for the closest additive metric under the l(infinity) norm. A byproduct of our work is a novel technique which yields a time optimal O(n(2)) implementation of common clustering algorithms such as UPGMA.", "paper_title": "Neighbor joining algorithms for inferring phylogenies via LCA distances", "paper_id": "WOS:000245435100001"}
