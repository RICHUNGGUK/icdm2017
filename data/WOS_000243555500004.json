They have addressed issues such as reactions to advisory radio and variable message signs, use of navigation systems, route diversion, and mode choice. The objective of this paper is to present the design and implementation of a different kind of travel simulator. GABRIEL (Gis Activity-Based tRavel sImuLator) has as a foundation the activity-based approach and makes use of geographic information systems (GIS) as a development environment. The simulation scenario consists of a commute trip where two activities take place. En-route to the first destination, congestion occurs and subjects are requested to take action based on a set of alternatives. The simulator provides re-routing, destination substitution, dynamic geographic information and real-time information to aid users in their decision-making process. As a result it helps subjects in developing their ability to adapt given a particular scenario and allow researchers in understanding trip making, activity rescheduling, and the decision-making process from a comprehensive perspective.", "paper_title": "GABRIEL: Gis activity-based tRavel sImuLator.
