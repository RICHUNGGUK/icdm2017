In this paper, we first present our test algorithm for eDRAM testing. A theoretical analysis to the leakage mechanisms of a switch transistor is also provided, based on that we can test the eDRAM at a higher temperature to reduce the total test time and maintain the same retention-fault coverage. Finally, we propose a mathematical model to estimate the defect level caused by wear-out defects under the use of error-correction-code circuitry, which is a special function used in eDRAMs compared to commodity DRAMs. The experimental results are collected based on 1-lot wafers with an 16 Mb eDRAM core.", "paper_title": "Testing Methodology of Embedded DRAMs", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518900015"}
