Based on the computational Diffie-Hellman problem, our scheme can be proven existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen-message attacks. Most importantly, our scheme requires short group elements for aggregate signature and constant pairing computations for aggregate verification, which leads to high efficiency due to no relations with the number of signers.", "paper_title": "A Secure and Efficient Certificateless Aggregate Signature Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738500011"}
