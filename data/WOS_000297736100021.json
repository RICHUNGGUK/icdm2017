Macroscopic quantities, such as mean flow velocity, temperature, and density, can be estimated by averaging the corresponding microscopic behavior of the particles. The two main subjects that should be considered in the averaging over the particles in a specific problem are spatial and temporal behaviors of them. In this paper, we study the latter. Because of the chaotic nature of the collisions among the molecules and consequently their random path, extracted macroscopic values fluctuate about their average values causing statistical errors. In this paper, an averaging method called SAM-Modified-CAM (SMC) will be proposed for the measurement of mean velocity that reduces statistical errors in its calculation. This proposal is based on the study conducted here on the implementations of two common averaging methods, sample-averaged measurement (SAM) and cumulative average measurement (CAM) in molecular dynamics. In addition, convergence of mean flow velocity measurement is thoroughly discussed, and a convergence criterion is proposed for this purpose. Implementation of the proposed method in different test cases has approved its reliable performance.
