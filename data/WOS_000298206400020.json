The consequent part of the proposed FIS is expressed as a nonlinear combination of the input variables, which can be obtained by introducing an implicit mapping from the input space to a high dimensional feature space. The proposed learning algorithm consists of two phases. In the first phase, the antecedent fuzzy sets are estimated by the kernel-based fuzzy c-means clustering. In the second phase, the consequent parameters are identified by support vector machine whose kernel function is constructed by fuzzy membership functions and the Gaussian kernel. The performance of the proposed model is verified through several numerical examples generally used in fuzzy modeling. Comparative analysis shows that, compared with the zero-order fuzzy model, first-order fuzzy model, and polynomial fuzzy model, the proposed model exhibits higher accuracy, better generalization performance, and satisfactory robustness.
