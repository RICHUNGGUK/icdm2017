Although not new, virtualization and automation are core features that characterize Cloud Computing. In this paper, we intend to explore the possibility of integrating cloud services with educational scenarios without re-defining neither the technology nor the usage scenarios from scratch. Our suggestion is based on certain solutions that have already been implemented and tested for specific cases.", "paper_title": "Using Cloud Services to Develop Learning Scenarios from a Software Engineering Perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000328542200002"}
