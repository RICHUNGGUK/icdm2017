The first part of the paper is an overview of TMTO methodology and summarizes earlier work on hardware implementation of TWO and exhaustive search attacks. The second part of the paper develops a cost model for analysing the effectiveness of generic attacks. Analysis of the cost model shows that 128-bit keys seem safe for the present. However, key sizes less than 96 bits do not provide comfortable security assurances. This is particularly relevant for the 80-bit stream ciphers in the Ecrypt call for stream ciphers as well as for the A5/3 encryption algorithm used in GSM mobile phones.", "paper_title": "On the effectiveness of TMTO and exhaustive search attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630900024"}
