The first strategy, referred to as adaptive selection of sample size, is employed to balance the tradeoff between quality measure of fitness and run-time complexity. The second strategy is concerned with determining statistical expectation, instead of conventional averaging, of fitness samples as the measure of fitness of the trial solutions. The third strategy attempts to extend Goldberg's method to compare slightly worse trial solutions with its competitor by a more statistically viable comparator to examine possible placement of the former solution in the Pareto optimal front. The traditional differential evolution for multiobjective optimization algorithm has been modified by extending its selection step with the proposed strategies. Experiments undertaken to study the performance of the extended algorithm reveal that the extended algorithm outperforms its competitors with respect to three performance metrics, when examined on a test suite of 23 standard benchmarks with additive noise of three statistical distributions. The extended algorithm has been applied on the well known box-pushing problem, where the forces and torques required to shift the box by two robots are evaluated to jointly satisfy the conflicting objectives on task-execution time and energy consumption in presence of noise on range estimates from the sidewalls of the workspace. The application justifies the importance of the proposed noise-handling strategies in practical systems.", "paper_title": "Uncertainty Management in Differential Evolution Induced Multiobjective Optimization in Presence of Measurement Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000342278400009"}
