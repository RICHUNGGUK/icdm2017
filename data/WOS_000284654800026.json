Regional aid in the form of central stockpiles and resource redistribution can help mitigate the resulting demand surge. This paper discusses a resource allocation approach for optimizing regional aid during public health emergencies. We find that, optimal response involves delaying the distribution of resources from the central stockpile as much as possible. Also, smaller counties stand to benefit the most from mutual aid. And finally, policy level decisions that alter the objectives of pandemic relief efforts can significantly impact the allocations to affected regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
