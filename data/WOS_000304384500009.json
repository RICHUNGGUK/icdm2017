An original Finite Volume Time Domain (FVTD) method has been developed to solve Maxwell's equations coupled with a simplified fluid plasma model and is described in this paper. This method is illustrated with the study of the shielding of a metallic aperture by the plasma generated by an incident high power electromagnetic wave. Typical results obtained with the FVTD method for this shielding problem are shown. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
