In this paper, we further strengthen the result by showing that the list-decodability of random Euclidean self-orthogonal codes is as good as that of general random codes as well, i.e., achieves the classical Gilbert-Varshamov bound. In particular, we show that, for any fixed finite field F-q, error fraction delta is an element of (0, 1 - 1/q) satisfying 1 - H-q(delta) <= 1/2, and small epsilon > 0, with high probability a random Euclidean self-orthogonal code over F-q of rate 1 - H-q(delta) - epsilon is (delta, O(1/epsilon))-list-decodable. This generalizes the result of linear codes to Euclidean self-orthogonal codes. In addition, we extend the result to list decoding symplectic dual-containing codes by showing that the list-decodability of random symplectic dual-containing codes achieves the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound as well. This implies that list-decodability of quantum stabilizer codes can achieve the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound. The counting argument on self-orthogonal codes is an important ingredient to prove our result.", "paper_title": "On the List-Decodability of Random Self-Orthogonal Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000348298400011"}
