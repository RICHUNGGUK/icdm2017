Our proposed phenotype classifier is an ensemble method with k-top-scoring decision rules. Each rule involves a number of genes, a rank comparison relation among them, and a class label. Current classifiers, which are also ensemble methods, consist of k-top-scoring decision rules. Some of these classifiers fix the number of genes in each rule as a triple or a pair. In this paper, we generalize the number of genes involved in each rule. The number of genes in each rule ranges from 2 to N, respectively. Generalizing the number of genes increases the robustness and the reliability of the classifier for the class prediction of an independent sample. Our algorithm saves resources by combining shorter rules in order to build a longer rule. It converges rapidly toward its high-scoring rule list by implementing several heuristics. The parameter k is determined by applying leave-one-out cross validation to the training dataset.", "paper_title": "Microarray Data Classifier Consisting of k-Top-Scoring Rank-Comparison Decision Rules With a Variable Number of Genes", "paper_id": "WOS:000274736500007"}
