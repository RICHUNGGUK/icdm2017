On the basis of this classification different network types are studied and their characteristics illustrated by means of simple one-dimensional nonlinear examples. For multidimensional problems, which are affected by the curse of dimensionality, the idea of spherical wavelet functions is considered. The behaviour of these networks is also studied for modelling of a low-dimension map.", "paper_title": "A taxonomy for wavelet neural networks applied to nonlinear modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000254949400004"}
