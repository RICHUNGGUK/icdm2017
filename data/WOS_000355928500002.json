A new condition of compatibility between the given topology and the indifference associated to the main trace of an interval order is introduced. Provided that this condition is fulfilled, a semiorder has a continuous interval order representation through a pair of continuous real-valued functions. Other necessary and sufficient conditions for the continuous representability of interval orders are also discussed, and, in particular, a characterization is achieved for the particular case of interval orders defined on a topological space of finite support.", "paper_title": "Continuous Representability of Interval Orders: The Topological Compatibility Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000355928500002"}
