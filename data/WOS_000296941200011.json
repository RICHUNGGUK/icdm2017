The parameter of Gaussian kernel function is a scalar that has significant influences on final results. However, until now, it is still unclear how to choose an optimal kernel parameter. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven method to optimize the Gaussian kernel parameter, which only depends on the original dataset distribution and yields a simple solution to this complex problem. The proposed method is task irrelevant and can be used in any Gaussian kernel-based approach, including supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Simulation experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the obtained results. A user-friendly online calculator is implemented at: www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/kernel/ for public use.
