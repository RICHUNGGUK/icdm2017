Method: The intrinsic TR-LIFS decays ore expanded on a Laguerre basis, and the computed laguerre expansion coefficients (LEC) are used to characterize the sample fluorescence emission. The method was applied for the diagnosis of atherosclerotic vulnerable plaques. Results: At a first stage, using a rabbit atherosclerotic model, 73 TR-LIFS in-vivo measurements from the normal and atherosclerotic aorta segments of eight rabbits were taken. The laguerre deconvolution technique was able to accurately deconvolve the TR-LIFS measurements. More interesting, the LEC reflected the changes in the arterial biochemical composition and provided discrimination of lesions rich in macrophages/foam-cells with high sensitivity (> 85%) and specificity (> 95%). At a second stage, 348 TR-LIFS measurements were obtained from the explanted carotid arteries of 30 patients. Lesions with significant inflammatory cells (macrophages/foam-cells and lymphocytes) were detected with high sensitivity (> 80%) and specificity (> 90%), using LEC-based classifiers. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated the potential of using TR-LIFS information by means of LEC for in vivo tissue diagnosis, and specifically for detecting inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions, a key marker of plaque vulnerability.", "paper_title": "New methods for time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy data analysis based on the Laguerre expansion technique - Applications in tissue diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000244967200024"}
