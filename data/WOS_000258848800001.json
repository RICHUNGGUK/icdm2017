In particular, the ontology layer of the often-discussed semantic web is based on description logics (DLs) and defines important challenges for current system implementations. The article introduces and evaluates optimization techniques for the instance retrieval problem w.r.t. the description logic SHIQ(D(n))(-), which covers large parts of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We demonstrate that sound and complete query engines for OWL-DL can be built for practically significant query classes. Experience with ontologies derived from database content has shown that it is often necessary to effectively solve instance retrieval problems with respect to huge amounts of data descriptions that make up major parts of ontologies. We present and analyze the main results about how to address this kind of scalability problem.", "paper_title": "On the scalability of description logic instance retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000258848800001"}
