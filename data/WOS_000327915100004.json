Many protocols have been proposed to build byzantine-fault-tolerant storage services on top of a message-passing system, but they do not consider the possibility to have servers joining and leaving the computation (churn phenomenon). This phenomenon, if not properly mastered, can either block protocols or violate the safety of the storage. In this paper, we address the problem of building a safe register storage resilient to byzantine failures in a distributed system affected from churn. A protocol implementing a safe register in an eventually synchronous system is proposed and some feasibility constraints on the arrival and departure of the processes are given. The protocol is proved to be correct under the assumption that the constraint on the churn is satisfied. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
