This paper proposes architecture-level statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) models for the near-threshold voltage computing where the path delay distribution is approximated as a lognormal distribution. First, we prove several important theorems that help consider architectural design strategies for high performance and energy efficient near-threshold computing. After that, we show the numerical experiments with Monte Carlo simulations using a commercial 28 nm process technology model and demonstrate that the properties presented in the theorems hold for the practical near-threshold logic circuits.", "paper_title": "Statistical Timing Modeling Based on a Lognormal Distribution Model for Near-Threshold Circuit Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466800010"}
