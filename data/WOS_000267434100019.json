The ability to predict the influence of the process parameters of RIE is crucial in terms of machine performance as they may have a serious impact on product quality as well as on the probability of machine failure. To address this issue, this correspondence paper presents a novel performance tradeoff function for evaluating the overall suitability of adopting the predicted control parameters suggested by domain experts, taking into full consideration their impact on the performance of the machine involved. An experiment using the RIE machine is provided to validate the practicability of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A Performance Tradeoff Function for Evaluating Suggested Parameters in the Reactive Ion Etching Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000267434100019"}
