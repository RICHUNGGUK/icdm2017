User authentication is an important security mechanism for recognizing legal roaming users. The traditional message authentication schemes are impractical for the mobility network due to limited computation, energy resources of mobile clients, and network dynamics, etc. This article will present a new efficient authentication scheme for roaming user so that a more secure and safe living environment is possible. In addition, the proposed method could provide complete functionality because: (1) no password table is required by the home agent; (2) users can freely choose their own passwords; (3) it provides mutual authentication between the user and the foreign agent; (4) user may update their password after the registration phase; (5) session key agreement is generated by the user and the foreign agent for each session; (6) lower communication cost; (7) mobile user anonymity property is provided. Finally, the proposed scheme is more suitable for mobile clients and smart-card users. It can be applied into mobile applications in the future smart living environments.", "paper_title": "User Authentication with Anonymity for Roaming Service with Smart Cards in Global Mobility Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000324972600002"}
