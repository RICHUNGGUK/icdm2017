In this paper, we combine the cloud platform and mobile devices to compensate for the lack of medical resources in certain remote areas. We also use cryptographic technology to protect the patient's personal information; additionally, the technology can authorize the medical treatment. The proposed scheme can minimize the misuse of medical resources; patients can employ a simple password and use mobile devices to log in to the public cloud such that the authentication, integrity, privacy and non-repudiation issues can be satisfied. Our scheme can also satisfy other specific security requirements. For example: defend against offline password guessing attacks, replay attacks, impersonation attacks, man-in-middle attacks and insider attacks; this is done without the need to maintain a verification table.", "paper_title": "DESIGNING A HEALTHCARE AUTHORIZATION MODEL BASED ON CLOUD AUTHENTICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000340132500005"}
