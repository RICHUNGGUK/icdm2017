Here, the \"serviceability failure\" is said to occur when the excavation-induced wall or ground movement exceeds specified limiting values. Knowledge of this probability can aid in engineering decision-making to prevent damage to adjacent infrastructures. The proposed framework consists of five elements: (1) finite element method (FEM) for analyzing wall and ground responses in a braced excavation, (2) fuzzy set modeling of parameter uncertainty, (3) spatial averaging technique for handling spatial variability, (4) vertex method for processing fuzzy input through FEM model, and (5) interpretation of fuzzy output. The proposed framework is demonstrated through a well-documented case history. The results show the proposed framework is simple and effective for assessing the probability of serviceability failure in a braced excavation in a spatially random field. To focus on the proposed fuzzy FEM approach, the scope of this paper is limited to one-dimensional modeling of spatial variability with an assumed exponential autocorrelation function.
