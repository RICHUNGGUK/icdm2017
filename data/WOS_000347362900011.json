We also provide a set of high-performance programs targeted both to single and multi-core processors. They compute multivariate PDFs by means of kernels, the optimal bandwidth using smoothed bootstrap and the index of agreement between multidimensional PDFs. Their use is illustrated with two case-studies. The first one assesses the ability of seven global climate models to reproduce the seasonal cycle of zonally averaged temperature. The second case study analyzes the ability of an oceanic reanalysis to reproduce global Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Surface Height. Results show that the proposed methodology is robust to variations in the optimal bandwidth used. The technique is able to process multivariate datasets corresponding to different physical dimensions. The methodology is very sensitive to the existence of a bias in the model with respect to observations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
