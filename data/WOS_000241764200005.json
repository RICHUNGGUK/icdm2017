Our system retrieves pairs of alpha-helices based on contact map similarity, then transfers and adapts the structure information to an unknown helix pair. We show that similar protein contact maps predict a similar three-dimensional protein structure. The success of this method provides support for the notion that changing representations can enable similarity metrics in case-based reasoning.", "paper_title": "Visio-spatial case-based reasoning: A case study in prediction of protein structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000241764200005"}
