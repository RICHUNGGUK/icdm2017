In this goal, we consider the numerical micro-macro Maxwell-Schrodinger-Plasma model originally presented by Lorin et al. [9,10]. Although this model is, in theory, applicable to large domains, due to its computational complexity, only short distances of propagation could be considered (less than 1 mm so far, see [9]). In the present paper, we explore some simple, but fast and accurate techniques allowing to reduce the computational complexity by a large factor (up to 60) and then to consider larger domains. This reduction is naturally essential to make this model relevant to study realistic laser-matter interactions at a macroscopic scale. Numerical simulations are proposed to illustrate the chosen approach. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
