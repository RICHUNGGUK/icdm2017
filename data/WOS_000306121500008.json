This LED driver has 500: 1 current sensing ratio and 1 kHz PWM dimming frequency. The maximum output current of the buck converter is 100 mA and the output voltage range is from 3.5 to 4.8 V with a 20 and 18 mu H off-chip capacitor and inductor, respectively. The maximum efficiency of the proposed LED driver is 87.8 % and the current difference between each LED string is 1.33 %. And it is fabricated with TSMC 0.35 mu m 2P4 M CMOS processes. The chip area is 1.52 mm x 1.36 mm.", "paper_title": "A high-efficient WLED driver using light-balanced-controlled techniques with current-locked loops", "paper_id": "WOS:000306121500008"}
