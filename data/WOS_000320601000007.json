The proposed algorithm is based on a chaotic mapping and a dynamic blocking, operating in the DWT domain. The framework of the proposed embedding algorithm consists of a special encoding process that has used a chaotic map for producing the embedding key (first key) (in the LL (3) step of the DWT domain). Because of using Arnold's Cat Map, the key can be produced in the extraction phase without the need for the presence of the original or transmitted information. This phase utilized the special dynamic blocking method and wavelet coefficient quantization (HL (3) or LH (3)) too. The wavelet quantization process sends the sequence (second key) for completion of the extraction phase. Because of the fact that both watermark embedding and detection are accomplished without using the original image, the algorithm claims that it is blind. In the simulation phase, first the approach is examined in the absence of attacks, and then expands the model to allow intentional and unintentional attacks. The experimental result demonstrates that the embedded watermark survives severe image attacks such as adding noise, JPEG compression and median filter. Both the robustness and the security can be well proved by the proposed watermarking algorithm. The robustness of the watermarked image has been verified on the parameters of PSNR and NC.
