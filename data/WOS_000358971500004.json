It describes the data distribution system for Xiaoqushan Submarine Comprehensive Observation and Marine Equipment Test Platform (XSCOMETP). Based on the design of C/S architecture, the overall system establishes a communication link between the observation infrastructure and the data center using Socket technology. The Data Distribution System for XSCOMETP was developed by C# in the .NET framework, which enabled multi-source and heterogeneous data to be acquired, interpreted and stored in real time. The system can be divided into three functional modules including data acquisition and transmission, data interpretation and storage, and data display. Given the successful trial from August 11, 2013, the data distribution solution proposed in this paper could be a useful reference implementation to the East China Sea Seafloor Observation System.
