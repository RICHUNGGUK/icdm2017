Crossover operations here are particularly utilized as a systematic means to generate several possible solutions from two superior solutions. To test the effectiveness of the method, it has been applied to the resource-constrained project scheduling problem. The computational experiments show that the application of the method to this problem is promising.", "paper_title": "An Accelerating Two-Layer Anchor Search with Application to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000285059500009"}
