Also, performance evaluation of fan design under different operating conditions is evidently in great demand for practical engineering applications. Therefore, this comprehensive investigation is aimed at offering the overall technical information for thoroughly evaluating fan performance. An 80 mm-diameter backward-inclined centrifugal fan is chosen to serve as the research subject for demonstration purposes. Numerical results are utilized to perform detailed flow visualization, torque calculation, efficiency estimation, and noise analysis. The results indicate that the fan performance curve and the sound pressure level (SPL) spectrum of the experiment agree with those of numerical simulations. In addition, this study proposes two modification alternatives based on the flow visualization at each operating point, having verified the successful enhancement of fan performance via numerical calculation. Consequently, this study establishes an integrated aerodynamic, acoustic, and electro-mechanical evaluation scheme that can be used as an essential tool for fan designers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
