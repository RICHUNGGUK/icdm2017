The block-based discrete cosine transform with motion compensation hybrid coding scheme has been widely employed by most available video coding standards, notably the ITU-T H.26x and ISO/IEC MPEG-x families and video part of China audio video coding standard (AVS). The objective of this paper is to provide a review of the developments of the four basic building blocks of hybrid coding scheme, namely predictive coding, transform coding, quantization and entropy coding, and give theoretical analyses and summaries of the technological advancements. We further analyze the development trends and perspectives of video compression, highlighting problems and research directions.", "paper_title": "Review of the current and future technologies for video compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000275537700001"}
