However, there are two issues which drag the customers' attention: 1) When will the tasks expect for termination (response time) under a specific resource scheduling; 2) What is the best scheduling solution by considering cost. In order to reply these two questions, a Kriging based forecasting and scheduling system has been proposed in this paper. With the cooperation between the scientific designer and the cloud designer, the design variables for evaluating the cloud applications can be achieved; Kriging surrogate model is then introduced to simulate the approximate functional relationship between the design variables and the response time of the tasks; Sequential quadratic programming optimization algorithm then provides the best scheduling solution for the tasks if cost constraints are to be met. Two real scientific computing cloud applications have been testified on an OpenStack cloud platform, with consequences described in details. The work in this paper has put forward a novel way for the designers and the customers on predictable and reasonable scheduling strategies for the various resource-intensive scientific computing cloud applications with surrogate models and optimization algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Kriging Based Forecasting and Scheduling System for Scientific Computing Cloud Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968300024"}
