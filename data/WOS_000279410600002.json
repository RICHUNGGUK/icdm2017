Each stage of the approach is controlled by a Graphical User Interface which allows a team of non-expert modellers to compare the outcomes of multiple model simulations and to decide what further simulation is needed. A distinguishing feature of the method is that it allows the goal of the management strategies to arise as a result of the interaction between the user and the model, rather than being defined a priori, as well as to change during the process in response to the information and the insight such modelling may provide. We envisage that a management team, rather than a single user, may also employ the method as an avenue for communication, in order to discuss the potentially conflicting aspects of different model outcomes along the path to finding workable compromises. We discuss an application of the approach to the sustainable management of a recreational fishery in a marine park in Western Australia. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
