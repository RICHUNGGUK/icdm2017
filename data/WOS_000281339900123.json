This study thus examines key factors, including self-efficacy, expectancy theory and organizational climate, on the software workers to intent to share knowledge, using a social cognitive framework. Programmers and software workers in Taiwan were surveyed to test the proposed research model. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) technique were used to analyze the data and evaluate the research model. Results showed that that the research model fit the data well and the main determinants of knowledge-sharing behavior were the encouraging intentions of knowledge intensive workers. We confirm our hypothesis that knowledge sharing self-efficacy and outcome expectancy, as well as organizational climate, will affect individual intentions to share knowledge. Additionally, organizational climate and perceived managerial incentive were found to positively encourage knowledge-sharing behavior. Research and practical implications are described.
