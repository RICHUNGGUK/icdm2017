The proposed method using reversed-scanning algorithm to reduce time and it don't need overwriting or erase the whole flash memory. After sensitive data pages are found, the program targetedly overwriting some blocks, erase them, and insert them into free block list waiting to be located again which means the blocks will be twice overwrited by new data.", "paper_title": "Secure Data Sanitization for Android Device Users", "paper_id": "WOS:000369374300006"}
