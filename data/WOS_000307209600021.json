We claim that energy management should be incorporated at the planning stages to produce an effective energy-management operation. For this, we propose a mathematical framework that takes into account the trade-off of capital expenditures vs. energy-related operational ones when designing the network. We also present results that put into relevance the impact of different coverage policies on energy efficiency.
