Passive Optical Networks (PONs) are believed to be the best technology for deploying broadband access networks. As new services evolve, end-users also expect PONs to be highly dependable. Yet, operators are not willing to deploy protection in access networks unless it is cost-efficient Hence, this paper aims at performing a thorough cost analysis of different protection mechanisms in PONs. PON physical layout, infrastructure sharing and design decisions are captured by means of a network geometric model. Also, the dynamic dependability behavior of PONs is modeled with the aid of a Markov cost model. Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the whole model. This way, a novel protection mechanism for PONs is proposed and assessed. Based on the results, the most cost-efficient protection scheme for PONs is identified. Finally, an important trade-off between Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and dependability-related Operational Expenditures (OPEX) regarding PON physical layout is presented and solved, giving guidelines for designing PONs where the total cost is reduced.
