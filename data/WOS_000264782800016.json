Most of the conventional techniques for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in rotating machinery are based chiefly on analyzing the difference of vibration signal amplitude in the time domain or frequency spectrum. Unfortunately, in some applications, the vibration signal may not be available and the performance is limited. However, the sound emission signal serves as a promising alternative to file fault diagnosis system. In the present study, the sound emission of gear-set is used to evaluate the proposed fault diagnosis technique. lit the experimental work, a continuous wavelet transform technique combined with a feature selection of energy spectrum is proposed for analyzing fault signals in a gear-set platform. The artificial neural network techniques both using probability neural network and conventional back-propagation network are compared in the system. The experimental results pointed out the sound emission can be used to monitor the condition off the gear-set platform and the proposed system achieved a fault recognition rate of 98% in the experimental gear-set platform.
