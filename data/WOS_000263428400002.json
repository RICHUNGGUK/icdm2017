First, a kinematic controller is introduced for the wheeled mobile robot. Secondly, the adaptive sliding-mode dynamic controller is proposed to make the real velocity of the wheeled mobile robot reach the desired velocity command, although the wheeled mobile robot is even with system uncertainties and disturbances. The convergence of the complete equations of motion of the wheeled mobile robot is proved by the Lyapunov stability theory. Computer simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes. Finally, the real-time experiments of the adaptive sliding-mode dynamic controller on the test ground demonstrate the feasibility of practical wheeled mobile robot maneuvers. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
