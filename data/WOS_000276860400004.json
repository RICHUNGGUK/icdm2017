We propose a scalable real-time monitoring method to aggregate large amounts of data from various sensor devices distributed over different domain areas. The real-time monitoring scheme can process data from sensor devices within deadline and is scalable based on the number of sensor devices. The scalability of monitoring can be improved by employing a hierarchical monitoring agent for sensor devices while still satisfying the data deadlines. Simulation results show that our real-time monitoring scheme can improve the met deadline ratio up to 27% compared to the previous schemes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
