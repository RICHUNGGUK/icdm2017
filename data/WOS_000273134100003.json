This study complements recent results showing how limited or noisy feedback can boost the reliability of communication. A strategy with fixed input distribution is given that asymptotically achieves rates arbitrarily close to the mutual information induced by and the state-averaged channel. When the capacity-achieving input distribution is the same over all channel states, this achieves rates at least as large as the capacity of the state-averaged channel, sometimes called the empirical capacity.", "paper_title": "Zero-Rate Feedback Can Achieve the Empirical Capacity", "paper_id": "WOS:000273134100003"}
