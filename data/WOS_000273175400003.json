In the first phase, we identify the outlier candidates-the pixels that are likely to be corrupted by impulse noise. We consider that the remaining data pixels are essentially free of outliers. Then in the second phase, the image is deblurred and denoised simultaneously by a variational method by using the essentially outlier-free data. The experiments show several dB's improvement in PSNR with respect to the typical variational methods.", "paper_title": "Fast Two-Phase Image Deblurring Under Impulse Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000273175400003"}
