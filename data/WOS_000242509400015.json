(ii) The validity of the generated proxy signature can only be verified by a subset of the designated verifiers. This article, however, will demonstrate a security leak inherent in Tzeng et al.'s scheme that any verifier can check the validity of the proxy signature by himself with no help of other verifiers. That is, Tzeng et al.'s scheme cannot achieve their claimed security requirement. Finally, we will propose an improvement to eliminate the pointed out security leak. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
