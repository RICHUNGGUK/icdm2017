Our research question is: in addition to task-technology fit, does individual-technology fit or individual-task fit matter in users' attitude and performance in the multi-tasks and multi-DSS models context? We first divide the concept of task-individual-technology fit into three dimensions - task-technology fit (TTF), individual-technology fit (IT(e)F), and task-individual fit (T(a)IF) - so that we can explore mechanisms and effects of interaction among these factors (i.e., task, individual difference, and technology). We then propose a two-phase view of task-individual-technology fit (i.e., pre-paradigm phase and paradigm phase) based on Kuhn's concept of revolutionary science. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment with multiple DSS models and decision-making tasks to test our hypotheses. Results confirmed our arguments that in the paradigm phase, the effects of individual differences on user attitudes toward DSS models can be ignored and that in the pre-paradigm phases individual differences play an important role. In addition, we found that effects of individual difference can be a two-blade sword: IT(e)F can enhance but T(a)IF can diminish users' attitude to DSS model (i.e., technology). Our results also suggested that different dimensions of fit may affect performance directly or indirectly. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
