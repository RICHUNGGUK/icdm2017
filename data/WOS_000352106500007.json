Specifically, the proposed infrastructure takes the advantages of the cloud platform and 5G technology to achieve its goals, where mobile users (connected with some external video taking device) can share their real-time video with their friends or families through the cloud while any other user with no permission cannot get any information about the video. More importantly, the infrastructure security is guaranteed even if the cloud server is hacked. In addition, our infrastructure also allows secure searching within the user's own video data. We believe our solution is practical to be deployed in the existing telecommunication platforms.", "paper_title": "Secure Sharing and Searching for Real-Time Video Data in Mobile Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000352106500007"}
