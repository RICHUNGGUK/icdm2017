Our framework can be adapted to languages other than English by replacing language-specific components. It supports the two major approaches to question answering, knowledge annotation and knowledge mining. Ephyra uses the web as a data resource, but could also work with smaller corpora. In addition, we propose a novel approach to question interpretation which abstracts from the original formulation of the question. Text patterns are used to interpret a question and to extract answers from text snippets. Our system automatically learns the patterns for answer extraction, using question-answer pairs as training data. Experimental results revealed the potential of this approach.", "paper_title": "A pattern learning approach to question answering within the Ephyra framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500086"}
