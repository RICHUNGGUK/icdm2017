The interface location and the time evolution of the free surface boundary condition are both approximated by means of level set techniques on a fixed domain. The interface velocity is obtained via a Galerkin boundary integral solution of the 3D axisymmetric Laplace equation. A short-time analytical solution of the Raleigh-Taylor instability in a liquid column is available, and this result is compared with our numerical experiments to validate the algorithm. The method is capable of handling pinch-off and after pinch-off events, and simulations showing the time evolution of the fluid tube are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
