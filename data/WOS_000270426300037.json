However, Adachi et al. thought that Rivest and Shamir's Pay Word scheme suffered from a vulnerability to credit abuse attack and bank falsification attack. Therefore, they proposed an improved version to prevent these attacks in 2005. Unfortunately, there are still some drawbacks. First, the efficiency is degraded because the improved version using a public key cryptosystem. Second, it is vulnerable to an unauthorized settlement attack because it does not satisfy the requirement of authentication. Third, they change the Pay Word scheme front a postpaid to a prepaid payment method. It is not practical because it is good for the vendor but is not fair to the customer. In this paper, we propose an authenticated PayWord scheme to eliminate these drawbacks and enhance the performance. Our scheme does not require a public key cryptosystem and the customer's rights can be assured.", "paper_title": "AN AUTHENTICATED PAYWORD SCHEME WITHOUT PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOSYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000270426300037"}
