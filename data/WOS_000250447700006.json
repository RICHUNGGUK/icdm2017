A novel receiver for current-sensing results in static power savings and allows an easier transition from current-sensing to traditional full rail voltage signals. Measurements of hybrids on a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology show significant gains over repeater insertion in delay across wire lengths. Hybrids can also be used in placement constrained and low-noise scenarios to achieve delay and power benefits.", "paper_title": "Current-sensing and repeater hybrid circuit technique for on-chip interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000250447700006"}
