We instead study aggregate user behavior and the retweet graph with a focus on quantitative descriptions. We find that the lifetime tweet distribution is a type-II discrete Weibull stemming from a power law hazard function, that the tweet rate distribution, although asymptotically power law, exhibits a lognormal cutoff over finite sample intervals, and that the inter-tweet interval distribution is a power law with exponential cutoff. The retweet graph is small-world and scale-free, like the social graph, but less disassortative and has much stronger clustering. These differences are consistent with it better capturing the real-world social relationships of and trust between users than the social graph. Beyond just understanding and modeling human communication patterns and social networks, applications for alternative, decentralized microblogging systems-both predicting real-word performance and detecting spam-are discussed.", "paper_title": "Aggregate Characterization of User Behavior in Twitter and Analysis of the Retweet Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000351020400004"}
