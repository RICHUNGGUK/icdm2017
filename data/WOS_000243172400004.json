The proposed approximation deals with the problem in two stages. In the first one, the most important motions are segmented; in the second one, the optical flow is estimated on the basis of the motions detected in the previous stage. To extract relevant motions, a new approach based on a spatio-temporal filtering is presented. The approach groups together parts of a moving object that have been separated into various filter responses because of the object's spatial structure, thereby avoiding the spatial dependency problem associated with a representation based on spatio-temporal filters. The proposed model, therefore, generates one \"motion pattern\" for each motion detected in the sequence. To obtain an optical flow estimation, which is able to represent multiple velocities, the gradient constraint is applied to the output of each filter so that multiple estimations of the velocity at the same location may be obtained. For each \"motion pattern\" detected in the previous stage, the velocities at a given point corresponding to the same motion are then combined using a probabilistic approach. In the application to optical flow estimation, the use of \"motion patterns\" allows multiple velocities to be represented, while the combination of estimations from different filters helps reduce the aperture problem. This technique is illustrated on real and simulated data sets, including sequences with occlusion and transparencies.", "paper_title": "A new approach to motion pattern recognition and its application to optical flow estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000243172400004"}
