By considering Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) as the underlying formalizing tool, we use logic-based techniques in order to offer novel solutions to identify user's influence in a social network. We propose the use of the Simplification Logic SLFD for attribute implications as the core of an automated method to build a structure containing the complete set of influences among users.
