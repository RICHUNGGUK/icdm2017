To be more precise, sum of squares techniques are used to solve at each sampling instant a finite horizon optimal control problem which arises in nonlinear model predictive control for discrete time polynomial systems. The combination of nonlinear model predictive control and sum of squares techniques is motivated by the successful application of semidefinite programming in linear model predictive control. The advantages and disadvantages of applying sum of squares techniques to nonlinear model predictive control are illustrated on a small example.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear model predictive control and sum of squares techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137700015"}
