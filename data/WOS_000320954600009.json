The density per particle, commonly called the shape function, can thus be used as the fundamental descriptor of systems with rapidly decaying external potentials. This result is analogous to a result that is known for Coulomb potentials. Possible extensions of the result to include broader classes of external potentials and alternative density-like descriptors are discussed.", "paper_title": "The density per particle can be used as the fundamental descriptor for systems with rapidly decaying external potentials", "paper_id": "WOS:000320954600009"}
