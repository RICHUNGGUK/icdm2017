Computational demands to simulate PG for ICs with increasing complexity is never-ending. Cloud computing platforms can be leveraged to mitigate costs associated with making these resources available. However, since simulation data usually contains sensitive design information, simulating on third-party platforms lead to major security concerns. In this paper, we propose a framework for secure PG simulation on Cloud. A transformation algorithm to hide current excitations is presented, while still allowing a majority of computations to be completed on Cloud. We employ multiple compression strategies to significantly reduce communication overheads. Experiments show that our framework can achieve similar turn-around time as an insecure simulator on Cloud, while securing current excitations and output voltage vectors with reasonable communication and computational overheads.", "paper_title": "Secure Power Grid Simulation on Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000351764500009"}
