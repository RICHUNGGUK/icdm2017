This model includes the Lindley, gamma and exponential distributions as and other forms of Lindley distributions as special cases. Lindley distribution based on two gamma with two consecutive shape parameter is investigated in some details. Statistical and reliability properties of this model are derived. The size-biased, the length-biased and Lorenze curve are established. Estimation of the underlying parameters via the moment method and maximum likelihood has been investigated and their values are simulated. Finally, fitting this model to a set of real-life data is discussed.", "paper_title": "A new generalized Lindley distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000361612800004"}
