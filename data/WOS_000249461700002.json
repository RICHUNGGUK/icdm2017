In this network, there are g groups of d processors each and the g(2) couplers are used for connecting each group with each of the groups, including itself. In this paper, we present a technique for optimally simulating a frequently arising hypercube communication pattern on this network for all combinations of values of d and g. Specifically, we show that one-hop movements on the hypercube along the same dimension can be simulated on the POPS(d,g) network in [d/g] slots for d not equal g and in 2 slots for d = g.", "paper_title": "Optimal hypercube simulation on the partitioned optical passive stars network", "paper_id": "WOS:000249461700002"}
