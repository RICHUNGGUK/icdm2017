The algorithm is based on a semi-implicit method for the time discretization and has a nine-point local stencil in space. Our scheme is fast, quite accurate and demonstrates good spatial convergence. The presented numerical tests show that it is well suited for hydrocodes with cell-centered principal variables. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
