A global location-based structure called transfer posts are adopted to act as the data forwarding stations among sink nodes and source nodes with mobility. Multiple source nodes share the transfer posts. The sink nodes can easily request or collect data through transfer posts in which store the location information of source nodes. Evaluation results show that our approach consumes less energy compared to recently results such as two-tier data dissemination (TTDD) [3] and Railroad [6]. We have resolved the problem of query forwarding and data delivering among mobile sinks and multiple sources with the remarkable performance.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient data dissemination in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600058"}
