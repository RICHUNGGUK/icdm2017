We apply the polynomial regression and response surface analysis to explain the nonlinear relationships. The results show the perceived behavioral control which is a critical part of the planned behavior theory is not a significant predictor to electronic library adoption, while the subjective norms and attitude are the two significant predictors. Furthermore, the nonlinear relationship between subjective norms and attitude is identified. It is a negative synergy between subjective norms and attitude in E-repository adoption where users have volitional control over their use of the system. Increasing in subjective norms has a decreasing marginal impact on usage intention when the attitude is high; while increasing in attitude has a decreasing marginal impact on usage intention when the subjective norms are high.", "paper_title": "LINEAR AND NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIPS ON E-REPOSITORY ADOPTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000358338700006"}
