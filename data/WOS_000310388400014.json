Initially, the modal decomposition technique is applied to the SDP to formulate it as an infinite-dimensional singular perturbation model of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). An approximate nonlinear ODE system that captures the slow dynamics of the SDP is thus derived by singular perturbations. Subsequently, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is employed to represent the finite-dimensional slow system, which is used as the basis for the control design. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is then developed for the design of multiobjective fuzzy controllers such that the closed-loop SDP is exponentially stable, and L-2 an performance bound is provided under a prescribed H-infinity constraint of disturbance attenuation for the slow system. Furthermore, using the existing LMI optimization technique, a suboptimal fuzzy controller can be obtained in the sense of minimizing the L-2 performance bound. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the control of the temperature profile of a catalytic rod.", "paper_title": "A Multiobjective Optimization Based Fuzzy Control for Nonlinear Spatially Distributed Processes With Application to a Catalytic Rod", "paper_id": "WOS:000310388400014"}
