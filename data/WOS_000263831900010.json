Determining a resident's location in the smart home or smart office is a key to such a system. This correspondence presents an enhanced location-recognition algorithm using a Bayesian classifier for the pyroelectric infrared sensor-based indoor location-aware system that is a nonterminal-based location-aware system proposed in a previous paper. This correspondence compares the conventional and enhanced location-recognition algorithms and their performance. The feasibility of the system is evaluated experimentally on a test bed.", "paper_title": "Resident Location-Recognition Algorithm Using a Bayesian Classifier in the PIR Sensor-Based Indoor Location-Aware System", "paper_id": "WOS:000263831900010"}
