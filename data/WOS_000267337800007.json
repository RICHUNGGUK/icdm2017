These oscillators are identical, although they can have a small frequency difference. In the first method, a strobe line that toggles exactly once with every frame of n-bit data is used to activate the oscillators. Local counters are used to count the number of bits in the data frame and to stop the local oscillators when the frame has been processed. In the second method, a single physical line is used to transmit both data and (in-band) control information, further reducing the power dissipation. The data transmission is controlled by the output of a starter flip-flop that indicates the empty/full state of an input buffer. whereas the data reception is controlled by the decoding of a \"1\" start bit and a \"0\" end bit, both of which are added to the n-bit data word to form a frame. Circuit simulation results demonstrate that both communication methods have high bandwidth and low power dissipation.", "paper_title": "Two high-performance and low-power serial communication interfaces for on-chip interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000267337800007"}
