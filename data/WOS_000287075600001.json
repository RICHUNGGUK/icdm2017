Regarding visual performance the results showed that display type, character size, interline spacing had significant effects on search time. Electrophoretic electronic ink display had a shorter search time than chlorestic liquid crystal display. Searching time decreased as character size and interline spacing increased. Ambient illumination, display type, character size, and interline spacing had significant effects on accuracy. Accuracy was highest for 1500 lx ambient illumination. Accuracy of electrophoretic electronic ink display was greater than chlorestic liquid crystal display. Accuracy increased as character size and interline spacing increased. Regarding visual fatigue, results showed that light source and ambient illumination had non-significant effects on change of critical flicker fusion (CFF) and subjective visual fatigue. Results could be able to provide some guidelines for consumers to choose a suitable electronic paper according to lighting condition and set appropriate character size and interline spacing.
