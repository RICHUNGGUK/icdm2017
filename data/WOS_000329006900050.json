We perform simulations based on 3GPP Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) parameters to compare the performance of an adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) using relay protocols of AF, DF, and DMF with non-adaptive MCS, with the same relay protocols. We analyze the performance of the proposed scheme and observe how the proposed AMC scheme with DMF performs at various Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) regions. The simulation results have shown that the performance of the proposed AMC scheme with relay protocols of DMF is much better at lower and a higher SNR regions and also provides higher average throughput.", "paper_title": "Novel Relay Protocol Using AMC Based Throughput Optimization in LTE-Advanced System", "paper_id": "WOS:000329006900050"}
