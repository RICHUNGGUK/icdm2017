The DRX method was proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and since then, the traffic behavior has been analyzed in several studies with a standard 3-state DRX model to describe the trade-off between power saving and delay. In this paper, we presented a novel 4-state and 5-state 3GPP LIE DRX mechanisms. The proposed mechanisms were developed by augmenting (an) active state(s) to deep and/or light sleep cycle of standard 3-state DRX for handling a small burst of packets, thereby bypassing the process of returning to the timer-dependent active mode. We have generated analytical models using a semi-Markov process for bursty packet data traffic and evaluated these augmented DRX mechanisms against a standard 3-state DRX method. Overall, the analytical results from varying timing parameters showed that our augmented DRX (both 4-state and 5-state) improved power saving factor (ranging between 1% and 8%) and reduced delay (ranging between 20% and 60%) compared to the standard 3-state DRX. Furthermore, the magnitude of improvement for both delay and power-saving was somewhat greater in 5-state than 4-state. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
