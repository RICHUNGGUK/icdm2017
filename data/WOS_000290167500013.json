Since it is difficult to estimate the exact partial correlation under the small-n large-situation, a sparseness constraint is generally introduced. In this paper, we consider the sparse linear regression model with a l(1)-norm penalty, also known as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), for estimating sparse brain connectivity. LASSO is a well-known decoding algorithm in the compressed sensing (CS). The CS theory states that LASSO can reconstruct the exact sparse signal even from a small set of noisy measurements. We briefly show that the penalized linear regression for partial correlation estimation is related to CS. It opens a new possibility that the proposed framework can be used for a sparse brain network recovery. As an illustration, we construct sparse brain networks of 97 regions of interest (ROIs) obtained from FDG-PET imaging data for the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children and the pediatric control (PedCon) subjects. As validation, we check the network reproducibilities by leave-one-out cross validation and compare the clustered structures derived from the brain networks of ASD and PedCon.", "paper_title": "Sparse Brain Network Recovery Under Compressed Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000290167500013"}
