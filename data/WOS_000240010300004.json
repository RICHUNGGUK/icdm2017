However, a user equipment (UE) may not be allowed to roam or hand off from UNITS to a private-lPv4 GPRS network. In this paper, we utilize SIP mobility and an automatic IPv6 tunneling mechanism, called Teredo, to support roaming/handoff of a UE between different networks. We have developed the first non-commercial Linux-based Teredo mechanism, and compared our solution with other Teredo implementations in the public domain. Our study indicates that our solution can reduce the tunneling overhead and transmission delay over two other implementations by 44-74%.
