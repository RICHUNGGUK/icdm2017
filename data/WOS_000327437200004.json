By assuming a small image displacement between frames, which is a property of high-frame rate vision, we develop an improved boosting-based face tracking algorithm for fast face tracking by enhancing the Viola-Jones face detector. In the improved algorithm, face detection can be efficiently accelerated by reducing the number of window searches for Haar-like features, and the tracked face pattern can be localized pixel-wise even when the window is sparsely scanned for a larger face pattern by introducing skin color extraction in the boosting-based face detector. The improved boosting-based face tracking algorithm is implemented on a GPU-based high-speed vision platform, and face tracking can be executed in real time at 500 fps for an 8-bit color image of 512 x 512 pixels. In order to verify the effectiveness of the developed face tracking system, we install it on a two-axis mechanical active vision system and perform several experiments for tracking face patterns.", "paper_title": "500-fps face tracking system", "paper_id": "WOS:000327437200004"}
