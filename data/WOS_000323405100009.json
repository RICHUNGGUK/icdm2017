The adoption of 3D NoC design depends on the performance and manufacturing cost of the chip. This article presents methods for allocating and placing a minimal number of vertical links and the corresponding vertical routers to achieve specified performance goals. A second optimization step allows to maximize redundancy in order to deal with failing TSVs. Globally optimal solutions are determined for the first time for meshes up to 17 x 17 nodes in size. A 64-core 3D NoC is modeled based on state-of-the-art 2D chips. We present benchmark results using a cycle accurate full system simulator based on realistic workloads. Experiments show that under different workloads, an optimal placement with 25% of vertical connections achieved 81.3% of average network latency and 76.5% of energy delay product, compared with full layer-layer connection. The performance with 12.5% and 6.25% of vertical connections are also evaluated. Our analysis and experiment results provide a guideline for future 3D NoC design. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
