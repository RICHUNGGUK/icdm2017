We use a standard approach for predicting the load in the next 10 min, while, for a forecast horizon of one day, we represent the data with a high-dimensional multi-variate TS, where the number of variables is equivalent to the quantity of measurements registered in a day. Through the orthogonal transformation returned by PCA decomposition, we reduce the dimensionality of the TS to a lower number k of distinct variables; this allows us to cast the original prediction problem in k different one-step ahead predictions. The overall forecast can be effectively managed by k distinct prediction models, whose outputs are combined together to obtain the final result. We employ a genetic algorithm for tuning the parameters of the ESN and compare its prediction accuracy with a standard autoregressive integrated moving average model.", "paper_title": "Short-Term Electric Load Forecasting Using Echo State Networks and PCA Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200147"}
