In such a process, pacemaker oscillators attach to the original network following an exclusively dynamical criterion oriented to entrain the network. Under these conditions, we show that successful entrainment always corresponds to the generation of a scale-free topology in the original graph.", "paper_title": "Generation of scale-free topology in complex networks by phase entrainment", "paper_id": "WOS:000270003300003"}
