NextSlidePlease is a slideware application that addresses these challenges using a directed graph structure approach for authoring and delivering multimedia presentations. The application combines novel approaches for searching and analyzing presentation datasets, composing meaningfully structured presentations, and efficiently delivering material under a variety of time constraints. We introduce and evaluate a presentation analysis algorithm intended to simplify the process of authoring dynamic presentations, and a time management and path selection algorithm that assists users in prioritizing content during the presentation process. Results from two comparative user studies indicate that the directed graph approach promotes the creation of hyperlinks, the consideration of connections between content items, and a richer understanding of the time management consequences of including and selecting presentation material.", "paper_title": "NextSlidePlease: Authoring and Delivering Agile Multimedia Presentations", "paper_id": "WOS:000312211900005"}
