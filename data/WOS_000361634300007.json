This extension is obtained by substituting the usual quadratic proximal term by a class of convex nonquadratic entropy-like distances, called phi-divergences. A study of the convergence rate of this new proximal point method under mild assumptions is given, and further it is shown that this estimate rate is better than the available one of proximal-like methods. Some applications are given concerning general convex minimizations, linearly constrained convex programs and variationnal inequalities.", "paper_title": "Entropy-Like Minimization Methods Based On Modified Proximal Point Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000361634300007"}
