The present paper proposes a new model which may be appropriate for a square ordinal table if it is reasonable to assume an underlying bivariate skew normal distribution with equal marginal variances. Simulations are used to investigate the fitting of new model for bivariate skew normal distribution. The decayed teeth data are analyzed by using the new model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
