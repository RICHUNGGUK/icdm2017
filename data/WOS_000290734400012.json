Current CA rule extraction approaches are both time consuming and inefficient when selecting neighborhoods. We give a novel approach to identifying CA rules from observed data and selecting CA neighborhoods based on the identified CA model. Our identification algorithm uses a model linear in its parameters and gives a unified framework for representing the identification problem for both deterministic and probabilistic CA. Parameters are estimated based on a minimum variance criterion. An incremental procedure is applied during CA identification to select an initial coarse neighborhood. Redundant cells in the neighborhood are then removed based on parameter estimates, and the neighborhood size is determined using the Bayesian information criterion. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our algorithm and that it outperforms other leading CA identification algorithms.", "paper_title": "Fast Rule Identification and Neighborhood Selection for Cellular Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000290734400012"}
