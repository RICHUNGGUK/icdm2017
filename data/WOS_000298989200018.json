This paper studies the class of linear-feedback codes that includes (non-linear) nonfeedback codes at one extreme and the linear-feedback codes by Schalkwijk and Kailath, Ozarow, and Kramer at the other extreme. The linear-feedback sum-capacity C-L(N, P) under symmetric power constraints P is characterized, the maximum sum-rate achieved by linear-feedback codes when each sender has the equal block power constraint P. In particular, it is shown that Kramer's code achieves this linear-feedback sum-capacity. The proof involves the dependence balance condition introduced by Hekstra and Willems and extended by Kramer and Gastpar, and the analysis of the resulting nonconvex optimization problem via a Lagrange dual formulation. Finally, an observation is presented based on the properties of the conditional maximal correlation-an extension of the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi maximal correlation-which reinforces the conjecture that Kramer's code achieves not only the linear-feedback sum-capacity, but also the sum-capacity itself (the maximum sum-rate achieved by arbitrary feedback codes).", "paper_title": "Linear-Feedback Sum-Capacity for Gaussian Multiple Access Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000298989200018"}
