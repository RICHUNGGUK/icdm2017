There has been a trade-off in previous studies between the computational costs and the equivalent qualities of test forms. To alleviate this problem, we propose an automated system of test construction based on the Bees Algorithm in parallel computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system through various experiments.", "paper_title": "Bees Algorithm for Construction of Multiple Test Forms in E-Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000294857500003"}
