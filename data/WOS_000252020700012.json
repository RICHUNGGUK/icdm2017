The algorithm analyzes the circuit and replaces intermediate registers with delay elements under the condition that the circuit works correctly at given target clock-period range with the smaller area. Experiments with pipelined multipliers verify that the proposed algorithm can reduce the area of a pipelined circuit without degrading performance.", "paper_title": "Low area pipelined circuits by the replacement of registers with delay elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700012"}
