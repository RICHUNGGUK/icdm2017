The journal Statistics and Computing has been instrumental in enhancing the interaction between them over the past quarter century. This has been a period of dramatic change in each of the disciplines, where huge progress has been made, in both fundamental theory and in practice and applications. But it has also been a period of dramatic change in scientific publishing. The evolution of Statistics and Computing has reflected both changes, putting it at the cutting edge of progress. But these changes have not reached an end. We can confidently expect even more startling progress in the disciplines and change in the practice of scientific publishing in future years. It is vital that Statistics and Computing keeps pace.", "paper_title": "Statistics and computing: the genesis of data science", "paper_id": "WOS:000356828600002"}
