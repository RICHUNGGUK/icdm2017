Relying on an alternative formulation of the shallow water equations that involves the free surface as a conservative variable, instead of the water height, we introduce a simple discretization of the bed slope source term, together with some suitable conservative variables reconstructions. The resulting scheme is automatically consistent and well-balanced, for any given consistent numerical flux for the homogeneous system. We obtain a very simple formulation, which do not need to be modified when second order accuracy MUSCL reconstructions are adopted. Additionally, the positivity of the water height is preserved under a relevant stability condition, as soon as the numerical flux for the associated homogeneous system does. Numerical assessments, involving dry areas and complex geometry are performed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
