It presents a single-step linear matrix inequality (LMI) method for the fuzzy control design, which overcomes the drawback of the two-step LMI approach often encountered in the literature. The derivation relies mainly on a proposed matrix decoupling technique using which a resultant matrix inequality can be equivalently converted to strict LMIs. When restricted to delay-free fuzzy systems, the present results improve or reduce to existing ones. Illustrative examples show the effectiveness and merits of the present results.", "paper_title": "Design of observer-based H(infinity) control for fuzzy time-delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257582500021"}
