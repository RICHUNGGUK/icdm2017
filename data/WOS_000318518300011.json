On one hand, OFDM is a promising technique for high-speed data transmission over multipath fading channels and has been considered to be the best candidate for 4G mobile networks. On another hand, the overlay cognitive radio model makes it possible to have two concurrent transmissions in a given interference region, where conventionally only one communication takes place at a given time. We investigate different service provision scenarios and propose both time domain and frequency domain overlay cognitive radio OFDM systems for next generation cellular networks. Numerical results show our proposed schemes can achieve satisfying performance in different use cases.", "paper_title": "OVERLAY COGNITIVE RADIO OFDM SYSTEM FOR 4G CELLULAR NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000318518300011"}
