Local containment enables CPV to guarantee that distant nodes be unaffected by faults. Local stabilization enables CPV to stabilize the network within time depending only on the perturbation size instead of the network size. In CPV, the distance to which the state of a node propagates is proportional to the time the state remains valid. These properties are achieved by reacting to a new fault only after first containing the response to the previous fault. In addition to analytically proving these properties, we evaluate CPV by simulating Internet-type networks with up to 75 autonomous systems; we observe that CPV reduces the number of fault-affected nodes by a factor of 71 and the network convergence time by a factor of 9.2 when compared with BGP.
