To allow dynamism, the actual service invocation of these pipes can be made as a separate action from the pipes subscription. This paper proposes a service invocation admission control algorithm that can be applied to aggregated IP pipes taking into account new service requests and the actual utilization of the domain resources of the subscribed pipes.
