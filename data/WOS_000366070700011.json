The two filters fuse the measurements taken by ultrasonic sensors located onboard the robot. The experimental results on real data show a substantial equivalence of the two filters, although in principle the approximating properties of the UKF are much better. A switching sensors activation policy is also devised, which allows to obtain an accurate estimate of the robot state using only a fraction of the available sensors, with a relevant saving of battery power.
