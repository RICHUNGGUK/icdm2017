Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is an emerging technology and a possible alternative for semiconductor transistor based technologies. A novel fault-tolerant full-adder is proposed in this paper: This component is suitable for designing fault-tolerant QCA circuits. The redundant version of full-adder is simple in structure and more robust than the standard style for this device. By considering two-dimensional arrays of QCA cells, fault properties of such block full-adder can be analyzed in terms of misalignment, missing and dislocation cells. In order to verify the functionality of the proposed device, some physical proofs are provided. The results confirm our claims and its usefulness in designing digital circuits. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
