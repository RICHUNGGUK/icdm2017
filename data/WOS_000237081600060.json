To enable this we propose the (ECA)(2) - Evolving and Context-Aware Event-Condition-Action paradigm for specifying triggers that capture the desired reactive behavior in databases which manage distributed and continuously changing data. Since both the monitored event and the condition part of the trigger may be continuous in nature, we introduce the concept of metatriggers to coordinate the detection of events and the evaluation of conditions.", "paper_title": "Evolving triggers for dynamic environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000237081600060"}
