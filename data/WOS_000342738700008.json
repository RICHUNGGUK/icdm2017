This problem requires us to synthesize a nondeterministic supervisor such that the supervised plant is simulated by a given specification. We assume that a supervisor can observe not only the event occurrence but also the current state of the plant. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a complete supervisor, which is a solution to the similarity control problem. Then, we present a method for synthesizing a maximally permissive similarity enforcing supervisor when the existence condition is satisfied.", "paper_title": "Maximally Permissive Similarity Enforcing Supervisors for Nondeterministic Discrete Event Systems under Event and State Observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738700008"}
