We synthesized customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction models from prior service quality research to provide a comprehensive model predicting the behavioral intentions of customers to reuse 15 services. Five research hypotheses were empirically tested by using a field study of 263 users of an IS service department. Our findings placed IS service quality in a causal network leading to IS service reuse and highlighted the relative importance that service quality value played in predicting behavioral intention to reuse the service.
