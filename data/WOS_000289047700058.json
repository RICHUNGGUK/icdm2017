Amongst methods used in combining classifiers, there are some methods which work on decision template as a tool for modeling behavior of base classifiers in order to label data. This tool models their behavior only based on their final outputs. Our new method, introduces a special structure for decision template such that internal behavior of a neural network base classifier can be modeled in a proper manner suitable for classifiers fusion. The new method builds decision template for each layer of the neural network including all hidden layers. Therefore, the process of making decision in each base classifier is also available for classifiers fusion. Efficiency of the new method is compared with some known benchmark datasets to show how it can improve efficiency of classifiers fusion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
