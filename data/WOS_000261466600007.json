Basing on the elliptic curve cryptosystem, this Study proposes a hierarchical mobile agent framework for handling key management and access control problems between mobile agent and host. It raises the security of key management, and also controls access to distributed environment in non-specific network. The proposed method successfully secures the accessing relationship between the mobile agent and the host while economizing the exhaust of storage space. Such an achievement lets the mobile agent operate efficiently, and puts in order a secure execution environment for mobile computing. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
