First, ME is performed to obtain a motion vector. Then, the OD method is used to refine the MV in the occlusion region. When occlusion occurs, median filtering is applied. Otherwise, bidirectional motion compensated interpolation (BDMC) is applied to create the interpolated frames. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides better performance than the conventional approach. The average gain in the PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) is always better than the other methods in the Full HD test sequences.", "paper_title": "Frame Rate Up-Conversion Using Median Filter and Motion Estimation with Occlusion Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464100052"}
