In contrast to earlier methods, LoCA optimizes explicitly for localized components and allows a flexible trade-off between localized and concise representations, and the formulation of locality is flexible enough to incorporate properties such as symmetry. This paper demonstrates that LoCA can provide intuitive presentations of shape differences associated with sex, disease state, and species in a broad range of biomedical specimens, including human brain regions and monkey crania.", "paper_title": "Exploration of Shape Variation Using Localized Components Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000267050600013"}
