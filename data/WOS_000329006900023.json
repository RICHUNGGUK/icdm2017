This paper mainly focuses on LDE-aware analog circuit synthesis. Our circuit synthesis follows an optimization framework of transistor sizing based on geometric programming (GP) in which analog circuit performances are formulated in terms of monomials and posynomials. Providing GP models for the LDEs such as the shallow trench isolation (STI) stress and the well proximity effect (WPE), we can generate layout constraints related to LDEs during the circuit synthesis. Applying our circuit synthesis to a typical two-stage op-amp, we showed that the resultant circuit, which generated by GP with circuit performance and layout constraints, satisfied all the specifications with the verification of HSPICE simulation based on the BSIM model with LDE options.", "paper_title": "Analog Circuit Synthesis with Constraint Generation of Layout-Dependent Effects by Geometric Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000329006900023"}
