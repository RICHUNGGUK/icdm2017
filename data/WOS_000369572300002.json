Scheduling is a critical and prominent issue in grid computing. An appropriate prediction method for allocating jobs to resources may significantly affect quality of service parameters. In this paper, a hierarchical approach is presented for job scheduling in computational grid utilizing a resource prediction method based on the scoring system. It is inspired by meta-heuristic algorithms in order to improve parameters such as makespan, load balancing and the rate of meeting deadlines. To evaluate the proposed method, GridSim toolkit is exploited. According to the simulation results and comparison with some recent well-known methods, this approach has been successful in improving the mentioned parameters.", "paper_title": "A hierarchical approach for job scheduling in grid computing based on resource prediction and meta-heuristic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000369572300002"}
