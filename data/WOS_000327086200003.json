Mainly, CWW has an exciting vision which tries to tackle the problem of human intelligence by taking the human mind as a role model. The human intelligence has been investigated by various disciplines including psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, computer science, and cognitive sciences. Notably, it is not a straightforward task to map the human's brain reasoning into computer processes. In this paper, we propose to facilitate such mapping by investigating a key element, which is to identify the step-by-step formation of perceptual judgments. Herein, we first introduce an approach that employs general type-2 fuzzy logic to dynamically model the human perceptions based on the human experience. This approach can be regarded as a step to enable the CWW vision. We have deployed the proposed approach in real-world settings and we will present two sets of real-world experiments which were conducted in the intelligent apartment (iSpace) in the University of Essex. The first set of experiments demonstrates the results of the proposed approach for the adaptive modeling of ambient luminance perception. In the second set of experiments, we show that our approach performs better in the rule base evaluation processing time and in output accuracy with comparison to an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system.", "paper_title": "Towards a linear general type-2 fuzzy logic based approach for computing with words", "paper_id": "WOS:000327086200003"}
