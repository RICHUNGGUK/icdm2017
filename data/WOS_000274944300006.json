In this paper, we address the problem of gateway placement that consists of minimizing the number of gateways while satisfying system performance requirements. Along with the placement problem, the formulation includes joint routing and scheduling to account for the problem of interference and to enable spacial reuse. The problem, which we coined GPSRP (Gateway Placement and Spatial Reuse Problem), allows a much more efficient use of the available resources and reduces overall gateway costs This article presents for the first time a mathematical formulation of the problem and discusses its advantages and limitations with respect to other approaches (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "The joint Gateway Placement and Spatial Reuse Problem in Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274944300006"}
