Dynamic changes in the three independent ratios RH, SH and SZ are studied for six selected topics. Data about these topics are obtained from the Web of Science for scientific papers and Derwent Innovations Index for technical patents. It is observed that all RH-and SH-values decrease when the time span widens, while SZ stays the same or increases; and that all RH- and SH-values for papers are larger than the corresponding values for patents. The shifted Lotka distribution is used in a theoretical interpretation of these empirical phenomena. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
