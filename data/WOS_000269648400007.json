In particular, we propose a standard model for the protocol among three entities for the first time. The security of this protocol depends on the difficulty of solving two new problems related to one-way isomorphisms and the decision co-bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem on multiplicative cyclic groups. It is the first time that the security of a key agreement has been formally proven by using negligible probability. We believe that our contribution gives many applications in the cryptographic community.", "paper_title": "Sender Authenticated Key Agreements without Random Oracles", "paper_id": "WOS:000269648400007"}
