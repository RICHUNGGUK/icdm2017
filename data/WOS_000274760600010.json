Yet, few previous studies have examined the success of knowledge-based systems (KBSs) taking into consideration the knowledge-intensive nature of KBSs. This study aims to identify the success factors of KBSs from the knowledge-sharing perspective. Given this purpose, we developed a research model by combining a knowledge-sharing framework with DeLone and McLean's IS success model. The model was tested using data gathered through a field survey of 60 organizations. The results showed that three organizational factors, namely, codifiability of knowledge, absorptive capacity, and relationship with a vendor were essential in interpreting the success of KBSs.", "paper_title": "THE FACTORS AFFECTING SUCCESS OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS AT THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000274760600010"}
