Particularly, it focuses on an adjacency constraint, as well as on the so-called set levelings. Some important findings are reported in this work. First, the relationships between the so-called adjacency stable operators and set levelings are investigated, and an equivalence is established. This permits to apply some properties to the related operator class. Second, the implications and limits of a property presented elsewhere that states that certain connected operators can be expressed as a sequential composition of an opening and a closing (and vice-versa) based on markers are treated. Then, a commutative property that involves alternated attribute filters is presented. In addition, other related expressions are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
