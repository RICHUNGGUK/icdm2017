On the other hand, Bellini et al., 2005 revealed the importance of integrating symbolic music representation with,multimedia objects due to the development of the MPEG standard. Therefore, it is foreseen that more and more music objects in symbolic format and multimedia objects, integrated with symbolic music representation, will be published via the Internet, as video and audio presentations. To cater to future music-related applications of these symbolic music representations, we propose a novel approach to music classification by discovering high-level features of polyphonic music from the score. Overall, the main goal of this paper is to present a new conceptual framework that can automatically parse MusicXML files and extract their qualitative and quantitative features. In addition, we also propose appropriate features to improve classification accuracy and create an effective classifier for automatic music classification. To assess the proposed approach, music features extracted from a score were used to test the music classification accuracy by employing the decision tree-based (C4.5), SVM, and k-NN methods. The experimental results show that the proposed approach substantially outperforms other methods in terms of classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL APPROACH FOR MUSIC CLASSIFICATION BY EXTRACTING SCORE FEATURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800032"}
