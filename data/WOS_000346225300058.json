Meyerson and Williams showed that this problem is NP-hard for k >= 3. The complexity of this problem for k = 2 remained open. In this note, we show that 2-anonymizing data by suppressing the minimum number of columns is also NP-hard. In fact, we prove a stronger claim that this problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of Omega(logm), where m is the number of columns in the table. Furthermore, our proof also shows that this problem, parameterized by the number of columns to be suppressed, is not in FPT unless W[2] = FPT. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
