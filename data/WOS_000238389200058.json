In this paper, a novel conversation database in Chinese was collected and an emotion interaction matrix was proposed to embody the discourse information in conversation. Based on discourse information, an enhanced speech emotion recognition system was presented to improve the recognition accuracy. Some modifications were performed on traditional KNN classification, which could reduce the interruption of noise. Experiment result shows that our system makes 3% - 5% relative improvement compared with the traditional method.", "paper_title": "An enhanced speech emotion recognition system based on discourse information", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200058"}
