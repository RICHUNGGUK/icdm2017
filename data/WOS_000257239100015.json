Huffman, which is a well-known fixed-to-variable code, is used in this paper as a variable-to-variable code. The precomputed test set of a core is partitioned into variable-length blocks, which are, then, compressed by an efficient Huffman-based encoding procedure with a limited number of codewords. To increase the compression ratio, the same codeword can be reused for encoding compatible blocks of different sizes. Further compression improvements can be achieved by using two very simple test set transformations. A simple and low-overhead decompression architecture is also proposed.", "paper_title": "Test data compression based on variable-to-variable Huffman encoding with codeword reusability", "paper_id": "WOS:000257239100015"}
