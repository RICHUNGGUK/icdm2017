A model to create renewable energy portfolio is established using guidelines drawn by Oregon's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) legislation with the objective of responding to a 25% of the state electricity demand by renewable resources in 2025. The fuzzy goal programming model is adaptable to accommodate changes in energy costs and future advances in technology maturity. It can also take into consideration the preferences of policy-makers and stakeholders. This model can help to reveal the costs and benefits of complex decisions regarding renewable energy.
