However, till now, there is few research works reported for it. In this paper, a novel crossing road monitoring system containing two cameras is built, which is composed of several steps. The long-range camera is used for lane lines extraction by improved multiple Hough transforms, and illegal vehicle is detected according to the distance between vehicle center and lane lines. Then, the illegal vehicle is tracked and license plate is captured by the close-range camera. The records used for police checking contain the video of illegal process and license plate. The proposed system has been used by the traffic administration bureau. The results on actual application show that this novel system can be used for E-police with high detection accuracy.
