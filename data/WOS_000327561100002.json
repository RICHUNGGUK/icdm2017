This process assumes that the data model includes most of the visible surface including regions around fixation points where the part will be attached to others. This paper proposes a method to inspect deformable part by acquiring only regions that need to be inspected and then by applying to the CAD model a non-linear deformation using FEM modeling to minimize the differences with the partial views. The process first starts with a rigid alignment followed by an iterative process where the part's deformation is iteratively matched to the partial views. In this scheme, fixation points are not digitized and the non-linear part deformation calculations are estimated by interpolation. Test results performed on real parts compares favorably to deformation calculations using complete data model from the point-of-view of speed and accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
