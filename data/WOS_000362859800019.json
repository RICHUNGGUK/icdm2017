It generates up to 2 TB of data per night which motivated us to investigate how to reduce the volume of data. Reducing the throughput enables us to efficiently acquire, store and process the observations data. This document presents the conclusions of this work, along with the implementation of the custom compression algorithm and I/O layer that is currently in use to operate the telescope.
