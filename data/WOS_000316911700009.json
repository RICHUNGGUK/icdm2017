Quadruple tank system is a nonlinear system which can be adjusted to obtain two different class of system i.e., minimum and nonminimum phase, therefore tuning for each phase of system has to be tackled separately. Control system design has been obtained by manual proportional-integral controller, traditional generalized predictive control, predictive proportional-integral-derivative on the basis of generalized predictive control, predictive iterative learning control and finally adaptive predictive proportional-integral-derivative control has been developed successfully. a Stability and performance of the each control system design has also been discussed.", "paper_title": "MIMO PREDICTIVE PID CONTROL: A PRACTICAL APPROACH FOR QUADRUPLE TANK", "paper_id": "WOS:000316911700009"}
