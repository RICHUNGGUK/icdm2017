In this paper, we first provide linear- and expected-sublinear-time algorithms for finding all the segregating sites of a given set of DNA sequences. We also describe a data structure for tracking segregating sites in a set of sequences, such that every time the set is updated with the insertion of a new sequence or removal of an existing one, the segregating sites are updated accordingly without the need to re-scan the entire set of sequences.", "paper_title": "Efficient algorithms for counting and reporting segregating sites in genomic sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000249521700009"}
