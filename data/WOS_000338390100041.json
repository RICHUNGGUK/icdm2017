Recent studies have been devoted to introduce measures of the central tendency of random fuzzy numbers showing a more robust behaviour than the so-called Aumann-type mean value. This paper aims to deepen in the (rather comparative) analysis of these centrality measures and the Aumann-type mean by examining the situation of symmetric random fuzzy numbers. Similarities and differences with the real-valued case are pointed out and theoretical conclusions are accompanied with some illustrative examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
