First, a Cartesian-coordinate based variable rate model is presented. Compared with conventional variable rate models, the proposed model does not need any prior knowledge of target mass or external forces. Consequently, it is more convenient in practical tracking applications. Second, a maneuvering detection strategy is adopted to adaptively adjust the parameters in MVRPF, which helps allocate more state points at high maneuver regions and fewer at smooth regions. Third, in the presence of small measurement errors, the unscented particle filter, which is embedded in MVRPF, can move more particles into regions of high likelihood and hence can improve the tracking performance. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A modified variable rate particle filter for maneuvering target tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000364565200007"}
