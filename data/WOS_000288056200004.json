Both assumptions may not hold in real life. In this paper we simultaneously consider both bicriteria scheduling and scheduling with limited machine availability. We focus on two parallel machines' environment and the goal is to find preemptive schedules to optimize both makespan and total completion time subject to machine availability. Our main contribution in this paper is that we showed three bicriteria scheduling problems are in P by providing polynomial time optimal algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
