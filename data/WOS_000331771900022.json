This impact factor mainly examines the influence of journal articles on patents by calculating the number of patents cited to a journal divided by the number of articles published in that particular journal. The values of TIF for five-year (TIF5) and ten-year (TIF10) periods at the journal level and aggregated TIF values (TIFAGG-3 and TIFAGG-10) at the category level were provided and compared to the JIF. The results reveal that journals with higher TIF values showed varied performances in the JCR, while the top ten journals on JIF(5) showed consistent good performance in TIFs. Journals in three selected categories - Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Research & Experimental Medicine, and Organic Chemistry - showed that TIF5 and TIF10, values are not strongly correlated with JIF5. Thus, TIFs can provide a new indicator for evaluating journals from the aspect of practical innovation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
