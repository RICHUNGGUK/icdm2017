A large number of sensor nodes are deployed in redundant fashion in dense sensor networks, which lead to higher energy consumption. We propose a distributed framework for energy efficient connectivity and coverage maintenance in WSNs. In our framework, each sensor makes self-scheduling to separately control the states of RF and sensing unit based on dynamic coordinated reconstruction mechanism. A novel energy-balanced distributed connected dominating set algorithm is presented to make connectivity maintenance; and also a distributed node sensing scheduling is brought forward to maintain the network coverage according to the surveillance requirements. We implemented our framework by C++ programming, and the simulation results show that our framework outperforms several related work by considerably improving the energy performance of sensor networks to effectively extend network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Connectivity and coverage maintenance in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276183700002"}
