Our approach was inspired by the success of recent work generating marbling textures using mathematical functions. We were able to transform an input image or a text message into an intricate texture by combining the seven basic, reversible functions provided in the system. Later, the input image or message could be recovered by reversing the process of these functions. During the design process, the parameters of operations were automatically recorded, encrypted and invisibly embedded into the final pattern to create a stego-texture. In this way, the receiver could extract the hidden message from the stego-texture without the need for extra information from the sender. To ensure that the delivered message is unnoticeably covered by the texture, we propose a new technique for automatically creating a background that is harmonious with the message based on a set of visual perception cues.", "paper_title": "Hidden message in a deformation-based texture", "paper_id": "WOS:000364126900006"}
