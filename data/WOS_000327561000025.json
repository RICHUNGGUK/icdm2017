In this paper, we briefly list the different models that have been proposed in order to characterize the handwriting process and focus on a representation involving a vectorial summation of lognormal functions: the Sigma-lognormal model. Then, from a practical perspective, we describe a new stroke extraction algorithm suitable for the reverse engineering of handwriting signals. In the following section it is shown how the resulting representation can be used to study the writer and signer variability. We then report on two joint projects dealing with the automatic generation of synthetic specimens for the creation of large databases. The first application concerns the automatic generation of totally synthetic signature specimens for the training and evaluation of verification performances of automatic signature recognition systems. The second application deals with the synthesis of handwritten gestures for speeding up the learning process in customizable on-line recognition systems to be integrated in electronic pen pads.
