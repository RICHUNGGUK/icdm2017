To facilitate the analysis, we derive a systematic reformulation of the finite difference schemes as finite element methods. The a posteriori error estimates quantify various sources of discretization errors, including effects arising from explicit discretization. This provides a way to judge the relative sizes of the contributions, which in turn can be used to guide the choice of various discretization parameters in order to achieve accuracy in an efficient way. We demonstrate the accuracy of the estimate and the behavior of various error contributions in a set of numerical examples.", "paper_title": "A posteriori error analysis for finite element methods with projection operators as applied to explicit time integration techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000366634300008"}
