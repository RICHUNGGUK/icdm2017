As stated by Fan et al., ''... while calculation of the noise-free capacity of constrained sequences is well known, the computation of the capacity of a constraint in the presence of noise ... has been an unsolved problem in the half-century since Shannon's landmark paper.\" We first express the constrained capacity of a binary symmetric channel with (d, k)-constrained input as a limit of the top Lyapunov exponents of certain matrix random processes. Then, we compute asymptotic approximations of the noisy constrained capacity for cases where the noise parameter epsilon is small. In particular, we show that when k <= 2d, the error term (excess of capacity beyond the noise-free capacity) is O(epsilon), whereas it is O(epsilon log epsilon) when k > 2d. In both cases, we compute the coefficient of the error term. In the course of establishing these findings, we also extend our previous results on the entropy of a hidden Markov process to higher-order finite memory processes. These conclusions are proved by a combination of analytic and combinatorial methods.", "paper_title": "Noisy Constrained Capacity for BSC Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000283449000004"}
