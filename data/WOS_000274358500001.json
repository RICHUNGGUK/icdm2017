This environment is built in conformance with the generic signalling environment, which is standardized by the NSIS IETF working group. The advanced resource reservation protocol, called MQoS NSLP, is based on the QoS NSLP signalling application. It provides to mobile terminals the QoS required based on the user's mobility and QoS profile. In this work, we investigate the use of some techniques of the AI (Artificial Intelligence) domain to implement a user interface called NIA (Negotiation Individual Assistant) in order to determine the QoS profile and negotiate the QoS parameters in the new domain after the handover. Therefore, we use connectionist learning in the management of the negotiation profiles and agent technology to help the user choose the best service provider, dynamically negotiate the QoS on the user's behalf, and follow the user's behaviour to be able to anticipate the negotiation and manage renegotiation. The advance resource reservation is based on an object MSpec (Mobility Specification) which determines the future location of the mobile terminal. The MSpec object is a part of the mobility and QoS profile and is determined by the NIA in the mobile terminal.
