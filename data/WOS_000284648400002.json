The new proposed features take into account temporal as well as frequency band energy variations for the task of Hindi phoneme recognition. The recognition performance achieved by the proposed features is compared with the standard MFCC and 24-band admissible wavelet packet-based features using a linear discriminant function based classifier. To evaluate robustness of these features, the NOISEX database is used to add different types of noise into phonemes to achieve signal-to-noise ratios in the range of 20 dB to -5 dB. The recognition results show that under noisy background the proposed technique always achieves a better performance over MFCC-based features.", "paper_title": "WAVELET SUB-BAND BASED TEMPORAL FEATURES FOR ROBUST HINDI PHONEME RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000284648400002"}
