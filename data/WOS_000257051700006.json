With CADNA the numerical quality of any simulation program can be controlled. Furthermore by detecting all the instabilities which may occur at run time, a numerical debugging of the user code can be performed. CADNA provides new numerical types on which round-off errors can be estimated. Slight modifications are required to control a code with CADNA, mainly changes in variable declarations, input and output. This paper describes the features of the CADNA library and shows how to interpret the information it provides concerning round-off error propagation in a code.

Round-off error propagation may invalidate the result of a program. The CADNA library enables one to estimate round-off error propagation in any simulation program and to detect all numerical instabilities that may occur at run time. Solution method: The CADNA library [1] implements Discrete Stochastic Arithmetic [2-4] which is based on a probabilistic model of round-off errors. The program is run several times with a random rounding mode generating different results each time. From this set of results, CADNA estimates the number of exact significant digits in the result that would have been computed with standard floating-point arithmetic. Restrictions: CADNA requires a Fortran 90 (or newer) compiler. In the program to be linked with the CADNA library, round-off errors on complex variables cannot be estimated. Furthermore array functions such as product or sum must not be used. Only the arithmetic operators and the abs, min, max and sqrt functions can be used for arrays. Running time: The version of a code which uses CADNA runs at least three times slower than its floating-point version. This cost depends on the computer architecture and can be higher if the detection of numerical instabilities is enabled. In this case, the cost may be related to the number of instabilities detected.", "paper_title": "CADNA: a library for estimating round-off error propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000257051700006"}
