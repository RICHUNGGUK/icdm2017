G. D. Birkhoff and D C. Lewis showed that, if G is a plane near-triangulation, then the only zeros of P(G, t) in (-infinity, 2] are 0, 1 and 2. We will extend their theorem by showing that a stronger result to the dual statement holds for both planar and non-planar graphs: if G is a bridgeless graph with at most one vertex of degree other than three, then the only zeros of F(G, t) in (-infinity, alpha] are 1 and 2, where alpha approximate to 2.225... is the real zero in (2, 3) of the polynomial t(4) - 8t(3) + 22t2 - 28t + 17. In addition we construct a sequence of 'near-cubic' graphs whose flow polynomials have zeros converging to alpha from above.", "paper_title": "Zero-free intervals for flow polynomials of near-cubic graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000243584500006"}
