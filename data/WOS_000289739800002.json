In the particular case of video communication, the seamless adaptation to heterogeneous mobile devices poses an additional strong challenge to those seeking for interoperable and easy-to-deploy solutions. In this paper, we make several contributions towards a generic peer-to-peer (P2P) videoconferencing solution that extends into the mobile realm. We describe the essential building blocks for conference management and media distribution that are necessary for a distributed conferencing approach. Establishing a distributed SIP conference focus, participants share the conference according to their individually given capabilities and resources in terms of bandwidth and processing power rather than in a centralized and fixed way. Overall concepts and SIP-primitives for such an autonomous organization are presented. Security issues that derive from this decentralized identity management are resolved by so-called Overlay AuthoCast, a novel use of cryptographically generated identifiers. Furthermore, this work is dedicated to the development of a software-based H.264 video codec implementation and the specific aspects resulting from tuning such a highly resource-intensive software codec to the given target platform of a standard consumer smartphone.", "paper_title": "Distributed SIP conference management with autonomously authenticated sources and its application to an H.264 videoconferencing software for mobiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000289739800002"}
