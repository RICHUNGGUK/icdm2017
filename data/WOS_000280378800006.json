Design/methodology/approach - To analyze electrical machine dynamics, the electromagnetic torque should be precisely determined. This paper presents a method for calculating the torque, where the radius of the integration contour is variable and estimated from the field distribution. Findings - The electromagnetic torque of the three-phase AC motor model proposed in TEAM Problem No. 30 is estimated using the proposed method. The obtained results are compared to solutions obtained analytically. Originality/value - This paper examines the application of the presented method to determine the electromagnetic torque in three-phase AC motors.", "paper_title": "Determination of electromagnetic torque with on-line computation of the optimal radius of the integration contour", "paper_id": "WOS:000280378800006"}
