Accurate verification is paramount, and any misuse of personal information may have serious consequences. Many authentication processes tried to design various methods to minimise such discrepancies. In this current work, we propose a new approach to design a robust biomedical content authentication system by embedding logo of the hospital within the electrocardiogram signal by means of both discrete wavelet transformation and cuckoo search (CS). An adaptive meta-heuristic cuckoo search is used to find the optimal scaling factor settings for logo embedding. Results show that the proposed method can serve as a secure and accurate authentication system.", "paper_title": "Optimisation of scaling factors in electrocardiogram signal watermarking using cuckoo search", "paper_id": "WOS:000326677200005"}
