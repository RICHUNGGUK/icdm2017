Elaborating on the data of a previous experimental study with 453 adolescents, we compared bystanders' behavioural intentions to help the victim according to their 'mediacy' (via communication technologies (CT) or face-to-face) and their 'privacy' (in public or in private). Furthermore, we investigated whether the context of the harassing incident (incident severity, identity and behaviour of other bystanders) influenced the 'mediacy' and 'privacy' of bystanders' helping intentions. The results showed that in general bystanders had higher behavioural intentions to help the victim in private (vs. in public) and via CT (vs. face-to-face). While incident severity influenced the 'mediacy' of bystanders' helping intentions, the identity and behaviour of other bystanders affected the 'privacy' of their helping intentions.", "paper_title": "'Can I afford to help?'
