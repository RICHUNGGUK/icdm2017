It reviews related researches and presents an improved insertion algorithm, a detection algorithm and a recover algorithm. We introduce a varied-size grouping method in our insertion algorithm to insert a meaningful watermark. We also introduce a new mechanism to insert watermarks using the mark itself to decide marked positions. This insertion mechanism can be validated in our detection algorithm to decide whether a watermark exists or not. A badly destroyed marked relation or only a small part of it could still be detected successfully. Our recover algorithm introduces a competing mechanism to help recover the exact meaningful watermark after the detection result confirms the existence of the watermark. The experiments show it's robust to various attacks.", "paper_title": "An improved algorithm to watermark numeric relational data", "paper_id": "WOS:000236882500011"}
