The sequences are classified according to a hierarchy of different classes, families and subfamilies based on literature search. The main innovation besides the classification of G-proteins, GPCRs and effectors is the relational model of the database, describing the known coupling specificity of GPCRs to their respective alpha subunits of G-proteins, and also the specific interaction between G-proteins and their effectors, a unique feature not available in any other database.", "paper_title": "gpDB: a database of GPCRs, G-proteins, effectors and their interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000256756800013"}
