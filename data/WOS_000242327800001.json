The core of system is an improved WaveShrink module. First, different parameters of WaveShrink are studied; then, based on the features of speech signal, an improved wavelet-based speech enhancement system is proposed. The system uses a novel thresholding algorithm, and introduces a new method for threshold selection. Moreover, the efficiency of system has been increased by selecting more suitable parameters for voiced, unvoiced and silence regions, separately. The proposed system has been evaluated on different sentences under various noise conditions. The results show a plausible improvement in performance of system, in comparison with similar approaches.
