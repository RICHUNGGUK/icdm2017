The Takagi and Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to represent a discrete-time nonlinear system with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties and Markovian jump parameters. As a result, an uncertain Markovian jump fuzzy system (MJFS) is obtained. A stochastic fuzzy Lyapunov function (FLF) is employed to analyze the robust stability of the uncertain MJFS, which not only is dependent on the operation modes of the system, but also directly includes the membership functions. Then, based on this stochastic FLF and a non-parallel distributed compensation (non-PDC) scheme, a mode-independent state-feedback control design is developed to guarantee that the closed-loop MJFS is stochastically stable for all admissible parameter uncertainties. The proposed sufficient conditions for the robust stability and mode-independent robust stabilization are formulated as a set of coupled linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be solved efficiently by using existing LMI optimization techniques. Finally, it is also demonstrated, via a simulation example, that the proposed design method is effective. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
