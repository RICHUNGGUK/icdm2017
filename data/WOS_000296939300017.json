In recent years, H.264 is a new advanced video compression standard; it provides higher compression efficiency and better video quality than the traditional one. Today, it is very convenient for information transmission. However, the digital information would be altered easily. Therefore, to prevent the data being used illegally is a very important issue today. In this paper, the watermarking approach is via comparing several corresponding AC coefficients to embed watermark information into I Frame. On the other hand, extracting watermark via comparing corresponding AC coefficients vice versa. Both of embedding and extracting are via modifying the majority of AC coefficients in accordance with watermark information bit. Additionally, these results show that the extracting watermark possesses high accuracy. Furthermore, the watermark information is able to resist the impact of video compression effectively.", "paper_title": "THE HIGH ACCURACY VIDEO WATERMARKING ON H.264 BY MAJORITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000296939300017"}
