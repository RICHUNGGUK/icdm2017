To overcome this limit, we introduce Virtual Channel, a novel concept to increase the number of available channels by efficiently managing given spectral and temporal resources. A virtual channel is created by scheduling a superframe and selecting a logical channel. This extends the notion of a channel from spectral domain to spectral and temporal domain. Specifically, we propose a superframe scheduler using throughput estimation (SUTE) of the IEEE 802.15.4 carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). In addition, nearest vacancy search (NEVS) is proposed, both of which are for temporal efficiency of the collocation. For both spectral and temporal efficiency, virtual channel selector (VCS) is proposed. The simulation results show that a remarkable improvement on the collocation efficiency of IEEE 802.15.4 can be achieved by our proposals. Moreover, this study also reveals the fundamental drawback of the current standard in terms of the collocation efficiency that the beacon interval and superframe duration are adjustable only by exponent parameters.", "paper_title": "Improving Spectral and Temporal Efficiency of Collocated IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000270779500002"}
