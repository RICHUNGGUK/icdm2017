It employs a powerful segmentation-free letter detection method based upon joint boosting with histograms of gradients as features. Efficient inference on an ensemble of hidden Markov models can select the most probable sequence of candidate character detections to recognize complete words in ambiguous handwritten text, drawing on character n-gram and physical separation models. Experiments with two corpora of handwritten historic documents show that this approach recognizes known words more accurately than previous efforts, and can also recognize out-of-vocabulary words.
