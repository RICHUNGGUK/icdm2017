As a promising information dissemination technique, network coding is suitable for the key information exchange due to the reduced number of transmissions and the enhanced robustness. Matrix decomposition can help to exchange key information without any central nodes and location knowledge. Our scheme uses LU matrix decomposition to decompose a shared key into two vectors R and C. The vector R is held privately by the sensor, while the other vector C is protected and disseminated using network coding. The combination of network coding and matrix decomposition enhances the scalability, improves the communication performance, and increases the robustness for sensor data storage networks. Extensive theoretical analysis and simulative results both demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed key pre-distribution scheme in distributed sensor data storage.
