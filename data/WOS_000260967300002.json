In this paper, an element-based search scheme is introduced to identify the load surface. The load surfaces are formed by the connection of the real boundary of elements and the pressures are transferred directly to corresponding element nodes. The search scheme is very convenient to apply and is found to be efficient and effective in identifying the load surfaces. Only slight modifications to the load codes in the routine procedure are required and there is no need to calculate the sensitivities of the load with respect to the material density changes. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the boundary search scheme.", "paper_title": "A new boundary search scheme for topology optimization of continuum structures with design-dependent loads", "paper_id": "WOS:000260967300002"}
