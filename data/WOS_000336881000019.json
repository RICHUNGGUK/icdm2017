Further, capacity and budget limitations are provided to make the LA problem more realistic. The two objective functions include (1) minimizing aggregate waiting times and (2) minimizing the maximum idle time of all facilities. Since the proposed model is NP-hard, a meta-heuristic algorithm called multi-objective harmony search algorithm (MOHA) is developed to solve it. In this algorithm, a new presentation scheme that satisfies most of the model constraints is proposed. Since there is no benchmark available in the literature to validate the results obtained, the performance of MOHA is statistically compared with the ones of two other common meta-heuristics called multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA). The parameters of all algorithms are first calibrated by means of the Taguchi method using a novel metric. The comparison results based on different problem sizes are in favor of MOHA.
