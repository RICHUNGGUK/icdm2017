However, this seems unrealistic from a neuroanatomical perspective and a VLSI implementation viewpoint. In this study, we built a new associative memory network based on the Watts-Strogatz model. The results indicate that this new network can recall the memorized patterns even with only a small fraction of total connections and is more sufficient than other networks with sparse topologies, such as randomly connected network and regularly network.", "paper_title": "Associative memory with small world connectivity built on Watts-Strogatz model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600019"}
