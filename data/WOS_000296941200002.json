This discrete-time intelligent system model, which is composed of a linear dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator, presents a unified description of delayed or non-delayed intelligent systems composed of neural networks and Takagi and Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models. Lure systems, and linear systems. The missing measurements from multi-sensors are described by a binary switching sequence that obeys a conditional probability distribution. We aim to design both centralized and distributed fusion filters such that, for all possible missing observations, the fusion error is globally asymptotically stable in the mean square, and the prescribed H-infinity performance constraint is satisfied. By employing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method with the stochastic analysis approach, several delay-independent criteria, which are in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), are established to ensure the existence of the desired multi-sensor H-infinity fusion filters. An optimization problem is subsequently formulated by optimizing the H-infinity filtering performances, which is described as the eigenvalue problem (EVP). Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the design procedure and expected performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
