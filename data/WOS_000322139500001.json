The design of Zhang dynamics (ZD) is based on the elimination of an indefinite error function, instead of the elimination of a square-based positive (or at least lower-bounded) energy function usually associated with gradient dynamics (GD). In this paper, we generalize, propose and investigate the continuous-time ZD model and its discrete-time models in two situations (i.e., the time-derivative of the coefficient being known or unknown) for time-varying cube root finding, including the complex-valued continuous-time ZD model for finding cube roots in complex domain. In addition, to find the static scalar-valued cube root, a simplified continuous-time ZD model and its discrete-time model are generated. By focusing on such a static problem solving, Newton-Raphson iteration is found to be a special case of the discrete-time ZD model by utilizing the linear activation function and fixing the step-size value to be 1. Computer-simulation and testing results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ZD models (including real-valued ZD models and complex-valued ZD models) for time-varying and static cube root finding, as well as the link and new explanation to Newton-Raphson iteration.", "paper_title": "Solving for time-varying and static cube roots in real and complex domains via discrete-time ZD models", "paper_id": "WOS:000322139500001"}
