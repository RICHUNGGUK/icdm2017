This paper shows that the problem is GI-complete. More precisely, we show that the graph isomorphism problem is GI-complete for comparability graphs of partially ordered sets with interval dimension 2 and height 3. In contrast, the problem is known to be solvable in polynomial time for comparability graphs of partially ordered sets with interval dimension at most 2 and height at most 2.", "paper_title": "Graph Isomorphism Completeness for Trapezoid Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000359467200035"}
