We start by applying our design approach to formulate the problem of optimizing the selected relay index and gain under the mean squared error criterion and a sparsity constraint. Building on recent advances in sparse signal recovery theory, we propose a solution based on the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm and investigate its performance-complexity tradeoffs. Then, we generalize our formulation to multiple-antenna large AF relay networks, which naturally leads to a joint multiple relay-antenna selection problem with sparse relay gain vector optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed scheme over existing schemes for both single-antenna and multiple-antenna large AF relay networks. Alternatively, at the same performance level, our scheme selects fewer relays resulting in reduced implementation complexity.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Sparsity for Multiple Relay Selection with Relay Gain Control in Large AF Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696700026"}
