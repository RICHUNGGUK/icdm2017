This paper aims at providing an uncertain multilevel programming model that is a type of multilevel programming involving uncertain variables. Besides, a genetic algorithm is employed to solve the model. As an illustration, the uncertain multilevel programming model is applied to a product control problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
