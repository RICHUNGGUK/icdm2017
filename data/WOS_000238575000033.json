In this paper, we present a new fuzzy linguistic multi-agent model to access information on the Web that incorporates the use of fuzzy multi-granular linguistic modeling to improve it's user-system interaction and be more user-friendly.", "paper_title": "Improving the user-system interaction in a web multi-agent system using fuzzy multi-granular linguistic information", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000033"}
