Design principles and advantages of this new framework of mobile converged networks are discussed. Moreover, mobile converged network models based on interference coordination and energy efficiency are presented, and the corresponding optimization algorithms are developed. Furthermore, future challenges of mobile converged networks are identified to promote the study in modeling and performance analysis of mobile converged networks.", "paper_title": "MOBILE CONVERGED NETWORKS: FRAMEWORK, OPTIMIZATION, AND CHALLENGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000347382300007"}
