This setting introduces new challenges which are not being addressed by classical protocol analysis techniques. The main complication stems from the fact that the actions of intermediate nodes and their connectivity can no longer be abstracted into a single unstructured adversarial environment as they form an inherent part of the system's security. In order to model this scenario faithfully, we present a broadcast calculus which makes a clear distinction between the protocol processes and the network's connectivity graph, which may change independently from protocol actions. We identify a property characterising an important aspect of security in this setting and express it using behavioural equivalences of the calculus. We complement this approach with a control flow analysis which enables us to automatically check this property on a given network and attacker specification. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
