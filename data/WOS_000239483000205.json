Some risk indices are used to assess the risk of cascading outages. The fuzzy neural network (FNN) is used to obtain the risk indices and to propose a solution that can decrease the system cascading outage risk under limited budget. The IEEE 118-bus system is used to illustrate the methodology.", "paper_title": "Risk assessment of cascading outages in power systems using fuzzy neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000205"}
