We develop the double sampling plan and determine the design parameters satisfying both the producer's and consumer's risks simultaneously for the specified reliability levels in terms of the mean ratio to the specified life. We also propose a group sampling plan and determine the parameters by the above-mentioned two-point method. Tables are constructed for the proposed sampling plans and results are explained with examples.", "paper_title": "New acceptance sampling plans based on life tests for Birnbaum-Saunders distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000288260600006"}
