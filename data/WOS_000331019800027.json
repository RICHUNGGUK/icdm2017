In the SCaNME system, the location tracking problem is solved by first matching the people's locations to the location points (LPs) with small Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Then, Allen's logics are applied to reveal the person's activities, assist the on-line location tracking and finally obtain a refined path estimate. The experimental results conducted on the large-scale HKUST campus demonstrate that the SCaNME tracking system provides better precision and reliability than the conventional location tracking systems. Furthermore, the experiments of SCaNME tracking system show its capability of providing people's real-time locations without fingerprint calibration in large-scale Wi-Fi environment.
