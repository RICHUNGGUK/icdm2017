However, since the requirements of the IoT are quite different from what the Internet today can offer, several innovative techniques have been gradually developed and incorporated into IoT, which is referred to as the Future Internet of Things (FIoT). Among them, how to extract \"data'' and transfer them into \"knowledge'' from sensing layer to application layer has become a vital issue. This paper begins with an overview of IoT and FIoT, followed by discussions on how to apply data mining and computational intelligence to FIoT. An intelligent data management framework inspired by swarm optimization will then given. Finally, open issues and future trends of this field will be addressed.", "paper_title": "Future Internet of Things: open issues and challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000343925600003"}
