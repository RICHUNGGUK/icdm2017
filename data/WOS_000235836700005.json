In particular, for the modal mu-calculus, the most powerful branching temporal logic used for verification, the problem is known to be EXPTIME-complete (even for a fixed formula). The problem remains EXPTIME-complete also for the logic CTL, which corresponds to a fragment of the alternation-free modal mu-calculus. However, the exact complexity in the size of the pushdown system (for a fixed CTL formula) is an open question: it lies somewhere between PSPACE and EXPTIME. To the best of our knowledge, the PMC problem for CTL* has not been investigated so far. In this paper, we show that this problem is 2EXPTIME-complete. Moreover, we prove that the program complexity of the PMC problem against CTL (i.e., the complexity of the problem in terms of the size of the system) is EXPTIME-complete.", "paper_title": "Complexity results on branching-time pushdown model checking", "paper_id": "WOS:000235836700005"}
