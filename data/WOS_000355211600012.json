This paper describes the development of a SE relative effectiveness index model that can be used to identify and analyze SE patterns and subsequently predict possible areas of SE performance risk in the acquisition and deployment of complex information systems. The approach employs a Bayesian belief network to model causal relationships in SE activities that can be used to assess SE performance in projects and organizations.", "paper_title": "A Measure of Systems Engineering Effectiveness in Acquisition of Complex Information Systems: A Bayesian Belief Network Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000355211600012"}
