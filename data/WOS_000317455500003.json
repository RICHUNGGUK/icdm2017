After a conversion of the code considered from Fortran to C and its deep restructuring for exploiting the GPU key features, significant speedups have been obtained for RWAVEPR, a time dependent quantum reactive scattering code propagating in time a complex wavepacket. As benchmark calculations those concerned with the evaluation of the reactive probabilities of the Cl + H-2 and the N + N-2 reactions have been considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
