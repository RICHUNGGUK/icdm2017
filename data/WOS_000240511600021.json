It aims to overcome topological defects owing to a rapid decrease of the neighborhood range over the finite running time in topographic map formation. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to accelerate the formation of a topographic map and, at the same time, to simplify the monitoring procedure.", "paper_title": "Monitoring the formation of kernel-based topographic maps in a hybrid SOM-kMER model", "paper_id": "WOS:000240511600021"}
