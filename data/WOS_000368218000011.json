First, the GPON-LTE Converged Network Architecture (GLCNA) and Optical Network Unit-evolved NodeB (ONU-eNB) is presented. Second, the QoS mapping strategy is defined for GPON-LTE converged networks. Third, a Synchronous Interleaved Dynamic Bandwidth Assignment (SIDBA) scheme is proposed to alleviate the idle period and asynchrony problem in upstream bandwidth allocation due to the cycle time of GPON and the frame size of LTE are mismatched. Simulation results show the proposed SIDBA scheme can effectively enhance the system performance for different polling cycle time/frame size pairs in terms of network throughput, packet delay and outage; especially the polling cycle time/frame size pair is 2 ms/5 ms performs the best.", "paper_title": "Synchronous Interleaved DBA for QoS over GPON-LTE Converged Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000368218000011"}
