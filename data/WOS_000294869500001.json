The boosted cascade algorithm is one of the fastest face detection algorithms in use, but its hardware implementation requires a huge amount of SRAM to store the input data, integral image, and classifiers. This paper proposes a novel cascade face detection architecture based on a reduced two-field feature extraction scheme for faster integral image calculation and feature extraction. This scheme reduces the required memory for storing integral images by 75%, and employs multiple register files instead of a single SRAM to speed up the integral image updating and feature extraction processes. The reduced integral images have only 5% of the features of original images. Although this approach requires more weak classifiers, the proposed parallel cascade detection architecture reduces the average detection time for one feature to 63% that of the original. A 0.64 mm(2) 15 mw (@390 fps) boosted cascade face detection is implemented under the UMC 90-nm CMOS technology. Experimental results show that this face detection system can achieve a high face detection rate in processing 160 x 120 grayscale images at a speed of 390 fps.", "paper_title": "A 0.64 mm(2) Real-Time Cascade Face Detection Design Based on Reduced Two-Field Extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000294869500001"}
