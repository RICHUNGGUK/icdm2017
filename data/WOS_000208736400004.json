Reuse provides many technical and economical benefits. Composability has been increasingly crucial for M&S of a system of systems, in which disparate systems are composed with each other. The purpose of this paper is to describe how R&C can be achieved by using a simulation conceptual model (CM) in a community of interest (COI). We address R&C in a multifaceted manner covering many M&S areas (types). M&S is commonly employed where R&C are very much needed by many COIs. We present how a CM developed for a COI can assist in R&C for the design of any type of large-scale complex M&S application in that COI. A CM becomes an asset for a COI and offers significant economic benefits through its broader applicability and more effective utilization.", "paper_title": "Achieving reusability and composability with a simulation conceptual model", "paper_id": "WOS:000208736400004"}
