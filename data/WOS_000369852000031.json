However, how to guarantee its safety has become a research hotspot in safety fields. The generic test system with high efficiency has become the main means to verify the function and performance of CBTC system. This paper discusses a composable modeling method for the generic test platform for CBTC system based on the port object. This method defines the port object(PO) model as the basic component for composable modeling, verifies its port behavior and generates its compositional properties. Based on the port description and the test environment description, it builds port sets and environment port cluster, respectively. Then it analyzes and extracts possible crosscutting concerns, and finally generates a variable PO component library. It takes the modeling of block port objects in line simulation of generic test platform for CBTC systems as an example to verify the feasibility of the method.", "paper_title": "Composable Modeling Method for Generic Test Platform for Cbtc System Based on the Port Object", "paper_id": "WOS:000369852000031"}
