Failure to do this has resulted in serious consequences to the users involved. So the analysis and management of risk is one of the important pre-requisites to ensure a successful outcome in a business activity in any domain. In this paper we propose an approach by which an interaction initiating user in the domain of e-business ascertains beforehand the level of transactional risk in the successful completion of its business activity and utilizes it to determine on an interaction. The proposed model considers the different sub-categories and characteristics of transactional risk and ascertains in numeric and semantic terms the different levels and severities of its occurrence. It then utilizes the determined analysis of transactional risk to recommend on an informed interact ion-based decision to the interaction initiating user.", "paper_title": "Transactional risk-based decision making system in e-business interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000275615600002"}
