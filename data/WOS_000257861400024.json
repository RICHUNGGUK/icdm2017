In the Gaussian case with two receivers, under the assumption that both receivers are degraded with respect to the relay, it is shown that the capacity region is achieved by a superposition strategy. This strategy is also shown to be optimal in the case where there is feedback from the receivers to the relay and one receiver assumed to be degraded with respect to the other in an appropriate sense. We also present an achievable region for a more general Gaussian RBC (GRBC) model.", "paper_title": "Gaussian degraded relay broadcast channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000257861400024"}
