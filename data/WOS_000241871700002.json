We show that the propositional connectives are not quite well-behaved from a traditional categorical perspective, and give a more refined, but necessarily complex, analysis of how connectives may be characterised abstractly. Finally we explain the consequences of insisting on more familiar categorical behaviour. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
