Design/methodology/approach - This research was conducted in two phases to explore the effects of information sharing on relationship intention of different customer segments. The objective of phase one was to segment different customer groups according to two criteria: customer relationship value and customer responsiveness. The objective of phase two was to analyze the impact of information sharing on these segmented customer groups. Findings - Data from 239 customers of a large steel supplier indicate that information sharing positively influences CRI and that the characteristics of the trading relationship moderate the effects of information sharing. These findings suggest that, while information sharing is an important means of enhancing a customer relationship, not all types of customer should be treated the same way. Research limitations/implications - Assessment of customer intention depends on the structure of the buyer-supplier network. Other extraneous variables such as branding, industrial position and bargaining power may influence customer attitudes towards information sharing-induced changes. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the understanding of the effects of different levels of information sharing on different customer clusters differentiated by trading relationship characteristics.", "paper_title": "Effects of information sharing on customer relationship intention", "paper_id": "WOS:000285567500014"}
