Goofspiel is a two-person card game that is easy to play. However, playing this game successfully has proven to be a difficult task. There is no known \"good\" strategy for Goofspiel. This is the first time that playing Goofspiel has been examined in a context of a round-robin competition between programs. None of the participating programs won consistently against its rivals. Thus, no clear dominating strategy of play has emerged. In this respect, Goofspiel is similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma where Tit-for-Tat has proven to be a good strategy against many but not against all. This paper introduces Repeated Goofspiel and presents preliminary experimental results. We hope it will motivate further research into this fascinating game.", "paper_title": "Repeated Goofspiel: A Game of Pure Strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000328732600002"}
