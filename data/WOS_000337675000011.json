To improve the quality of hot mix asphalt, both the aggregates gradation and the process variables must be considered. Current practice involves taking samples from actual production and analyzing them in the lab. The entire process can take two hours, which, along with being expensive, is not amenable to real time online process control or even in knowing how much product is actually out of specification. In this paper, an online control system is proposed that can be used to significantly decrease the analysis time and adjust production by using discrete time stochastic simulation combined with algorithmic optimization. Additionally, the system can readily show when a mix is out of specification without lag time or physical experimentation. Results show that this approach can effectively control the production process resulting in improved quality. This is the first known such application in hot mix asphalt online process control.
