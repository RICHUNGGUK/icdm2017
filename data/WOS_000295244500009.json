This is accomplished by replacing the quarter-wave uniform transmission lines in the conventional WPD by multiband nonuniform transmission line transformers (NTLTs). The design of these NTLTs is performed under the even mode analysis of the WPD. A single isolation resistor is used between the two output ports whose value is determined using the simple odd mode analysis of the WPD. For verification purposes, a triple-frequency WPD and a quad-frequency WPD are designed, simulated, fabricated, and measured. The results of the full-wave simulations and the measurements verify the validity of the design procedure. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.
