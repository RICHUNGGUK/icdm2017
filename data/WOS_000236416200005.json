An efficient algorithm for exploiting the timing slack of building blocks of the application is proposed. The slack of blocks can be utilized by replacing them with slower but cheaper, i.e. better, modules and by assigning the computations to the proper resources. Thus, our approach manages the comprising computations and system resources and can indirectly assist the realtime scheduling of computations on system resources. This is performed without compromising the timing constraints of the application and can lead to significant improvements in power dissipation, computation accuracy or other metrics of the application domain. Our algorithm is well-suited for arbitrary tree computations. Moreover, it delivers solutions that are desirably close to the optimal solution. Experimental results for a number of object tracking applications implemented in an networked system with embedded computation resources, exhibit a significant amount of slack utilization.", "paper_title": "Efficient timing budget management for accuracy improvement in a collaborative object tracking system", "paper_id": "WOS:000236416200005"}
