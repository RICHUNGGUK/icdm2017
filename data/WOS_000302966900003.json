Many different view selection methods have been proposed in the literature to address this issue. The present paper provides a survey of view selection methods. It defines a framework for highlighting the view selection problem by identifying the main dimensions that are the basis in the classification of view selection methods. Based on this classification, this study reviews most of the view selection methods by identifying respective potentials and limits.", "paper_title": "A Survey of View Selection Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000302966900003"}
