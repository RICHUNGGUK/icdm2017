One of the problems is that of scaled matching, finding all appearances of a pattern, proportionally enlarged according to an arbitrary real-sized scale, in a given text. The currently fastest known algorithm for this problem uses techniques from dictionary matching to solve the problem in O(nm (3)+n (2) mlog m) time using O(nm (3)+n (2)) space, where T is a two-dimensional nxn text array and P is a two-dimensional mxm pattern array. We present a new approach for solving the scaled matching problem improving both the running time and the space requirements. Our algorithm runs in O(n (2) m) time and uses O(n (2)) space.", "paper_title": "Faster Two Dimensional Scaled Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000273158900006"}
