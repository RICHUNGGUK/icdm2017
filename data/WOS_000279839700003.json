Manufacturers have adopted modern communication technologies for the information flow related to customers' orders. However, there is still high uncertainty in the information provided. This work introduces a model for estimating the probability that, once a customer has received a potential delivery date for a product, whether they will actually place the order. In this instance the manufacturing resources should be committed to this order. The Bayesian networks method is adopted and an automotive industrial case study is discussed.", "paper_title": "Customer's behaviour modelling for manufacturing planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000279839700003"}
