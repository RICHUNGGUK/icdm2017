We consider three different mobility models, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) mobility model, random walk mobility model with constant speed and Levy flight mobility model. For i.i.d mobility model and random walk mobility model with the speed e(1/root n), we get the theoretical results of the average packet delay when capacity is e(1),) individually, where n is the number of nodes. We find that the optimal average packet delay is achieved when capacity A(n) < 2 1) where K is the number of gateways. It is proved that average packet delay D(n) divided n log2(+i-c by capacity A(n) is bounded below by K\"W\" When u.)
