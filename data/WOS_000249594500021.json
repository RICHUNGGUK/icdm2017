The proposed method is an improved version of the regular neuro-fuzzy TSK fuzzy inference system. For the proposed method, first, the data that are processed ire grouped by the k-means clustering method. The membership A arbitrary input for each fuzzy rule is then derived through in ELM, followed by a normalization method. At the same time, he consequent part of the fuzzy rules is obtained by multiple ELMs. At last, the approximate prediction value is determined by a weight computation scheme. For the ELM-based TSK fuzzy inference system, two extensions are also proposed to improve its accuracy. The proposed methods can avoid the curse of dimensionality that is encountered in backpropagation and hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. Moreover, the proposed methods have a competitive performance in training time and accuracy compared to three ANFIS methods.", "paper_title": "A neuro-fuzzy inference system through integration of fuzzy logic and extreme learning machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000249594500021"}
