Moreover, we prove that the obtained complex Z satisfies the Whitehead conjecture, i.e. any subcomplex Z< subset of>Z is aspherical. This implies that Y is homotopy equivalent to a wedge ZS2...S2 where Z is a 2-dimensional aspherical simplicial complex. We also show that under the assumptions where c > 3 and 0<E<1/47, the complex Z is genuinely 2-dimensional and in particular, it has sizable 2-dimensional homology; it follows that in the indicated range of the probability parameter p the cohomological dimension of the fundamental group 1(Y) of a random 2-complex equals 2.
