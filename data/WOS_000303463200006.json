An analysis of the searching activity and population growth of mobile agents is important for improving performance in agent driven networks. In this paper, we describe a general execution model of mobile agents for network routing and classify it into two cases. For each case, we analyze the population distribution of mobile agents (the distribution of mobile agents running in the network) and the probability of success (the probability that an agent can find its destination). We also perform extensive experiments for various network topologies to validate our analytical results. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the population distribution and the probability of success of mobile agents can be controlled by locally adjusting relevant parameters, such as the number of agents generated per request, the number of jumps each mobile agent can move, etc. Our results reveal new theoretical insights into the statistical behaviors of mobile agents and provide useful tools for effectively managing mobile agents in large networks.", "paper_title": "Statistical behaviors of mobile agents in network routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000303463200006"}
