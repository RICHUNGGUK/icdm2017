However, anonymity hinders the assessment of the veracity of assertions that online users make about their identity attributes, such as age or profession. We propose FaceTrust, a system that uses online social networks to provide lightweight identity credentials while preserving a user's anonymity. FaceTrust employs a \"game with a purpose\" design to elicit the opinions of the friends of a user about the user's self-claimed identity attributes, and uses attack-resistant trust inference to assign veracity scores to identity attribute assertions. FaceTrust provides credentials, which a user can use to corroborate his assertions. We evaluate our proposal using a live Facebook deployment and simulations on a crawled social graph. The results show that our veracity scores are strongly correlated with the ground truth, even when dishonest users make up a large fraction of the social network and employ the Sybil attack.
