It is shown how this metric can be used for solving statistical problems that are seemingly unrelated to classification and concern highly dependent time series. Specifically, the problems of time-series clustering, homogeneity testing and the three-sample problem are addressed. Universal consistency of the resulting algorithms is proven under most general assumptions. The theoretical results are illustrated with experiments on synthetic and real-world data.", "paper_title": "A Binary-Classification-Based Metric between Time-Series Distributions and Its Use in Statistical and Learning Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000327007400011"}
