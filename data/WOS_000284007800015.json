String matching is the most computation-consuming task in IDS. In this paper, a new algorithm for multiple string matching is proposed. This proposed algorithm is based on the canonical Aho-Corasick algorithm and it utilizes a bidirectional and parallel processing structure to accelerate the matching speed. The proposed string matching algorithm was implemented and patched into Snort for experimental evaluation. Comparing with the canonical Aho-Corasick algorithm, the proposed algorithm has gained much improvement on the matching speed, especially in detecting multiple keywords within a long input text string.", "paper_title": "An Efficient String Matching Algorithm Using Bidirectional and Parallel Processing Structure for Intrusion Detection System", "paper_id": "WOS:000284007800015"}
