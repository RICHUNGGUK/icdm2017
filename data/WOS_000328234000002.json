Companies must focus not only on the efficiency of supply chain, but also on its risks. If an unanticipated event occurs, all of the supply chain members will be impacted, and the result will cause significant loss. Therefore, this research proposes a modified failure mode and effects analysis (MFMEA) method to select new suppliers from the supply chain risk's perspective and applies the analytic hierarchy process (AMP) method to determine the weight of each criterion and sub-criterion for supplier selection. An IC assembly company is then studied to validate this model. The result shows that the case company can categorize its suppliers more effectively and at the same time select a low-risk supply chain partner. Moreover, the case company can provide unsatisfactory suppliers with valuable feedback that will help them improve and become its partners in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
