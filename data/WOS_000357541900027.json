In these materials, pore geometry evolves to minimize the solid-liquid interfacial energy while maintaining a constant dihedral angle,., at solid-liquid contact lines. We present a level set method to compute an implicit representation of the liquid-solid interface in textural equilibrium with space-filling tessellations of multiple solid grains in three dimensions. Each grain is represented by a separate level set function and interfacial energy minimization is achieved by evolving the solid-liquid interface under surface diffusion to constant mean curvature surface. The liquid volume and dihedral angle constraints are added to the formulation using virtual convective and normal velocity terms. This results in an initial value problem for a system of non-linear coupled PDEs governing the evolution of the level sets for each grain, using the implicit representation of the solid grains as initial condition. A domain decomposition scheme is devised to restrict the computational domain of each grain to few grid points around the grain. The coupling between the interfaces is achieved in a higher level on the original computational domain. The spatial resolution of the discretization is improved through high-order spatial differentiation schemes and localization of computations through domain composition. Examples of three-dimensional solutions are also obtained for different grain distributions networks that illustrate the geometric flexibility of the method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
