The approach stresses the practical use of a QM, not only in requirement definition and quality assessment, but also in quality improvement processes. The primary requirement for such QMs is organization mapping, which allows those who are in charge of quality management to easily identify the actors in the organization responsible for implementing or improving each specific quality characteristic. A core QM is proposed, collecting the main common characteristics of Web applications. This is not a complete QM, but requires adaptations to cope with specific application classes, organization and project needs and practical purposes. An example of such an adaptation is given for a simple class of Web sites. The core QM is compared with ISO/IEC 25010 QMs for software products and software-intensive computer systems.", "paper_title": "A CORE QUALITY MODEL FOR WEB APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000209097000002"}
