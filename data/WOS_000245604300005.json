Furthermore they must be able to cluster a data set without using any kind of a priori information, such as the required number of clusters. Clustering algorithms inspired by the behavior of real ants generally meet these requirements. In this article we propose a novel approach to ant-based clustering, based on fuzzy logic. We show that it improves existing approaches and illustrates how our algorithm can be applied to the problem of Web search results clustering.
