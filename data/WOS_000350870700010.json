Starting from basic statistical decision theory, optimal frequency-dependent weights are derived for a multiple-bin system and the Hotelling-SDNR calculated. A 28% increase in detectability index is found for high frequency objects when applying optimal frequency-dependent weights instead of pixel-based weights to a simplified model of a silicon detector, decreasing towards 0% for low frequency objects. Simulation results indicate a potentially large increase in detectability for high-frequency object imaging using silicon detectors, thus meriting further evaluations on a real system.", "paper_title": "Optimal Frequency-Based Weighting for Spectral X-Ray Projection Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000350870700010"}
