The mechanical model is a refinement of the classical sandwich theory (CST), for which the core is modelled with a third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT). The FE model is developed considering, through the beam length, electrically: constant voltage for piezoelectric layers and quadratic third-order variable of the electric potential in the core, while meclianically: linear axial displacement, quadratic bending rotation of the core and cubic transverse displacement of the sandwich beam. Despite the refinement of mechanical and electric behaviours of the piezoelectric core, the model leads to the same number of degrees of freedom as the previous CST one due to a two-step static condensation of the internal dof (bending rotation and core electric potential third-order variable). The results obtained with the proposed FE model are compared to available numerical, analytical and experimental ones. Results confirm that the TSDT and the induced cubic electric potential yield an extra stiffness to the sandwich beam. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
