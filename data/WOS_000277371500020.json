Design/methodology/approach - Measurements are based on the frequency shifts due to the adsorption of acetone vapor on the surface of the modified electrodes. A first-order linear time-invariant (LTI) system model is used to simulate the sensor response. Findings - It is found that frequency shifts are linear to the concentrations of analyte, and cycle test examination shows good repeatability. The sensitivity to acetone vapor is better than other volatile compounds. A good match result is obtained with the LTI system model. Originality/value - The device performance opens a potential way for analyzing acetone vapor.", "paper_title": "A study on QCM sensor for identification of acetone vapor", "paper_id": "WOS:000277371500020"}
