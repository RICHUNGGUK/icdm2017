Conformers from LeadQuest(A (R)) database of drug-like compounds were selected and then docked on the surface of TsCu/Zn-SOD. Results were screened looking for ligand contacts with receptor side-chains not conserved in the human homologue, with a subsequent development of a score optimization by a set of energy minimization steps, aimed to identify lead compounds for in vitro experiments. Six out of fifty experimentally tested compounds showed mu M inhibitory activity toward TsCu/Zn-SOD. Two of them showed species selectivity since did not inhibit the homologous human enzyme when assayed in vitro.", "paper_title": "Novel inhibitors to Taenia solium Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase identified by virtual screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000298191600004"}
