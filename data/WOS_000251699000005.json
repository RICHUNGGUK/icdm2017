More than ten different types of means (including the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic ones) were already studied 2000 years ago. Nevertheless, this topic has gained relevance in recent years. This is partly due to the increasing need of methods and operators for fusing information within computer programs. In this paper, we will present a personal view of the field, focusing on the application issues and on averaging aggregation operators. We will point out some research topics and open lines for future research.", "paper_title": "A view of averaging aggregation operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000251699000005"}
