In this paper, the sensitivity of the t-random variable under a left-truncated normal population is explored. Simulation results are used to assess the errors associated when applying the student t-distribution to the case of an underlying left-truncated normal population. The maximum errors are modelled as a linear function of the magnitude of the truncation and sample size. In the case of a left-truncated normal population, adjustments to standard inferences for the mean, namely confidence intervals and observed significance levels, based on the t-random variable are introduced.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity analysis of the t-distribution under truncated normal populations", "paper_id": "WOS:000265453400008"}
