This paper presents an investigation of selection performance of three input selection techniques, which include two model-free techniques, partial linear correlation (PLC) and partial mutual information (PMI) and a model-based technique based on genetic programming (GP). Four hypothetical datasets and two real datasets were used to demonstrate the performance of the three techniques. The results suggested that the model-free PLC technique due to its computational simplicity and the model-based GP technique due to its ability to detect non-linear relationships (demonstrated by its relatively good performance on a hypothetical complex non-linear dataset) are recommended for the input selection task. Candidate inputs which are selected by both these recommended techniques should be considered as significant inputs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
