The method is applied to a very large database on corporate performance over the last four decades. The results of this study provide a formal basis for making cross-peer-group comparisons among companies in very different industries and operating environments. This is done by using models for Bayesian multiple hypothesis testing to determine which firms, if any, have systematically out-performed their peer groups over time. We conclude that systematic out-performance, while it seems to exist, is quite rare worldwide. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
