When multiple sink nodes are interested in collecting the readings of the same monitoring region, it is conducive to exploit the sharing route to save bandwidth and power consumption and prolong WSN's lifetime. This paper proposes a Dynamic Route-Sharing Protocol (DRSP), which constructs sharing routes based on different attributes (for example, frequency, packet length or delay time) of the commands requested from different sink nodes. The proposed DRSP dynamically adjusts data transmission route to achieve the goals of routes sharing and route length reduction. The simulation study shows that DRSP saves more energy and bandwidth consumptions than the existing work and thus prolongs the WSN's lifetime.", "paper_title": "Adaptive route-sharing protocol for data collection in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000304747400005"}
