Each of them consists of N sub-systems which are represented by Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models. The main objective is to design stable filters that minimize a guaranteed cost index and to achieve a prescribed H-infinity performance. Based on Lyapunov theory, it is shown that the sufficient conditions guaranteeing stability and achieving prescribed performance are established by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. A simulation example is also given to show the effectiveness of the present approach.", "paper_title": "Decentralized mixed H-2/H-infinity filtering for discrete time fuzzy large-scale systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000290758000003"}
