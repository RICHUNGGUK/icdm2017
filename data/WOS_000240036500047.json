This paper analyses the Snort software network intrusion detection system to highlight the bottlenecks of such systems. It proposes a novel packet processing engine called UNITE that deploys a uniform hardware architecture to perform both header classification and payload signature extraction utilising a Content Addressable Memory (CAM) which is optimised by techniques based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). The proposed design has been implemented on an XC2VP30 FPGA, and we achieve an operating frequency of 350MHz and a processing speed in excess of 2.8Gbps. The area resource usage for UNITE is also shown to be efficient, with a Look Up Tables (LUTs) per character ratio of 0.82 for a rule set of approximately 20,000 characters.", "paper_title": "UNITE: Uniform hardware-based network intrusion deTection engine", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036500047"}
