The design takes as input the administrator's performance objectives, which can be adjusted at run-time. Based on these objectives, the design takes the necessary actions to achieve them and it dynamically adapts to changing networking conditions. It does so by periodically solving a linear optimization problem that computes a new configuration for the SMS system. We have evaluated the design through extensive simulations in various scenarios using traces from a production SMS system. It has proved effective in achieving the administrator's performance objectives, and efficient in terms of computational cost. Our experiments also show that the design is adaptive, i.e., it effectively adapts the systems's configuration to changes in the networking conditions, in order to continuously meet the performance objectives. Finally, the feasibility of our design is proved through the development of a prototype on a commercial SMS platform.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Performance Management for SMS Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272574500003"}
