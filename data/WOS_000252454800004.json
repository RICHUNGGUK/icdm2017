Recently, it was found that compression-first schemes outperform the conventional demosaicing-first schemes in terms of output image quality. An efficient prediction-based lossless compression scheme for Bayer CIA images is proposed in this paper. It exploits a context matching technique to rank the neighboring pixels when predicting a pixel, an adaptive color difference estimation scheme to remove the color spectral redundancy when handling red and blue samples, and an adaptive codeword generation technique to adjust the divisor of Rice code for encoding the prediction residues. Simulation results show that the proposed compression scheme can achieve a better compression performance than conventional lossless CIA image coding schemes.", "paper_title": "A lossless compression scheme for Bayer color filter array images", "paper_id": "WOS:000252454800004"}
