One of the major obstacles for air pollution index forecast is the data imbalance problem so that forecast model biases to the majority class. This paper proposes a new method called meta-cognitive online sequential extreme learning machine (MCOS-ELM) that aims to alleviate data imbalance problem and sequential learning at the same time. Under a real application of air pollution index forecast, the proposed MCOS-ELM was compared with retrained ELM and online sequential extreme learning machine in terms of accuracy and computational time. Experimental results show that MCOS-ELM has the highest efficiency and best accuracy for predicting the minority class (i.e., the most important but with fewest training samples) of air pollution level.", "paper_title": "Imbalanced Learning for Air Pollution by Meta-Cognitive Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000354884100009"}
