This paper presents an equivalent simulation method so as to transform this complex dynamic problem into an approximate initial-boundary problem. The equivalent elastic boundary applied by the blasting load was developed for multiple holes according to the spatial distribution of rock damage around each blasthole. The equivalent mechanics process of the complex blasting load was performed through analysis of the expansion of the borehole volume, the growth of cracks, the movement of stemming and the outburst of detonation gases. In combination with the blasting excavation of the tailrace tunnel in the Pubugou Hydropower Station, particle vibration velocities in the surrounding rock at different distances from the explosion source were simulated by applying this equivalent method based on the dynamic finite element method. The comparison with field monitoring data indicates that this equivalent simulation method is applicable to predicting the far-field dynamic response of the ground subjected to blasting load, and the selection of rock mass properties near the equivalent elastic boundary has a significant impact on simulation results.
