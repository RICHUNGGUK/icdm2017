The algorithm is based on the Euclid's algorithm for computing the GCD of rational numbers. We make use of the ability to parametrise the set of all solutions to a linear Diophantine equation in two variables with a. single parameter. The bounds on the variables are translated to bounds on the parameter. This is used progressively by reducing a n variable problem into a two variable problem. Computational experiments indicate that for a given number of variables the running times decreases with the increase in the number of equations in the system.", "paper_title": "Use of extended Euclidean algorithm in solving a system of linear diophantine equations with bounded variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566700014"}
