The method is based on a non-symmetric fuzzy partition of the space of input variables which results to networks with smaller structures and better approximation capabilities compared to other state-of-the-art training procedures. The lower modeling error and the smaller size of the produced models become particularly important when they are used in online applications. This is demonstrated by integrating the model produced by the proposed algorithm in a Model Predictive Control configuration, resulting in better control performance and shorter computational times.
