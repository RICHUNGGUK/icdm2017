Consumers' distrust of online stores becomes the main problem impeding the acceptance of online shopping. Initial trust is the focus of this study because most Internet users in China have no experience of online shopping. Although the technology acceptance model (TAM) has been extensively studied, it is rarely tested in the context of initial trust or in developing countries such as China. Because China has a very different cultural environment firom western countries, the results of existing studies on TAM and trust may, not be directly applied to China without actual examination. The study integrates TAM with initial trust to explain online shopping behaviour of Chinese consumers. The results demonstrate that perceived usefulness, consumers' trust propensity, website security and vendor reputation have significant effect on initial trust. Perceived usefulness fully mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and initial trust as well as the relationship between perceived ease of use and purchase intention.", "paper_title": "A research of consumers' initial trust in online stores in China", "paper_id": "WOS:000249285900002"}
