In this article we focus on multi-layer LTE-Advanced networks, and especially address aspects related to interference management. The network controlled time-domain enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) concept is outlined by explaining the benefits and characteristics of this solution. The benefits of using advanced terminal device receiver architectures with interference suppression capabilities are motivated. Extensive system level performance results are presented with bursty traffic to demonstrate the eICIC concepts ability to dynamically adapt according to the traffic conditions.", "paper_title": "ENHANCED INTER-CELL INTERFERENCE COORDINATION IN CO-CHANNEL MULTI-LAYER LTE-ADVANCED NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000321278800017"}
