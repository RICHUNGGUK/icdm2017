The asymptotic stability theorem and the relevant corollary for linearized nonlinear dynamical systems are stated. For BAM neural network with delayed self-feedback, a control model based on washout filter is proposed and analyzed. By applying the stability lemma, we investigate the stability of the control system and state the relevant theorem for choosing the parameters of the stabilized control system. Some numerical results are also given to illustrate the correctness of our results.", "paper_title": "On control of Hopf bifurcation in BAM neural network with delayed self-feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000044"}
