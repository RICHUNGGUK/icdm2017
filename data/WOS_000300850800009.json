A new discretization is introduced for the L (p) -convergence analysis and an O(h (delta) ) convergence result is proved given C (delta) -continuous coefficient functions. Numerical comparisons are made between three different methods. These suggest that the polar coordinate discretization method of Daripa applied in the present context is preferable.", "paper_title": "Convergence of a numerical solver for an a\"e-linear Beltrami equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000300850800009"}
