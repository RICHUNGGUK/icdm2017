In general, the modified shape of the workpiece is given as a mesh and has to be converted to a parametric representation by surface reconstruction before manufacturing. In this paper, a new approach for obtaining small shape modifications by direct deformation of the NC programs is presented. In an iterative process, the CAM data is modified by a free-form deformation and is verified by a milling simulation so that the modified workpiece can be manufactured directly on the basis of the original CAD/CAM data without surface reconstruction.
