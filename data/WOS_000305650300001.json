In this paper, we focus on the designing of automatic repeat-request (ARQ) protocols for the two-way wireless relay systems. According to different feedback schedules, we propose three basic ARQ protocols to improve the throughput of two-way relay systems, namely, relay-only ARQ (Ro-ARQ), terminal only ARQ (To-ARQ) and relay-terminal ARQ (RT-ARQ). Through analyzing the outage throughput of these three ARQ protocols, it is verified that all three protocols can improve the system performance. In addition, simulation results reveal that the RT-ARQ protocol has the closest performance to the theoretical throughput upperbound among all given methods without severe deterioration on system complexity.", "paper_title": "ARQ Protocols for Two-Way Wireless Relay Systems: Design and Performance Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000305650300001"}
