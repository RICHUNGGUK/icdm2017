The representations are mathematically proven to be no circuit (i.e., without any degeneracy), and associated with protein sequences in a one-to-one manner. In addition, our graphical curves allow more conveniently a visual inspection of protein sequences alignment. We illustrated our approach on two examples.", "paper_title": "H-L curve: A Novel 2D Graphical Representation of Protein Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000264128200022"}
