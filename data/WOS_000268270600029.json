Slag compositions have remarkable influences on the recovery of gold and the gold content in slag. A method for determining optimum flux compounding with neural networks is studied in this paper, and the neural network model for estimating the gold contents with different slag compositions is presented. On the basis of the neural network model, an algorithm for searching the optimum flux compounding in the gold-slime smelting process is proposed, and the optimum flux compositions are obtained accordingly.
