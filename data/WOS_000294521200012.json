The paper formally describes how those topics can be addressed in order to provide advanced identity functionality to end users. The security analysis demonstrates how privacy and security constraints are solved by the framework. Finally, a first approach of bindings shows how this proposal can be instantiated with existing and widely spread technologies. This work covers the missing parts of the most recent proposals on advanced identity management, as described in the related work, but it also provides a security analysis and a formal description of the proposed architecture.
