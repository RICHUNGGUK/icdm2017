We checked the reachability properties via reachability of the error labels, and the behavioral properties via a bounded LTL model checking approach. Our approach could solve about 700 properties for the small and medium problems from the offline phase, and scored overall about 5,000 marks but still ranked last in the competition.", "paper_title": "Applying symbolic bounded model checking to the 2012 RERS greybox challenge", "paper_id": "WOS:000209673300006"}
