In fact, the intrinsic value of assets at each moment is estimated by means of the classical principle of discounted cash flow model. A formula of the intrinsic value sequence of assets from the yield equation in discrete form and a formula of the intrinsic value function from the yield equation in continuous form are derived and some properties of the intrinsic value sequence and function for assets are given, such as linearity, non-arbitrage, and certain characteristics of the curve of intrinsic value function. In addition, we give the corresponding analytic formula of the intrinsic value functions for some commonly used cash earnings functions. Finally, several application modes to estimate the rationality prices of assets are discussed, making use of the concepts and the mathematical formula of the intrinsic value function proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "INTRINSIC VALUE FUNCTION OF ASSETS DETERMINED BY THE YIELD EQUATION AND ITS PROPERTIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161000021"}
