It is well known that the finite element discretization may fail to produce solutions converging with optimal rates unless the mesh fits with the discontinuity interface. We introduce a method based on piecewise linear finite elements on a non-fitting grid enriched with a local correction on a sub-grid constructed along the interface. We prove that our method recovers the optimal convergence rates both in H-1 and in L-2 depending on the local regularity of the solution. Several numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
