The complement of this language forms an ideal whose minimal elements, with respect to the factorial ordering, appear to have a particular combinatorial structure very close to the Christoffel words. In this paper, those words are completely characterized as those of the form uw(k)u where k >= 1, w = u . u and u, u, w are Christoffel words. Also, by considering the most balanced among the unbalanced words, we obtain a second characterization for a special class of minimal non-convex words that are of the form u(2)v(2) corresponding to the case k = 1 in the previous form.
