For this interactive user application, the total time for accessing the database, processing the data, and making the prediction needs to be within a few seconds. We first analyze three relatively fast machine learning-based time series prediction algorithms and find that the nearest neighbor (NN) algorithm (k NN with k = 1) shows better accuracy. Considering the sparseness of the time series of the charging records, we then discuss the new algorithm based on the new proposed time-weighted dot product (TWDP) dissimilarity measure to improve the accuracy and processing time. Two applications have been designed on top of the proposed prediction algorithm: one predicts the expected available energy at the outlet and the other one predicts the expected charging finishing time. The total time, including accessing the database, data processing, and prediction is approximately 1 s for both applications. The granularity of the prediction is 1 h and the horizon is 24 h; data have been collected from 20 EV charging outlets.", "paper_title": "Fast Prediction for Sparse Time Series: Demand Forecast of EV Charging Stations for Cell Phone Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000350356000025"}
