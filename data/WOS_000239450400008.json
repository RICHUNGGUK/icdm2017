With the success of Internet-based business, there is more and more interest in the availability of systems. This paper presents the Availability Management Framework(AMF), which supports the management of availability for applications in layered distributed systems. We focus on the AMF's flexibility in order to support various failure detection and recovery mechanisms that are required by each application. In addition, this paper describes the result of application of the AMF to support availability of RFID systems.", "paper_title": "A framework-based design for supporting availability of layered distributed applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000239450400008"}
