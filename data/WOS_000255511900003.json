The paper further develops the tooth profile model and the contact curves with the latency errors and examines the error effect on the helix model and the helix lead angle model. In addition, two kinds of limit curve model and the induced normal curvature models are further derived. This provides a comprehensive study of error effect on the meshing characteristics of the novel drive.
