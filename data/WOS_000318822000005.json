Working with three atoms inside three coupled cavities, we analyze the transport and the confinement of a single photon along two different directions. It is shown that two Q switches can be built by tuning the transition energy of each atom. Applying a classical field, we can implement high-speed gate operation between photon and atom. In addition, the influence of decoherence on the gate fidelity is also discussed.", "paper_title": "FAST iSWAP GATE USING TWO Q SWITCHES", "paper_id": "WOS:000318822000005"}
