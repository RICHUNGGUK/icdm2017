The probability of stochastic wind power based on nonlinear wind power curve and Weibull distribution is included in the model. In order to solve the revised dispatch strategy, quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is also adopted, which shows stronger search ability and quicker convergence speed. The dispatch model is tested on a modified IEEE benchmark system involving six thermal units and two wind farms using the real wind speed data obtained from two meteorological stations in Australia.", "paper_title": "Quantum-Inspired Particle Swarm Optimization for Power System Operations Considering Wind Power Uncertainty and Carbon Tax in Australia", "paper_id": "WOS:000310388400016"}
