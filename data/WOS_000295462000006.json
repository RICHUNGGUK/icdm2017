We study conventional, switched and relaxed controllable dynamical models described by nonlinear ordinary differential equations that are affine in the input. The special structure of these systems makes it possible to prove the strong approximability property that can provide a useful tool for some specific robustness results. The mathematical approach based on the nonlinear and set-valued analysis, allows to consider the controllable dynamics in an abstract setting and to obtain some general theoretical results. The latter can be effectively applied to a wide classes of switched control systems and to differential inclusions with affine structure.", "paper_title": "Applications of the strong approximability property to a class of affine switched systems and to relaxed differential equations with affine structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000295462000006"}
