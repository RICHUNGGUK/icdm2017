It has been shown by several researchers that, two-dimension (2-D) based algorithms that retain the natural matrix form of the 2-D filter's coefficients are computationally much more efficient than the conventional one-dimension (1-D) based algorithms that rearrange the coefficient matrix into a vector. In this paper, two 2-D based algorithms are presented for the weighted least squares (WLS) design of quadrantally symmetric 2-D FIR filters with arbitrary weighting functions. Both algorithms are based on matrix iterative techniques with guaranteed convergence, and they solve the WLS design problems accurately and efficiently. The convergence rate, solution accuracy and design time of these proposed algorithms are demonstrated and compared with existing algorithms through two design examples.", "paper_title": "Efficient 2-D based algorithms for WLS designs of 2-D FIR filters with arbitrary weighting functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000316871800002"}
