Unlike the commonly used quadratic cost function, involving the state, a cost function, involving the delayed state is considered. This naturally leads to a memory state feedback such that the resulting closed-loop system, is not only asymptotically stable but also guarantees an adequate level of performance even with an, admissible class of uncertainties. A sufficient condition for the existence of a guaranteed cost controller is given in, terms of the feasibility condition, of a linear matrix inequality. Finally, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Memory state feedback guaranteed cost control for neutral delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255300002"}
