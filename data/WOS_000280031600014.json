The following was found experimentally: (1) upon loading, the crushable rods slide, rotate and break, and finally the breakage band forms for the two types of stress paths and different stress states; and (2) for the axial loading stress path, the round rods mainly fail in the vertically split mode and laterally crushed mode. However, for the lateral unloading stress path, the round rods fail with the combination mode of locally crushed and vertically split. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
