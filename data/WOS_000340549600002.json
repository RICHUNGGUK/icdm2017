The controller is then applied to uncertain robotic manipulators, with a control objective of driving the system state to the original equilibrium point. It is proved that the closed-loop system is finite-time stable. Moreover, simulated and experimental results indicate that the proposed NNFTC is effective and robust.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Neural Network Finite-Time Control for Uncertain Robotic Manipulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000340549600002"}
