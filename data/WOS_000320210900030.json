The authors demonstrate that this biometric trait has the capability to provide enough discriminative information to authenticate the identity of a subject. A new methodology to compute the spatio-temporal biometric template recordings of the pupil area changes, in a video-oculography sequence under constant luminance level, is also introduced in this paper. According to the authors' knowledge, there is no evidence that other attempts were made, addressing this methodology to distinguish individuals based on the spatio-temporal representations, computed from the normal dilation-contraction behavior of the pupil. In this work, liveness will be detected by using the information obtained from the spontaneous pupillary oscillation mechanism. Preliminary experiments were conducted by using a particular own collected database, resulting in a (Equal Error Rate) in the order of 0.2338%. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
