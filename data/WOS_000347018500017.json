However, current methods are not yet ready for real use in industry due to insufficient artistic effect, noticeable distortion, and unbalanced contrast. We previously proposed a shape-from-shading (SFS) based method to automatically generate bas-reliefs from single frontal photographs of human faces; however, suppression of unwanted details remained a problem. Here, we give experimental results showing how incorporating non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) into our previous framework enables us to both suppress unwanted detail, and yet also emphasize important features. We have consider an alternative approach to recovering relief shape, based on photometric stereo instead of SFS for surface orientation estimation. This can effectively reduce the computational time.
