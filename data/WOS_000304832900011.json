This article elaborates some basic complexity theory for the CoL framework. Then it proves soundness and completeness for the deductive system CL12 with respect to the semantics of CoL, including the version of the latter based on polynomial time computability instead of computability-in-principle. CL12 is a sequent calculus system, where the meaning of a sequent intuitively can be characterized as 'the succedent is algorithmically reducible to the antecedent', and where formulas are built from predicate letters, function letters, variables, constants, identity, negation, parallel and choice connectives and blind and choice quantifiers. A case is made that CL12 is an adequate logical basis for constructive applied theories, including complexity-oriented ones.
