The surface treatment of MoO(3) with ultraviolet ozone (UVO), nitrogen (N(2)) and argon (Ar) gas plasma have been studied. The turn on voltage is lowered in UVO treated device whereas for plasma treated device the turn on voltage increases. The surface roughness as well as the interface resistance increases with all the treatments. The UVO treated MoO(3) device performance and stability enhances; the luminous efficiency by 16% and power efficiency by 14% compared with the reference device. The performance improvement can be explained by the change in work function of MoO(3) with UVO treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
