Many researchers have proposed solutions to security issues with cryptography and still images. However, they are unsuitable for 3D models, because of the 3D models' special characteristics. In this paper, we propose two schemes to solve the problem, of authentication in 3D mesh models. first, our schemes can detect and locate any unauthorized modification precisely. Second, both schemes have the features of being public and having the short key. Third, the distortion is controllable and is proven to be k(1)/3 on average, where k(1) is a key specified by users. In addition, after being slightly modified, both schemes can deal with point-sampled geometry and be robust to affine transformations.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE AUTHENTICATION SCHEMES FOR 3D MESH MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800016"}
