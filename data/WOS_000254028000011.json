The aim of this paper is to address this challenge and facilitate the move towards reconfigurable manufacturing by providing manufacturing industry and research with an integrated approach to developing highly customized and responsive product support for the next generation of complex and highly customized products. The paper Presents the key features of the proposed approach, its enabling technologies, architecture and development phases. These include development of training materials and their integration with the automation system, integration of the training materials with the diagnostic modules, and provision of context-aware training. The approach is illustrated with examples from the automotive industry.", "paper_title": "Adaptive, responsive and reconfigurable product support for future manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000011"}
