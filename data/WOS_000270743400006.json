Synchronization of TCP flows appears when optical bursts with segments from different flows inside are dropped in the network causing flow congestion windows decreasing simultaneously. In this article, this imminent effect is studied with different assembly schemes and network scenarios. Different metrics are applied to quantitatively assess synchronization with classical assembly schemes. A new burst assembly scheme is proposed that statically or dynamically allocates flows to multiple assembly queues to control flow aggregation within the assembly cycle. The effectiveness of the scheme has been evaluated, showing a good improvement in optical link utilization.", "paper_title": "On transmission control protocol synchronization in optical burst switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000270743400006"}
