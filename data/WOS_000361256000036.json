Modern electric power grids (smart grids) are equipped with smart sensors that allow to gather real-time information regarding the physical status of all components belonging to the whole infrastructure (e.g., cables and related insulation, transformers, and breakers). In real-world smart grid systems, usually, additional information that are related to the operational status of the grid are collected, such as meteorological information. Designing an efficient recognition model to discriminate faults in real-world smart grid system is hence a challenging task. This follows from the heterogeneity of the information that actually determine a typical fault condition. In this paper, we deal with the problem of modeling and recognizing faults in a real-world smart grid system, which supplies the entire city of Rome, Italy. Recognition of faults is addressed by following a combined approach of dissimilarity measures learning and one-class classification techniques. We provide here an in-depth study related to the available data and to the models based on the proposed one-class classification approach. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the fault recognition results by exploiting a fuzzy set based decision rule. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
