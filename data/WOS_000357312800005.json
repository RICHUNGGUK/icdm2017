Decision makers can decide on optimum locations of suitable treatment, recycling and disposal centers, and also the routes for transporting of different types of industrial wastes between these centers by the help of the model. There are considered three criteria in the mathematical model which minimizing total costs of transportation and establishment of the centers and total transportation and site risks related to the population exposure along transportation routes and around treatment and disposal centers. During the optimization process, waste collection system is improved by considering fuzzy customer satisfaction level. Finally, the model is computed and solved by Lingo software to find efficient solutions.", "paper_title": "Application of a fuzzy service level constraint for solving a multi-objective location-routing problem for the industrial hazardous wastes", "paper_id": "WOS:000357312800005"}
