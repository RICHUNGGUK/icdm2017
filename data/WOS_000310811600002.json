In this work, we investigate the optimization of queries that involve multiple data resources, each of which is processed by non-overlapping sets of remote filtering services. The main novelty of this work is the proposal of optimization algorithms that produce an ordering of calls to services so that the query response time is minimized. The distinctive features of our work lie in the consideration of direct, heterogenous links among services and of multiple data resources. To the best of our knowledge, there is no known algorithm for this problem and the evaluation results show that the proposed algorithms can yield significant performance improvements compared to naive approaches.", "paper_title": "Optimization of decentralized multi-way join queries over pipelined filtering services", "paper_id": "WOS:000310811600002"}
