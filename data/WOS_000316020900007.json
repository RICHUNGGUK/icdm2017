The problem is defined as follows: The Maximum Quasi-biclique Problem: Given a bipartite graph G=(Xa(a)Y,E) and a number 0 <delta a parts per thousand currency sign0.5, find a subset X (opt) of X and a subset Y (opt) of Y such that any vertex xaX (opt) is incident to at least (1-delta)|Y (opt) | vertices in Y (opt) , any vertex yaY (opt) is incident to at least (1-delta)|X (opt) | vertices in X (opt) and |X (opt) |+|Y (opt) | is maximized. The problem was proved to be NP-hard. We design a polynomial time approximation scheme to give a quasi-biclique X'aS dagger X and Y'aS dagger Y with |X'|+|Y'|a parts per thousand yen(1-epsilon)(|X (opt) |+|Y (opt) |) such that any vertex xaX' is incident to at least (1-delta-epsilon)|Y'| vertices in Y' and any vertex yaY' is incident to at least (1-delta-epsilon)|X'| vertices in X' for any epsilon > 0, where X (opt) and Y (opt) form the optimal solution.", "paper_title": "Near optimal solutions for maximum quasi-bicliques", "paper_id": "WOS:000316020900007"}
