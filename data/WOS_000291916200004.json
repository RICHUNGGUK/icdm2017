Special attention is given to the analytical derivation of consistent density-corrected tangent operators, which means that explicit formulas are derived without any approximations. The whole procedure depends strongly on the choice of the stress-strain measure and on the employed algorithms. Here, we present a Lagrangian finite deformation version. Numerical examples are presented in order to attest the proposed methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
