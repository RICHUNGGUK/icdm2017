In the method, the gene regulation, an important mechanism of gene activities, is first introduced, and then the probabilities of gene regulation are estimated. These probabilities can be seen as the gene regulation information and can be used for gene selection. The applications to the leukemia dataset and the colon dataset suggest that our proposed method is effective, efficient, and competitive to the previous methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
