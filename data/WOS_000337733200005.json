This is done by considering all the coupling and interference interactions between the channels of the system as disturbances, using an Extended State Observer (ESO) to estimate them in real time and then canceling its effect employing the estimate as part of the control signal. The ADRC tuning is essentially a pole-placement technique and the desired performance is indirectly achieved through the location of the closed-loop poles. However, the final choice of these poles becomes a trial-and-error strategy. In contrast with pole-placement, in the LQR method, the desired performance objectives are directly and globally addressed by minimizing a quadratic function of the state and control input.", "paper_title": "ADRC Tuning Employing the LQR Approach for Decoupling Uncertain MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000337733200005"}
