One of the tools for lean is cellular manufacturing. This technique reduces the factory to several small entities which are easier to manage. The algorithm proposed in this paper is based on a simultaneous resolution of two interdependent problems. These two problems emerge when the flexibility is used during the production process. This paper proves the efficiency of the simultaneous resolution comparing to the sequential resolution with iterations. To compare only the resolution method, a unique grouping genetic algorithm is adapted to be used in both cases.", "paper_title": "Generalized cell formation: iterative versus simultaneous resolution with grouping genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800022"}
