However, existing methods are mainly suffer from confusing backgrounds in real-world images. In this paper, we try to address this issue by exploring and combining several human skin properties, i.e. color property, texture property and region property. First, images are divided into superpixels, and robust skin seeds and background seeds are acquired through color property and texture property of skin. Then we combining color, region and texture properties of skin by proposing a novel skin color and texture based graph cuts (SCTGC) to acquire the final skin detection results. Comprehensive and comparative experiments show that the proposed method achieves promising performance and outperforms many state-of-the-art methods over publicly available challenging datasets with a great part of hard images.
