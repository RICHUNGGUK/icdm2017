We present a new method to realize effective visual surveillance under an environment in which a number of non-calibrated fixed surveillance cameras are being operated. We also show two applications that are useful for surveillance tasks based on our proposed method. One is \"suggestion of associative blocks\", and the other is \"dominant camera selection\". Our approach exploits co-occurrence between two regions of interest (ROIs) over the surveillance cameras, and it needs neither calibration nor supervised training. We have conducted preliminary tests with forty cameras installed in a room and a corridor next to the room, and some promising results of the two applications are shown in this paper.", "paper_title": "Visual surveillance using less ROIs of multiple non-calibrated cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000235772300033"}
