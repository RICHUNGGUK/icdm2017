Its semantics is given in the form of networks of timed automata, which can be checked using symbolic methods. This paper shows how to detect various kinds of indefinite waitings in the components of such systems. The method is experimented using the PRISM model checker.", "paper_title": "Indefinite waitings in MIRELA systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000367336000002"}
