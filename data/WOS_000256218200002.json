Using the red blood cell as a common example the method locates the edge of the cell, with sub-pixel precision at multiple points on the periphery. This method is a different implementation to a technique used for giant unilamellar vesicles and addresses issues relating specifically to biological cells, in particular relating to finding a local minima, calculating equi-spaced measuring points for arbitrary shapes and using the perpendicular direction to the edge for position measurement. Parameters have been defined to characterise the cell's membrane behaviour and the analysis program allows the automatic compilation of multiple tests under varying conditions, and statistical comparison of identical populations of cells.
