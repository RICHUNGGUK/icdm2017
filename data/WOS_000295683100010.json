It is well known that the Bayes estimators of the two-parameter gamma distribution do not have compact form. In this paper, it is assumed that the scale parameter has a gamma prior and the shape parameter has any log-concave prior, and they are independently distributed. Under the above priors, we use Gibbs sampling technique to generate samples from the posterior density function. Based on the generated samples, we can compute the Bayes estimates of the unknown parameters and can also construct HPD credible intervals. We also compute the approximate Bayes estimates using Lindley's approximation under the assumption of gamma priors of the shape parameter. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compare the performances of the Bayes estimators with the classical estimators. One data analysis is performed for illustrative purposes. We further discuss the Bayesian prediction of future observation based on the observed sample and it is seen that the Gibbs sampling technique can be used quite effectively for estimating the posterior predictive density and also for constructing predictive intervals of the order statistics from the future sample.", "paper_title": "Bayes estimation and prediction of the two-parameter gamma distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000295683100010"}
