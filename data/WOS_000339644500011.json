Gutman. The problem on determining the maximal energy tends to be complicated for a given class of graphs. There are many approaches on the maximal energy of trees, unicyclic graphs and bicyclic graphs, respectively. Let P-n(6,6,6) denote the graph with n >= 20 vertices obtained from three copies of C-6 and a path Pn-18 by adding a single edge between each of two copies of C-6 to one endpoint of the path and a single edge from the third C-6 to the other endpoint of the Pn-18. Very recently, Aouchiche et al. [M. Aouchiche, G. Caporossi, P. Hansen, Open problems on graph eigenvalues studied with AutoGraphiX, Europ. J. Comput.Optim. 1(2013), 181-199] put forward the following conjecture: Let G be a tricyclic graphs on is vertices with n = 20 or n >= 22, then epsilon(G) <= epsilon(P-n(6,6,6)) with equality if and only if G congruent to P-n(6,6,6). Let G(n; a, b, k) denote the set of all connected bipartite tricyclic graphs on n vertices with three vertex-disjoint cycles C-a, C-b, and C-k, where n >= 20. In this paper, we try to prove that the conjecture is true for graphs in the class G is an element of G (n; a, b, k), but as a consequence we can only show that this is true for most of the graphs in the class except for", "paper_title": "On a Conjecture about Tricyclic Graphs with Maximal Energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000339644500011"}
