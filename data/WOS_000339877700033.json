Reversible data hiding has drawn considerable attention in recent years. Being reversible, the decoder can extract the hidden data and recover the cover image completely. In this paper we used the block prediction to achieve histogram-based reversible data hiding. The histogram is created by exploiting all difference values between pixels and their predictive values. Experimental results show that our scheme is capable of providing great embedding capacity without making noticeable distortion. In the one-level data hiding, our scheme preserves image quality larger than 48 dB and has the best capacity. Moreover, in the multilevel cases, our scheme performs better than other existing schemes. Our scheme can successfully increase the embedding capacity from histogram-based data hiding and preserve image quality well.", "paper_title": "Image reversibility in data embedding on the basis of blocking-predictions", "paper_id": "WOS:000339877700033"}
