A strong security model for certificateless public key encryption was established by Al-Riyami and Paterson in 2003. In this paper, we first present a security model for certificateless public-key signature schemes, and then propose an efficient construction based on bilinear pairings. The security of the proposed scheme can be proved to be equivalent to the computational Diffie-Hellman problem in the random oracle model with a tight reduction.", "paper_title": "Certificateless public-key signature: Security model and efficient construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000238570400020"}
