However, LSI is notably a computationally intensive process because of the computing complexities of singular value decomposition and filtering operations involved in the process. This paper presents MR-LSI, a Map Reduce based distributed LSI algorithm for scalable information retrieval. The performance of MR-LSI is first evaluated in a small scale experimental cluster environment, and subsequently evaluated in large scale simulation environments. By partitioning the dataset into smaller subsets and optimizing the partitioned subsets across a cluster of computing nodes, the overhead of the MR-LSI algorithm is reduced significantly while maintaining a high level of accuracy in retrieving documents of user interest. A genetic algorithm based load balancing scheme is designed to optimize the performance of MR-LSI in heterogeneous computing environments in which the computing nodes have varied resources.", "paper_title": "A MAPREDUCE BASED DISTRIBUTED LSI FOR SCALABLE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000338484900002"}
