The results show that the Forti's conjecture is true when neural networks are affected by impulses. Further, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results obtained in this paper.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis for neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations and impulses", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211400004"}
