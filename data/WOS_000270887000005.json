Starting from some theoretical considerations about the role of ontologics in engineering design, this paper reflects on the difficulties that arise when knowledge is distributed, and Misunderstanding and communication problems among partners could easily lead to errors in the final product.", "paper_title": "An upper-level functional design ontology to support knowledge management in SME-based E-Manufacturing of mechanical products", "paper_id": "WOS:000270887000005"}
