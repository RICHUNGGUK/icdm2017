Using the discriminant analysis based feature ranking, an ordered feature queue can be obtained according to the saliency of features. The neural network is trained by minimizing an augmented cross-entropy error function in the method. Feature selection is based on the reaction of the cross-validation data set classification error due to the removal of the individual features. The approach proposed is compared with four other feature selection methods, each of which banks on a different concept. The algorithm proposed outperforms the other methods by achieving higher classification accuracy on all the problems tested.", "paper_title": "A new method for feature selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000203"}
