In this paper, we use the technique of support vector regression on wavelet sub-bands to learn a model relating facial shape (obtained from 3D scanners) to 3D pose in an identity-invariant manner. The proposed method yields an estimation accuracy of 97-99% within an error of +/- 9 degrees on a large set of data obtained from two different sources. The method could be used for pose estimation in a view-invariant face recognition system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
