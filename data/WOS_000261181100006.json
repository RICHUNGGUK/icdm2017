It was tested in laboratory and animal trials to ascertain its suitability for achieving a target renal temperature of 15C for tissue preservation within a 30-min period. A simple theoretical model was developed to calculate cooling rates under ideal circumstances. In the laboratory, a potato was used as the model for the kidney and an average minimum temperature of 15.8C was reached in 30 min. The theoretical model calculated this as 9.9C. In the animal trials, an average minimum temperature of 11.4C was reached in 30 min, compared to the calculated temperature of 9.8C from the theoretical model. In conclusion, the new device can cool as affectively as other techniques trialled, with the added advantage that it does not release cold fluid or ice into the abdomen.", "paper_title": "Laparoscopic renal cooling device", "paper_id": "WOS:000261181100006"}
