The H.264/AVC uses an in-loop deblocking filter to remove the blocking artifacts. The filter considers some coding conditions in its adaptive deblocking filtering such as coded block pattern (CBP), motion vector, macroblock type, etc. for inter-predicted blocks, however, it does not consider much for intra-coded blocks. In this paper, we utilize the human visual system (HVS) characteristic and the local characteristic of image blocks to modify the boundary strength (BS) of the intra-deblocking filter in order to gain improvement in the subjective quality and also to reduce the complexity in filtering Ultra coded slices. In addition, we propose a low-complexity deblocking method which utilizes the correlation between vertical and horizontal boundaries of a block in inter coded slices. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves not only significant gain in the subjective quality but also some PSNR gain, and reduces the computational complexity of the deblocking filter by 36.23% on average.", "paper_title": "A Low Complexity H.264/AVC Deblocking Filter with Simplified Filtering Boundary Strength Decision", "paper_id": "WOS:000315244800020"}
