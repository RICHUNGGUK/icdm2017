While most of the previous methods convert a string into intermediate codes with phonetic transformation rules, this paper proposes a novel algorithm to segment two phonetic strings into syllables and find the optimal pairing of the corresponding syllables to calculate their similarity score. The experiment shows that this method is very effective and flexible. It can be easily adapted to different datasets and achieves optimal performance on average.", "paper_title": "Syllable alignment: A novel model for phonetic string search", "paper_id": "WOS:000234952100038"}
