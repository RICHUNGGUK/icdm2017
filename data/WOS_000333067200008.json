However, as new ones are frequently emerging in this changing time, authors have to change and update them constantly and, consequently; development teams do not know which is the most suitable for them because in many cases it depends on their project scope. Furthermore, approaches are usually appearing with different concepts and terminologies in many cases, although all lack the use of standards and practical experience. Thus, the need of managing quality in this type of approach arises every day. This paper suggests a characterization of these methodologies in order to use this information for the quality management of Model-Driven Web development methodologies for authors and development teams alike. In addition, an experimental study in order to analyse and evaluate a Model-Driven Web development methodology (the NDT methodology) has been carried out within a specific work context.", "paper_title": "TOWARDS A HOMOGENEOUS CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MODEL-DRIVEN WEB DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000333067200008"}
