We present Maximal Metric Margin Partitioning (MMMP), a partitioning scheme for similarity search indexes. MMMP divides the data based on its distribution pattern, especially for the boundaries of clusters. A partitioning boundary created by MMMP is likely to be located in a sparse area between clusters. Moreover, the partitioning boundary is at maximum distances from the two cluster edges. We also present an indexing scheme, named the MMMP-Index, which uses MMMP and pivot filtering. The MMMP-Index can prune many objects that are not relevant to a query, and it reduces the query execution cost. Our experimental results show that MMMP effectively indexes clustered data and reduces the search cost. For clustered data in a vector space, the MMMP-Index reduces the computational cost to less than two thirds that of comparable schemes.", "paper_title": "Margin-Based Pivot Selection for Similarity Search Indexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250600012"}
