A demand response program offers time-based rates that allow customers to choose whether to adjust their consumption. In the manufacturing sector, production managers are likely to participate in a demand response program if they can schedule their production operations in response to electricity prices at peak times. The drum-buffer-rope (DBR) scheduling system in the theory of constraints (TOC) is a useful production operation method because it helps managers focus on effectively managing capacity based on the critical constraint that limits performance of the system. This paper presents a conceptual approach to managing production in consideration of shifting electrical loads in an effort to deal with the most expensive hours of the day. A DBR-based operation model is developed to determine the running time of production processes depending on power saving vs. throughput loss. Conceptual cases are prepared to demonstrate how a production manager can shift electrical loads in response to electricity prices. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
