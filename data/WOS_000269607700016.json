This problem is currently being attacked from many different points of view, a strong indication of its current importance. Precisely, being able to predict new drug-target interactions with both high precision and accuracy is the holy grail, a fundamental requirement for in silico methods to be useful in a biological setting. This, however, remains extremely challenging due to, amongst other things, the rarity of known drug-target interactions. Results: We propose a novel supervised inference method to predict unknown drug-target interactions, represented as a bipartite graph. We use this method, known as bipartite local models to first predict target proteins of a given drug, then to predict drugs targeting a given protein. This gives two independent predictions for each putative drug-target interaction, which we show can be combined to give a definitive prediction for each interaction. We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method in the prediction of four classes of drug-target interaction networks involving enzymes, ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors in human. This enables us to suggest a number of new potential drug-target interactions.", "paper_title": "Supervised prediction of drug-target interactions using bipartite local models", "paper_id": "WOS:000269607700016"}
