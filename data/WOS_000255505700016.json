We show that the result can be derived directly as a consequence of two common assumptions, and matches the results obtained from using Rand S-transforms in free probability theory. We also give a direct derivation of the a.e.d. of the sum of certain random matrices which are not free. This is used to determine the asymptotic signal-to-interference-ratio of a multiuser code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system with a minimum mean-square error linear receiver.", "paper_title": "Eigenvalue distributions of sums and products of large random matrices via incremental matrix expansions", "paper_id": "WOS:000255505700016"}
