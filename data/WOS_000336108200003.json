The approach is an extension of our previous work where similar principles were used to develop a path planning algorithm. In this work, we select a mobile robot exploration task as a platform for exhibiting the core properties of the proposed computational framework. The functionalities represent particular building blocks that provide decision-logic capability of the exploration strategy. Beside a single mobile robot exploration, the proposed principles can also be generalized for multi-robot exploration, which is supported by the presented results.", "paper_title": "Reaction-Diffusion based Computational Model for Autonomous Mobile Robot Exploration of Unknown Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000336108200003"}
