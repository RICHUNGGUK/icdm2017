Both methods are based on a special interpolation scheme for the velocity components but with different effects and behaviour. They introduce varying errors in the continuity equation but also the derivation of terms contributing to the special interpolation have a great influence on the quality of the results. By means of various examples the two stabilisation methods and their contributing parts are compared. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
