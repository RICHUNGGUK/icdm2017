From this embedding, we obtain a mapping from Ferraris's propositional general logic programs to circumscription, and show that this mapping can be used to check the strong equivalence between two propositional logic programs in classical logic. We also show that Ferraris's propositional general logic programs can be extended to the first-order case, and our mapping from Ferraris's propositional general logic programs to circumscription can be extended to the first-order case as well to provide a semantics for these first-order general logic programs.
