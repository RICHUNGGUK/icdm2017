In the early stages of dynamic flexible manufacturing system (FMS) environments, only a litter data is obtained, and this means that the scheduling knowledge is often unreliable. The purpose of this research is to utilize data expansion techniques for an obtained small data set to improve the accuracy of machine learning for FMS scheduling. This research proposes a mega-trend-diffusion technique to estimate the domain range of a small data set and produce artificial samples for training the modified backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The tool used is the Pythia software. The results of the FMS simulation model indicate that learning accuracy can be significantly improved when the proposed method is applied to a very small data set. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
