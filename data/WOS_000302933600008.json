Major advantages of a space-time formulation are its excellent capabilities of dealing with moving and deforming domains and grids and its ability to achieve higher-order accurate approximations in both time and space by simply increasing the order of polynomial approximation in the space-time elements. Our formulation is related to the HDG formulation for incompressible flows introduced recently in, e. g., [N.C. Nguyen, J. Peraire, B. Cockburn, A hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for Stokes flow, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 199 (2010) 582-597]. However, ours is inspired in typical DG formulations for compressible flows which allow for a more straightforward implementation. Another difference is the use of polynomials of fixed total degree with space-time hexahedral and quadrilateral elements, instead of simplicial elements. We present numerical experiments in order to assess the quality of the performance of the methods on deforming domains and to experimentally investigate the behavior of the convergence rates of each component of the solution with respect to the polynomial degree of the approximations in both space and time.
