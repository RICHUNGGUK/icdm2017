These access points can provide high-rate mobile services at hotspots to users. In a Small Cell Network (SCN), the good deployment of small cells can guarantee the performance of users on the basis of average and cell edge spectrum efficiency. In this paper, the performance of small cell deployment is analyzed by using system-level simulations. The positions of small cells can be adjusted according to the deployment radius and angle. Moreover, different Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) techniques are also studied, which can be implemented either in time domain or in frequency domain. The network performances are evaluated under different ICIC techniques when the locations of Small evolved Nodes (SeNBs) vary. Simulation results show that the average throughput and cell edge throughput can be greatly improved when small cells are properly deployed with the certain deployment radius and angle. Meanwhile, how to optimally configure the parameters to achieve the potential of the deployment is discussed when applying different ICIC techniques.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis and Evaluation of Deployment in Small Cell Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000353109800003"}
