In this paper a study of the backoff exponent (BE) management in CSMA-CA for 802.15.4 is conducted. The BEs determine the number of backoff periods the device shall wait before accessing the channel. The power consumption requirements make CSMA-CA use fewer Bes which increase the probability of devices choosing identical Bes and as a result wait for the same number of backoff periods in some cases. This inefficiency degrades system performance at congestion scenarios, by bringing in more collisions. This paper addresses the problem by proposing an efficient management of Bes based on a decision criterion. As a result of the implementation potential packet collisions with other devices are restricted. The results of NS-2 simulations indicate an overall improvement in effective data bandwidth, validating our claim.", "paper_title": "Adaptive backoff exponent algorithm for Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)", "paper_id": "WOS:000238120800046"}
