We present a novel distributed processing framework called Intelligent Foraging, Gathering and Matching (I-FGM) that addresses this problem by concentrating on resource allocation and adapting to computational needs in real-time. It serves as an umbrella framework in which the various tools and techniques available in information retrieval can be used effectively and efficiently. We implement a prototype of I-FGM and validate it through both empirical studies and theoretical performance analysis.", "paper_title": "A large-scale distributed framework for information retrieval in large dynamic search spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000296009800004"}
