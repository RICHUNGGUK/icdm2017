This paper proposes a novel method for multipath search through Minimum Descriptive Length (MDL) criterion, and hence a novel instantaneous RDS estimation method for wireless OFDM systems. compared with the conventional multipath search based instantaneous RDS estimators, the proposed estimator doesn't need any a priori information about the noise variance and the channel power delay profile (PDP) while the performance is improved. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator is also insensitive to the variance of SNR and robust against the frequency selectivity, as well as the vehicle speed.", "paper_title": "A novel RMS delay spread estimation for wireless OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241305800014"}
