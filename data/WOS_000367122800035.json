In this paper, a high payload image steganographic scheme based on an extended interpolating method is proposed. In the premise of image quality assurance, the proposed scheme increases the capacity by maximizing the difference between neighboring pixels. Meanwhile, it has low complexity and retains good image quality. Extensive experiments on images have been conducted and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than several state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
