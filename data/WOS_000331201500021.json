The proposed methodology, which covers the entire design flow, from specifications to component sizing, is validated with three design examples, namely a second-order, a third-order, and a fourth-order class-D amplifier. Moreover, the third-order class-D amplifier has been integrated on silicon and characterized, further confirming the validity of the whole design flow. The achieved results demonstrate that high-order class-D amplifiers can achieve total-harmonic-distortion (THD) performance compatible with the specifications of high-end audio applications (THD a parts per thousand 90 dB), which would be unfeasible with conventional first-order class-D amplifiers.", "paper_title": "A design methodology for high-order class-D audio amplifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000331201500021"}
