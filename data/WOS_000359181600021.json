The de-facto standard methods based on machine learning or computer vision still suffer from a phenomenon of visual polysemia and concept polymorphism (VPCP). To resolve the VPCP, semantic dictionary has been proposed to characterize the membership distribution between visual appearances and semantic concepts. In this paper, we propose an online semantic dictionary learning algorithm on the base of both locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and stochastic approximations, which can scale up to large scale datasets with millions of training samples and speedup the efficiency of follow-up processing. With the help of the LSH-based semantic dictionary, we develop an extension of the spatial pyramid matching (SPM) kernel method by generalizing the dictionary as a basic semantic description. The efficiency of our approach is validated in the experiments of web-scale semantic image search and image classification on the ImageNet dataset and Caltech-256 dataset.
