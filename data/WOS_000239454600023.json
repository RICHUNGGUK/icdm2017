We first propose two algorithms that find optimal solutions for two cases, respectively, and then we propose one approximation algorithm for a special case that has the best possible performance ratio. At last we consider how to apply the obtained result to solve a wavelength assignment problem in all optical networks.", "paper_title": "Connected set cover problem and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454600023"}
