The algorithms are based on strategy iteration. Our algorithms can, for instance, be used for the analysis of recursive stochastic games. In the present article we apply our techniques for computing abstract least fixpoint semantics of affine programs over the relational template polyhedra domain. In particular, we thus obtain practical algorithms for computing abstract least fixpoint semantics over the abstract domains of intervals, zones, and octagons.", "paper_title": "Solving Systems of Rational Equations through Strategy Iteration", "paper_id": "WOS:000290019800003"}
