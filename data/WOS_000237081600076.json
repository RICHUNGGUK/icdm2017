TeNDaX is a new approach for word-processing in which documents (i.e. content and structure, tables, images etc.) are stored in a database in a semi-structured way. This supports the provision of collaborative editing and layout, undo- and redo operations, business process definition and execution within documents, security, and awareness. During document creation process and use meta data is gathered automatically. This meta data can then be used for the TeNDaX dynamic folders, data lineage, visual- and text mining and search. We present TeNDaX as a word-processing 'LAN-Party': collaborative editing and layout; business process definition and execution; local and global undo- and redo operations; all based on the use of multiple editors and different operating systems. In a second step we demonstrate how one can use the data and meta data to create dynamic folders, visualize data provenance, carry out visual- and text mining and support sophisticated search functionality.", "paper_title": "TeNDaX, a collaborative database-based real-time editor system - A word-processing 'LAN-Party'", "paper_id": "WOS:000237081600076"}
