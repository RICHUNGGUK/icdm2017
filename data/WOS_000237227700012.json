It is based on the authentication tests theory and enhances the original methods by introducing the notion of message type. Formalized definition of replay attacks have been integrated into the original theoretical models for further verification of security protocols. The thoroughly proof of initial and subsequent authentications in Neuman-Stubblebine protocol shows that the improved authentication tests can find flaws of the protocol more efficiently than the original ones.", "paper_title": "Security protocol analysis with improved authentication tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000237227700012"}
