They consist in identifying the columns of the (filtered permuted) mixing matrix in Constant-Time TF zones where they detect that a single source occurs, using TIme-Frequency Ratios Of Mixtures (hence their name AD-TIFROM-CT). We thus identify columns of scale coefficients and time shifts. Unlike various previously reported TF-BSS approaches, these methods set very limited constraints on the source sparsity and overlap. They are especially suited to non-stationary sources.", "paper_title": "Two time-frequency ratio-based blind source separation methods for time-delayed mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300085"}
