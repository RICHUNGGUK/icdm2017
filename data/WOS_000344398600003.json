This problem is formulated as three-objective problem which minimizes completion time (makespan), critical machine workload and total work load of all machines. The quantum coding is shown to improve the immune strategy. The proposed algorithm overcomes the problem by increasing the speed of convergence and diversity of population. Three benchmarks of Kacem and Brandimart are examined to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show a better performance in comparison to other approaches.", "paper_title": "A Novel Quantum Immune Algorithm for Multiobjective Flexible Job Shop Scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000344398600003"}
