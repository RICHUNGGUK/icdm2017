Although organisations adopt Cloud Computing for Web Services, technical and business challenges emerge, including the measurement of Cloud business performance. Organisational Sustainability Modelling (OSM) is a way to measure Cloud business performance quantitatively and accurately. It combines statistical computation and 3D Visualisation to present the Return on Investment arising from the adoption of Cloud Computing by organisations. 3D visualisation simplifies the review process and is a method for Return of Investment (ROI) valuation. Two detailed case studies with SAP and Vodafone are presented, where OSM has analysed the business performance and explained how CCBF offers insights, which are helpful for WS and Grid businesses. Comparisons and discussions between CCBF and other approaches related to WS are presented, where lessons learned are useful for Web Services, Cloud and Grid communities.", "paper_title": "Case Studies and Organisational Sustainability Modelling Presented by Cloud Computing Business Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000295797600002"}
