We have previously demonstrated a potential relationship between color-Doppler M-mode (CDMM) images and two basic indices of LV function: peak-systolic elastance (E-max) and the time-constant of LV relaxation (tau). Thus, we hypothesized that these two indices could be estimated noninvasively by adequate postprocessing of CDMM recordings. A semiparametric regression (SR) version of support vector machine (SVM) is here proposed for building a blind model, capable of analyzing CDMM images automatically, as well as complementary clinical information. Simultaneous invasive and Doppler tracings were obtained in nine mini-pigs in a high-fidelity experimental setup. The model was developed using a test and validation leave-one-out design. Reasonably acceptable prediction accuracy was obtained for both E-max (intraclass correlation coefficient R-ic = 0.81) and tau (R-ic = 0.61). For the first time, a quantitative, noninvasive estimation of cardiovascular indices is addressed by processing Doppler-echocardiography recordings using a learning-from-samples method.", "paper_title": "Support vector analysis of color-Doppler images: A new approach for estimating indices of left ventricular function", "paper_id": "WOS:000239359700006"}
