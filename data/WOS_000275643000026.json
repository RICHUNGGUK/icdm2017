By establishing an L-operator delay differential inequality with impulses and using the stochastic analysis technique, some Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the existence and global exponential stability of periodic solution for the addressed neural networks. Those conditions only including related parameters of neural networks can be easily checked by simple algebraic methods. Finally, two examples and their simulations are given to show the feasibility and effectiveness of our results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
