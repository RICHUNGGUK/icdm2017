While general relations are not possible to prove, we study these measures on the \"trajectories\" of the form parallel to (X) over right arrow parallel to = a parallel to (Y) over right arrow parallel to, where a > 0 is a constant and parallel to center dot parallel to denotes the Euclidean norm of a vector. In this case, direct functional relations between these measures are proved. For Jaccard, we prove that it Is a convexly increasing function of Salton's cosine measure, but always smaller than or equal to the latter, hereby explaining a curve, experimentally found by Leydesdorff. All the other measures have a linear relation with Salton's cosine, reducing even to equality, in case a = 1. Hence, for equally normed vectors (e.g., for normalized vectors) we, essentially, only have Jaccard's measure and Salton's cosine measure since all the other measures are equal to the latter.", "paper_title": "New Relations Between Similarity Measures for Vectors Based on Vector Norms", "paper_id": "WOS:000263136200002"}
