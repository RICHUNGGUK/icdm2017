The interaction forces between the masses and the structure are used as excitation. Masses and damage extents are used as the optimization variables; compared to the approaches based on identification of the interaction forces, it allows ill-conditioning to be avoided and decreases the number of required sensors. The virtual distortion method is used; the damaged structure is modeled by the intact structure subjected to response-coupled virtual distortions and moving forces. These are related to the optimization variables via a linear system, which allows the optimization variables of both kinds to be treated in a unified way. A moving dynamic influence matrix is introduced to reduce the numerical costs. The adjoint variable method is used for fast sensitivity analysis. A numerical experiment of a three-span beam with 10% rms measurement error and three types of model errors is presented.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous identification of moving masses and structural damage", "paper_id": "WOS:000283362500008"}
