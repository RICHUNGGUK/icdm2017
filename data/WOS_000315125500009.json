We first show, at the theoretical level, that the convergence towards equilibrium heavily depends on the initial data and on the time evolution law of the vessel. Subsequently, we describe a numerical strategy to simulate the problem, based on a particle method implemented on general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPU). We observe that the parallelisation procedure on GPGPU allows for a marked improvement of the performances when compared with the standard approach on CPU. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
