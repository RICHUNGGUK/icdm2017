The successive transitions of FM-KT-PM phases are investigated along the Nishimori line. For the upper critical temperature, it is found that the transition temperature is almost the same as in the continuous case for all q values. The lower transition temperature is found to be proportional to 1/q(2). While the present model is not self-dual, we have a remarkable behavior with respect to the duality relation derived for the self-dual Villain-type model.", "paper_title": "NONEQUILIBRIUM RELAXATION STUDIES FOR FRUSTRATED SPIN SYSTEMS WITH KOSTERLITZ-THOULESS TRANSITIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000270691700007"}
