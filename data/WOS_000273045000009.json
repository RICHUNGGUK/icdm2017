It combines an intuitive free form deformation with a Loop subdivision algorithm. The main advantage of this method of deformation is that it uses only vertices of an object and satisfies the geometrical constraints provided by the user. It permits us to control the final shape of the deformed object, defining the range (i.e. the impact) of the deformation before applying it. The deformation takes into account the Loop properties to follow the subdivision scheme, allowing the user to fix some curvilinear constraints at the subdivision level he works on and to render the final object at the level he wants to. As the deformation uses an influence area defined by the user, we have implemented an adaptive object subdivision driven by the deformation influence. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
