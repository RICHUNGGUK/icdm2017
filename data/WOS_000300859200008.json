The antiphishing method described here collects webpages with either a direct or indirect association with a given suspicious webpage. This enables the discovery of a webpage's so-called \"parasitic\" community and then ultimately its phishing target - that is, the page with the strongest parasitic relationship to the suspicious webpage. Finding this target lets users determine whether the given webpage is a phishing page.", "paper_title": "Antiphishing through Phishing Target Discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000300859200008"}
