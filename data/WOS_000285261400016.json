On the basis of a one-dimensional model problem and the two versions of the generalized-alpha method developed for first- and second-order systems, it is shown that the overall problem is likely to be less stable and less accurate than the individual sub-problems unless special measures are taken. The benchmark problem of the oscillating flexible beam is used to demonstrate that these findings also apply to full computational fluid-structure interaction.
