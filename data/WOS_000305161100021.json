The proposed model can be used for a long term planning period (dynamic planning) in order to consider the timing concept. An interactive fuzzy satisfying method based on Chaotic Local Search and Modified Honey Bee Mating Optimization (CLS-MHBMO) is used to choose the final solution. The effectiveness of the proposed model and search method are assessed and demonstrated by various studies on an actual distribution network.", "paper_title": "AN INTERACTIVE FUZZY MULTI-OBJECTIVE APPROACH FOR SHORT TERM DG PLANNING", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161100021"}
