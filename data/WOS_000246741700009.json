While many algorithms for pattern discovery have been developed, relatively little work has been reported on mining dynamic databases, a major area of application in this field. In this paper, a new algorithm, namely the Efficient Dynamic Database Updating Algorithm (EDUA), is designed for mining dynamic databases. It works well when data deletion is carried out in any subset of a database that is partitioned according to the arrival time of the data. A pruning technique is proposed for improving the efficiency of the EDUA algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach and it is demonstrated that the EDUA is efficient. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
