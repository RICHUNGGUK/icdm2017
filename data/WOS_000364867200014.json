In this paper, we propose a novel filter, called multi-granularity locality-sensitive Bloom filter (MLBF), which can process AMQs with multiple distance granularities. Specifically, the MLBF is composed of two Bloom filters (BF), one is called basic multi-granularity locality-sensitive BF (BMLBF), and the other is called multi-granularity verification BF (MVBF). The BMLBF is used to store the data objects. It adopts an alignable locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) function family to support multiple granularities. The MVBF is used to reduce the false positive rate of the MLBF. The false negative rate of the MLBF is reduced by applying AND-constructions followed by an OR-construction. In addition, based on the MLBF structure, we suggest a more space-effective variant, called the MLBF*, to further reduce space cost. Theoretical analyses for estimating false positive/negative rates of the MLBF/MLBF* are given. Experiments using synthetic and real data show that the theoretical estimates are quite accurate, and the MLBF/MLBF* technique can handle AMQs with low false positive and negative rates for multiple distance granularities.", "paper_title": "Multi-Granularity Locality-Sensitive Bloom Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000364867200014"}
