Additionally, we propose a set of features extracted from file system specific BSM audit records, as well as an IDS that identifies attacks based on a decision engine that employs one-class classification using a moving window on incoming data. We have used two different machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and our evaluation is performed on real-world datasets collected from three web servers and a honeynet. Results are very promising, since FI2DS detection rates range between 91% and 95.9% with corresponding false positive rates ranging between 8.1 x 10(-2) % and 9.3 x 10(-4) %. Comparison of (FIDS)-D-2 to another state-of-the-art filesystem-based IDS, FWRAP, indicates higher effectiveness of the proposed IDS in all three datasets. Within the context of this paper FI2DS is evaluated for the web daemon user; nevertheless, it can be directly extended to model any daemon-user for both intrusion detection and postmortem analysis.
