Many NIR methods have been developed, but are especially difficult to evaluate since point-wise inter-image correspondence is usually unknown, i.e., there is no \"Cold Standard\" to evaluate performance. The Non-rigid Image Registration Evaluation Project (NIREP) has been started to develop, establish, maintain, and endorse a standardized set of relevant benchmarks and metrics for performance evaluation of nonrigid image registration algorithms. This paper describes the basic framework of the project.", "paper_title": "Introduction to the non-rigid image registration evaluation project (NIREP)", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485200016"}
