First, the classification and definition of four different categories of user groups are proposed, and the notion of group user experience is introduced. Second, we analyze the quantitative evaluation of group user experience for different types of user groups and establish an evaluation model for group user experience. Particularly, we employ two quantitative social metrics, user rating and user attention duration, as the main criteria for evaluating user experience. Other social factors, such as group interaction and the diversity of group members, are also taken into account to forma general quantitative evaluation model of group user experience for different user groups. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model with preliminary experiments in a smart museum.", "paper_title": "Quantitative Evaluation of Group User Experience in Smart Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000276688800003"}
