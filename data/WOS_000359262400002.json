Following the concepts of Atanassov's temporal intuitionistic fuzzy sets (ATIFSs), this paper proposes time-validating Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets (TvAIFSs) to make an earlier decision based on the desired information level. Several useful theorems that extend the concepts of ATIFSs are derived to supplement some definitions of TvAIFSs. Three measures are developed to improve decision making within a time horizon. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed theorems andmeasures of TvAIFSs in which the subjective and objective decision time-moments are determined based on a decision-maker's attitude and the optimal profit, respectively.", "paper_title": "Time-Validating-Based Atanassov's Intuitionistic Fuzzy Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000359262400002"}
