Spike timing-dependent plasticity is the latest development in refinements of Hebbian learning. We have applied additive and multiplicative STDP synaptic learning rules to a biologically inspired olfactory network. The olfactory system recognizes odorant patterns by synchronization of mitral cells. Synchronization enhances synaptic connections between mitral cells and cortical cells. Both STDP rules exhibit unimodal weight distributions which is biologically realistic. As a result, cortical cells respond with a wider range of variability and higher firing frequency. This property has potential for the improvement of artificial odor recognition through ongoing selection of mitral cells. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
