The goal is to optimise balanced data gathering, where the utility function is a weighted sum of the minimum and average amounts of data collected from each sensor node. We define a number of classes of simplified relay placement problems, including a planar problem with a simple cost model for radio communication. We prove that all of these problem classes are NP-hard, and that in some cases even finding approximate solutions is NP-hard.", "paper_title": "Computational complexity of relay placement in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235805500050"}
