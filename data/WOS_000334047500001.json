We define an enhanced covariance matrix using the covariances of the observed signal. We get a special inherent relation between the number of 2D harmonics in additive colored noise and the eigenvalues of the enhanced covariance matrix, which can be used to detect the number of 2D harmonics in additive colored noise by analyzing the eigenvalues of the enhanced covariance matrix. The proposed method has a super resolution and does not need to assume the color and distribution of the additive noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated by both the theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.
