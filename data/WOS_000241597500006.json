The formulation is based on an increasing process analysis of the monochromatic wave in free space. A numerical experiment scheme is designed to verify the accuracy of the proposed formulation. The results obtained from the proposed formulation are in a good agreement with those from the numerical experiments, and the proposed formulation is more accurate than those reported in the literature.
