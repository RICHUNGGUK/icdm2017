We present several steps to reduce the amount of computations which would be necessary otherwise, if even possible. The methods, in combination, allow to characterize all monotonic orthomodular lattice operations. Consequences for the (non-)existence of normal forms of expressions in orthomodular lattices are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
