Music genres are inherently ambiguous and, to make matters worse, assigned manually by a diverse user community. People tend to organize music based on similarity to other music and based on the music's emotional qualities. Taking this into account, we have designed a music player which derives a set of criteria from the actual music data and then provides a coherent visual metaphor for a similarity-based navigation of the music collection.", "paper_title": "AudioRadar: A metaphorical visualization for the navigation of large music collections", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566000008"}
