We aim at quantifying the uncertainty in the prediction arising from both the input data and the prediction model. A multilayer perceptron NN is trained to map interval-valued input data onto interval outputs, representing the prediction intervals (PIs) of the real target values. The NN training is performed by nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, so that the PIs are optimized both in terms of accuracy (coverage probability) and dimension (width). Demonstration of the proposed method is given in two case studies: 1) a synthetic case study, in which the data have been generated with a 5-min time frequency from an autoregressive moving average model with either Gaussian or Chi-squared innovation distribution and 2) a real case study, in which experimental data consist of wind speed measurements with a time step of 1 h. Comparisons are given with a crisp (single-valued) approach. The results show that the crisp approach is less reliable than the interval-valued input approach in terms of capturing the variability in input.", "paper_title": "An Interval-Valued Neural Network Approach for Uncertainty Quantification in Short-Term Wind Speed Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000363242800014"}
