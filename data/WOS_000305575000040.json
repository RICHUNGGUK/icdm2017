Concepts from mathematical programming used in the context of decoding include linear, integer, and nonlinear programming, network flows, notions of duality as well as matroid and polyhedral theory. This paper reviews and categorizes decoding methods based on mathematical programming approaches for binary linear codes over binary-input memoryless symmetric channels.", "paper_title": "Mathematical Programming Decoding of Binary Linear Codes: Theory and Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000305575000040"}
