The iterated Schonheim bound is the best known lower bound on the size of a covering code in G(q)(n, k). We prove that both bounds are asymptotically attained for fixed k and fixed radius, as n approaches infinity. Our methods rely on results from the theory of quasi-random hypergraphs which are proved using probabilistic techniques. We also determine the asymptotics of the size of the best Grassmannian codes and covering codes when n - k and the radius are fixed, as n approaches infinity.", "paper_title": "The Asymptotic Behavior of Grassmannian Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000308965600023"}
