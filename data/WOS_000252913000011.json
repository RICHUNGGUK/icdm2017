Such a system, however, produces characteristic trichromatic separation, or \"colour breakup\". Colour breakup is the perceived splitting of the white portions of an image into its red, green, and blue components when the image is projected with the colour sequential method and the viewer's eyes are moving rapidly. Viewing images containing colour breakup may cause visual fatigue and other symptoms of asthenopia. In this study, the authors examine the various subjective symptoms of asthenopia that can be caused by colour breakup. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
