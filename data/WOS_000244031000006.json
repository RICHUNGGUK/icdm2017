It enables rapid and efficient product development by composing an accurate and integrated computer model in manufacturing systems. The virtual manufacturing technology can be shared using a networked system. This approach can be called networked virtual manufacturing (net-VM). The distributed, collaborated, and interactive operations are its major features of the net-VM. This paper proposes a net-VM to share usage of the latest integrated design and manufacturing facilities for SMEs. The paper discusses the key technology of the system development. Some sub-systems developed are used to demonstrate the proposed system and methods.", "paper_title": "A networked virtual manufacturing system for SMEs", "paper_id": "WOS:000244031000006"}
