The paper is to apply such a theory in the RoboCup domain. First, the computational verbs for our small-size soccer robots are developed based on the theory. Then, the modelling and matching are investigated and analyzed to obtain verb similarity. The developed system reduces the computation cost by using row-wise and column-wise compositions of spatial verbs, and makes the vision system have high accuracy and high process speed.", "paper_title": "Applications of computational verbs to image processing of RoboCup small-size robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400059"}
