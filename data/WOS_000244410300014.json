Unlike traditional IP multicast, the non-leaf nodes in the tree are normal end hosts, which are potentially more susceptible to failures than routers and may leave the multicast group voluntarily. In these cases, all downstream nodes are affected. Thus, an important problem for making overlay multicast more dependable is how to recover from node departures in order to minimize the disruption of service to those affected nodes. In this paper, we propose a proactive tree recovery mechanism to make the overlay multicast resilient to these failures and unexpected events. Rather than letting downstream nodes try to find a new parent after a node departure, each non-leaf node precalculates a parent-to-be for each of its children. When this non-leaf node is gone, all its children can find their respective new parents immediately. The salient feature of the approach is that rescue plans for multiple non-leaf nodes can work together for their respective children when they fail or leave at the same time. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proactive approach can recover from node departures much faster than reactive methods, while the quality of trees restored and the cost of recovery are reasonable.", "paper_title": "A proactive tree recovery mechanism for resilient overlay multicast", "paper_id": "WOS:000244410300014"}
