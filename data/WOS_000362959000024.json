We express an access privilege in terms of an access right and a privilege level. The privilege level and a protection diagram associated with each given object determine whether a nominal access privilege for this object corresponds to an effective, possibly weaker access privilege, or is revoked. We associate a password system with each object; the password system takes the form of a hierarchical bidimensional one-way chain. A subject possesses a nominal access privilege for a given object if it holds a key that matches one of the passwords in the password system of this object; the protection diagram determines the extent of the corresponding effective access privilege. The resulting protection environment has several interesting properties. A key reduction mechanism allows a subject that holds a key for a given object to distribute keys for weaker access rights at lower privilege levels. A subject that owns a given object can review or revoke the passwords for this object by simply modifying the protection diagram. The memory requirements to represent a protection diagram are negligible; as far as password storage is concerned, space-time trade-offs are possible.", "paper_title": "Password Management: Distribution, Review and Revocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000362959000024"}
