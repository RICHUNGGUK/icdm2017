The method exploits fixed-point arithmetic to propose a modified multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm, allowing to better preserve the smartphone battery lifetime with respect to the conventional floating-point based formulation while maintaining comparable system accuracy levels. Experiments show comparative results between this approach and the traditional SVM in terms of recognition performance and battery consumption, highlighting the advantages of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficient Smartphone-Based Activity Recognition using Fixed-Point Arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000327373900007"}
