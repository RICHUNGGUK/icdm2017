(2012) [19]). Reaction automata are language acceptors with multiset rewriting mechanism whose basic frameworks are based on reaction systems introduced in Ehrenfeucht and Rozenberg (2007) [8]. In this paper we continue the investigation of reaction automata with a focus on the formal language theoretic properties of subclasses of reaction automata, called linear-bounded reaction automata (LRAs) and exponentially-bounded reaction automata (ERAs). Besides LRAs, we newly introduce an extended model (denoted by lambda-LRAs) by allowing lambda-moves in the accepting process of reaction, and investigate the closure properties of language classes accepted by both LRAs and lambda-LRAs. Further, we establish new relationships of language classes accepted by LRAs and by ERAs with the Chomsky hierarchy. The main results include the following: (i) the class of languages accepted by lambda-LRAs forms an AFL with additional closure properties, (ii) any recursively enumerable language can be expressed as a homomorphic image of a language accepted by an LRA, (iii) the class of languages accepted by ERAs coincides with the class of context-sensitive languages.
