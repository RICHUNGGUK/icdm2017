A characteristic of the data generated by a WSN is that the data distribution may alter over the lifetime of the network due to the changing nature of the phenomenon being observed. Anomaly detection techniques must be able to adapt to a non-stationary data distribution in order to perform optimally. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of approaches to anomaly detection in a WSN and their operation in a non-stationary environment.", "paper_title": "Anomaly Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks in a Non-Stationary Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000343072200012"}
