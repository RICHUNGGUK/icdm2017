This paper mainly deals with attribute reductions of an object-oriented concept lattice constructed on the basis of rough set. Attribute rank of object-oriented concept lattice is first defined, and relationships between attribute rank and object-oriented concepts are then discussed. Based on attribute rank, generating algorithm of object-oriented concepts is investigated. The object-oriented consistent set and object-oriented reduction of an object-oriented concept lattice are defined. Adjustment theorems of the object-oriented consistent set, and the necessary and sufficient conditions for a attribute subset to be an object-oriented consistent set of an object-oriented concept lattice are discussed. Then the object-oriented discernibility matrix of an object-oriented concept lattice is defined and its properties are also studied. Based on the object-oriented discernibility matrix, an approach to object-oriented reductions of an object-oriented concept lattice is proposed, and the attribute characteristics are also analyzed.", "paper_title": "Attribute reductions in object-oriented concept lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000348040800012"}
