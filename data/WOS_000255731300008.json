The network relies on an amplified ring feeder to properly interconnect several EPONs to a single optical line terminal. The network performance is evaluated using computer simulations at both physical and logical layers, taking into account the service and protection operational states. The study developed in the optical layer assesses the impact of several physical impairments in the upstream and downstream transmission, while the logical analysis evaluates the performance of different dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithms operating in the medium access control layer of the upstream channel. The results obtained prove the feasibility of the proposed network considering a ring extension of 100 km, supporting four EPONs of 32 optical network units each and operating at 10 Gbits/s.
