In this study, a combined approach with statistical and data mining techniques is utilized to address the nonignorable missing data issue in growth pattern recognition. First, a parallel mixture model is proposed to model the nonignorable missing information from a real-world patient-oriented study and concurrently to estimate the growth trajectories of participants. Then, based on individual growth parameter estimates and their auxiliary feature attributes, a fuzzy clustering method is incorporated to identify the growth patterns. This case study demonstrates that the combined multi-step approach can achieve both statistical generality and computational efficiency for growth pattern recognition in longitudinal studies with nonignorable missing data.", "paper_title": "PATTERN RECOGNITION OF LONGITUDINAL TRIAL DATA WITH NONIGNORABLE MISSINGNESS: AN EMPIRICAL CASE STUDY", "paper_id": "WOS:000270953100006"}
