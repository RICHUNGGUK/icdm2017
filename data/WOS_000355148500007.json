A given CAMD problem, based on target properties, is formulated as a mixed integer linear/non-linear program (MILP/MINLP). The mathematical programming model presented here, which is formulated as an MILP/MINLP problem, considers first-order and second-order molecular groups for molecular structure representation and property estimation. It is shown that various CAMD problems can be formulated and solved through this model.(C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
