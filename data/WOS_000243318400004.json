These contributions continue today and promise to further advance the state of the art both in terms of modeling innovations and new solution methodologies. In this paper, we present a new modeling and solution methodology for unsupervised clustering. Preliminary computational experience is given to illustrate the approach. This methodology is part of our current research and offers considerable opportunity for additional investigation to be conducted by other researchers.", "paper_title": "New optimization models for data mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000243318400004"}
