Some scholars suggest that restricted damped trend models yield excellent prediction results by automatically revising unforeseen structural break factors in the prediction process. Restricted damped trend models add a smoothed error statistic to a local-level model and use the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) method to make corrections. This paper applies the generally weighted moving average (GWMA) concept and method to a restricted damped trend model that changes the smoothed error statistic from the EWMA form to the GWMA form and adds the correction parameter , which distinguishes three situations <1, =1, and >1. The original restricted damped trend model applies only to =1, enabling the model to capture situations in which <1 and >1 increases its generality. This paper also compares the effect of various parameter values on the predictive model and finds the range of parameter settings that optimize the model.", "paper_title": "Application of generally weighted moving average method to tracking signal state space model", "paper_id": "WOS:000327024600006"}
