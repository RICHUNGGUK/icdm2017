The registration model minimizes a hybrid metric that is a combination of the tangent distance error and the sliding penalty. As a result, the proposed method is capable of reducing the sliding error in registration, especially for an object containing flat features. We used kinematical geometry to linearize rigid-body motions and approximate the registration model with a quadratic objective function, which leads to solving linear equations at each iteration. We also describe experiments indicating that our registration algorithm is insensitive to the initial alignment and maintains global stability. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
