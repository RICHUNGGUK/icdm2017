In this paper, we study the problem of skeleton extraction and conduct the first work on quantitative evaluation of skeleton in sensor networks. Different from traditional schemes which assume complete or incomplete boundaries, the proposed skeleton extraction algorithm is based on mere connectivity information, without reliance on any boundary information. More specifically, for each node we compute its variability factor based on the neighborhood sizes of the node and its neighbors, which can reflect how central a sensor node is to the network, and a sensor node identifies itself as a skeleton node if its variability factor is locally maximal. Next, we present a light-weight scheme to connect these skeleton nodes. Finally, we proposed a metric, named visibility coefficient, to quantitatively evaluate the derived skeleton.", "paper_title": "Boundary-free skeleton extraction and its evaluation in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000347777300019"}
