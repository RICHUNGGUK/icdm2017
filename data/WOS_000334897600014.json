The proposed t-chart has double control limits that use repetitive sampling and determine its control constants. The in-control and the out-of-control average run lengths are derived and tabulated according to various process shifts. The proposed control chart indicates the out-of-control process more quickly than the existing control chart for small shifts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
