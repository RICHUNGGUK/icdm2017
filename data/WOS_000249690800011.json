We also answer a question of Frank by showing that it is NP- complete to decide whether the vertex set of a given tournament can be partitioned into two feedback vertex sets. In addition, we give exact and approximation algorithms for the feedback vertex set packing problem on tournaments.", "paper_title": "A min-max theorem on tournaments", "paper_id": "WOS:000249690800011"}
