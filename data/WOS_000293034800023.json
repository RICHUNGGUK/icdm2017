The new HR utilizes a set of point values when evaluating polynomials and remainders on neighboring cells, extending the technique introduced in Hu, Li and Tang [9]. The point-wise HR simplifies the implementation of the previous HR method which requires integration over neighboring cells and makes HR easier to extend to arbitrary meshes. We prove that the new point-wise HR method keeps the order of accuracy of the approximation polynomials. Numerical computations for scalar and system of nonlinear hyperbolic equations are performed on two-dimensional triangular meshes. We demonstrate that the new hierarchical reconstruction generates essentially non-oscillatory solutions for schemes up to fourth order on triangular meshes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
