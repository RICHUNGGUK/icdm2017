Unbounded model checking is a SAT-based verification method and has attracted recent attention as a powerful approach. The interpolation-based approach is one of the most promising unbounded model checking methods and has been proven to be effective for hardware verification. However, the application of unbounded model checking to asynchronous systems, such as telecommunication systems, has rarely been practiced. This is because, with the conventional encoding, the behavior of an asynchronous system can only be represented as a large propositional formula, thus resulting in large computational cost. To overcome this problem we propose to use a new scheme for encoding the behavior of the system and adapt the unbounded model checking algorithm to this encoding. By exploiting the concurrency of an asynchronous system, this encoding scheme allows a very concise formula to represent system's behavior. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments where 21 pairs of telecommunication services are verified using several methods including ours. The results show that our approach exhibits significant speed-up over unbounded model checking using the traditional encoding.", "paper_title": "Feature Interaction Verification Using Unbounded Model Checking with Interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000267639600004"}
