Since protein structure databases are rapidly growing in size, the development of a fast search method to find similar protein substructures by comparison of protein 3D structures is essential. In this article, we present a novel protein 3D structure search method to find all substructures with root mean square deviations (RMSDs) to the query structure that are lower than a given threshold value. Our new algorithm runs in O(m + N/m(0.5)) time, after O(N log N) preprocessing, where N is the database size and m is the query length. The new method is 1.8-41.6 times faster than the practically best known O(N) algorithm, according to computational experiments using a huge database (i.e., > 20,000,000 C-alpha coordinates).", "paper_title": "LB3D: A Protein Three-Dimensional Substructure Search Program Based on the Lower Bound of a Root Mean Square Deviation Value", "paper_id": "WOS:000303811800003"}
