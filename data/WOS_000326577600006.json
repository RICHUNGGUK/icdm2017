The prohibitive sizes of the mutational and conformational landscapes, combined with the volume of data to process, require efficient algorithms to compute sequence-structure properties. In this article, we address the correction of NGS errors by calculating which mutations most increase the likelihood of a sequence to a given structure and RNA family. We introduce RNApyro, an efficient, linear time and space inside-outside algorithm that computes exact mutational probabilities under secondary structure and evolutionary constraints given as a multiple sequence alignment with a consensus structure. We develop a scoring scheme combining classical stacking base-pair energies to novel isostericity scores and apply our techniques to correct pointwise errors in 5s and 16s rRNA sequences. Our results suggest that RNApyro is a promising algorithm to complement existing tools in the NGS error-correction pipeline.", "paper_title": "Using Structural and Evolutionary Information to Detect and Correct Pyrosequencing Errors in Noncoding RNAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000326577600006"}
