As samples are assigned to clusters, users need to manually give descriptions for all clusters. In this paper, a rapid fuzzy rule clustering method based on granular computing is proposed to give descriptions for all clusters. A new and simple unsupervised feature selection method is employed to endow every sample with a suitable description. Exemplar descriptions are selected from sample's descriptions by relative frequency, and data granulation is guided by the selected exemplar fuzzy descriptions. Every cluster is depicted by a single fuzzy rule, which make the clusters understandable for humans. The experimental results show that our proposed model is able to discover fuzzy IF-THEN rules to obtain the potential clusters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
