In the first step, rHVDM uses a small number of known targets to derive the activity pro. le of a given transcription factor. Then, in a subsequent step, this activity pro. le is used to predict other putative targets of that transcription factor. A dynamic and mechanistic model of gene expression is at the heart of the technique. Measurement error is taken into account during the process, which allows an objective assessment of the robustness of fit and, therefore, the quality of the predictions. The package relies on efficient algorithms and vectorization to accomplish potentially time consuming tasks including optimization and differential equation integration. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of rHVDM by examining the activity of the tumour-suppressing transcription factor, p53.", "paper_title": "rHVDM: an R package to predict the activity and targets of a transcription factor", "paper_id": "WOS:000262959500021"}
