Design/methodology/approach - The inner loop calculates the two-axis stator reference voltages through a feedback linearization method. The outer loop employs an RST control structure to compute the q-axis stator reference current. To increase the robustness of the proposed method, the RST controller parameters are adapted through a fractional order model reference adaptive system (FO-MRAS). The fractional order gradient and Lyapunov methods are utilized as adaptation mechanisms. Findings - The effect of the fractional order derivative in the load disturbance rejection, transient response speed and the robustness is verified through computer simulations. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method against the external torque and mechanical parameters uncertainties. Originality/value - The proposed FO-MRAS based on Lyapunov adaptation mechanism is proposed for the first time. Moreover, application of the FO-MRAS for velocity control of PMSM is presented for the first time.", "paper_title": "Design of a fractional order adaptive controller for velocity control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000359046300016"}
