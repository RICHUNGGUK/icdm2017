This study evaluated the variables influencing the use of a telecare service program by the elderly. A questionnaire survey was used to explore the relationship between quality of life and technology acceptance of a telecare program in Taiwan. In addition, open-ended questions were used to elicit qualitative information regarding the experience of technology use. The results revealed that elderly persons with better social welfare status and health condition, who used the device frequently, had higher quality of life and accepted technology use. The correlation results also indicated that elderly persons who perceived telecare as useful in solving health problems, had the intention to use the program, and were willing to continue use, also had a better perception toward quality of life regarding their interpersonal relationships and living environment. Nonetheless, cost may be an issue that will impede their willingness to use the technology in care service.", "paper_title": "Technology Acceptance and Quality of Life of the Elderly in a Telecare Program", "paper_id": "WOS:000324622200006"}
