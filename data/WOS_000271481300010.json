Since the sensors collect personal medical data, security and privacy are important components in a BSN. In this paper, we developed IBE-Lite, a lightweight identity-based encryption suitable for sensors in a BSN. We present protocols based on IBE-Lite that balance security and privacy with accessibility and perform evaluation using experiments conducted on commercially available sensors.", "paper_title": "IBE-Lite: A Lightweight Identity-Based Cryptography for Body Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000271481300010"}
