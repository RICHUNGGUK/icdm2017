Given an ad hoc scoring function that assigns a score to a multidimensional instance, we want to rank a set of multivalued objects. Different from the existing models of ranking uncertain and probabilistic data, which model an object as a random variable and the instances of an object are assumed exclusive, we have to capture the coexistence of instances here. To tackle the problem, we advocate the semantics of favoring widely preferred objects instead of majority votes, which is widely used in many elections and competitions. Technically, we borrow the idea from Borda Count (BC), a well-recognized method in consensus-based voting systems. However, Borda Count cannot handle multivalued objects of inconsistent cardinality, and is costly to evaluate top k queries on large multidimensional data sets. To address the challenges, we extend and generalize Borda Count to quantile-based Borda Count, and develop efficient computational methods with comprehensive cost analysis. We present case studies on real data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the generalized Borda Count ranking, and use synthetic and real data sets to verify the efficiency of our computational method.", "paper_title": "Consensus-Based Ranking of Multivalued Objects: A Generalized Borda Count Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000327656800008"}
