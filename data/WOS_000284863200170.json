These two approaches were applied to a data set of 16 projects by using 17 parameters available at the early design phase. The regression analysis estimated the cost of testing samples with an error of 2.32%. On the other hand, artificial neural network estimated the cost with 5.76% error, which was slightly higher than the regression error. As a result, two successful cost estimation models have been developed depending on the findings of this paper. These models can effectively be utilized in the tender decision-making phase of projects with trackworks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
