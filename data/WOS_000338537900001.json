In order to guarantee the vehicle user satisfaction of multimedia service, with the proliferation of the distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) cooperative transmission technologies, P2P-based VANET has recently received a substantial amount of interest. Using the P2P services thought and at the same time, a set of methods should be designed to avoid the disadvantage of P2P system appearing in VANET. Under such a presupposition, in this paper, we study the media provisions in P2P-based VANET and present a repeated game \"More Pay for More Work (RGMPMW)\" incentive mechanism based on service evaluation information. We also propose evolutionary game-based veracity (EGV) gamemodel which exploits evolutionary game to guarantee the multimedia service share veracity of all vehicles in VANET. In addition, we provide extensive simulation results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary Game Theoretic Modeling and Repetition of Media Distributed Shared in P2P-Based VANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000338537900001"}
