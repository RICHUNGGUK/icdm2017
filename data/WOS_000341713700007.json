Design/methodology/approach - A typical rare earth interior permanent magnet (IPM) machine is used as the benchmark to conduct the optimal design study. Based on the flux distribution, major changes are made to the rotor lamination design. Enhanced torque production and lower torque ripple are specifically targeted as the two main objectives of the proposed design approach. Findings - As a result, the optimally designed SynRM can achieve performance very close to that of the benchmark PM machine with a potential for further improvement. Originality/value - Discussions of IPM replacement by optimally designed SynRM in electrical and hybrid electrical vehicles are given in terms of performance and cost.", "paper_title": "Optimal design of synchronous reluctance machine A feasible solution to eliminating rare earth permanent magnets for vehicle traction applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000341713700007"}
