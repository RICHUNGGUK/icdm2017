Since its original design, our system has been extended in various ways, and has become very popular in the research community due to its features and to the ability to emulate even moderately complex network setups on unmodified operating systems. We have recently made a number of extensions to the emulator, including loadable packet schedulers, support for better MAC layer modeling, the inclusion in PlanetLab, and development of Linux and Windows versions in addition to the native FreeBSD and Mac OS X ones. The goal of this paper is to present in detail the current features of Dummynet, compare it with other emulation solutions, and discuss what operating conditions should be considered and what kind of accuracy to expect when using an emulation system.", "paper_title": "Dummynet Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000277061000002"}
