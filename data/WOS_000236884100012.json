At the same time, many of these processes have been explicitly modeled. For example, SAP R/3 logs events in transaction logs and there are EPCs (Event-driven Process Chains) describing the so-called reference models. These reference models describe how the system should be used. The coexistence of event logs and process models raises an interesting question: \"Does the event log conform to the process model and vice versa?\". This paper demonstrates that there is not a simple answer to this question. To tackle the problem, we distinguish two dimensions of conformance: fitness (the event log may be the result of the process modeled) and appropriateness (the model is a likely candidate from a structural and behavioral point of view). Different metrics have been defined and a Conformance Checker has been implemented within the ProM Framework.", "paper_title": "Conformance testing: Measuring the fit and appropriateness of event logs and process models", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100012"}
