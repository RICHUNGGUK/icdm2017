The need for simulation tools, able to steer and support the early design choices, pushes researchers to develop concept modeling techniques. In this paper, an innovative procedure, based on the wave-based substructuring (WBS) technology, is proposed to achieve a database framework for joint concepts, so that joint alternatives can be easily exchanged in concept modification and optimization studies. An industrial case study is analysed, where the proposed methodology is validated through static and dynamic FE analyses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
