Then, a physical aspect model is introduced to analyze the worst case crosstalk noise effect on the delay and rise time of the driver. It is observed that the inductive coupling effect can have a great effect on the timing characteristic of the interconnect line. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper differs from the HSPICE simulation with an average error less than 2.5% for both the 50% delay and the rise time.", "paper_title": "Worst case crosstalk noise effect analysis in DSM circuits by ABCD modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000241464600049"}
