The focus of research in this paper is the segmentation of handwritten text and machine printed text from annotated documents sometimes referred to as the task of \"ink separation\" to advance the state-of-art in realizing search of hand-annotated documents. We propose a method which contains two main steps-patch level separation and pixel level separation. In the patch level separation step, the entire document is modeled as a Markov Random Field (MRF). Three different classes (machine printed text, handwritten text and overlapped text) are initially identified using G-means based classification followed by a MRF based relabeling procedure. A MRF based classification approach is then used to separate overlapped text into machine printed text and handwritten text using pixel level features forming the second step of the method. Experimental results on a set of machine-printed documents which have been annotated by multiple writers in an office/collaborative environment show that our method is robust and provides good text separation performance.", "paper_title": "Handwritten text separation from annotated machine printed documents using Markov Random Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000315038600001"}
