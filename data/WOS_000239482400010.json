With the advancement in wireless technology, mobile communication has become a salient interaction media between people. Particularly, with the ad-hoc mobile networks, each peer is able to attain information and services (from the other peers) of value to the peer anywhere, any time and using a variety of different kinds of devices. However, how to empower peers to share and acquire information/services through an automated negotiation mechanism, to take into account the attributes of the context (physical and non-physical) and then to achieve social welfare is one of the ideals in exploiting a wireless Peer-to-Peer network environment in the era of enterprise computing. Accordingly, this paper presents Contextualized Integrative Negotiation Strategies (CINS) for content sharing in wireless Peer-to-Peer environments. CINS enables peers to engage proper interactions within the environment in time, to understand the needs of the other peers and to employ practices of cooperation negotiation (instead of competition ones). In CINS, peer re-learning negotiation strategies consider content-sharing ontologies employed and the reward attained from the environment for the purpose of useful sharing experience. This not only helps peers embrace a common consensus of collective benefits in content sharing but also guarantees that the negotiation results achieve win-win decisions of allocations.", "paper_title": "Mobile P2P automatic content sharing by ontology-based and contextualized integrative negotiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239482400010"}
