The aim of this paper is to investigate how such notion influences the relationship between the base and the cardinality of the alphabet allowing block parallel addition. In this paper, we mainly focus on a certain class of real bases the so-called Parry numbers. We give lower bounds on the cardinality of alphabets of non-negative integer digits allowing block parallel addition. By considering quadratic Pisot bases, we are able to show that these bounds cannot be improved in general and we give explicit parallel algorithms for addition in these cases. We also consider the d-bonacci base, which satisfies the equation X-d = Xd-1 + Xd-2 + ... + X + 1. If in a base being a d-bonacci number I-block parallel addition is possible on an alphabet A, then #A >= d + 1; on the other hand, there exists a k is an element of N such that k-block parallel addition in this base is possible on the alphabet {0, 1, 2}, which cannot be reduced. In particular, addition in the Tribonacci base is 14-block parallel on alphabet {0, 1, 2}. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
