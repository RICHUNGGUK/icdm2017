Differing from the usual Bayesian prediction, we do not specify the prior distribution of the parameter, and only some moment conditions are assumed. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the prediction results.", "paper_title": "Life prediction under random censorship", "paper_id": "WOS:000260324900006"}
