Based on a class of nonlinear algebraic equations with n variables and some computational techniques in M-matrix, some sufficient conditions for global attractivity of the equilibrium of the n-dimensional neutral Hopfield-type neural networks are established. Numerical simulations are given to summarize the applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
