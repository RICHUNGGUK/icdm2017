The CrossBroker job manager provides services as part of the CrossGrid middleware and allows execution of parallel MPI applications on Grid resources in a transparent and automatic way. This document describes the design and implementation of the key components responsible for an efficient and reliable execution of MPI jobs splitted over multiple Grid sites, executed either in an on-line or batch manner. We also provide details on the overheads introduced by our system, as well as an experimental study showing that our system is well-suited for embarrassingly parallel applications.", "paper_title": "Supporting efficient execution of MPI applications across multiple sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500034"}
