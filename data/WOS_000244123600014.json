This paper studies covering-based rough sets from the topological view. We explore the topological properties of this type of rough sets, study the interdependency between the lower and the upper approximation operations, and establish the conditions under which two coverings generate the same lower approximation operation and the same upper approximation operation. Lastly, axiomatic systems for the lower approximation operation and the upper approximation operation are constructed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
