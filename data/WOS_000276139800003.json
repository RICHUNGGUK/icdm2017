Then for each fuzzy quasi-pseudo-metric on a set X we construct a fuzzy quasi-pseudo-metric on the collection of all nonempty subsets of X. called the Hausdorff fuzzy quasi-pseudo-metric. We investigate several properties of this structure and present several illustrative examples as well as an application to the domain of words. The notion of Hausdorff fuzzy quasi-pseudo-metric when quasi-pseudo-metric fuzziness is considered in the sense of George and Veeramani is also discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
