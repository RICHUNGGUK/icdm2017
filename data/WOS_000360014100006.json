This paper employs agility lens (Overby et al. 2006; Roberts and Grover 2012) to understand how such firms could address the issue of black market threats with the help of network structure. Through a case study of a global asset pooling and leasing company, we reveal the criticality of network structures, the difficulties, inadequacies and impracticalities of current tracking technologies that challenge firms in minimizing such threats.", "paper_title": "Unveiling the Black Markets of Pooled Assets", "paper_id": "WOS:000360014100006"}
