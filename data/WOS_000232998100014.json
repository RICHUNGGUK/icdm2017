In other words, given a set S of points in the plane and a positive value l(0), we want to compute an anchored 1-corner polygonal chain having length at most l(0) such that the minimum distance to the points in S is maximized. We present non-trivial algorithms based on geometric properties of each possible configuration providing a solution. More specifically, we give an O(n log n)-time algorithm for finding a 1-corner obnoxious polygonal chain whose length is exactly l(0), and an O(n 2) -time algorithm when the length of the optimal chain is at most the given bound l(0).
