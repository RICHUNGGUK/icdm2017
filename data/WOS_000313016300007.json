Then we further apply the proposed new model to the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology (N&N) for the purpose of analyzing the reciprocal dependence between S&T. The empirical results provide an understanding of the relationship between S&T and their dynamic potential of interdependence in the selected 20 leading universities in the field of N&N. We find that at present nanotechnology depends mainly on the scientific-push rather than the technology-pull and nanotechnology is science-based field. In contrast, a parallel development of the technology is not visible. Policy implications are at last put forward based on the several interesting findings for the interaction mechanisms between S&T in the field.", "paper_title": "Love dynamics between science and technology: some evidences in nanoscience and nanotechnology", "paper_id": "WOS:000313016300007"}
