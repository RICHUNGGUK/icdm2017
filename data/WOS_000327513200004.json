These models can thus help improve the process of developing in-vehicle devices by reducing or eliminating the need for conducting driver experiments in the early stage of the development. Further, these models can help improve traffic flow simulation. This article develops a dual-task model of driving with a visual distraction task using the Queuing Network model of driver lateral control and a logistic regression model. The comparison between the model simulation data and the human data from drivers in a driving simulator shows that this computational model can perform driving with a secondary visual task well and its performance is consistent with the driver data.", "paper_title": "Using Queuing Network and Logistic Regression to Model Driving with a Visual Distraction Task", "paper_id": "WOS:000327513200004"}
