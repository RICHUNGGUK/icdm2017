Since the clock signal is delivered to clock sinks (e.g., latches, flip-flops) through TSVs, any fault on a TSV in the clock tree may cause a chip failure. Therefore, ensuring the reliability of clock TSVs in 3-D ICs is highly important. To cope with clock TSV reliability problem effectively, we propose a new circuit cell called slew-controlled TSV fault-tolerant unit (SC-TFU) which overcomes the limited capability of the conventional TFUs and propose a full solution to the problem of designing and synthesizing 3-D TSV fault-tolerant clock tree based on SC-TFUs. Precisely, for a presynthesized 3-D clock tree, we solve the problem in three steps: 1) performing a comprehensive TSV pairing algorithm to maximally allocate SC-TFUs; 2) replacing TSV pairs obtained in step 1 with SC-TFUs followed by TSV tripling to maximize TSV fault-tolerance under wire and time constraints; and 3) performing a global clock skew tuning process on the SC-TFU embedded 3-D clock tree produced in step 2. Through out experiments, two outstanding benefits are confirmed: 1) our synthesis using SC-TFUs enables a large number of clock TSVs to be paired or tripled to ensure a very high degree of TSV fault-tolerance and 2) our synthesis flow effectively performs tuning of global clock skew whose variation is caused by the inclusion of TSV fault-tolerant cells into 3-D clock trees.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of TSV Fault-Tolerant 3-D Clock Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000348229600009"}
