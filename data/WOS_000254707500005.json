The fairly recent development of efficient algorithms for list decoding of Reed-Solomon codes spur new fuel to the study of this decoding strategy. In this paper we give a weight-based characterization of the set of correctable error patterns under list-of-2 decoding of (tau, 2)-list-decodable linear codes with known weight distribution. We apply our characterization of the set of correctable error patterns to a few codes in a family of low-rate list-of-2 decodable Reed-Solomon codes. We study the increase in error-correction performance obtained in a symmetric AWGN channel by using list-of-2 decoding instead of traditional decoding for these codes. Some simulation results for list-of-2 decoding on QAM channels using the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm for decoding of Reed-Solomon codes are also presented.", "paper_title": "A weight-based characterization of the set of correctable error patterns under list-of-2 decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000254707500005"}
