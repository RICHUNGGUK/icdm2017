With this technique, electric field lines are geometrically approximated to separately model the different capacitive components. These components are finally combined to obtain the equivalent fringe capacitance. Using the aforementioned technique, a model was developed to compute the capacitances of typical interconnect geometries using technology-dependent parameters. The proposed model closely matches with FASTCAP results and significantly reduces the computational complexity and time in calculating the interconnect capacitances.", "paper_title": "An analytical fringe capacitance model for interconnects using conformal mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000242604800014"}
