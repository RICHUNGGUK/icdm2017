In each time step, an arbitrary number of packets arrive, and only one packet can be sent. The buffer can store a limited number of packets, and; due to the FIFO property, the sequence of sent packets has to be a subsequence of the arriving packets. The differentiated service model is abstracted by attributing each packet with a value according to its service level. A buffer management strategy can drop packets. The goal is to maximize the sum of values of sent packets. For only two different packet values, we introduce the account strategy and prove that this strategy achieves an optimal competitive ratio of approximate to 1.282, if the buffer size tends to infinity, and an optimal competitive ratio of (root 13 - 1)/2 approximate to 1.303, for arbitrary buffer sizes. For general packet values, the simple preemptive greedy strategy (PG) is studied. We show that PG achieves a competitive ratio of root 3 approximate to 1.732 which is the best known upper bound on the competitive ratio of this problem. In addition, we give a lower bound of 1 + 1/root 2 approximate to 1.707 on the competitive ratio of PC which improves the previously known lower bound. As a consequence, the competitive ratio of PC cannot be further improved significantly.", "paper_title": "Lower and upper bounds on FIFO buffer management in QoS switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200031"}
