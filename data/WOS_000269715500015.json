The method combines the vector-valued Allen-Cahn phase field equation with initial data fitting terms with prescribed interface width and fidelity constants. Efficient numerical solution is achieved using a multigrid splitting of a finite element space, thereby producing an efficient and robust method for the segmentation of large images. We also present the use of adaptive mesh refinement to further speed up the segmentation process.", "paper_title": "Color Image Segmentation by the Vector-Valued Allen-Cahn Phase-Field Model: A Multigrid Solution", "paper_id": "WOS:000269715500015"}
