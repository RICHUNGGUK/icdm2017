Besides the standard inversion method, however, several other discrete inversion algorithms exist that can perform the same transformation in O(1) time per point. In this paper, we examine the performance of three of these alternate methods, two of which are new.", "paper_title": "A Comparison of Tabular PDF Inversion Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000263678700013"}
