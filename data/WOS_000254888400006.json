It directly evaluates fictional values in 'ghost' cells adjacent to boundary cells and requires no interpolation or generation of cut cells. The boundary treatment is implemented in a dynamically adaptive quadtree grid-based solver of the hyperbolic shallow water equations and validated against several test cases with analytical or alternative numerical solutions. The method is easy to code, accurate, and demonstrably effective in dealing with irregular computational domains in shallow flow simulations. Results are presented for still water in a basin of complicated geometry, steady hydraulic jump in an open channel with a converging sidewall, wind-induced circulation in a circular shallow lake, and shock wave diffraction in a channel containing a contraction and expansion.
