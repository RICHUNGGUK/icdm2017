Compared with the traditional eight-phase oscillator, this capacitive coupling structure can decrease the number of inductors to half and only of four inductors. The VCO is designed and taped out in TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology. Measurement results show the phase noise is 105.95 dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset from a carrier frequency of 10 GHz. The chip area of VCO is 480 mu mx700 mu m and the VCO core power dissipation is 4.8 mW with the 1.0 V supply voltage.", "paper_title": "A 10 GHz multiphase LC VCO with a ring capacitive coupling structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000310226800022"}
