Rather than the request/reply model, these centers use an event-based communication model. Traditionally, the event-based middleware and the Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine are viewed as two distinct components within a distributed system's architecture. This division adds additional system complexity and reduces the ability for consuming applications to fully utilize the CEP toolset. This article will address these issues by proposing a novel event-based middleware solution. We introduce Complex Event Routing Infrastructure (CERI), a single event-based infrastructure that serves as an event bus and provides first class integration of CEP. An unstructured peer-to-peer network is exploited to allow for efficient event transmission. To reduce network flooding, superpeers and overlay network partitioning are introduced. Additionally, CERI provides each client node the capability of local complex query evaluation. As a result, applications can offload internal logic to the query evaluation engine in an efficient manner. Finally, as more client nodes and event types are added to the system, the CERI can scale up. Because of these favorable scaling properties. CERI serves as a foundational step in bringing event-based middleware and CEP closer together into a single unified infrastructure component. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
