The machines have identical capacity of size and processing velocity. The jobs are processed in batches given that the total size of jobs in a batch cannot exceed the machine capacity. Once a batch starts processing, no interruption is allowed until all the jobs are completed. First we present a mixed integer programming model of the problem. We show the computational complexity of the problem and optimality properties. Then we propose a novel ant colony optimization method where the Metropolis Criterion is used to select the paths of ants to overcome the immature convergence. Finally, we generate different scales of instances to test the performance. The computational results show the effectiveness of the algorithm, especially for large-scale instances.
