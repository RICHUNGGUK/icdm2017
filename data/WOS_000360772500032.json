The purpose of this paper is to model effectively to solve remanufacturing scheduling problem. The problem is modeled as flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FISP) and is divided into two stages: scheduling and re-scheduling when new job arrives. The uncertainty in timing of returns in remanufacturing is modeled as new job inserting constraint in FJSP. A two-stage artificial bee colony (TABC) algorithm is proposed for scheduling and re-scheduling with new job(s) inserting. The objective is to minimize makespan (maximum complete time). A new rule is proposed to initialize bee colony population. An ensemble local search is proposed to improve algorithm performance. Three re-scheduling strategies are proposed and compared. Extensive computational experiments are carried out using fifteen well-known benchmark instances with eight instances from remanufacturing. Forscheduling performance, TABC is compared to five existing algorithms. For re-scheduling performance, TABC is compared to six simple heuristics and proposed hybrid heuristics. The results and comparisons show that TABC is effective in both scheduling stage and rescheduling stage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
