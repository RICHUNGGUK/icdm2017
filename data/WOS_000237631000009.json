The existing mechanisms based on per-packet performance guarantees used mainly for voice and streaming media do not suffice for the elastic nature of non-real- time traffic. For a non-real- time user data services, the key performance measure of interest is the total download time. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduling framework for wireless content service. Specifically, we present a two-layer scheduling architecture that combines content-aware scheduling with opportunistic scheduling. In terms of content-awareness, the proposed scheduling policy provides guarantees on the download time of content. In the second stage, the instantaneous channel conditions of different users are exploited in an opportunistic manner so as to maximize the throughput of the system. We define service differentiation in two modes - differential and guaranteed - and provide polynomial time algorithms for both that manipulate the stretch ratio but within allowable limits. Extensive simulations are conducted that verify the efficiency of the proposed schemes and provide insights into the behavior of the scheduling algorithms for non-real- time data.", "paper_title": "Non-real-time content scheduling algorithms for wireless data networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237631000009"}
