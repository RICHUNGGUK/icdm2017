The concept of an irreducible-at-infinity generalized state space realization of a polynomial matrix is defined and the mechanism of the \"cancellations\" of \"decoupling zeros at infinity\" is closely examined. The difference between the concepts of irreducibility and minimality of generalized state space realizations of polynomial (transfer function) matrices is pointed out and the associated concepts of dynamic and non-dynamic variables appearing in generalized state space realizations are also examined.", "paper_title": "ON THE REALIZATION THEORY OF POLYNOMIAL MATRICES AND THE ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURE OF PURE GENERALIZED STATE SPACE SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000265706000007"}
