The proposed method is based on the zero phase (ZP) signal defined as the IDFT of the spectral amplitude. When the target noise can be modeled as the sum of the impact part and the damped oscillation part, the proposed method can reduce them individually. First, the proposed method estimates the damped oscillation spectra and subtracts them from the observed spectra. Then, the impact part is reduced by replacing several samples of the ZP observed signal. Simulation results show that the proposed method improved 10 dB of SNR of real impact noise.", "paper_title": "A Zero Phase Noise Reduction Method with Damped Oscillation Estimator", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784000003"}
