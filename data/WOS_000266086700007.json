The neural model used in simulations was developed to allow for an analytic solution to a neuron fire time. while maintaining a non-instant post-synaptic potential rise time. The synaptic weights and delays were tuned using an evolution strategy. Simulation experiments demonstrate that within about seven thousand generations the. biped is able to acquire a dynamic walk which allows it to walk upright for several metres.", "paper_title": "SIMULATED 3D BIPED WALKING WITH AN EVOLUTION-STRATEGY TUNED SPIKING NEURAL NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000266086700007"}
