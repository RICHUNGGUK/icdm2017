The global positioning system (GPS) is the most popular positioning technique widely used in vehicular communication systems. However, GPS cannot work effectively in many situations, for example, in a tunnel or under a bridge. For accurate positioning in such situations, it is desirable to have more reliable positioning techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel method for node positioning in vehicular communication systems. Unlike existing positioning methods that employ a roadside node as an observation station, the proposed positioning method allows a vehicular node to play the role of an observation station, and estimates the vehicular node's absolute coordinates based on the measurement of the Doppler frequency shift, the velocity of the vehicular node, and the known absolute coordinates of roadside nodes. To improve positioning accuracy, it introduces extended Kalman filtering (EKF) to mitigate the effects of channel noise and multipath interference. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed positioning method can significantly improve the positioning accuracy compared with differential GPS and reduce the positioning delay.
