Design/methodology/approach - The goal of this paper is to show the efficiency of the software component approach for the implementation of optimisation frameworks for engineering systems in general, and electromagnetic systems in particular. Findings - This paper highlights the component standard, a generator based on analytical expressions of the system, and an optimization service. References and examples show application in the area of electromagnetic components and systems. Practical implications - This paper presents CADES, a framework dedicated to system design, based on optimization needs. The framework is defined with a standard implementing the software component paradigm and a pattern to use it. Indeed, this pattern details how to create and use a component (the model of the device to design). Originality/value - This paper shows how the new emerging paradigm of software components can be used for building new generations of optimisation environment allowing capitalisation and reuse by combination of software components containing models and optimisation algorithms.", "paper_title": "An optimizer using the software component paradigm for the optimization of engineering systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000246638700015"}
