However, due to some peculiar characteristics of multimedia objects and user activities in streaming services, design of an efficient caching system becomes a more challenging problem compared to the traditional caching systems. This paper discusses some important issues that are of interest in the domain of multimedia streaming caching and presents a new cache management scheme for multimedia streaming servers. Our new scheme considers different streaming rates of multimedia objects as well as the inter-arrival time between two consecutive requests on an identical object. It also considers user activities in requesting and playing multimedia contents. Trace-driven simulations with real world VOD traces show that the proposed scheme improves the performance of multimedia streaming systems significantly.", "paper_title": "Considering user behavior and multiple QoS supports in multimedia streaming caching", "paper_id": "WOS:000245923000004"}
