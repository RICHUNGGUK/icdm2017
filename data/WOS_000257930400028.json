In this paper, we derive a reduced-complexity residue-to-binary conversion algorithm for the moduli set (2(n), 2(n+1) - 1, 2(n) - 1) by using New Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). The resulting converter architecture mainly consists of simple adder and multiplexer (MUX) which is suitable to realize an efficient VLSI implementation. For the various dynamic range (DR) requirements, the experimental results show that the proposed converter can significantly achieve at least 23.3% average Area-Time (AT) saving when comparing with the latest designs. Based on UMC 0.18 mu m CMOS cell-based technology, the chip area for 16-bit residue-to-binary converter is 931 x 931 mu m(2) and its working frequency is about 135 MHz including I/O pad.", "paper_title": "Efficient VLSI design of residue-to-binary converter for the moduli set (2(n), 2(n+1)-1, 2(n)-1)", "paper_id": "WOS:000257930400028"}
