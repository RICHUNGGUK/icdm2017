In this study, we meet the bit loading problem of the subcarriers of a DMT system. We propose two new optimum-loading algorithms with low computational complexity. These algorithms assign integer number of bits successively until a target bit rate is fulfilled. We compare them with several existing algorithms in terms of transmitting energy versus data rate and complexity versus system's characteristics i.e. number of subcarriers and target data rate. Simulations prove that without sacrificing optimality both our proposals present a lower complexity level.
