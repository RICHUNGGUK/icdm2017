The objective of this letter is to present a new family of ternary cyclic codes with parameters [3(m) - 1, 3(m) - 1 - 2m,4], where m is an odd integer. The proposed cyclic codes are optimal in the sense that their parameters meet the Sphere Packing bound.", "paper_title": "A New Family of Optimal Ternary Cyclic Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000331343200034"}
