The geometric context model characterizes the single-character likeliness and between-character relationship. The linguistic model utilizes the dependency of the word with the external adjacent characters. The combining weights are optimized on training documents. Experiments on a large handwriting database CASIA-HWDB demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and justify the benefits of geometric and linguistic contexts. Compared to transcription-based text search, the proposed method can provide higher recall rate, and for spotting words of four characters, the proposed method provides both higher precision and recall rate.
