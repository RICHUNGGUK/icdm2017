In this paper we propose a new definition for available bandwidth and a novel framework that addresses these issues. We define probabilistic available bandwidth (PAB) as the largest input rate at which we can send a traffic flow along a path while achieving, with specified probability, an output rate that is almost as large as the input rate. PAB is expressed directly in terms of the measurable output rate and includes adjustable parameters that allow the user to adapt to different application requirements. Our probabilistic framework to estimate network-wide probabilistic available bandwidth is based on packet trains, Bayesian inference, factor graphs and active sampling. We deploy our tool on the PlanetLab network and our results show that we can obtain accurate estimates with a much smaller measurement overhead than Pathload. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
