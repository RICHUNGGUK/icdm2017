It refers to the process of aligning data sets, possibly from different modalities (e. g., magnetic resonance and computed tomography), different time points (e. g., follow-up scans), and/or different subjects (in case of population studies). A large number of methods for image registration are described in the literature. Unfortunately, there is not one method that works for all applications. We have therefore developed elastix, a publicly available computer program for intensity-based medical image registration. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. The command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting. The usage of elastix for comparing different registration methods is illustrated with three example experiments, in which individual components of the registration method are varied.", "paper_title": "elastix: A Toolbox for Intensity-Based Medical Image Registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000273334400018"}
