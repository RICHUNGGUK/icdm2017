Inspired by the neurophysiological structure of the brain, SN P systems have been extended in various ways. P-Lingua is a standard language for the definition of P systems, where pLinguaCore library provides particular implementations of parsers and simulators for the models specified in P-Lingua. A support for simulating SN P systems in P-Lingua was introduced recently and soon expanded to cover further features of these systems. In this paper, we present an extension of P-Lingua related to asynchronous SN P systems, in order to incorporate simulation capabilities for limited asynchronous SN P systems and asynchronous SN P systems with local synchronization.", "paper_title": "Extending Simulation of Asynchronous Spiking Neural P Systems in P-Lingua", "paper_id": "WOS:000349462400007"}
