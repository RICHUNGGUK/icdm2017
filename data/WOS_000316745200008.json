However, the problem of asymmetric read and write costs has to be addressed before the advantages of NVM can be fully exploited. That is, the cost of write operation is much more expensive than the cost of read operation on NVMs. The existing techniques for loop optimization cannot be used effectively with non-volatile main memory because this special feature is not considered. In this paper, we propose an efficient loop scheduling algorithm, the Rotation with Maximum Bipartite Matching (RMBM) algorithm, to address the problem of expensive write operations on non-volatile main memory for chip multiprocessors (CMPs). It achieves high parallelism for a loop and, at the same time, reduces the number of write operations on NVM. The experimental results show that the RMBM algorithm reduces the number of write activities on NVM by 34.5 % on average compared with the traditional rotation scheduling algorithm. The execution time is reduced by 20.5 %, and the energy consumption is also reduced by 15.03 % on average using the RMBM algorithm. In other words, the average lifetime of NVM can be extended by more than 2 times using the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Efficient Loop Scheduling for Chip Multiprocessors with Non-Volatile Main Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000316745200008"}
