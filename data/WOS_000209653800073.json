Both emission type tomographic imaging modalities use external X-rays to stimulate secondary emissions, either light or secondary X-rays, which are then acquired for tomographic reconstruction. These modalities surpass the limits of sensitivity in current X-ray imaging and have the potential of enabling X-ray imaging to extract molecular imaging information. These new modalities also promise to break through the spatial resolution limits of other in vivo molecular imaging modalities. This paper reviews the development of X-ray luminescence and X-ray fluorescence CT and their relative merits. The discussion includes current problems and future research directions and the role of these modalities in future molecular imaging applications.", "paper_title": "X-Ray Luminescence and X-Ray Fluorescence Computed Tomography: New Molecular Imaging Modalities", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800073"}
