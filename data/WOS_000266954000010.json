The manual execution of these tasks is very time consuming and a configurable environment to facilitate these tasks and consequently improve testing performance is desired. In this paper a virtual network environment that can be easily re-configured is presented to address this problem. The environment has been evaluated by a series of case studies: one dealing with the deployment and containment of a worm propagation attack and one dealing with detecting a denial of service attack. Three smaller case studies have also been developed. The results are a clear indication of the flexibility and usefulness of the virtual network environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
