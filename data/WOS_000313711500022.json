What is the academic productivity of an Italian researcher working in Italy compared with one working abroad? Does academic productivity depend on their well-being at work? The aim of this study is to find explanations for these questions and to demonstrate the relationship that exists between academic productivity and organizational well-being and work, both for researchers who are Italian emigrants abroad (project IRA) and for those who remain in Italy (IRI project).This goal was achieved through two surveys. Where there is an atmosphere of a wellness organization, it creates a productive work environment (vision abroad); conversely, a poor working environment that is associated with an organizational system that is below the average level negatively affects the overall academic productivity (in Italy). We can confirm that working environments with better organizational climate produce more productive academics.", "paper_title": "Academic productivity correlated with well-being at work", "paper_id": "WOS:000313711500022"}
