It is unknown what makes these recent H5N1 strains more aggressive than previously circulating strains. Here, we have compared more than 3000 RNA sequences of segment 8 of type A influenza viruses and found a unique single nucleotide substitution typically associated with recent H5N1 strains. By phylogenetic analysis, biochemical and biophysical experiments, we demonstrate that this substitution dramatically affects the equilibrium between a hairpin and a pseudoknot conformation near the 3' splice-site of the NS gene. This conformational shift may have consequences for splicing regulation of segment 8 mRNA. Our data suggest that besides changes at the protein level, changes in RNA secondary structure should be seriously considered when attempting to explain influenza virus evolution.", "paper_title": "An RNA conformational shift in recent H5N1 influenza A viruses", "paper_id": "WOS:000244124500002"}
