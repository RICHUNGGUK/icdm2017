In this case, computer aided method is very helpful. While some local search algorithms are easily to fall into a local optimum solution. On contrast, the population based methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, Artificial Immune System, Autonomy Oriented Computing, are global search algorithms. However they are not good at the local search. In thia paper, an improved method is proposed by combining the local and global search ability, so as to improve the performance in terms of the convergence speed and the convergence reliability. We construct a generic form to deal with the common objective function space or the objective function with the partial derivative. In addition, we present an n-hold method in population based evolution method. The experiments indicate that our approach can effectively improve the convergence reliability, which is much concerned in some applications with the expensive executing expense.", "paper_title": "An improved population based optimization solution method by combining local and global searching", "paper_id": "WOS:000251390300008"}
