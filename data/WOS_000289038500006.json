A content architecture based on ICDT was constructed and employed to analyze 26 online game websites chosen from top online game rankings in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This research found that websites in China area provide the highest service rate in VCS; those in Hong Kong area provide the highest service rate in VIS; Taiwan's online game websites provide the highest service rate in VTS and VDS. Most of the websites investigated provide good service functions in VIS, but require further improvement of their VTS functions in the Great China area. The findings in this study can help understand the current status of online game websites in Great China area and can also be used for website owners to improve web design by offering players more decent function services.", "paper_title": "Function Assessment of Online Game Websites in Great China Area", "paper_id": "WOS:000289038500006"}
