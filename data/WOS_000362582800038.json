Additive filter gain uncertainties that reflect imprecision in filter implementation are considered. Based on the robust control approach, sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that the filtering error system is asymptotically stable with a prescribed H-infinity performance level and the eigenvalues of the filtering error system in a given circular region. The filter parameters are determined by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. A simulation study on the nonlinear tunnel diode circuit system is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "Nonfragile Distributed Filtering for T-S Fuzzy Systems in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000362582800038"}
