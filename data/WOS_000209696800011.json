Our aim is to minimize the total transmitted power subject to the worst-case individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and equivocation rates. To model the imperfect CSI, bounded ellipsoidal uncertainties for channel vector and covariance are both considered. By deriving the equivalent forms for the SINR and secrecy constraints, the worst-case robust problem can be reformulated as a semi-definite programming (SDP) with the help of rank relaxation. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Robust Coordinated Beamforming for Secure MISO Interference Channels with Bounded Ellipsoidal Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696800011"}
