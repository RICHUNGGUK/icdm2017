The development of surrogates for such complex relationships often requires the modeling of high dimensional and non-smooth functions using limited information. To this end, the hybrid surrogate modeling paradigm, where different surrogate models are combined, offers an effective solution. In this paper, we develop a new high fidelity surrogate modeling technique that we call the Adaptive Hybrid Functions (AHF). The AHF formulates a reliable Crowding Distance-Based Trust Region (CD-TR), and adaptively combines the favorable characteristics of different surrogate models. The weight of each contributing surrogate model is determined based on the local measure of accuracy for that surrogate model in the pertinent trust region. Such an approach is intended to exploit the advantages of each component surrogate. This approach seeks to simultaneously capture the global trend of the function as well as the local deviations. In this paper, the AHF combines four component surrogate models: (i) the Quadratic Response Surface Model (QRSM), (ii) the Radial Basis Functions (RBF), (iii) the Extended Radial Basis Functions (E-RBF), and (iv) the Kriging model. The AHF is applied to standard test problems and to a complex engineering design problem. Subsequent evaluations of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Maximum Absolute Error (MAE) illustrate the promising potential of this hybrid surrogate modeling approach.", "paper_title": "An adaptive hybrid surrogate model", "paper_id": "WOS:000305987000005"}
