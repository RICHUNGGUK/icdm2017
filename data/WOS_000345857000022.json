The aim of this paper is to investigate a new approach to derive the priority weights from an IFPR. To do so, we give a new definition of multiplicative consistent IFPR, which is based on the membership and nonmembership degrees of the intuitionistic fuzzy judgments. After that, a formula, which involves the underlying intuitionistic fuzzy weights of the IFPR, is proposed to construct such a multiplicative consistent IFPR. Based on the formula, some fractional programming models are built to generate the intuitionistic fuzzy priority weighting vector of the IFPR. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Priorities of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Preference Relation Based on Multiplicative Consistency", "paper_id": "WOS:000345857000022"}
