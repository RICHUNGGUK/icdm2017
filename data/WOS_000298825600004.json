Using ABAQUS software and a bilinear softening fictitious crack model, the crack propagation process was simulated and compared to the experimental results. It is found that the increase of AE hit count has a similar trend with the increase of energy dissipation in FEM simulation. For two types of concretes, both experimental results and numerical simulation indicate that the rubberized concrete has a better fracture resistance.", "paper_title": "Fracture process of rubberized concrete by fictitious crack model and AE monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000298825600004"}
