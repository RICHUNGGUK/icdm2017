Implementation, prototyping, and verification of such large systems has become very challenging. One of the reasons is that chips/FPGAs resources are limited and therefore it is not always possible to implement the whole design in the traditional system-on-a-chip solutions. The state-of-the-art is to partition such systems into smaller sub-systems to implement each on a separate chip. Consequently, it requires interconnecting separate chips/FPGAs. Since Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) have become common interconnection solutions in embedded designs, we propose to bridge NoC-based SoCs enabling a generic multi-chip systems interconnection. In this context, the contribution of this paper is threefold, (i) we explore the NoC protocol stack to determine the best layer for implementing the off-chip bridge, (ii) we propose a generic hardware architecture for the bridge, and (iii) we develop a new software architecture enabling seamless configuration and communication of multi-chip NoC-based SoCs. Finally, we demonstrate performance, i.e., bandwidth and latency, of the bridge in a multi-FPGA platform, while the bridge guarantees QoS of traffic. The synthesis results indicate the implementation area cost of the bridge is only 1% of Xilinx Virtex6 FPGA. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
