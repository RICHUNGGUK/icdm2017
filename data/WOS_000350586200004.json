Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a case to demonstrate the feasibility and contributions of the S-D logic-based input-output analysis approach. Findings - This study adopted the idea of customer involvement to formulate the S-D logic-based input-output analysis approach. Service providers can apply this systematical approach to find potential opportunities to spread information technology and co-create values with customers. Originality/value - The S-D logic-based input-output analysis approach has elasticity to dynamically employ different perspectives to evaluate the effects of technology spillovers in order for integrity and precision. The proposed approach is to delineate the possible target values that related to specific services based on the notions of operant resources and customer involvement in a selected service sector. Service providers within the service sector have to offer innovative service activities and manage existing services for customers to participate in.", "paper_title": "An innovative approach to measuring technology spillovers in service-dominant logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000350586200004"}
