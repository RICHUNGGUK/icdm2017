We replace the Lipschitz condition on the set-valued map in the right-hand side by a weaker onesided Lipschitz (OSL), one-sided Kamke (OSK) or a continuity-like condition (CLC). We prove new Filippov-type theorems for singularly perturbed and evolution inclusions with OSL right-hand sides. In the CLC case we obtain two extended theorems, one of which implies directly the relaxation theorem. We obtain also a theorem in Banach spaces for OSK multifunctions. Some applications to exponential formulae are surveyed.", "paper_title": "On the theorem of Filippov-Plis and some applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000278066900016"}
