Yet they are usually incomplete and insufficient to describe the whole semantic content of the corresponding images, resulting in performance degradations of various tag-dependent applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method denoted as DLSR for automatic image tag completion via Dual-view Linear Sparse Reconstructions. Given an incomplete initial tagging matrix with each row representing an image and each column representing a tag, DLSR performs tag completion from both views of image and tag, exploiting various available contextual information. Specifically, for a to-be-completed image, DLSR exploits image-image correlations by linearly reconstructing its low-level image features and initial tagging vector with those of others, and then utilizes them to obtain an image-view reconstructed tagging vector. Meanwhile, by linearly reconstructing the tagging column vector of each tag with those of others, DLSR exploits tag-tag correlations to get a tag-view reconstructed tagging vector with the initially labeled tags. Then both image-view and tag-view reconstructed tagging vectors are combined for better predicting missing related tags. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets and real-world web images well demonstrate the reasonableness and effectiveness of the proposed DLSR. And it can be utilized to enhance a variety of tag-dependent applications such as image auto-annotation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
