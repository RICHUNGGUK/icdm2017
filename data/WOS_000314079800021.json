LTV treats all facial areas with the same regularization parameters, which inevitably results in the loss of useful facial details and is harmful for recognition tasks. To address this problem, we propose to assign the regularization parameters which balance the large-scale (illumination) and small-scale (reflectance) components in a spatially adaptive scheme. Face recognition experiments on both Extended Yale B and the large-scale FERET databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Spatially Adaptive Logarithmic Total Variation Model for Varying Light Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000314079800021"}
