Some watermarking schemes have been reported to solve this problem. However, both these watermarking schemes and the traditional hash methods have a problem of increasing file size. In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking scheme for the tamper-proof of web pages, which is free of this embarrassment. For a web page, the proposed scheme generates watermarks based on the principal component analysis (PCA) technique. The watermarks are then embedded into the web page through the upper and lower cases of letters in HTML tags. When a watermarked web page is tampered, the extracted watermarks can detect the modifications to the web page, thus we can keep the tampered one from being published. Extensive experiments are performed on the proposed scheme and the results show that the proposed scheme can be a feasible and efficient tool for the tamper-proof of web pages.
