Thus, the caregiving process and the quality of life of older adults can be improved by adopting systems for the automatic detection of falls. This paper presents a smartphone-based fall detection system that monitors the movements of patients, recognizes a fall, and automatically sends a request for help to the caregivers. To reduce the problem of false alarms, the system includes novel techniques for the recognition of those activities of daily living that could be erroneously mis-detected as falls (such as sitting on a sofa or lying on a bed). To limit the intrusiveness of the system, a small external sensing unit can also be used for the acquisition of movement data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
