In our resource calculus, all applications are (multi)linear in the algebraic sense. i.e. commute with linear combinations of the function or the argument. We study the collective behaviour of the beta-reducts of the terms occurring in the Taylor expansion of any ordinary lambda-term, using, in a surprisingly crucial way, a uniformity property that they enjoy. As a corollary, we obtain (the main part of) a proof that this Taylor expansion commutes with Bohm tree computation. syntactically. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
