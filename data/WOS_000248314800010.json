In this paper, we propose to use event dynamics, a property that is inherent to an event and is thus common to all acquisitions of the event, for both global and local temporal registration of video sequences in order to generate high temporal resolution video. We compare our approach to a widely used linear interpolation based temporal registration algorithm and demonstrate that in the case of low temporal acquisition rate, a global event dynamics based approach, such as ours, has smaller temporal registration error. We also present a unique application of our work in solving 3-D (2D + time) high temporal resolution medical data visualization problem.", "paper_title": "Event dynamics based temporal registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000248314800010"}
