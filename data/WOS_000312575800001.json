In contrast to many existing methods, we directly integrate 3D reasoning with an appearance-based voting architecture. Our method relies on a nonparametric representation of a joint distribution of shape and appearance of the object class. Our voting method employs a novel parameterization of joint detection and viewpoint hypothesis space, allowing efficient accumulation of evidence. We combine this with a re-scoring and refinement mechanism, using an ensemble of view-specific support vector machines. We evaluate the performance of our approach in detection and pose estimation of cars on a number of benchmark datasets. Finally we introduce the \"Weizmann Cars ViewPoint\" (WCVP) dataset, a benchmark for evaluating continuous pose estimation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
