There is, therefore, an emphasis on understanding, which is contained in the linguistic message. Understanding goes beyond what is said, and includes the immediate connotations, that is, semantics in the strict sense. Language must, therefore, be interpreted, though it is indeed transferred by the immediate meanings of the linguistic code.
