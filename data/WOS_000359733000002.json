Instead of prescribing an artificial force to enforce the no-slip boundary condition at the solid-fluid interface, this work imposes two boundary velocities, referred to as the solid and mass-conserving boundary velocities, to satisfy the no-slip boundary condition and mass conservation in the ghost cells around the immersed solid boundary. Both the traditional level set method [41] and the hybrid particle level set method [45] were used to represent the solid boundary and the complex free-surface evolution, respectively. Consequently, the boundary velocities close to the immersed solid boundary can be determined in terms of the level set function and the neighboring fluid velocity. The projection method is further modified to incorporate the solid and mass-conserving boundary velocities into the solution algorithm. A series of numerical experiments were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. They involved uniform flow past a stationary circular cylinder and the propagation of water waves over a submerged trapezoidal breakwater. Comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data showed very good agreement in all cases of interest.
