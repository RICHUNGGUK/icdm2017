However, recent research has emphasized not just the receipt but also the pacing of citation. Citation speed has been shown to be affected by journal prestige and self-citation but also public funding of research. Amidst these viewpoints, this paper explores the speed of article citation of a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary publicly funded research center relative to that of a comparison group of articles. Results indicate that articles by authors affiliated with the center are significantly more likely to have early-cited papers within the year of publication than the random comparison group, with controls by field also being significant. Implications for the ability of a publicly funded center to attract attention toward articles are discussed.", "paper_title": "The use of citation speed to understand the effects of a multi-institutional science center", "paper_id": "WOS:000340569800002"}
