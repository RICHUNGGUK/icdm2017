A density biased sampling algorithm based on grid can avoid the problem. However, the grid division granularity has an influence on the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm. To overcome the drawback, a variable grid density biased sampling is proposed to deal with large scale unevenly distributed datasets. However, the efficiency is restricted by dimensionality. Aiming at this, an efficient density biased sampling algorithm is proposed for large highdimensional datasets. Firstly, an efficient feature selection method is designed to obtain the feature subsets. Secondly, the variable grid division is executed in the selected feature subsets. Finally, the sample is obtained from the grid space. Synthetic datasets and IJCI datasets, tested in our experiments, reveal that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher quality than SRS. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm consumes less sampling time comparing with density biased sampling algorithm based on grid and density biased sampling algorithm based on variable grid division.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Density Biased Sampling Algorithm for Clustering Large High-Dimensional Datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000365890200003"}
