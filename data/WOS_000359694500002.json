Defining formal semantics for modeling languages is a widely accepted solution to this problem. We have developed methods, techniques and processes to provide a systematic mapping - which we call semantic anchoring - that support the scaling of these formal definitions to large modeling languages. Although a semantic mapping is a definition and behaves as a set of axioms for formal verification, we argue that a semantic mapping can conflict with the informal intentions of the language designer, resulting in a counterintuitive DSML, and should therefore be validated. This paper proposes a solution that involves formalizing the language designer's intentions about the semantic mapping and validating the consistency between the two by applying model finding techniques.", "paper_title": "Validating Transformations for Semantic Anchoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000359694500002"}
