Simple as well as multiple regressions have indicated that PW2 (Path\\Walk-2-Randic Shape Index) is the most dominating parameter to be used in modeling K-app. Excellent results are obtained in multiparametric regressions. The results are critically discussed using a variety of statistical parameters. The models are validated using Leave-One-Out (LOO) and Leave-Group-Out (LGO) crossvalidation, external test set, and chance correlation.", "paper_title": "QSAR of novel hydroxyphenylureas as antioxidant agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000255693800002"}
