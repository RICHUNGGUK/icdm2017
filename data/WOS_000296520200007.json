The shape of the partition is a p-tuple of the size of each part. A single-shape partition polytope is the convex hull of partition sums of all partitions that have a prescribed shape. A partition is separable if the convex hull of its parts are pairwise disjoint. The separability of a partition is a necessary condition for the associated partition sum to be a vertex of the single-shape partition polytope. It is also a sufficient condition for d=1 or p=2. However, the sufficiency fails to hold for da parts per thousand yen3 and pa parts per thousand yen3. In this paper, we give some geometric sufficient conditions as well as some necessary conditions of vertices in general d and p. Thus, the open case for d=2 and pa parts per thousand yen3 is resolved.", "paper_title": "On the vertex characterization of single-shape partition polytopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000296520200007"}
