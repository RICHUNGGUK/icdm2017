To demonstrate the power and simplicity of this technique, a number of recent results are rederived, using only a few simple steps. In particular, we derive the joint probability distribution of eigen-values of the matrix GG dagger, with G a nonzero mean or a semi-correlated Gaussian random matrix. These joint probability distribution functions can then be used to calculate the moment generating function of the mutual information for Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels with these probability distribution of their channel matrices G. We then turn to the previously unsolved problem of calculating the moment generating function of the mutual information of MIMO channels, which are correlated at both the receiver and the transmitter. From this moment generating function we obtain the ergodic average of the mutual information and study the outage probability. These methods can be applied to a number of other problems. As a particular example, we examine unitary encoded space-time transmission of MIMO systems and we derive the received signal distribution when the channel matrix is correlated at the transmitter end.", "paper_title": "Capacity and character expansions: Moment-generating function and other exact results for MIMO correlated channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000242503300011"}
