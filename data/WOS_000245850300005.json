A digital watermark pattern has been attached with the speech signal to detect three kinds of alterations or forgeries such as substitution, insertion, and removal. The watermark pattern will be modified if some changes have been made to the speech contents. Modification and forgery can be measured and detected by pattern recovery. The proposed method uses the cyclic pattern embedding to overcome synchronizing problems of previous detection techniques. In addition, pattern recovery enhances the robustness to compression. This method has been tested and verified using six recording devices, which was used for collecting verbal data. The speech signals were sampled at the rate of 8 kHz and digitized at 16 bits resolution. Randomly chosen regions were substituted, removed, and compressed in MP3 at the rate of 16 kbps as well as in CELP at the rate of 11.5 kbps. The experiment shows the perfect detection for three kinds of forgeries and it proved the validity of the proposed method. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
