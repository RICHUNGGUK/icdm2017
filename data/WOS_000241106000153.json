The dynamic equations of their interaction are always nonlinear, sometimes chaotic. This paper applied phase space reconstruction method to map time series into multi-dimension space based on chaos theory. Extracted from multi-dimension phase space by the method of sequential deviation detection, outlier set was used to construct a decision tree in order to identify the kinds of outliers. According to the results of decision tree, a trading strategy was set up and applied to Chinese stock market. The results show that, even in bear market, the strategy dictated by decision tree brought in considerable yield.", "paper_title": "Sequence outlier detection based on chaos theory and its application on stock market", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000153"}
