Due to our empirical evidences, the regions with higher relationship (network) capital enjoy higher knowledge productivity in terms of published articles. Our purpose in this paper is to investigate the relationships that exist between regional published articles and co-authorship in China covering the period from 1998 to 2007 by using Stata to investigate the relation between the regional publications and co-authored published articles. As main findings, the greater the number of co-authored articles that a region has, the greater their success, in terms of the number of articles published. Indeed, both domestic and international co-authorship have had positive effects on published article levels in China.", "paper_title": "Improvements in productivity based on co-authorship: a case study of published articles in China", "paper_id": "WOS:000282048200006"}
