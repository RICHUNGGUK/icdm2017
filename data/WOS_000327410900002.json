As one of the most popular argumentation frameworks, Besnard and Hunter's framework is built on arguments in the form of <Phi, phi > where Phi is consistent and minimal for entailing phi. However, the problem of generating arguments over ontologies is still open. This paper presents an approach to generating arguments over DL-Lite ontologies by searching support paths in focal graphs. Moreover, theoretical results and examples are provided to ensure the correctness of this approach. Finally, we show that approach has the same complexity as propositional revision.", "paper_title": "AN APPROACH TO GENERATING ARGUMENTS OVER DL-LITE ONTOLOGIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000327410900002"}
