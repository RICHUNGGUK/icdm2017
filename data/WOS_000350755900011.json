It is well known that language barrier and translation ambiguity are two challenging issues for cross-lingual document representation. To this end, we propose to represent cross-lingual documents through statistical word senses, which are automatically discovered from a parallel corpus through a novel cross-lingual word sense induction model and a sense clustering method. In particular, the former consists in a sense-based vector space model and the latter leverages on a sense-based latent Dirichlet allocation. Evaluation on the benchmarking datasets shows that the proposed models outperform two state-of-the-art methods for cross-lingual document clustering.", "paper_title": "Document Representation with Statistical Word Senses in Cross-Lingual Document Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000350755900011"}
