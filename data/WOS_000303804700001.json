The primary problem of meta-scheduling is selecting the best resources (sites) to use to execute the underlying jobs while still achieving the following objectives: reducing the mean job turnaround time, ensuring site load balance, and considering job priorities. We introduce an enhanced meta-scheduling system, called Job Nature Meta-scheduling over Grid (JNMgrid), that achieves these objectives. JNMgrid consists of three components: (1) Job Analyzer and Monitor, which is responsible for determining the types of jobs in specific ratios; (2) Job Decider, which is responsible for matching the jobs with the appropriate resources; and (3) Job Batcher, which is responsible for determining the best number of jobs for execution. The performance of JNMgrid is compared with similar existing systems, such as Random, Queue Length, File Access Cost, and File Access Cost + Job Queue Access Cost. The simulation results demonstrate that JNMgrid outperforms these systems and can thus be deployed in any grid middleware to improve sharing of limited resources among grid users.", "paper_title": "An enhanced meta-scheduling system for grid computing that considers the job type and priority", "paper_id": "WOS:000303804700001"}
