We consider the deterministic lightpath scheduling problem in which the whole set of lightpath demands is completely known in advance. The objective is to maximize the number of established lightpaths for a given number of wavelengths. Since this problem has been shown to be NP complete, various heuristic algorithms have been developed to solve it suboptimally. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic RWA algorithm for SLDs based on the bee colony optimization (BCO) metaheuristic. BCO is a newborn swarm intelligence metaheuristic approach recently proposed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. We compare the efficiency of the proposed algorithm with three simple greedy algorithms for the same problem. Numerical results obtained by numerous simulations performed on the widely used realistic European Optical Network topology indicate that the proposed algorithm produces better-quality solutions compared to those obtained by greedy algorithms. In addition, we compare the results of the BCO-RWA-SLD algorithm with four other heuristic/metaheuristic algorithms proposed in literature to solve the RWA problem in the case of permanent (static) traffic demands.", "paper_title": "A heuristic algorithm for lightpath scheduling in next-generation WDM optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303463700007"}
