In general, it is desirable to have sequence sets with small absolute values of partial correlations. In this paper, generalized lower bounds on partial aperiodic correlation of complex roots of unity sequence sets with respect to family size, sequence length, subsequence length, maximum partial aperiodic autocorrelation sidelobe, maximum partial aperiodic crosscorrelation value and the zero or low correlation zone are derived. It is shown that the previous aperiodic sequence bounds such as Sarwate bounds, Welch bounds, Levenshtein bounds, Tang-Fan bounds and Peng-Fan bounds can be considered as special cases of the new partial aperiodic bounds derived.", "paper_title": "Generalized bounds on partial aperiodic correlation of complex roots of unity sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241183000030"}
