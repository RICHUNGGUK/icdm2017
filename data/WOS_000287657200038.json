As the optimal rates for entanglement distillation and dilution in this paradigm, we obtain the max- and min-relative entropies of entanglement, the two logarithmic robustnesses of entanglement, and smoothed versions thereof. This gives a new operational meaning to these entanglement measures. Moreover, by considering the limit of many identical copies of the shared entangled state, we partially recover the recently found reversibility of entanglement manipulation under the class of operations which asymptotically do not generate entanglement.", "paper_title": "One-Shot Rates for Entanglement Manipulation Under Non-entangling Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000287657200038"}
