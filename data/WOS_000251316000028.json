The accuracy and the stability of the model are essentially improved by using this regularization. A good agreement with analytical Womersley solution is presented, as well as an improvement of the accuracy over standard L-BGK. Numerical stability of the scheme for a range of Reynolds and Womersley numbers is also presented, demonstrating an enhancement of the stability range of L-BGK for this type of flows.", "paper_title": "Simulating time harmonic flows with the regularized L-BGK method", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316000028"}
