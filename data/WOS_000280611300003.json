Out of necessity, these complex applications need to execute in distributed environments and make use of a number of heterogeneous resources. In this paper we describe some of these applications and illustrate techniques that improve their performance and reliably in distributed environments, such as grids and clouds. Although clouds were first introduced in the business arena, they have a potential to be provide on-demand resources for scientific computations.", "paper_title": "GRIDS AND CLOUDS: MAKING WORKFLOW APPLICATIONS WORK IN HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTED ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280611300003"}
