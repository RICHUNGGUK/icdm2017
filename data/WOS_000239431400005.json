The use of multiple non-overlapping frequency channels in multirate wireless networks can overcome the performance degradation by having nodes communicate on different channels based on their data rates. However, no effort has been invested to utilize the multiple channels for a multirate wireless network. In this paper, we introduce the Data Rate Adaptive Channel Assignment (DR-CA) algorithm for a multichannel multirate single-hop wireless network to provide higher network throughput and network efficiency. The main idea is to assign links having same or comparable data rates on the same channel to minimize the wastage of channel resources due to interference between high data links and low data rate links. We also design a new Intermediary Multichannel Layer (IML) which resides between network layer and link layer, at which we implement the DR-CA algorithm. The IML design requires no modifications to the underlying MAC layer and upper layers of the network stack. To evaluate the proposed algorithm we define new performance metrics-channel efficiency and network efficiency for a multichannel multirate wireless network. Using OPNET simulations, we show that the multichannel enhancement using our proposed algorithm provides significant performance improvement in terms of network throughput, channel efficiency, and network efficiency over existing approaches in multirate wireless networks. Under heavy load condition, the network efficiency using DR-CA algorithm reaches 90% of the maximum limit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize the benefits of multiple channels in the multirate wireless network environment.", "paper_title": "Design and evaluation of multichannel multirate wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239431400005"}
