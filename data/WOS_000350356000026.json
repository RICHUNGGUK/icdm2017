That way, VPPs can participate in frequency control by regulating in a coordinated manner their output power for the sake of system stability. This study analyzes a decision tree (DT)-based methodology that dispatches a requested reduction of active power within a VPP (among the sources it consists of), so as to support the mitigation of over-frequency. The presented control con-cept finds its application concerning grid support in case of over-frequency, and is also meant as a response to related reports and studies asking for the increased contribution of DG to overcome such phenomena.", "paper_title": "Decision Trees-Aided Active Power Reduction of a Virtual Power Plant for Power System Over-Frequency Mitigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000350356000026"}
