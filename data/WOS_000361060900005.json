The algorithm is based on the use of Rotation Forest and KNN classifiers for the texture classification. 720 textural characteristics were extracted using methods based on Laws' masks analysis, co-occurrence matrix, gray level run-length matrix and statistical characteristics of the images. An optimal subset of 22 informative features was selected using correlation-based method. Testing the algorithm with liver images of 57 patients divided into 5 stages of fibrosis showed 72.7% classification accuracy for single regions of interest. In the case of entire image classification the fibrosis stage was correctly identified for the vast majority of cases.", "paper_title": "Ultrasound image texture analysis for liver fibrosis stage diagnostics", "paper_id": "WOS:000361060900005"}
