The problem asks to decide whether a directed graph contains anonymous subgraphs of a given family. This problem has a number of practical applications and here we describe three of them (Secret Santa Problem, anonymous routing, robust paths) that can be formulated as ASPs. Our main contributions are (i) a formalization of the anonymity property for a generic family of subgraphs, (ii) an algorithm to solve the ASP in time polynomial in the size of the graph under a set of conditions, and (iii) a thorough evaluation of our algorithms using various tests based both on randomly generated graphs and on real-world instances.
