General resizing techniques (e. g., uniform scaling) and image-resizing techniques suffer from several drawbacks, as they do not consider the content of the visualizations. This work introduces ViSizer, a perception-based framework for automatically resizing a visualization to fit any display. We formulate an energy function based on a perception model (feature congestion), which aims to determine the optimal deformation for every local region. We subsequently transform the problem into an optimization problem by the energy function. An efficient algorithm is introduced to iteratively solve the problem, allowing for automatic visualization resizing.", "paper_title": "ViSizer: A Visualization Resizing Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000312482200010"}
