We use a vectorial codification to represent class labels and a multi-class exponential loss function to evaluate classifier responses. This representation produces a set of margin values that provide a range of punishments for failures and rewards for successes. Moreover, the stage-wise optimization of this model introduces an asymmetric boosting procedure whose costs depend on the number of classes separated by each weak-learner. In this way the boosting algorithm takes into account class imbalances when building the ensemble. The experiments performed compare this new approach favorably to AdaBoost.MH, Gentle-Boost and the SAMME algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
