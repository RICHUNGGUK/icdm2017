Currently, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to have higher accuracy than trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) when used to ascertain the presence of prostate cancer. As MRI can provide both morphological and functional images for a tissue of interest, some researchers are exploring the uses of multispectral MRI to guide prostate biopsies and radiation therapy. However, success with prostate cancer localization based on current imaging methods has been limited due to overlap in feature space of benign and malignant tissues using any one MRI method and the inter-observer variability. In this paper, we present a new unsupervised segmentation method for prostate cancer detection, using fuzzy Markov random fields (fuzzy MRFs) for the segmentation of multispectral MR prostate images. Typically, both hard and fuzzy MRF models have two groups of parameters to be estimated: the MRF parameters and class parameters for each pixel in the image. To date, these two parameters have been treated separately, and estimated in an alternating fashion. In this paper, we develop a new method to estimate the parameters defining the Markovian distribution of the measured data, while performing the data clustering simultaneously. We perform computer simulations on synthetic test images and multispectral MR prostate datasets to demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method and also provide a comparison with some of the commonly used methods.", "paper_title": "Prostate Cancer Segmentation With Simultaneous Estimation of Markov Random Field Parameters and Class", "paper_id": "WOS:000266676500011"}
