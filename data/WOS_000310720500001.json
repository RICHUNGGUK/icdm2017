Based on the giant magnetostrictive actuator model related to the combined action of magnetic field and external force, a controller is designed. The controller is composed of giant magnetostrictive actuator model control algorithm and PID control algorithm to realize the output force reaching the constant force target quickly and finely adjustment. Control system's hardware and related software were designed and software package was developed. Experiment results show that the control system has perfect response performance and stability, and favorable controllability. It can effectively realize the giant magnetostrictive actuator which is disturbed by external force continuously keeping outputting a constant force through adjusting the working current. It lays a certain theoretical foundation for giant magnetostrictive actuator being used in the fields of cutting with invariableness cutting force. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
