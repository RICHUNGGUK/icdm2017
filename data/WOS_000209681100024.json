Two methods are envisaged: (i) one for the general case, which includes both fading and phase parameters; and (ii) another for the particular case, which includes only the fading parameter. In both cases, the samples are drawn from easily-implementable hat functions found in closed-form. For the general case, the efficiency is always in excess of 70% reaching 100% depending on the parameters. For the particular case, the efficiency moves rapidly towards 100% for useful values of the parameter.", "paper_title": "Efficient Acceptance-Rejection Method for Nakagami-m Complex Samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681100024"}
