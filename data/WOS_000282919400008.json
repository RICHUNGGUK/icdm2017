Despite its extreme simplicity, the obtained formalism is suitable both for representing (and therefore dynamically anaysing) existing scheduling methods, and for synthesizing new ones m a totally system-theoretical perspective Also. by further specialising the class of systems employed, the modelling complexity can be scaled and tailored to the particular problem to be addressed Examples are reported to explain and support the above dams, including some (simple) new scheduling policies", "paper_title": "A NEW PERSPECTIVE PROPOSAL FOR PREEMPTIVE FEEDBACK SCHEDULING", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400008"}
