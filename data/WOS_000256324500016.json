The analysis of the interaction between a soil nail and the surrounding soil is of great interests to both design engineers and researchers. In this paper, authors present a simple mathematical model for the interaction analysis of a soil nail and the surrounding soil considering a few key factors which are soil dilation, bending of the soil nail, vertical pressure, and non-linear subgrade reaction stiffness. The lateral subgrade reaction between the soil and the soil nail is assumed to obey a hyperbolic relation. Reported test data in the literature are used to verify the present model. The contributions of the soil-nail bending on the pull-out resistance are evaluated in two case studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
