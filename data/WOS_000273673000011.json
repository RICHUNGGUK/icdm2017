Collaborative tagging is employed as an approach in order to grasp and filter users' preferences for items. In addition, we explore several advantages of collaborative tagging for data sparseness and a cold-start user. These applications are notable challenges in collaborative filtering. We present empirical experiments using a real dataset from del.icio.us. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm offers significant advantages both in terms of improving the recommendation quality for sparse data and in dealing with cold-start users as compared to existing work.
