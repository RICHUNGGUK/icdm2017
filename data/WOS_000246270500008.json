An inherent problem of Domino logic is that under specific input conditions the charge redistribution between parasitic capacitances at internal nodes of a circuit can violate the noise margins and cause erroneous responses at the output. The dominant solution to this problem is the multiple precharging of the gate's internal nodes. However, the added precharge transistors are not testable for stuck-open faults. Undetectable stuck-open faults at these transistors may cause noise margins reduction and consequently may affect the reliability of the circuit since its operation in the field will be sensitive to environmental factors such as noise. In this paper, we propose new multiple precharging design schemes that enhance Domino circuits' testability with respect to transistor stuck-open and stuck-on faults.", "paper_title": "Testable designs of multiple precharged Domino circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000246270500008"}
