The aim of this study was to validate clinical Y-90 positron emission tomography (PET) quantification, focusing on scanner linearity as well as acquisition and reconstruction parameter impact on scanner calibration. Data from three dedicated phantom studies (activity range: 55.2 MBq-2.1 GBq) carried out on a Philips Gemini TF 16 PET/CT scanner were analyzed after reconstruction with up to 361 parameter configurations. For activities above 200 MBq, scanner linearity could be confirmed with relative error margins <4%. An acquisition-time-normalized calibration factor of 1.04 MBq . s/CNTS was determined for the employed scanner. Stable activity convergence was found in hot phantom regions with relative differences in summed image intensities between -3.6% and +2.4%. Absolute differences in background noise artifacts between -79.9% and +350% were observed. Quantitative accuracy was dominated by subset size selection in the reconstruction. Using adequate segmentation and optimized acquisition parameters, the average activity recovery error induced by the axial scanner sensitivity profile was reduced to +2.4% +/- 3.4% (mean +/- standard deviation). We conclude that post-therapy dose assessment in Y-90 PET can be improved using adapted parameter setups.", "paper_title": "Study-Parameter Impact in Quantitative 90-Yttrium PET Imaging for Radioembolization Treatment Monitoring and Dosimetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000316213500001"}
