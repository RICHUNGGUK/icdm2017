The presence of stabilizing intermolecular C---C, C---S and C---Se contacts in the longitudinal and transversal projections of the single crystals is postulated on the grounds of the previous high-resolution X-ray data for octathio[8]circulene; it is supported by the present QTAIM calculations and also predicted in some new details for both circulenes. We suggest that the appearance of the observed red color for the monocrystalline octathio[8]circulene is caused by strong intermolecular interactions between the molecules in the single crystal. However, the intermolecular interactions for the sym-tetraselenatetrathio[8]circulene crystal fragment are weaker and molecular layers are more friable in comparison to octathio[8]circulene crystal structure. These lead to the absence of visible absorption for the sym-tetraselenatetrathio[8]circulene crystal.", "paper_title": "Single crystal architecture and absorption spectra of octathio[8]circulene and sym-tetraselenatetrathio[8]circulene: QTAIM and TD-DFT approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000324644000042"}
