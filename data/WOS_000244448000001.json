This article reports on an experiment with 22 readers aimed at finding lexical cohesive patterns in 10 texts. Although there was much diversity in peoples' answers, we identified a common core of the phenomenon, using statistical analysis of agreement patterns and a validation experiment. The core data may now be used as a minimal test set for models of lexical cohesion; we present an example suggesting that models based on mutually exclusive lexical chains will not suffice. In addition, we believe that procedures for revealing and analyzing sub-group patterns of agreement described here may be applied to data collected in other studies of comparable size.", "paper_title": "Reader-based exploration of lexical cohesion", "paper_id": "WOS:000244448000001"}
