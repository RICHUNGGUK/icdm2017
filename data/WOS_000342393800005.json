We propose augmenting FPGAs with networks-on-chip (NoCs) to simplify design, and we show that this can be done while maintaining or even improving silicon efficiency. We compare the area and speed efficiency of each NoC component when implemented hard versus soft to explore the space and inform our design choices. We then build on this component-level analysis to architect hard NoCs and integrate them into the FPGA fabric; these NoCs are on average 20-23x smaller and 5-6x faster than soft NoCs. A 64-node hard NoC uses only similar to 2% of an FPGA's silicon area and metallization. We introduce a new-communication efficiency metric: silicon area required per realized communication bandwidth. Soft NoCs consume 4960 mm(2)/TBps, but hard NoCs are 84x more efficient at 59 mm(2)/TBps. Informed design can further reduce the area overhead of NoCs to 23 mm(2)/TBps, which is only 2.6x less efficient than the simplest point-to-point soft links (9 mm(2)/TBps). Despite this almost comparable efficiency, NoCs can switch data across the entire FPGA while point-to-point links are very limited in capability; therefore, hard NoCs are expected to improve FPGA efficiency for more complex styles of communication.", "paper_title": "Networks-on-Chip for FPGAs: Hard, Soft or Mixed?", "paper_id": "WOS:000342393800005"}
