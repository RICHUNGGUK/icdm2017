To this end, we offer a unified and abstract concept with a dual interpretation as a DOM and as a DBW system. We validate the proposed approach by using a set of simulations on an illustrative case Study and show how it can be used in modeling as well as design of planning and control algorithms for DOM and DBW systems. In the case study, we describe the proposed approach and show its dual interpretation by identifying the relations between 2D dynamic object manipulation of a disc using two planar manipulators and 2D dynamic object locomotion of lower part of a biped robot. More specifically, having obtained the equations of DOM, we change the boundary conditions of the problem in such a way that both radius and mass of the disc tend to infinity. Simultaneously, both size and mass of the manipulators' base, i.e. the planet earth, tend to some values in the order of human body mass and dimension. Regarding these changes, we can transform DOM into DBW and vice versa. To test the proposed approach, a simple control strategy is introduced to handle impact between the manipulators (legs) and the object (the earth). In addition, a motion planning system is designed in Such a way that the manipulators (legs) catch and throw the manipulated object (the earth) in appropriate configurations. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
