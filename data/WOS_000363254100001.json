Unfortunately, with link-state routing protocols commonly used in such networks, topological changes lead to transient forwarding loops inducing service disruption. This reduces the frequency at which operators can adapt their network. Prior works proved that it is possible to avoid disruptions due to the planned reconfiguration of a link by progressively changing its weight, leading to a solution that does not require changing protocol specification. In this paper, we study the more general problem of gracefully modifying the logical state of multiple interfaces of a router, while minimizing the number of weight updates. Compared to single-link modifications, the router update problem is k-dimensional for a router having neighbors. We also show that multidimensional updates may trigger new kinds of disruptions that make the problem more challenging than the single-link case. We then present and evaluate efficient algorithms that compute minimal sequences of weights enabling disruption-free router reconfigurations. Based on analysis of real IP network topologies, we show that both the size of such sequences and the computing time taken by our algorithms are limited.", "paper_title": "Computing Minimal Update Sequences for Graceful Router-Wide Reconfigurations", "paper_id": "WOS:000363254100001"}
