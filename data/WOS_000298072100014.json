It promises simplified and flexible user management, reduced administrative costs, improved security, as well as the integration of employees' business functions into the IT administration. A comprehensive scientific literature collection revealed more than 1300 publications dealing with the application of sociological role theory in the context of Information Security up to now. Although there is an ANSI/NIST standard and an ISO standard proposal, a variety of competing models and interpretations of the role concept have developed. The major contribution of this survey is a categorization of the complete underlying set of publications into different classes. The main part of the work is investigating 32 identified research directions, evaluating their importance and analyzing research tendencies. An electronic bibliography including all surveyed publications together with the classification information is provided additionally. As a final contribution potential future developments in the area of role-research are considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
