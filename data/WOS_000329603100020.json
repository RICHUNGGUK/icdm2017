The purpose is to design a mode-dependent linear filtering which ensures that, for all admissible uncertainties, the filtering error system is not only stochastically asymptotically stable in the large, but also satisfies a prescribed H-infinity-leo norm level. Some novel mode-dependent and delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the solvability of this problem are obtained. The desired filter can be constructed by solving a set of strict linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
