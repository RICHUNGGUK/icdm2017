Unfortunately, node compromises pose the great challenge of securing the data collection; the sensed data could be leaked to or could be manipulated by the compromised nodes. Furthermore, chunks of the sensed data could be dropped maliciously, resulting in an incomplete query result, which is the most difficult security breach. Here, we propose a simple yet effective hash tree-based framework, under which data confidentiality, query result authenticity, and query result completeness can be guaranteed simultaneously. In addition, the subtree sampling technique, which could be of independent interest to the other applications, is proposed to efficiently identify the compromised nodes. Last, analytical and extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance and security of our methods. Prototype implementation on TelosB mote demonstrates the practicality of our proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Practical and Secure Multidimensional Query Framework in Tiered Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290737100001"}
