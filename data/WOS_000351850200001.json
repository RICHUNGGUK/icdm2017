It relies on model reference-based control, where a reference model generates the desired trajectory. Depending on the type of reference model used for generating the reference trajectory, and on the assumptions about the availability and uncertainty of fault estimation, different error models are obtained. These error models are suitable for passive FTC, active FTC and hybrid FTC, the latter being able to merge the benefits of active and passive FTC while reducing their respective drawbacks. The controller is generated using results from the robust linear parameter varying (LPV) polytopic framework, where the vector of varying parameters is used to schedule between uncertain linear time invariant (LTI) systems. The design procedure relies on solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) in order to achieve regional pole placement and H-infinity norm bounding constraints. Simulation results are used to compare the different FTC strategies.", "paper_title": "ROBUST QUASI-LPV MODEL REFERENCE FTC OF A QUADROTOR UAV SUBJECT TO ACTUATOR FAULTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000351850200001"}
