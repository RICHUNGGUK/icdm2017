This paper contributes to this line of research by collecting and analyzing CAD (computer-aided design) procedural and cognitive performance data for novice trainees during 16-weeks of training. The declarative performance is measured by time, and the procedural performance by the number of features used to construct a design part. These data were analyzed using declarative or procedural performance separately as predictors (univariate), or a combination of declarative or procedural predictors (multivariate). Furthermore, a method to separate the declarative and procedural components from learning curve data is suggested. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
