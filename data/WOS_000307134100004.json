We utilize the unlabeled data to compensate for the complexities in the input space and model the underlying manifold by a nearest neighbor graph. We argue that the optimal graph is a subgraph of the k nearest neighbors (k-NN) graph. Then, we estimate distances in the output space to approximate this subgraph. In addition, we use the underlying manifold of the points in the output space to introduce a novel regularization term which captures the correlation among the output dimensions. The modified graph and the proposed regularization term are utilized for a smooth regression over both the learned input and output manifolds. Experimental results on various human activities demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to the current state of the art methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
