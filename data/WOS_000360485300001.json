This paper proposes a cooperative sensor selection and power-efficient gathering (CSSPEG) strategy in multihop wireless sensor networks to avoid the \"hot spot\" problem. Intracluster communication radiuses have different sizes, in which the clusters closer to the base station have smaller size. Furthermore, intracluster member allocation scheme uses cooperative sensor selection and power-efficient gathering strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed CSSPEG can efficiently balance the energy consumption of cluster heads and prolong the lifetime of the network.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Sensor Selection Optimization and Power-Efficient Gathering for Multihop Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360485300001"}
