By a suitable extension of fast univariate Euclidean division, we obtain theoretical and practical improvements over a direct recursive approach; for a family of special cases, we reach quasi-linear complexity. The main outcome we have in mind is the acceleration of higher-level algorithms, by interfacing our low-level implementation with languages such as AXIOM or MAPLE. We show the potential for huge speed-tips, by comparing two AXIOM implementations of van Hoeij and Monagan's modular GCD algorithm. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
