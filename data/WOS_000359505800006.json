In order to achieve parallelism, one aims to increase the number of simultaneous measurements, such that the effects of decoherence on the resource state are minimised due to the reduction of the time required to run the computation. At the heart of this question is the notion of quantum information flow, which specifies the dependency relations between the measurements in the computations. There exist two well-known techniques for reducing the time required to perform a one-way quantum computation without changing its semantics. The first one, called signal-shifting, transforms the flow of a graph (representing the resource state) within the measurement calculus formalism, whereas the second one, namely finding the maximally-delayed generalised flow, explores the geometry of the graph to increase the number of Operations that can be performed simultaneously. In this paper, we show for the first time how these two techniques relate to each other. We prove that the application of the signal-shifting rules to a measurement pattern with flow results in a generalised flow for the pattern. Then, we prove that in the particular case when the input size equals the output size, the gflow obtained using signal-shifting has the lowest possible depth. As a side result, we construct an O(n(3))-algorithm for finding maximally delayed gflows on graphs with flow. For those graphs, our algorithm is more efficient than the best previously known algorithm for the same task, which takes O(n(4)) operations to complete.", "paper_title": "OPTIMISING THE INFORMATION FLOW OF ONE-WAY QUANTUM COMPUTATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000359505800006"}
