The present paper describes a stereovision based occupant classification system (OCS) within an embedded system, by which triggering of the airbag deployment can be intelligently controlled. The embedded system consists of dual Digital Signal Processors; one is for stereo matching algorithm and the other is for calculating an SVM algorithm for the OCS. Performance was evaluated using our stereo image database. Results suggest that the system is satisfactory as an embedded OCS system.", "paper_title": "A stereovision based advanced airbag system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000071"}
