These modes are mainly concentrated in a narrow domain along the equatorial line of a spheroid and they are famous because of their extremely high quality factor. The scalar Helmholtz equation provides a sufficient accuracy for WGM simulation and (in a contrary to its vector version) is separable in spheroidal coordinates. However, the numerical simulation of 'whispering gallery' phenomena is not straightforward. The separation of variables yields two spheroidal wave ordinary differential equations (ODEs), first only depending on the angular, second on the radial coordinate. Though separated, these equations remain coupled through the separation constant and the eigenfrequency, so that together with the boundary conditions they form a singular self-adjoint two-parameter Sturm-Liouville problem. We discuss an efficient and reliable technique for the numerical solution of this problem which enables calculation of highly localized WGMs inside a spheroid. The presented approach is also applicable to other separable geometries. We illustrate the performance of the method by means of numerical experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
