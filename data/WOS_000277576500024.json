Unlike the nonlinear matrix inequalities (NMIs) condition put forward by the existing results for the same problem, in. this paper, by introducing some new matrix variables, the control synthesis is parameterized in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, the reduced-control law, which is only dependent on the slow variables, is also discussed. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the design procedure less conservative than the existing results.", "paper_title": "ROBUST CONTROL FOR FAST-SAMPLING DISCRETE-TIME FUZZY SINGULARLY PERTURBED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500024"}
