SWOT is criticized mostly for considering only qualitative examination of environmental factors, no priority for various factors and strategies, and no vagueness of the factors under fuzziness. In this paper, fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) integrated with fuzzy AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) is used to develop fuzzy multi-criteria SWOT analysis in order to overcome these shortcomings. Nuclear power plant site selection, which is a strategic and important issue for Turkey's energy policy making, is considered as an application case study that demonstrated the applicability of the developed fuzzy SWOT model.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Multi-Criteria SWOT Analysis: An Application to Nuclear Power Plant Site Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000297795000015"}
