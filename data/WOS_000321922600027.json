This work is intended to rationalize molecular recognition at DNA gyrase B enzyme - inhibitor binding interface through the evaluation of different scoring functions in finding the correct pose and scoring properly 50 Escherichia coli DNA Gyrase B inhibitors belonging to five different classes. Improving the binding free energy calculation accuracy is further attempted by using rescoring schemes after short molecular dynamic simulations of the obtained docked complexes. These data are then compared with the corresponding experimental enzyme activity data. The results are analyzed from a structural point of view emphasizing the strengths and limitations of the techniques applied in the study.", "paper_title": "Thermodynamic computational approach to capture molecular recognition in the binding of different inhibitors to the DNA gyrase B subunit from Escherichia coli", "paper_id": "WOS:000321922600027"}
