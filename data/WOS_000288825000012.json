The performance of the system optimization and monitoring schemes can be improved by spending resources such as time or bandwidth in observing or resolving the values of these parameters. In a resource-constrained situation, deciding which parameters to observe in order to best optimize the expected system performance (or in general, optimize the expected value of a certain objective function) itself becomes an interesting optimization problem. In this article, we initiate the study of such problems that we term \"model-driven optimization\". In particular, we study the problem of optimizing the minimum value in the presence of observable distributions. We show that this problem is NP-HARD, and present greedy algorithms with good performance bounds. The proof of the performance bounds are via novel sub-modularity arguments and connections to covering integer programs.", "paper_title": "How to Probe for an Extreme Value", "paper_id": "WOS:000288825000012"}
