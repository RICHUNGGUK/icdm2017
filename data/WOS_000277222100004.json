The flow field is solved by a quasi-two-dimensional nine-speed (D2Q9) LBE, while the temperature field is solved by another four-speed (D2Q4) LBE. The model is validated by a thermal flow in a pipe and some nontrivial thermal buoyancy-driven flows in vertical cylinders, including Rayleigh-Benard convection, natural convection, and heat transfer of swirling flows. It is found that the numerical results agree excellently with analytical solution or other numerical results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
