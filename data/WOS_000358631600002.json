It is vital to understand how small businesses, like restaurants, use this real-time data to make better-informed business operation decisions in this mobile marketing era. Using data collected from Foursquare, a leading location-based service provider, and Yelp, we aim to find out the predictive power of customer checkins oft business failure of restaurants in New York City by using several predictive modeling techniques, such as Neural Network, Logit model and K-nearest neighbor. Our findings are encouraging. The customer checkin data from both a focal restaurant and its neighbors have shown strong predictive power on business failure. Compared to the baseline model in which we only use business characteristic variables to predict failure, incorporating the checkin data captured from location-based services gives a remarkable improvement on predictive accuracy. Our findings provide the foundation for future studies on the predictive power of information obtained from location-based services on business operations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
