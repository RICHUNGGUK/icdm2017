This study proposes a cascaded classifier-based framework for use in biometric recognition systems. The proposed framework utilises a set of weak classifiers to reduce the enrolled users' dataset to a small list of candidate users. This list is then used by a strong classifier set as the final stage of the cascade to formulate the decision. At each stage, the candidate list is generated by a Mahalanobis distance-based match score quality measure. One of the key features of the authors framework is that each classifier in the ensemble can be designed to use a different modality thus providing the advantages of a truly multimodal biometric recognition system. In addition, it is one of the first truly multimodal cascaded classifier-based approaches for biometric recognition. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated both for single and multimodalities to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "Cascaded multimodal biometric recognition framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000346562300003"}
