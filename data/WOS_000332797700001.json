This model is used for two dimensional (2D) transient hotspot modeling. The results of the diffusive regime are compared with those of the Fourier law as a model of continuum mechanics and an excellent agreement is found in this regime. After the validation of model for the case of Kn = 0.01, it has been used for high-Knudsen number simulations and a test case with Kn = 10 is studied. By increasing the Knudsen number from 0.01 up to 10, the transition from totally diffusive to totally ballistic behavior has been discussed and the wave-feature of heat transport through the solid material has been investigated.", "paper_title": "Transient conduction simulation of a nano-scale hotspot using finite volume lattice Boltzmann method", "paper_id": "WOS:000332797700001"}
