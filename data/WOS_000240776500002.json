This paper examines the high-rate performance of nested lattice quantizers and gives the theoretical performance for general continuous sources. In the quadratic Gaussian case, as the rate increases, we observe an increasing gap between the performance of finite-dimensional nested lattice quantizers and the Wyner-Ziv distortion-rate function. We argue that this is because the boundary gain decreases as the rate of the nested lattice quantizers increases. To increase the boundary gain and ultimately boost the overall performance, a new practical Wyner-Ziv coding scheme called Slepian-Wolf coded nested lattice quantization (SWC-NQ) is proposed, where Slepian-Wolf coding is applied to the quantization indices of the source for the purpose of compression with side information at the decoder. Theoretical analysis shows that for the quadratic Gaussian case and at high rate, SWC-NQ performs the same as conventional entropy-coded lattice quantization with the side information available at both the encoder and the decoder. Furthermore, a nonlinear minimum mean-square error (MSE) estimator is introduced at the decoder, which is theoretically proven to degenerate to the linear minimum MSE estimator at high rate and experimentally shown to outperform the linear estimator at low rate. Practical designs of one- and two-dimensional nested lattice quantizers together with multilevel low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for Slepian-Wolf coding give performance close to the theoretical limits of SWC-NQ.", "paper_title": "Slepian-Wolf coded nested lattice quantization for Wyner-Ziv coding: High-rate performance analysis and code design", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776500002"}
