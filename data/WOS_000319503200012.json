A geometric method based on the differential geometric analysis and Lie group investigation is proposed. The infinitesimal invariance principle in Lie group theory is extended to the case of discrete impulsive nonlinear systems. By characterising the infinitesimal principle in terms of the sequences of codistribution and distribution, explicit criteria for the local observability and local accessibility of the system are derived, respectively. Additionally, two examples are provided to show that the criteria are convenient to check.", "paper_title": "A geometric method for observability and accessibility of discrete impulsive nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000319503200012"}
