The proposed protocol need not be repeated equal BU course whenever the MN moves to foreign link or network, and is able to be executed in environment of not operating the Home Agent (HA), and also easies scalability.", "paper_title": "A new authentication scheme of binding update protocol on handover in mobile IPv6 networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000098"}
