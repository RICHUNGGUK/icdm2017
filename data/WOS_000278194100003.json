In order to characterize the motor imagery related rhythm and higher-order statistics information contained within the EEG signals, a novel feature extraction method based on harmonic wavelet transform and bispectrum is developed and applied to the recognition of right and left motor imageries for developing EEG-based BCI systems. The experimental results on the Graz BCI data set have shown that the separability of the two classes features extracted by the proposed method is notable. Its performance was evaluated by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The recognition accuracy of 90% was obtained. The recognition results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. This method provides an effective way for EEG feature extraction in BCI system.", "paper_title": "FEATURE EXTRACTION OF MOTOR IMAGERY EEG BASED ON WAVELET TRANSFORM AND HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194100003"}
