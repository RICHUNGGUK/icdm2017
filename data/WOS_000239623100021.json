However, this ability is still not developed in any of the RoboCup soccer leagues. We aim at reverting this situation by proposing a gaze direction determination system for robot soccer; the system is designed primarily for the four-legged league, but it could be extended to other leagues. This system is based on a robot-head pose detection system, consisting on two main processing stages: (i) computation of scale-invariant local descriptors of the observed scene, and (ii) matching of these descriptors against descriptors of robot-head prototypes already stored in a model database. After the robot-head pose is detected, the robot gaze direction is determined using a head model of the observed robot, and the current 3D position of the observing robot camera. Experimental results of the proposed approach are presented.", "paper_title": "Gaze direction determination of opponents and teammates in robot soccer", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623100021"}
