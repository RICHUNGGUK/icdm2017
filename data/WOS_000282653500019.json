We introduce a new Realizability semantics we call \"Interactive learning-based Realizability\", for Heyting Arithmetic plus EM1 (Excluded middle axiom restricted to Sigma(0)(1) formulas). Individuals of N evolve with time, and realizers may \"interact\" with them, by influencing their evolution. We build our semantics over Avigad's fixed point result, but the same semantics may be defined over different constructive interpretations of classical arithmetic (Berardi and de' Liguoro use continuations). Our notion of realizability extends intuitionistic realizability and differs from it only in the atomic case: we interpret atomic realizers as \"learning agents\".", "paper_title": "INTERACTIVE LEARNING-BASED REALIZABILITY FOR HEYTING ARITHMETIC WITH EM1", "paper_id": "WOS:000282653500019"}
