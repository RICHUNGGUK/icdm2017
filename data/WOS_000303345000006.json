For the good chaotic dynamical properties of chaotic systems sequence such as randomness and initial sensitivity, chaotic systems have a strong advantage in generating the pseudo-random bit sequence. However, in practical use, the dynamical properties of chaotic systems will be degraded because of the limited calculation accuracy and it even could cause a variety of security issues. To improve the security, in full analyses of the pseudo-random bit generator proposed in our former paper, we point out some problems in our former design and redesign a better pseudo-random bit generator base on it. At the same time, we make some relevant theoretical and experimental analyses on it. The experiments show that the design proposed in this paper has good statistical properties and security features.", "paper_title": "A DESIGN OF PSEUDO-RANDOM BIT GENERATOR BASED ON SINGLE CHAOTIC SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000303345000006"}
