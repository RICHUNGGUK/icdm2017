[2002] introduce an accurate algorithm for evaluating expressions of the form ab + cd in binary floating-point arithmetic, assuming an FMA instruction is available. They show that if p is the precision of the floating-point format and if u = 2(-p), the relative error of the result is of order u. We improve their proof to show that the relative error is bounded by 2u + 7u(2) + 6u(3). Furthermore, by building an example for which the relative error is asymptotically (as p -> infinity or, equivalently, as u -> 0) equivalent to 2u, we show that our error bound is asymptotically optimal.", "paper_title": "On the Error of Computing ab plus cd using Cornea, Harrison and Tang's Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000349832900002"}
