We build a lightweight delay measurement system and present a robust method to calculate the per-packet delay. We show that the method can identify incorrect delays and recover them with a bounded error. Through analysis of delay and other system metrics, we seek to answer the following fundamental questions: What are the spatial and temporal characteristics of delay performance in a real network? What are the most important impacting factors, and is there any practical model to capture those factors? What are the implications to protocol designs? In this paper, we identify important factors from the data trace and show that the important factors are not necessarily the same with those in the Internet. Furthermore, we propose a delay model to capture those factors. We revisit several prevalent protocol designs such as Collection Tree Protocol, opportunistic routing, and Dynamic Switching-based Forwarding and show that our model and analysis are useful to practical protocol designs.", "paper_title": "On the Delay Performance in a Large-Scale Wireless Sensor Network: Measurement, Analysis, and Implications", "paper_id": "WOS:000350342300015"}
