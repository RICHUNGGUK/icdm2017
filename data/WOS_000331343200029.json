The signal-to-leakage-plus-noise-ratio (SLNR) of per-antenna is calculated only using the unknown leakages and the known leakages are cancelled at the transmit side by Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP). The proposed scheme is different from per-user SSLNR. It does not need QR decomposition. The proposed precoding scheme is further improved by ordering antennas. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes exhibit a considerable bit error rate (BER) improvement over conventional SLNR scheme.", "paper_title": "Effective Per-Antenna SSLNR Precoding for MIMO Broadcast Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000331343200029"}
