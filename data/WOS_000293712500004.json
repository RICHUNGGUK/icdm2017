The proposed operating technique greatly simplifies the pixel architecture with only four transistors and two control signals required, while six transistors and four control lines are required by its current-mediated counterpart. The imager achieves fixed pattern noise (FPN) correction during pixel-readout and exhibits a power consumption which is independent of the imager array size, since only a single current source is solicited at any given time due to the array-level operating technique. A linearization circuit technique using the transistor's channel length modulation effect is employed enabling to double the linear range of the pixel's photon-to-output signal transfer function. Performance analysis and experimental results are presented for a 32 x 32 image sensor array prototype, fabricated using AMS 0.35-mu m process. The pixel size is 6.5 x 6.5 mu m(2) with 22% fill-factor. The chip total power consumption is less than 1 mW, at 50 frames/s with a 3.3 V power supply.", "paper_title": "A 4T Low-Power Linear-Output Current-Mediated CMOS Image Sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000293712500004"}
