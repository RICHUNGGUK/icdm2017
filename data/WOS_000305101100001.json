In this paper, the concept of generalized differentiability is described from a new perspective. On the basis of this concept, the class of differentiable fuzzy set-valued mappings is enlarged. The Cauchy problem for fuzzy differential equations is investigated in this enlarged setting. As a result, some new solutions are obtained. The lengths of the support sets of these solutions may be non-monotonic. Several examples are also shown. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
