The top-down methods are usually adopted instead, but they are less accurate because of the so-called error-propagation problem in their classifying phase. To address this problem, this paper proposes a meta-top-down method that employs metaclassification to enhance the normal top-down classifying procedure. The proposed method is first analyzed theoretically on complexity and accuracy, and then applied to five real-world large-scale data sets. The experimental results indicate that the classification accuracy is largely improved, while the increased time costs are smaller than most of the existing approaches.", "paper_title": "A Meta-Top-Down Method for Large-Scale Hierarchical Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000333532100001"}
