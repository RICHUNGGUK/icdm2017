We investigated the behavior of an iris filter at different scales. After iris filter was applied, suspicious regions were segmented by means of an adaptive threshold. Suspected regions were characterized with features based on the iris filter output and, gray level, texture, contour-related, and morphological features extracted from the image. A backpropagation neural network classifier was trained to reduce the number of false positives. The system was developed and evaluated with two completely independent data sets. Results for a test set of 66 malignant and 49 normal cases, evaluated with free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis, yielded a sensitivity of 88% and 94% at 1.02 false positives per image for lesion-based and case-based evaluation, respectively. Results suggest that the proposed method could help radiologists as a second reader in mammographic screening. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
