In order to quantitatively analyze the selective pressure, the concept of selection degree and a simple linear control equation are introduced. We can maintain the diversity of the evolutionary population by controlling the value of the selection degree. Performance of aGA is further enhanced by incorporating local search strategies.", "paper_title": "Affinity genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000244682400003"}
