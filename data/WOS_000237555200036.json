An assumption that each textured or coloured region can be represented by a small template, called the seed, is used. Positioning of the seed across the input image gives many possible sub-segmentations of the image having same texture and colour property as the pixels behind the seed. A probability map constructed during the sub-segmentations helps to assign each pixel to just one most probable region and produce the final pyramid representing various detailed segmentations at each level. Each sub-segmentation is obtained as the min-cut/max-flow in the graph built from the image and the seed. One segment may consist of several isolated parts. Compared to other methods our approach does not need a learning process or a priori information about the textures in the image. Performance of the method is evaluated on images from the Berkeley database.", "paper_title": "Automatic image segmentation by positioning a seed", "paper_id": "WOS:000237555200036"}
