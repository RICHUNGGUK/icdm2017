Moreover, since the DW integrates the information provided by data sources, it is also crucial to take these sources into account throughout the development process to obtain a consistent reconciliation of data sources and information needs. In this paper, we start by summarizing our approach to specify user requirements for data warehouses and to obtain a conceptual multidimensional model capturing these requirements. Then, we make use of the multidimensional normal forms to define a set of Query/View/Transformation (QVT) relations to assure that the conceptual multidimensional model obtained from user requirements agrees with the available data sources that will populate the DW. Thus, we propose a hybrid approach to develop DWs, i.e., we firstly obtain the conceptual multidimensional model of the DW from user requirements and then we verify and enforce its correctness against data sources by using a set of QVT relations based on multidimensional normal forms. Finally, we provide some snapshots of the CASE tool we have used to implement our QVT relations. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
