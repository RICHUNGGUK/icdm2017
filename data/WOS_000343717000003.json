We study the parameterized complexity of -Contraction for three different classes : the class of graphs with maximum degree at most , the class of -regular graphs, and the class of -degenerate graphs. We completely classify the parameterized complexity of all three problems with respect to the parameters , , and . Moreover, we show that -Contraction admits an vertex kernel on connected graphs when , while the problem is -hard when is the class of -degenerate graphs and hence is expected not to admit a kernel at all. In particular, our results imply that -Contraction admits a linear vertex kernel when is the class of cycles.", "paper_title": "Parameterized complexity of three edge contraction problems with degree constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000343717000003"}
