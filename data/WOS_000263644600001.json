The parties involved should control and monitor the conditions of goods in order to ensure their quality for consumers and to comply with all legal requirements. Among environmental parameters during transport, temperature is the most important in prolonging the shelf life of the products. Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is an emergent technology that has proven its suitability for tracking and tracing in logistics. This paper shows how miniaturized RFID temperature loggers can be adapted to analyze the amount of local deviations, detect temperature gradients, and estimate the minimum number of sensors that are necessary for reliable monitoring inside a truck or container. These devices are useful tools for improving the control during the transport chain and detecting weaknesses by identifying specific problem areas where corrective actions are necessitated. In a first step, the RFID tags were tested by studying the temperature distribution in a pallet. Then, 15 shipments from a wholesale company in Germany in compartmented trucks were monitored, covering different temperature range conditions. During transport, several temperature differences were found in the same compartment. Using a factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) the influence of different factors has been studied, such as: the location of the logger, type of truck, and external temperature. The shelf life, or keeping quality model, was applied to the recorded temperature profiles. Suggestions for future research areas are also discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
