Here, we introduce a new, fast zeta transform algorithm that improves the space requirement to only linear in the size of the given set family, while not increasing the time requirement. Thus, for instance, the chromatic or domatic number of an n-vertex graph can be found in time within a polynomial factor of 2(n) and space O(1.442(n)) or O(1.716(n)), respectively. For computing the chromatic polynomial, we further reduce the space requirement to O(1.292(n)). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
