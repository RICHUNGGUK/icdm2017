The proposed Mobile Resource Discovery Protocol (MRDP) uses a distributed dynamic clustering algorithm to adaptively and rapidly group nodes in a MANET for resource discovery purpose, and utilizes DHTs to efficiently cache resource information in a peer-to-peer manner. We provide a probabilistic lower bound on the performance of the MRDP. We also present simulation results under different scenarios to show that MRDP has low message overheads and its performance is highly insensitive to the size of the MANET. These characteristics make MRDP suitable for large-scale MANETs.", "paper_title": "An adaptive low-overhead resource discovery protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286829700010"}
