The proposed RNN identifier is implemented in direct and indirect adaptive control schemes, incorporating a noise rejecting plant output filter and recurrent neural or linear-sliding mode controllers. For sake of comparison, the RNN model is learned both by the backpropagation and by the recursive Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) learning algorithm. The estimated states and parameters of the RNN model are used for direct and indirect adaptive trajectory tracking control. The proposed direct and indirect schemes are applied for real-time control of wastewater treatment bioprocess, where a good, convergence, noise filtering, and low mean squared error of reference tracking is achieved for both learning algorithms, with priority of the L-M one.
