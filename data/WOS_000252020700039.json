Verifiably committed signature is a generalized and unified model for non-interactive optimistic fair exchange scheme. The state-of-the-art verifiably committed signature that enjoys the off-line, setup-free and stand-alone properties is due to Zhu and Bao [1]. In this article, we show that the Zhu-Bao's verifiably committed signature is insecure in the multi-user setting and then consider possible countermeasures.", "paper_title": "Security analysis of Zhu-Bao's verifiably committed signature", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700039"}
