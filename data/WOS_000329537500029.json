The inputs are the assumed temperature-pressure profile of the planetary atmosphere, the continuum absorption coefficients and the absorption crosssections for the trace molecular absorbers present in the model, as well as the fundamental system parameters taken from the published literature. The program then calculates the optical path through the planetary atmosphere of the r,adiation from the host star, and quantifies the absorption due to the modeled composition in a transmission spectrum of transit depth as a function of wavelength. The code is written in C++, parallelized using OpenMP, and is available for public download and use from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/exoplanets/. New version program summary Program title: tau Catalogue identifier: AEPN_v1_1 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEPN_vl_thtml Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 56203 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 1679.104 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++. Computer: Non-specific. Operating system: Linux, Mac. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes RAM: 300 MB Classification: 1.3. External routines: OpenMP (http://openmp.org/wp) Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Calculation of molecular absorption, and hence transit depths, as a function of wavelength for stellar radiation passing through planetary atmospheres. Solution method: Line-by-line calculation of wavelength-dependent optical depths using absorption crosssections for various trace molecular absorbers. Reasons for new version: Bug found in previous version whereby some values, defined as floats, took values too small to be represented by this datatype, and so were set to zero. Summary of revisions: All 'float' datatypes changed to 'double'. Additional comments: The distribution file contains, center dot./doc/: readme and User Guide. center dot./run/: sample input data files center dot\" lout/sample_tau_outputdat: sample output file for run mode '9' (H2O at x = 10(-5) for HD189733b at T-atm = 1500 K).
