Main feature of this system is the use of a low cost Near-Infra-Red (NIR) camera instead of the more expensive infra-red thermal camera for palm image capture. Our preliminary experiments show that useful information from palm-vein and palm-crease texture can be effectively extracted for identity verification using a simple setup to contain the camera.", "paper_title": "Identity verification through palm vein and crease texture", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300073"}
