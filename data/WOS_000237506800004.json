This approach to epistemic logic is very general and is used in several logical frameworks modeling multi-agent systems, but has no interesting logical properties - partly because the standard logical language is too weak to express properties of such structures. In this paper we extend the logical language with a new operator used to represent the proposition that an agent '' knows at most '' a given finite set of formulae and study the problem of strongly complete axiomatization of syntactic structures in this language. Since the logic is not semantically compact, a strongly complete finitary axiomatization is impossible. Instead we present, first, a strongly complete infinitary system, and, second, a strongly complete finitary system for a slightly weaker variant of the language.", "paper_title": "Strongly complete axiomatizations of \"knowing at most\" in syntactic structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000237506800004"}
