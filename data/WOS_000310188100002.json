The solution methodology of the depth-averaged shallow water equations is based upon a Godunov-type upwind finite volume formulation, whereby the inviscid fluxes of the system of equations are obtained using the HLL Riemann solver. A simple yet precise analytical expression is presented to compute hydrostatic flux through an interface of a quadrilateral cell in order to achieve exact balance between flux gradient and bed slope source terms under still water condition. A multidimensional gradient reconstruction procedure and a continuously differentiable multidimensional slope limiter based on a wide computational stencil are proposed to maintain second-order spatial accuracy. The proposed second-order scheme is shown to be more accurate even when distorted grids are used and is therefore more suitable for practical applications. The presented model is verified and validated by solving a wide variety of test cases having analytical solutions and laboratory measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
