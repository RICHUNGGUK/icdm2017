It implements Laplace transform technique to obtain the corresponding time-independent inhomogeneous equation in Laplace space and then employs a truly boundary-only meshless boundary particle method (BPM) to solve this Laplace-transformed problem. Unlike the other boundary discretization methods, the BPM does not require any inner nodes, since the recursive composite multiple reciprocity technique (RC-MRM) is used to convert the inhomogeneous problem into the higher-order homogeneous problem. Finally, the Stehfest numerical inverse Laplace transform (NILT) is implemented to retrieve the numerical solutions of time fractional diffusion equations from the corresponding BPM solutions. In comparison with finite difference discretization, the LTBPM introduces Laplace transform and Stehfest NILT algorithm to deal with time fractional derivative term, which evades costly convolution integral calculation in time fractional derivation approximation and avoids the effect of time step on numerical accuracy and stability. Consequently, it can effectively simulate long time-history fractional diffusion systems. Error analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that the present LTBPM is highly accurate and computationally efficient for 2D and 3D time fractional diffusion equations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
