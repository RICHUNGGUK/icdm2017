Using multimedia services, there are more and more users in end-system over wireless networking environment. H.264/AVC is now the standard for video streaming because of its high compression efficiency, robustness against errors and network-friendly features. However, providing the desired quality of service or improving the transmission efficiency for H.264 video transmissions over wireless networks present numbers of challenges. In this paper, we consider those challenges and survey existing mechanisms based on the protocol layers they work on. Finally, we address some open research issues concerning for H.264 video transmission in wireless networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
