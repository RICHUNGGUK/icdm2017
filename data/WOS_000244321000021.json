In addition to the traditional ways for reducing dispersion, i.e., increasing sampling rate and using higher order degrees of accuracy, a number of schemes have been proposed recently. In this work, an unified methodology for deriving new difference schemes is presented. It is based on certain modifications of the characteristic equation that accompanies any given discretized version of the wave equation. The method is duly compared with existing schemes and verified numerically. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
