Basically, in their method the solutions of all systems of linear crisp equations formed by the a-levels are calculated. We propose a new method for solving systems of linear fuzzy equations based on a practical algorithm using parametric functions in which the variables are given by the fuzzy coefficients of the system. By observing the monotonicity of the parametric functions in each variable, i.e. each fuzzy coefficient in the system, we improve the algorithm by calculating less parametric functions and less evaluations of these parametric functions. We show that our algorithm is much more efficient than the method of Buckley and Qu. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
