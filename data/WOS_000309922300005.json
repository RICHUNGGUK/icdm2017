In this paper, we introduce a novel method in the framework of granular computing that incorporates fuzzy sets, rough sets and shadowed sets, and calculates feature weights automatically. Experiments on synthetic and real data patterns show that our algorithms always converge and are more effective in handling overlapping among clusters and more robust in the presence of noisy data and outliers.", "paper_title": "FEATURE WEIGHTING FUZZY CLUSTERING INTEGRATING ROUGH SETS AND SHADOWED SETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309922300005"}
