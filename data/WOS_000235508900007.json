Then for various DAC waveforms the power spectral density (psd) of the clock jitter at the output of DAC is derived and by using an approximation the in-band power of the clock jitter at the output of the modulator is extracted. The simplicity and generality of the proposed approach are the main advantages of this paper. The MATALB and HSPICE simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed formulas.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the clock jitter effects in a time invariant model of continuous time Delta Sigma modulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508900007"}
