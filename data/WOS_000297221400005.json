It is shown that S has maximum correlation 1+p(n+2e/2) 2, family size p(n), and maximal linear span (m+3)n/2 . When m is even, the proposed family S contains Tang, Udaya, and Fan's construction as a subset. Furthermore, when n is even and e = 1, S has the same correlation and family size, but larger linear span compared with the construction by Seo, Kim, No, and Shin.", "paper_title": "New p-ary sequence family with low correlation and large linear span", "paper_id": "WOS:000297221400005"}
