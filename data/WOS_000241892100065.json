The image is firstly divided into several parts and the color connected areas in the image is computed, then, the primitive co-occurrence matrix of the four color components corresponded with the connected area of each color is extracted. Lastly the image retrieval on the basis of the content is realized by using of the feature similar function which is designed according to these features.", "paper_title": "An image retrieval method on color primitive co-occurrence matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100065"}
