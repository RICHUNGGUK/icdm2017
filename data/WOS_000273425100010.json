At the branching point, the particles move to one of the two branches with equal rate r/2.The phase diagram and density profiles are investigated by using mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that the phase diagram can be classified in to three regions at any value of r. However, a threshold r(c) = 2 - root 2 is identified. In cases of r > r(c) and r < r(c), the phase diagram exhibits qualitatively different phases. The analytical results are in good agreement with the results of Monte Carlo simulations.", "paper_title": "TOTALLY ASYMMETRIC EXCLUSION PROCESSES ON LATTICES WITH A BRANCHING POINT", "paper_id": "WOS:000273425100010"}
