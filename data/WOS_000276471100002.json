We use subtrees of the tectogrammatical tree structures of the Prague dependency treebank to store representations of the MWEs in the dictionary and pre-annotate following occurrences automatically. We also show a way to measure reliability of this type of annotation.", "paper_title": "Annotation of multiword expressions in the Prague dependency treebank", "paper_id": "WOS:000276471100002"}
