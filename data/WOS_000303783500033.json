It mainly aims to efficiently manage inventories at different facilities (for example, warehouses and plants in Supply Chains (SCs)), minimizing the total cost and satisfying the service levels. Some exact inventories management approaches are successfully proposed and applied to different real scenarios, traditionally related to the SCs, even if the extreme versatility of these techniques could make them attractive to new challenging scenarios such as those related to telecommunications networks. Starting from this vision, the focus of this paper is to show the new benefits of applying an adaptive period inventory management policy to a wireless cognitive telecommunication scenario in which radio transmission resources are treated as short-term life time goods which supplies wisely in order to maximize both economic profit and quality of service offered to wireless users. The system behavior is tested using an agent-based simulator and computational results show that introducing this wise control on the bandwidth supplying mechanism guarantees a more reactive and effective telecommunication network, reaching a good compromise between the total profit and the service levels.
