In this paper, a noncoherent multiple symbol detection (MSD) scheme is proposed to enhance the performance of DSTBC-UWB system. After the signal model of DSTBC-UWB is analyzed, the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) MSD is derived and then a suboptimal ML-MSD is obtained by channel approximating. However, exhaustive search based MSD is impractical in DSTBC-UWB systems since its complexity increases exponentially with observation window size. To decrease the computational complexity, the decision-feedback (DF) scheme is introduced to MSD. The resultant DF-MSD yields reasonable complexity and solid performance improvement.", "paper_title": "Decision-feedback multiple symbol detection for differential space-time block coded UWB systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317632400005"}
