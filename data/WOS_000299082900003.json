The DLT includes compact form dynamic linearization, partial form dynamic linearization, and full form dynamic linearization. The main feature of the approach is that the controller design depends only on the measured input/output data of the controlled plant. Analysis and extensive simulations have shown that MFAC guarantees the bounded-input bounded-output stability and the tracking error convergence.", "paper_title": "Data-Driven Model-Free Adaptive Control for a Class of MIMO Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299082900003"}
