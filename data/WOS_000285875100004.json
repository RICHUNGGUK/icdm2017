In this paper, we study the problem of finding the minimum cost service composition (MCSC) for a general service composition request which is represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We first prove that the general case of the MCSC problem is NP-Hard. We then show that optimal solutions can be found in polynomial time for some special structured service composition requests. To this end, we derive a sufficient condition on the service composition request graph and propose corresponding algorithms to find the optimal solutions in polynomial time. Using such algorithms as building blocks, we propose heuristic algorithms to decompose the general service composition request graph into service composition request subgraphs with optimal structures. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic algorithms.", "paper_title": "Minimum cost service composition in service overlay networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285875100004"}
