It is based on a closed loop structure consisting of a feedforward part for reference signal tracking and a feedback part for system stabilization and for disturbance rejection. The feedforward control uses a nonlinear model based reference filter, shaping arbitrary reference signal inputs such that only the safely applicable signals are transferred to the plant. Furthermore, the plant input signals generated are confined to predefined amplitude limits. Thus the new approach allows one to reserve part of the limited input amplitudes for disturbance attenuation and to use only the remaining part for the reference tracking. The reference shaping filter also yields a systematic prevention of the directionality problem. Two examples demonstrate the design procedure and the results achievable.", "paper_title": "Windup prevention for stable and unstable MIMO systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235277200002"}
