This has increased the need to have available the widest possible range of statistical results on products of random variables. In this paper, the exact distributions of alpha X + beta Y, and X/Y are derived when X, and Y follow two of the most applied models in reliability. Computer programs for calculating the associated percentage points are also given.", "paper_title": "Reliability modeling: Linear combination and ratio of exponential and Rayleigh", "paper_id": "WOS:000245372200013"}
