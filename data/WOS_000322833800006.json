Usually, the success of well-known algorithms, such as iterative closest point, highly depends on several assumptions, e.g., the user should provide an initial near-optimal pose of the images to be registered. In the last decade, a new family of registration algorithms based on evolutionary principles has been contributed in order to overcome the latter drawbacks. However, their performance highly depends on carefully tuning (usually by hand) the control parameters of the algorithm, which is an error-prone and a time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a new self-adaptive evolution model to deal with IR problems. To our knowledge, this is the first time a self-adaptive approach has been used for tuning the control parameters of evolutionary algorithms tackling computer vision tasks. Specifically, we introduce a novel design of the proposed self-adaptive approach facing pair-wise range IR problem instances, which is a challenging real-world optimization problem. In addition, several classical approaches, as well as state-of-the-art evolutionary IR methods, have been considered for numerical comparison.", "paper_title": "Self-Adaptive Evolution Toward New Parameter Free Image Registration Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000322833800006"}
