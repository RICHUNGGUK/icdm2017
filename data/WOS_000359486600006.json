The limiting step to max-product inference is the max-convolution problem (sometimes presented in log-transformed form and denoted as \"infimal convolution,\" \"min-convolution,\" or \"convolution on the tropical semiring\"), for which no O(k log(k)) method is currently known. Presented here is an O(k log(k)) numerical method for estimating the max-convolution of two nonnegative vectors (e.g., two probability mass functions), where k is the length of the larger vector. This numerical max-convolution method is then demonstrated by performing fast max-product inference on a convolution tree, a data structure for performing fast inference given information on the sum of n discrete random variables in O(nk log(nk)log(n)) steps (where each random variable has an arbitrary prior distribution on k contiguous possible states). The numerical max-convolution method can be applied to specialized classes of hidden Markov models to reduce the runtime of computing the Viterbi path from nk(2) to nk log(k), and has potential application to the all-pairs shortest paths problem.", "paper_title": "A Fast Numerical Method for Max-Convolution and the Application to Efficient Max-Product Inference in Bayesian Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000359486600006"}
