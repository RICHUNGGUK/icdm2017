They can lead to major performance gains by taking advantage of local characteristics of the specific network. However, these TCP variants could not be automatically chosen according to the lower network environments. In this paper, we propose the ACCF, an adaptive congestion control framework, which can automatically transition among existing congestion control mechanisms according to the change of the network status. Then we perform a simple implementation of ACCF over the networks with high bandwidth-delay product (BDP). It can switch the congestion control approaches between the delay-based ones and the loss-based ones according to the network status. Extensive experiments are conducted based on network simulators as well as over real wired networks on different time periods of the day. For the simulation measures, the experimental results show that the performance of ACCF is significantly improved as compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms in term of throughput, fairness and TCP-friendliness. For the real network tests, the experimental results show that ACCF achieves speedup ratios up to 225.83% compared with average throughput of other TCP congestion control algorithms.
