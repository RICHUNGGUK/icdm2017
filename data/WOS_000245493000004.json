This paper presents a new blind intersymbol decorrelating detector in asynchronous CDMA systems, which uses the cross correlation matrix of the consecutive symbols. The proposed detector is attractive for its simplicity because no channel estimation is required except the synchronization of the desired user. Compared with other reported multiuser detectors, simulation results show that the proposed detector provides a good performance when the active users have significant intersymbol interference and the multipath length is short.", "paper_title": "Intersymbol decorrelating detector for asynchronous CDMA systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000245493000004"}
