We propose a generalized version of Yao's exponentiation algorithm allowing the use of general double-base expansions instead of the popular double base chains. We introduce a class of constrained double base expansions and prove that the average density of non-zero terms in such expansions is O(log k/log log k) for any large integer k. We also propose an efficient algorithm for computing constrained expansions and finally provide a comprehensive comparison to double-base chain expansions, including a large variety of curve shapes and various key sizes.", "paper_title": "Efficient Double Bases for Scalar Multiplication", "paper_id": "WOS:000357929500008"}
