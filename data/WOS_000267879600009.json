Many authenticated group Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocols have been proposed to meet the challenges. However, existing protocols are either limited by the use of public key infrastructure or by their scalability, requiring O(n) rounds. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose an efficient password-based group key agreement protocol resistant to the dictionary attacks by adding password-authentication services to a non-authenticated multi-party key agreement protocol proposed by Horng. The proposed protocol is very efficient since it only requires constant rounds to agree upon a session key, and each user broadcasts a constant number of messages and only requires four exponentiations. Under the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption, we will show the proposed protocol is provably secure in both the ideal-cipher model and the random-oracle model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
