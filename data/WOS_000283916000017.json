E-learning has recently emerged as a potentially effective tool in teaching children social skills, in addition to academic subject matter. Quest for the Golden Rule is one of the first bullying prevention e-learning programs available, designed by the Practi-Quest Corporation, for children in grades 2 - 5. The purpose of the current study was to explore data collected as part of standard program quality assurance practices to evaluate the impact of the gaming modules on how much children learned through interacting with the modules. Sample sizes ranged from 226 to 438 depending on the module: with approximately equal numbers of boys and girls. Following their interactions with each module, children's knowledge of bullying and their identification of strategies to prevent bullying improved significantly. The majority of children reported that they enjoyed the game and felt confident that they could help solve bullying problems. Quest for the Golden Rule is an engaging, effective, and efficient means of raising awareness, fostering positive attitudes, and promoting effective problem-solving for bullying prevention in schools.
