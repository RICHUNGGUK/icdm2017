To manufacture such components, a hybrid layered manufacturing technology was proposed. Since it would be risky and very expensive to make such a physical machine without further study and optimization, manufacturing simulation is adopted to do further research so as to provide the reliable foundation for future practical manufacturing. This paper describes its virtual manufacturing technologies and modeling of the component virtually manufactured. Such a model can be used to evaluate the errors of the virtual manufacturing. Finally, an example of simulating manufacturing process and generating the model of the component virtually manufactured is introduced in more detail. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
