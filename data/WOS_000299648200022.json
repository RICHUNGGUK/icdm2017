This method employs a breadth first traversal linear quadtree to divide the image into nonoverlapping blocks, and then uses logic functions and spectral techniques to encode the blocks. This paper also presents a QLS hiding-compression method to encode a cover image and embed secret data in the cover image during encoding the cover image. The stego image created by the QLS hiding-compression method is quite similar to the cover image.", "paper_title": "A BINARY IMAGE HIDING-COMPRESSION METHOD USING BFT LINEAR QUADTREE AND LOGIC-SPECTRA", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648200022"}
