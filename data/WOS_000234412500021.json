The channel model is assumed to be (transmit) correlated Rayleigh flat-fading with, unequal powers. The SINR can be decomposed into two independent random variables: SINR = SINRZF + T, where SINRZF corresponds to the SINR for a zero-forcing (ZF) receiver and has an exact Gamma distribution. This correspondence focuses on characterizing the statistical properties of T using the results from random matrix theory. First three asymptotic moments of T are derived for uncorrelated channels and channels with equicorrelations. For general correlated channels, some limiting upper bounds for the first three moments are also provided. For uncorrelated channels and correlated channels satisfying certain conditions, it is proved that T converges to a Normal random variable. A Gamma distribution and a generalized Gamma distribution are proposed as approximations to the finite sample distribution of T. Simulations suggest that these approximate distributions can be used to estimate accurately the probability of errors even for very small dimensions (e.g., two transmit antennas).", "paper_title": "On the distribution of SINR for the MMSE MIMO receiver and performance analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000234412500021"}
