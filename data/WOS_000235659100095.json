In the paper, after the gap between theoretic researches and practical applications of workshop scheduling is analyzed, the hierarchical framework of agile manufacturing oriented workshop scheduling and control based on MAS is put forward. According to practical application requirements, traditional Petri net is expanded and RCPN is put forward to model workshop activities. Then, the architecture of workshop scheduling system based on RCPN is presented. Finally, the scheduling system that adopts 3-layer B/S/D mode is developed on Internet/Intranet by using Web database and Java The application of the system developed has been used at machine tool large parts workshop of Shaanxi Qinchuan Machinery Development Co., Ltd and the system has been proved to be effective.", "paper_title": "Dynamic workshop scheduling and control based on a rule-restrained colored Petri net and system development adopting extended B/S/D mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100095"}
