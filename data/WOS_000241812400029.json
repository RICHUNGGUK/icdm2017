This is the goal of the MD2 method presented in this paper. We propose the MD2 model to describe didactic materials requirements like its contents, pedagogical, technical and quality features. The rationale is to use some of those descriptors to provide mapping from high level technical descriptions of learning technology standards to simpler and closer descriptions to practitioners about material requirements. Those model mappings are used as foundation of MD2 creation method, and we show how they can guide the selection and composition phases of creation. By other side, another set of MD2 descriptors are used in the evaluation phase to control the usability and quality of the obtained material. A log of the whole process including the values of all model elements and the material's design rationales will be stored as extended semantic annotation. Thus, important proper-ties of the created material like its interoperability, accessibility and reusability will be ensured.", "paper_title": "MD2 method: The didactic materials creation from a model based perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000241812400029"}
