While most existing approaches are based on ray-tracing, we present an alternative approach by emulating multi-perspective rasterization on the classical perspective graphics pipeline. To render a general multi-perspective camera, we first decompose the camera into piecewise linear primitive cameras called the general linear cameras or GLCs. We derive the closed-form projection equations for GLCs and show how to rasterize triangles onto GLCs via a two-pass rendering algorithm. In the first pass, we compute the GLC projection coefficients of each scene triangle using a vertex shader. The linear raster on the graphics hardware then interpolates these coefficients at each pixel. Finally, we use these interpolated coefficients to compute the projected pixel coordinates using a fragment shader. In the second pass, we move the pixels to their actual projected positions. To avoid holes, we treat neighboring pixels as triangles and re-render them onto the GLC image plane. We demonstrate our real-time multi-perspective rendering framework in a wide range of applications including synthesizing panoramic and omnidirectional views, rendering reflections on curved mirrors, and creating multi-perspective faux animations. Compared with the GPU-based ray tracing methods, our rasterization approach scales better with scene complexity and it can render scenes with a large number of triangles at interactive frame rates.", "paper_title": "Towards multi-perspective rasterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000265539300019"}
