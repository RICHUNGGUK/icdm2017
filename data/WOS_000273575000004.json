Exploiting a unified MIMO transmission scheme that can adapt with various channel conditions is well motivated both in theory and practical applications. An eigen-mode based closed-loop MIMO transmission over frequency selective fading MIMO channels, which considers receive correlation, transmit correlation and line of sight (LOS) components, is investigated by maximizing the upper bound of channel capacity under the assumption that the channel is partially known at the transmitter and perfectly known at the receiver. Based on the eigen-mode transmission, several key techniques including linear precoding, stream selection, virtual spatial hopping and online capacity estimation are proposed, and a unified MIMO transmission scheme is established. Both computer simulation and field test results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the spectral efficiency and link reliability under various channel conditions.", "paper_title": "Unifying eigen-mode MIMO transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000273575000004"}
