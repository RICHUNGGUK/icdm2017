In this paper, we propose a power-efficient Quality of Service (QoS) routing scheme for multiple many-to-many multicast requests with given static traffic demands in green multi-granularity transport networks, which comprehensively considers both the IP and the optical layers. A chosen probability model is devised to describe the probability of a link being selected when routing, and a heuristic routing algorithm is proposed to construct multiple many-to-many multicast trees in order to decrease power consumption, enhance QoS evaluation and improve resource utilization evaluation under QoS and capacity constraints. Results from simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme is more power-efficient with higher QoS evaluation and better resource utilization compared with others.
