Via this scheme, the linear photon-like dispersion relation is achievable, which could be employed to perform a perfect quantum state transfer. Numerical results show that when applying two lasers in each cavity, the fidelity is higher than the highest fidelity of a classical transfer even for the transfer distance l increases up to 100 sites. In the simulation, as the number of lasers increases, the fidelity will be evidently enhanced for a wide range of l.", "paper_title": "THE PHOTON-LIKE FLYING QUBIT IN THE COUPLED CAVITY ARRAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000304611000002"}
