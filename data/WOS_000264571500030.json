In this article, we survey recent progress in list decoding that has led to efficient error-correction schemes with an optimal amount of redundancy, even against worst-case errors caused by a potentially malicious channel. To correct a proportion rho (say 20%) of worst-case errors, these codes only need close to a proportion r of redundant symbols. The redundancy cannot possibly be any lower information theoretically. This new method holds the promise of correcting a factor of two more errors compared to the conventional algorithms currently in use in diverse everyday applications.", "paper_title": "Error Correction up to the Information-Theoretic Limit", "paper_id": "WOS:000264571500030"}
