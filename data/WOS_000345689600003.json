To overcome these problems, this study proposes a generalization of the multiple-point Metropolis algorithm, which proceeds by generating multiple-dependent proposals and then by selecting a candidate among the set of proposals on the basis of weights that can be chosen arbitrarily. The performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by using both simulated and real data.", "paper_title": "Generalized multiple-point Metropolis algorithms for approximate Bayesian computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000345689600003"}
