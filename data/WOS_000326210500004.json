Sensor noise was gradually increased in selected low-level physical sensors of DURESS a representative thermal-hydraulic process simulation. There are two important findings. First, participants in the EID condition achieved target goals significantly faster across all magnitudes of sensor noise. Second, participants in the EID condition exhibited more stable control; experiencing fewer and shorter oscillations around the target goals. This is the first study to empirically investigate the impact of the presence and magnitude of sensor noise on the robustness and effectiveness of an EID interface. These findings are important if EID is to be applied in industrial settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
