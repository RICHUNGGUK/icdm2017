Recently, studies have been conducted to develop methods and algorithms for health surveillance and disease detection. This paper attempts to review recent research on temporal and spatiotemporal surveillance methods. We have addressed specific challenges and research gaps in the relevant research. Lastly, we discuss a comparative example using a dataset of male thyroid cancer cases in New Mexico.", "paper_title": "Recent Research and Developments in Temporal and Spatiotemporal Surveillance for Public Health", "paper_id": "WOS:000287861400007"}
