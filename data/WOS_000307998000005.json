To this end we show that while running a Mirror Descent Stochastic Approximation procedure one can compute, with a small additional effort, lower and upper statistical bounds for the optimal objective value. We demonstrate that for a certain class of convex stochastic programs these bounds are comparable in quality with similar bounds computed by the sample average approximation method, while their computational cost is considerably smaller.", "paper_title": "Validation analysis of mirror descent stochastic approximation method", "paper_id": "WOS:000307998000005"}
