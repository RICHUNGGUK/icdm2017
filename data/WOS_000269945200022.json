Based on geometrical frame of parallel robots, the highly nonlinear equations of system states estimation are obtained using analytical approach. GNRMD algorithms modified from Global Newton-Raphson method are developed to solve the nonlinear equations in real-time application. The procedure of GNRMD algorithms are programmed in MATLAB/Simulink, and then compiled to a real-time PC with Microsoft Visual Studio.NET for implementation. Applying the proposed algorithms. the real-time spatial 6-DOF states of the parallel robots are estimated. In addition, the performances, accuracy, convergence, property of real-time and effectiveness, of the proposed method are analyzed and verified in experiment and theory. Furthermore, the presented algorithms are used in a DOF control scheme of parallel robots. Simulation and experimental results show the proposed algorithms are effective and feasible for spatial states estimation of parallel robots, and are suitable for a real-time control system required accurate feedback of system states.
