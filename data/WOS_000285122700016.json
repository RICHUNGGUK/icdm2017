It is then required to set up an appropriate initial condition to start the calculation. Like in some previous works, we study the far wake of a sphere in a stratified fluid, but rather than starting from an ad hoc initial condition, we first carry out a spatial development simulation in order to define a relevant initialization. The control parameters of the flow are the Prandtl, Reynolds and internal Froude numbers, that we take equal to Pr=7, Re = 10,000 and F = 25. The numerical method is based on a spectral multi-domain Fourier-Chebyshev approximation, stabilized by using a spectral vanishing viscosity technique, that may be interpreted as a spectral large-eddy simulation closure restricted to the high frequencies. Very realistic results are obtained, especially showing the so-called three-dimensional (3D), non-equilibrium (NEQ) and quasi two-dimensional (Q2D) regimes, with satisfactory comparisons with the experiments.
