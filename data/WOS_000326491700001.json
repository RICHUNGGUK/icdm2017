In the frame of Cartesian grid, one often uses finite volume method with second order accuracy or finite difference method. In this paper, an h-adaptive Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method on Cartesian grid with ghost cell immersed boundary method for arbitrarily complex geometries is developed. A ghost cell immersed boundary treatment with the modification of normal velocity is presented. The method is validated versus well documented test problems involving both steady and unsteady compressible flows through complex bodies over a wide range of Mach numbers. The numerical results show that the present boundary treatment to some extent reduces the error of entropy and demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and versatility of the proposed approach.
