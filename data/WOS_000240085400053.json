In this method, we first employ independent component analysis (ICA) to model the gene expression data, then apply optimal scoring algorithm to classify them. To show the validity of the proposed method, we apply it to classify two DNA microarray data sets involving various human normal and tumor tissue samples. The experimental results show that the method is efficient and feasible.", "paper_title": "Penalized independent component discriminant method for tumor classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400053"}
