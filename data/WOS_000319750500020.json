It is important to find an effective experimental design of ALT with the consideration of certain optimality criteria. In this paper, we discuss a new approach to designing ALT test plans when readout data (i.e., interval censoring) are collected. We utilize the proportional hazard (PH) model for a failure time distribution, and formulate a generalized linear model (GLM) for censored data. The optimal design is obtained such that the prediction variance of the expected product lifetime at the product's use condition is minimized.", "paper_title": "A Novel Approach to Optimal Accelerated Life Test Planning With Interval Censoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000319750500020"}
