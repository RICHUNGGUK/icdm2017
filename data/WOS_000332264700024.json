As test problems it was chosen the leapfrogging and head-on collision of two vortex rings for which a well documented visualization exists in the literature. Our aim was to show the great potential of the VIC method for solution of 3D flow problems and that it is very well suited for parallel computation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
