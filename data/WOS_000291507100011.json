With rare exception, all of the work to date assumes low variation in appearance, which limits them to a single depictive style usually photographic. The same object depicted in other styles - as a drawing, perhaps - cannot be identified reliably. Yet humans are able to name the object no matter how it is depicted, and even recognize a real object having previously seen only a drawing. This paper describes a classifier which is unique in being able to learn class identity no matter how the class instances are depicted. The key to this is our proposition that topological structure is a class invariant. Practically, we depend on spectral graph analysis of a hierarchical description of an image to construct a feature vector of fixed dimension. Hence structure is transformed to a feature vector, which can be classified using standard methods. We demonstrate the classifier on several diverse classes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
