However, this traditional approach may not well capture the main parts of complex models, and may even produce poor results for applications such as animation. Instead, we approximate model topology through a target feature size omega, where undesired features smaller than omega are smoothed, and features larger than omega are retained into groups called bones. This relaxed feature-varying strategy allows applications to generate robust and meaningful results without requiring additional parameter tuning, even for damaged, noisy, complex, or high genus models.", "paper_title": "Feature-varying skeletonization Intuitive control over the target feature size and output skeleton topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000304411500025"}
