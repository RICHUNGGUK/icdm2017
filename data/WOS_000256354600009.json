Interactions among brain regions are expressed by a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) while contextual dependencies within functional images are formulated by a Markov random field. The approach simultaneously considers both the detection of brain activation and the estimation of effective connectivity and does not require a priori model of connectivity. Experimental results show that the present approach outperforms earlier fMRI analysis techniques on synthetic functional images and robustly derives brain connectivity from real fMRI data.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic framework for brain connectivity from functional MR images", "paper_id": "WOS:000256354600009"}
