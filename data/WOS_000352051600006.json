Due to the widespread use of information and communication technologies, many of these services may be delivered online by means of service value networks. To automate this delivery, however, issues such as composition, integration, and operationalization need to be addressed. In this paper, the authors share their long-term vision on composition of service value networks and describe relationships with fields such as cloud computing and enterprise computing. As a demonstration of the state of the art, capabilities and limitations of e(3)-service are described and research challenges are defined.", "paper_title": "e(3) service: A Critical Reflection and Future Research", "paper_id": "WOS:000352051600006"}
