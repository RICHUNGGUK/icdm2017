However, students only login to the assisted learning system once or twice a week on average to surf for relevant references, participate in discussions, or hand in assignments, even though information and interaction are greatly enhanced by these online services. Therefore, increasing the transfer rate of useful information and interaction during the course period would help students learn. To this end, we designed an e-news delivery system that sends personalized e-mails to every student's mailbox to make information access and peer interaction more convenient and efficient. Through the daily habit of using e-mail, students can receive the latest information, new instructions or peer discussions early. To encourage usage of the system, a user friendly interface was designed. The e-news system takes advantage of webpage hyperlinks to allow students to click on interesting topics while reading e-news; doing so will cause another window to pop-up with detailed content retrieved from the web-based learning system. A mouse-click allows students to login to the web-based learning system and extract the details of the chosen topic. To enhance the efficiency of e-news, learners' needs and interests were taken into consideration when forming the e-news content. Students' learning status and reading preferences are assessed to determine which information or content to include in the e-news. Experiment results reveal that c-news and personalized information greatly promote the reading of new information and participation in online activities. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
