In this paper, we present experimental results for four new algorithms based on the Classic 3D-WT. The proposed algorithms are capable of obtaining the wavelet coefficients after the spatial and, mainly, the temporal decomposition processes, reducing most redundancies in the video sequence and getting lower entropy values than the Classic algorithm. The new algorithms are based on the Temporal-Window method for carrying out the temporal decomposition. We have conducted a set of experimental evaluations for a representative data set of a modality of intrinsically volumetric medical imaging: angiography sequences.", "paper_title": "Entropy improvement by the Temporal-Window method for alternating and non-alternating 3D wavelet transform over angiographies", "paper_id": "WOS:000251097800016"}
