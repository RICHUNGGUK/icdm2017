This paper describes an approach and a case study to balancing uncertainties of context in the very early project stages, when an ERP adopter initiates a request-for-proposal process and when alternative bids are to be compared for the purpose of choosing an implementation partner. The proposed empirical approach leverages the complementary application of three techniques, an algorithmic estimation model, Monte Carlo simulation, and portfolio management. Our case study findings show how the ability of our approach to model uncertainty allows practitioners to address the challenging question of how to adjust project context factors so that chances of project success are increased. We also include a discussion on the implications of our approach for practice as well as on the possible validity threats and what the practitioner could do to counterpart them.
