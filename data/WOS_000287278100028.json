This research designed a portable anemometer that can display two-dimensional direction and data as well as measure small instantaneous variations in small wind speed using a wireless sensors network. The research principle is to use Negative high-voltage free air molecules to form different equipotential fields, which will offset as they are affected by wind. The voltage differences are measured using sensing bars of four terminals indicating wind speed and wind direction. The sensors can sense air convention, gas emissions and gas leakage in wide range of applications such as aerospace, energy and food, biochemical laboratory, hospital isolation room, office, storage facilities, mine field, tunnel and vehicles. In the future, integrated electric circuits can be designed into the IC for application in MEMS to make measurements without external high voltage. This can allow measurements for micro-surgery and measure the airflow in and around body organs.", "paper_title": "A LIGHT WIND SPEED MEASUREMENT SYSTEM DESIGN TO STRENGTHEN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287278100028"}
