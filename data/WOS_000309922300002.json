The drawback of missing data techniques is the vulnerability of the recognizer to errors in the reliability mask. This work proposes a novel group selection algorithm to perform top-down refinement of initial bottom-up reliability mask estimates with the goal of removing these errors. A novel probabilistic decision process based on normalized likelihood distances is proposed and used to evaluate the quality of a reliability mask without any a priori noise knowledge. Experimental results on a speaker identification task illustrate the ability of the combined bottom-up top-down system to significantly outperform traditional bottom-up only missing data techniques for various types of mask corruption.", "paper_title": "ITERATIVE GROUP SELECTION-BASED ENHANCEMENT OF TIME-FREQUENCY MASKS FOR MISSING DATA RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000309922300002"}
