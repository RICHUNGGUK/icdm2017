In addition, the capacity of the video servers can quickly become a bottleneck. One solution to alleviate the load on servers is to use peer-to-peer (P2P) technology. In this paper, we propose a conditional access mechanism to protect the copyright in P2P IPTV service. It enables large-scale distribution of copyrighted video using P2P streaming technology. The security and efficiency of IPTV service can be guaranteed in our design.", "paper_title": "A design of IPTV conditional access mechanism based on P2P network", "paper_id": "WOS:000330475700003"}
