The receiver equalizes the channel prior to the dispreading and then performs two successive soft-output decisions, achieved by a soft-input soft-output (SISO) multi-code detector and a SISO turbo decoder through an iterative process. At each iteration, extrinsic information is extracted from detection and decoding stages and is then used as a priori information in the next iteration, just as in turbo decoding. Computer simulations show that the turbo iterative receiver structure with chip equalization offers significant performance gain over the traditional receiver structure.", "paper_title": "Turbo iterative equalization for HSDPA systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000245639600009"}
