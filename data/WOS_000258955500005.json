Placing different marks in different copies uniquely identifies the recipient of each copy, and therefore allows tracing of the source of an unauthorised redistribution. A widely used approach to the fingerprinting problem is the use of error correcting codes with a suitable large minimum distance. With this approach, the set of embedded marks in a given copy is precisely a code word of the error Correcting code. We present two different approaches that use side information for the tracing process. The first approach deals uses the Guruswami-Sudan errors-and-erasures list decoding algorithm whereas the second approach shows the use of a full side information matrix.", "paper_title": "Tracing illegal redistribution using errors-and-erasures and side information decoding algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000258955500005"}
