It is also desirable that the underlying algebra be familiar, and provide a close modelling of those phenomena. The fundamental problem addressed in this paper is that, since computers do not support real-number arithmetic, the algebraic behaviour of the representation may not be correct, and cannot directly model a mathematical abstraction of space based on real numbers. This paper describes a basis for the robust geometrical construction of spatial objects in computer applications using a complex called the \"Regular Polytope\". In contrast to most other spatial data types, this definition supports a rigorous logic within a finite digital arithmetic. The definition of connectivity proves to be non-trivial, and alternatives are investigated. It is shown that these alternatives satisfy the relations of a region connection calculus (RCC) as used for qualitative spatial reasoning, and thus introduce the rigor of that reasoning to geographical information systems. They also form what can reasonably be termed a \"Finite Boolean Connection Algebra\". The rigorous and closed nature of the algebra ensures that these primitive functions and predicates can be combined to any desired level of complexity, and thus provide a useful toolkit for data retrieval and analysis. The paper argues for a model with two and three-dimensional objects that have been coded in Java and which implement a full set of topological and connectivity functions which is shown to be complete and rigorous.", "paper_title": "Connectivity in the regular polytope representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000288219800001"}
