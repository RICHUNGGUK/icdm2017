However, it has been traditionally difficult to afford theoretical and experimental researches to this problem. The numerical methodology based on the penalty finite element method with a decoupled algorithm is presented in the study to simulate three-dimensional extrusion swelling of viscoelastic fluids flowing through out of a circular die. The rheological responses of viscoelastic fluids are described by using three kinds of differential constitutive models including the Phan-Thien Tanner model, the Giesekus model, and the finite extensible nonlinear elastic dumbbell with a Peterlin closure approximation model. A streamface-streamline method is introduced to adjust the swelling free surface. The calculation stability is improved by using the discrete elastic-viscous split stress algorithm with the inconsistent streamline-upwind scheme. The essential flow characteristics of viscoelastic fluids are predicted by using the proposed numerical method, and the mechanism of swelling phenomenon is further discussed.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Modeling and simulation of three-dimensional extrusion swelling of viscoelastic fluids with PTT, Giesekus and FENE-P constitutive models", "paper_id": "WOS:000319875700002"}
