The existing bridge scour equation from HEC-18 was developed from laboratory experiments in relatively small scale. Field studies by Mueller [Mueller D, Wagner Chad R. Analysis of pier scour predictions and real-time field measurements. In: Proceedings of ICSF-1 first international conference on scour of foundations, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA; 20021 indicate that it is difficult to verify the scour equation with field data obtained from large bridge piers. In this study, computational model simulations using a 3D CFD model were conducted to examine scale effects on turbulent flow and sediment scour. For the large-scale model, the physical scale and boundary velocity were set up from the small scale model based on the Froude similarity law. Results of flow and sediment scour were obtained from two different approaches: (a) Froude similarity which is commonly used in physical modeling and (b) full scale 3D CFD modeling. Unlike physical modeling in which the effect of turbulent Reynolds number is ignored, the CFD model employs a 2nd order turbulent model to calculate turbulent velocity and sediment scour. Effects of scale on turbulence flow and sediment scour were investigated by comparing different results obtained from a full scale numerical model to those derived from the Froude similarity method.
