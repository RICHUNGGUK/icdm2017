In this paper, we propose a two-stage data hiding method with high capacity and good visual quality based on image interpolation and histogram modification techniques. At the first stage, we first generate a high-quality cover image using the developed enhanced neighbor mean interpolation and then take the difference values from input and cover pixels as a carrier to embed secret data. In this stage, our proposed scheme raises the image quality a lot due to the ENMI method. At the second stage, a histogram modification method is applied on the difference image to further increase the embedding capacity and preserve the image quality without distortion. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method have better PSNR value of stego-image with improving 43 % on the average when compared the past key-studies.", "paper_title": "Image interpolating based data hiding in conjunction with pixel-shifting of histogram", "paper_id": "WOS:000326461100029"}
