The results suggest that different service satisfaction and switching barriers are strong antecedents of p-loyalty; the moderating effect of switching barriers on the relationship between satisfactions and p-loyalty is contingent on the portal users' usage patterns.", "paper_title": "A Study of Online Portal Users' Loyalty From Core Service, Additional Value-added Service and Switching Barriers Perspectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000353144800005"}
