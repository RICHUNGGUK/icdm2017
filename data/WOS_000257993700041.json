Given these advantages, it is not surprising that business and educational institutions are making substantial investments in e-learning systems. In military, the military scenario is a tool or environment that supports the classroom training in collaborative decision-making and problem solving. It offers a method to train officers by simulating battlefield situations to analyze situations, generate plans, make decision, and acquire knowledge and experience from the scenario training procedure. This article is an example on implementing a military e-training system on military training institute in the Taiwanese Military. For this, this paper proposes a knowledge-based system architecture that incorporates the functions of military training materials, scenario case base, database, and geographical information systems (GIS) in terms of integrating web-based and collaborative problem solving methods in military collaborative scenario training. A scenario case is presented as an example of system implementation and some issue discussion are also described. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
