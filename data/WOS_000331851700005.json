This paper proposes a parallelized ELM ensemble based on the Min-Max Modular network (M-3-network) to meet the challenge of the so-called big data. The proposed M-3-ELM first decomposes classification problems into smaller subproblems, then trains an ELM for each subproblem, and in the end ensembles these ELMs with the M-3-network. Twelve data sets including both benchmarks and real-world applications are employed to test the proposed method. The experimental results show that M-3-ELM not only speeds up the training phrases by 1.6-4.6 times but also reduces the test errors by 0.37-19.51% compared with the normal ELM. The results also indicate that M-3-ELM possesses scalability on large-scale tasks and accuracy improvement on imbalanced tasks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
