It becomes more and more important to model and analyse collaboration business processes to guarantee their correctness and consistence. Among various formal methods, Petri nets have become one of the major formal methods due to its strong mathematical foundation, rich analysis techniques and graphical representations. Pi calculus, a branch of process algebra, has been proved to be more capable in modelling interactions and mobility. In this paper, we introduce a mapping model between these two formal methods, which integrates the local flow model of Petri nets and the interaction model of Pi calculus to describe collaboration business processes. The state graphs of Petri nets and Pi calculus are combined together to analyse the structure soundness of the unified model. A collaborative reduction tool is developed to support the unified modelling and analysis method.", "paper_title": "Unified modelling and analysis of collaboration business process based on Petri nets and Pi calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000282144900001"}
