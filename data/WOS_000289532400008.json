Current systems, which are designed for documents including modern language, use some form of approximate search in a given background lexicon. Due to the large amount of spelling variation found in historical documents, special lexica for historical language can only offer restricted coverage. Hence historical language is often described in terms of a matching procedure to be applied to modern words. Given such a procedure and a base lexicon of modern words, the question arises of how to generate correction suggestions for garbled historical variants. In this paper we suggest an efficient algorithm that solves this problem. The algorithm is used for postcorrection of optical character recognition results on historical document collections.", "paper_title": "Efficiently generating correction suggestions for garbled tokens of historical language", "paper_id": "WOS:000289532400008"}
