Enterprise architecture analysis concerns using enterprise architecture models for analysis of selected properties to provide decision support. This paper presents a framework based on the ArchiMate metamodel for the assessment of four properties, viz., application usage, system availability, service response time and data accuracy. The framework integrates four existing metamodels into one and implements these in a tool for enterprise architecture analysis. The paper presents the overall metamodel and four viewpoints, one for each property. The underlying theory and formalization of the four viewpoints is presented. In addition to the tool implementation, a running example as well as guidelines for usage makes the viewpoints easily applicable.", "paper_title": "An enterprise architecture framework for multi-attribute information systems analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000338502600010"}
