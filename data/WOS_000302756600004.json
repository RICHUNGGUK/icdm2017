In this paper, several objective measures are proposed and tested as correlates of subjective intelligibility. More specifically, the kurtosis of the linear prediction residual is proposed as a measure of vocal source excitation oddity. Additionally, temporal perturbations resultant from imprecise articulation and atypical speech rates are characterized by short- and long-term temporal dynamics measures, which in turn, are based on log-energy dynamics and on an auditory-inspired modulation spectral signal representation, respectively. Motivated by recent insights in the communication disorders literature, a composite measure is developed based on linearly combining a salient subset of the proposed measures with conventional prosodic parameters. Experiments with the publicly-available 'Universal Access' database of spastic dysarthric speech (10 patient speakers; 300 words spoken in isolation, per speaker) show that the proposed composite measure can achieve correlation with subjective intelligibility ratings as high as 0.97; thus the measure can serve as an accurate indicator of dysarthric speech intelligibility.
