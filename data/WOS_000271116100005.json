The new model is based on the technique of the higher-order moment of-equilibrium distribution functions and a series of lattice Boltzmann equations in different time scales. The forms of moments are derived from the binary wave equation by designing the higher-order dissipation and dispersion terms. The numerical results agree well with classical ones.
