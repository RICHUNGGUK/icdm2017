More generally, for an input graph G=(V,E) and an activity >0, we are interested in the quantity ZG() defined as the sum over independent sets I weighted as w(I)=|I|. In statistical physics, ZG() is the partition function for the hard-core model, which is an idealized model of a gas where the particles have non-negligible size. Recently, an interesting phase transition was shown to occur for the complexity of approximating the partition function. Weitz showed an FPAS for the partition function for any graph of maximum degree when is constant and <c(T):=(-1)-1/(-2). The quantity c(T) is the critical point for the so-called uniqueness threshold on the infinite, regular tree of degree . On the other side, Sly proved that there does not exist efficient (randomized) approximation algorithms for c(T)<<c(T)+epsilon(), unless NP=RP, for some function epsilon()>0. We remove the upper bound in the assumptions of Sly's result for 4,5, that is, we show that there does not exist efficient randomized approximation algorithms for all >c(T) for =3 and 6. Sly's inapproximability result uses a clever reduction, combined with a second-moment analysis of Mossel, Weitz and Wormald which prove torpid mixing of the Glauber dynamics for sampling from the associated Gibbs distribution on almost every regular graph of degree for the same range of as in Sly's result. We extend Sly's result by improving upon the technical work of Mossel et al., via a more detailed analysis of independent sets in random regular graphs. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
