Elucidating closely related miRNAs and mRNAs can be an essential first step towards the discovery of their combinatorial effects on different cellular states. Here, we propose a probabilistic learning method to identify synergistic miRNAs involving regulation of their condition-specific target genes (mRNAs) from multiple information sources, i.e. computationally predicted target genes of miRNAs and their respective expression profiles. Results: We used data sets consisting of miRNA-target gene binding information and expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs on human cancer samples. Our method allowed us to detect functionally correlated miRNA-mRNA modules involved in specific biological processes from multiple data sources by using a balanced fitness function and efficient searching over multiple populations. The proposed algorithm found two miRNA-mRNA modules, highly correlated with respect to their expression and biological function. Moreover, the mRNAs; included in the same module showed much higher correlations when the related miRNAs were highly expressed, demonstrating our method's ability for finding coherent miRNA-mRNA modules. Most members of these modules have been reported to be closely related with cancer. Consequently, our method can provide a primary source of miRNA and target sets presumed to constitute closely related parts of gene regulatory pathways.", "paper_title": "Discovery of microRNA-mRNA modules via population-based probabilistic learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000246773300013"}
