A clonal selection algorithm (CSA) is introduced for the first time in the literature to select optimal input features and RBF kernel parameters. CSA is shown to be capable of improving the speed and accuracy of classification systems by removing redundant and potentially confusing input features, and of optimizing the kernel parameters simultaneously. Simulation results on practice data demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Diagnosis of incipient fault of power transformers using SVM with clonal selection algorithms optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800065"}
