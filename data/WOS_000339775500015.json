In this work, no-slip boundary condition is directly used to modify velocities at boundary-dependent points through the second-order Lagrange interpolation. As a consequence, flow penetration is avoided and more accurate results are acquired. The boundary-dependent points can be easily identified from intersection points between Cartesian mesh lines and the immersed boundary. Another important contribution of this work is to use Newton's second law to compute forcing terms at the boundary-dependent points. Due to presence of the solid boundary, velocity change between pre-modified velocity and post-modified velocity will generate acceleration. This acceleration can be used to compute force given from the boundary. Numerical experiments show that present solver has the second-order of overall accuracy. To validate the present method, three-dimensional (3D) incompressible viscous flow over a sphere is first simulated. Then simulations of complicated 3D moving boundary flows are conducted. Numerical results show that the flow penetration of conventional IB-LBM is completely eliminated, and the results obtained agree very well with available data in the literature.
