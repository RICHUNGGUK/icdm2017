For (i.e. for maximum bisection), the new bound is at least as strong as a well-known bound by Poljak and Rendl (SIAM J Optim 5(3):467-487, 1995). For the new bound dominates a bound of Karisch and Rendl (Topics in semidefinite and interior-point methods, 1998). The new bound is derived from a recent semidefinite programming bound by De Klerk and Sotirov for the more general quadratic assignment problem, but only requires the solution of a much smaller semidefinite program.", "paper_title": "On semidefinite programming relaxations of maximum k-section", "paper_id": "WOS:000311675700003"}
