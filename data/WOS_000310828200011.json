We have proposed a novel machine learning method that hybridizes support vector machine (SVM) and simulated annealing (SA). Simulated annealing is a stochastic method currently in wide use for difficult optimization problems. Intensively explored support vector machine due to its several unique advantages is successfully verified as a predicting method in recent years. We take the dataset used in our study from the UCI machine learning database. The classification accuracy is obtained via 10-fold cross validation. The obtained classification accuracy of our method is 96.25% and it is very promising with regard to the other classification methods in the literature for this problem.
