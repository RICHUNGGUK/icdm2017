As many other distributed networks, routing operations assume a crucial importance in system optimization, especially when considering dense urban areas, where interference effects cannot be neglected. In this paper a new routing protocol for VANETs and a new scheme of multichannel management are proposed. In particular, an interference-aware routing scheme, for multiradio vehicular networks, wherein each node is equipped with a multichannel radio interface is investigated. NS-2 has been used to validate the proposed Multiobjective routing protocol (MO-RP) protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, end-to-end delay, and overhead.", "paper_title": "Routing Optimization in Vehicular Networks: A New Approach Based on Multiobjective Metrics and Minimum Spanning Tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000328058800001"}
