Electronic structures were calculated at the MP2/6-311+G(d,p) level, and energetic information further refined by the MC-QCISD (single-point) method. The rate constants for major reaction channels were calculated by the canonical variational transition state theory with small-curvature tunneling correction over the temperature range of 200-1,500 K. The theoretical rate constants were in good agreement with the available experimental data and were fitted to the three parameter expression: k (1a)(T) = 2.93 x 10(-26) T (4.25) exp (-318.68/T), and k (2a)(T) = 3.67 x 10(-22) T (2.72) exp (-1,414.22/T), k (3a) (T) = 7.00 x 10(-24) T (3.27) exp (-384.04/T), k (4a)(T) = 6.35 x 10(-22) T (2.59) exp (-603.18/T) (in unit of cm(3)molecule(-1)s(-1)) are given. Our calculations indicate that hydrogen abstraction channel is the major channel due to the smaller barrier height among four channels considered.", "paper_title": "Theoretical study and rate constant calculations for the reactions of SiHX3 with CF3 and CH3 radicals (X = F, Cl)", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677600005"}
