Through a number of evolutions, Web applications have become interactive, dynamic and asynchronous. The Web's ubiquity and our reliance on it have made it imperative to ensure the quality, security and correctness of Web applications. Testing is a widely used technique for validating Web applications. It is also a long-standing, active and diverse research area. In this paper, we present a broad survey of recent Web testing advances and discuss their goals, targets, techniques employed, inputs/outputs and stopping criteria. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
