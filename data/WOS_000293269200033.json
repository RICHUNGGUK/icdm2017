This potential impact needs to be evaluated by quantifying the risk of an accident on the basis of a joint study of factors affecting the probability of occurrence, environmental, populational and infrastructural vulnerability factors and intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. The problem is non-linear, and this fact, combined with the high number of risk conditioning variables, justifies using machine learning techniques to estimate risk. A comparison of results for supervised versus non-supervised learning techniques confirms that the former adapts better to the problem than the latter. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
