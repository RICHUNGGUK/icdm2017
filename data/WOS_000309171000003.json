Benefits of this algorithm include anytime solving process, homogeneous verification of inner boxes, and applicability to generic problems, allowing any number of (possibly nonlinear) equality and inequality constraints. We present three key improvements of the algorithm dedicated to projection problems: (i) The verification process is enhanced in order to prove faster larger boxes in the projection space. (ii) Computational effort is saved by pruning redundant portions of the solution set that would project identically. (iii) A dedicated branching strategy allows reducing the number of treated boxes. Experimental results indicate that various applications can be modeled as projection problems and can be solved efficiently by the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Interval-based projection method for under-constrained numerical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000309171000003"}
