With this FVCR system, one can enter characters into a computer by just using the movement of fingertip, without any additional device such as a keyboard or a digital pen. This provides a new wireless character-inputting method. A simple but effective background model is built for segmenting human-finger movements from cluttered background. A robust fingertip detection algorithm based on feature matching is given, and recognition of the finger-writing character is by a DTW-based classifier. Experiments show that the FVCRS can successfully recognize finger-writing uppercase and lowercase English alphabet with the accuracy of 95.3% and 98.7%, respectively.", "paper_title": "A novel vision-based finger-writing character recognition system", "paper_id": "WOS:000251176000007"}
