Our derivation emphasizes space-time symmetry, which sheds light on the role of time-parallel transport in eliminating-without approximation-all but an O(n) band of entries of the physical system's energy Hessian. The result is a fast, unified, implicit treatment of viscous threads and elastic rods that closely reproduces a variety of fascinating physical phenomena, including hysteretic transitions between coiling regimes, competition between surface tension and gravity, and the first numerical fluid-mechanical sewing machine. The novel implicit treatment also yields an order of magnitude speedup in our elastic rod dynamics.", "paper_title": "Discrete Viscous Threads", "paper_id": "WOS:000279806600085"}
