The HEB consists of a planar antenna and an NbN bridge connecting across the antenna's inner terminals on a high-resistivity Si substrate. The double sideband noise temperatures at 4.2 K without corrections have been characterized from 0.65 to 3.1 THz. The excess quantum noise factor beta of about 4 has been obtained, which agrees well with the calculated value. Allan variance of the HEB has been measured, and Allan time up to 20 s is obtained using a microwave feedback method. Also, the intermediate frequency gain bandwidth (GBW) was measured using two different methods, resulting in same GBW value of about 3.5 GHz.", "paper_title": "Terahertz detectors based on superconducting hot electron bolometers", "paper_id": "WOS:000298651900008"}
