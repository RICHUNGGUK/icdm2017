They use order statistics, directional and adaptive processing techniques. Extensive simulation results in known reference video color sequences have demonstrated that the proposed filters consistently outperform other filters by balancing the tradeoff between noise suppression, detail preservation, and chromaticity characteristics. The criteria used to compare the performance or various filters were the PSNR, MAE, and NCD.", "paper_title": "3D vector directional filters to process video sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400049"}
