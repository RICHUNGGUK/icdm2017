Once a candidate valid shift has been located, a subsequent verification phase checks whether the shift is codeword aligned by taking advantage of the skeleton tree data structure. Our approach leads to algorithms that exhibit a sublinear behavior on the average, as shown by extensive experimentation.", "paper_title": "ADAPTING BOYER-MOORE-LIKE ALGORITHMS FOR SEARCHING HUFFMAN ENCODED TEXTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302061000008"}
