Structured assemblies of spheropolyhedra were created and a constant water inflow was applied at their center. The hydraulic pressure and the resulting fracture pattern were monitored during each simulation. Both showed a strong dependence on the geometry of the preexisting discontinuities and the orientation of the stress field. The dependence of the maximum hydraulic pressure in each simulation on the geometry of the preexisting discontinuities was found to be compatible with continuum considerations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
