The many advantages of digital information have also generated new challenges and new opportunities for innovation. The strength of the information hiding science is due to the nonexistence of standard algorithms to be used in hiding secret message. Also, there is randomness in hiding method such as combining several media (covers) with different methods to pass secret message. Information hiding represents a class of process used to embed data into various forms of media such as image, audio, or text. The proposed text in image cryptography and steganography system (TICSS) is an approach used to embed text into gray image (BMP). TICSS is easily applied by any end user.", "paper_title": "Artificial neural network for steganography", "paper_id": "WOS:000347408400009"}
