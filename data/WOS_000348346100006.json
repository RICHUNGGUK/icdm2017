The ability to self-form and self-manage brings great opportunities for D-MANETs, but developing distributed applications capable of running in such networks remains a major challenge. A middleware system is thus needed between network level and application level in order to ease application development, and help developers take advantage of the unique features of D-MANETs. The characteristics of D-MANETs favor a middleware which supports a decoupled and opportunistic style of computation. Such requirements are perfectly addressed in the concept of Tuple Space. In this paper, we introduce a peer-to-peer JavaSpaces implementation that we specifically designed for D-MANETs, and with which pre-existing or new JavaSpaces-based applications can be easily deployed in such networks.", "paper_title": "A P2P tuple space implementation for disconnected MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000348346100006"}
