A pebble move consists of transferring a pebble from its current host vertex to an adjacent unoccupied vertex. The problem is to move the pebbles to a given new color arrangement. We study the feasibility version of the problem-does a given instance have a solution? We use an algorithm of Auletta et al. (Algorithmica 23:223-245, 1999) for the problem where each pebble has a distinct color to give a linear time algorithm for the feasibility decision problem on a general graph.", "paper_title": "Multi-Color Pebble Motion on Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000280552200005"}
