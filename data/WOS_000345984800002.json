In CBTC systems, less service availability could cause train derailment, collision or even catastrophic loss of lives or assets. Therefore, the availability of data communication should be carefully considered in designing CBTC systems. In this paper, we propose two wireless local area network (WLAN)-based data communication systems with redundancy in CBTC systems. The availability is analyzed using continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) model. We also model the WLAN-based data communication system behavior with deterministic and stochastic Petri net (DSPN). The DSPN solution is used to show the soundness of our proposed CTMC model. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed systems with redundancy can significantly improve service availability in CBTC systems.
