As for the issues, we present in this paper a method for rapid design of Petri net (PN) formalized models of RMS, intended for supervisory control and logic control of RMS, as well as a method for automated reconfiguration of the models. Firstly, we present an improved net rewriting system (INRS) for dynamically operating net transformation, unlike its predecessor-net rewriting system, where the initial behavioral properties of the underlying PN rewritten can be preserved during the transformation. Subsequently, the paper proposes the three-phase method for rapid design of initial full PN models of reconfigurable manufacturing cells (RMCs). In this method, activity diagrams of Unified Modeling Languages version 2 (UML 2) are used to describe manufacturing configurations, firstly; then the sub-activity diagrams are transformed into PN sub-models; finally, the PN sub-models are automated synthesized into a full model by the approach of INRS. Further, we present a model reconfiguration method for this class of PN models. The method compares changes in activity diagrams of the existing and goal manufacturing configurations and converts them into net rewriting rules of INRS. By applying the rules obtained, the existing PN model can reconfigure into a new one for the goal manufacturing configuration. No matter the design method or the reconfiguration method, the behavioral properties of the obtained PN models, e.g., liveness, boundedness, or reversibility, can be guaranteed and thereby the efforts of verification can be avoided. Finally, rapid design of a PN model of a reconfigurable manufacturing cell, as well as its automated reconfiguration, is illustrated with the help of an example. The result indicates the validity of the methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
