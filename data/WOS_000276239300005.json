Simulation has become an effective way to avoid costly decisions through what-if analysis of different maintenance policies, and maintenance schedules before their actual implementation. In this paper, a new modularized simulation package for manufacturing production systems has been developed using standard Stochastic Timed Petri-Nets (STPNs). By utilizing the basic functional modules, we can quickly build production lines with different configurations and maintenance policies. A maintenance decision support tool has also been developed in this paper, together with the simulation package, to provide offline and online maintenance decision support.
