In this paper we consider a localisation problem of 2-D directional sensor networks that contain a subset of static anchor nodes. All sensors are assumed to recognise the global north exactly through the operation of equipped compass. We introduce a distributed strategy to calibrate the position of non-anchor sensors. In our approach, directional sensors measure relative range and bearing with respect to neighbouring nodes. Moreover, sensors enable low complexity motion (rotation) to compensate the confined field of view and improve relative bearing measurements. We discuss the localisation accuracy as a function of deployment density and bearing granularity. Using noisy distance and bearing (angular) information allows sensors to compute position estimate that asymptotically approaches ground truth given sufficiently high deployment density. We evaluate the performance through simulations.", "paper_title": "Exploiting low complexity motion for ad-hoc localisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000280104500004"}
