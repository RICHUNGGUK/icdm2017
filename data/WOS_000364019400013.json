We demonstrate the potential of these two features to indicate saliency by comparing their statistics around human fixation points against their statistics at control points away from fixations. Then, using these features, we construct a simple and effective saliency estimation method for compressed video, which utilizes only motion vectors, block coding modes and coded residuals from the bitstream, with partial decoding. The proposed algorithm has been extensively tested on two ground truth datasets using several accuracy metrics. The results indicate its superior performance over several state-of-the-art compressed-domain and pixel-domain algorithms for saliency estimation.", "paper_title": "Compressed-domain correlates of human fixations in dynamic scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000364019400013"}
