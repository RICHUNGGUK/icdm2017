Optical packets are assembled by aggregating IP packets, and attaching an optical packet header. Conventional schemes process optical packet headers one by one, in a sequential form. Then, the worst case algorithm response time is tightly coupled to switch size. In contrast, in PI-OPS all the optical packets received during a given time window are jointly processed to optimize the delay and output wavelength allocation, applying void filling techniques. The scheduler has a deterministic response time, independent of the traffic arrival's pattern. In addition, PI-OPS has been specifically designed to allow a parallel electronic implementation similar to the ones found in VOQ schedulers. In this respect, we evaluate the traffic loss performance of the scheduler in different settings, to dimension a set of hardware related parameters. Finally, we conduct an emulation of an FPGA implementation of a large-scale version of the scheduler. Results support the feasibility of its implementation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
