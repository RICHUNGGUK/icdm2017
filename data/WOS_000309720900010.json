(1986), 'The Economic Design of Control Charts: A Unified Approach', Technometrics, 28, 3-10], in which the external costs of employing the chart are added. In addition, the model is statistically constrained to achieve desired in-control and out-of-control average run lengths. The Taguchi loss approach is used to model the problem and a genetic algorithm, for which its main parameters are tuned using the response surface methodology (RSM), is proposed to solve it. At the end, sensitivity analyses on the main parameters of the cost function are presented and their practical conclusions are drawn. The results show that RSM significantly improves the performance of the proposed algorithm and the external costs of applying the chart, which are due to real-world constraints, do not increase the average total loss very much.", "paper_title": "A parameter-tuned genetic algorithm for statistically constrained economic design of multivariate CUSUM control charts: a Taguchi loss approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000309720900010"}
