In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that when the bit-rate used to code the residual layer falls into a critical region (which covers almost all typical bit-rates used in practice), it often happens that all pixels in the down-sampled layer would be deteriorated if the corresponding coded residuals are added into them. To avoid this problem, we first propose a \"naive\" solution: no coded residuals will be added back into the down-sampled layer; whereas coded residuals will be added only into the interpolated pixels. Then, we propose to apply a constrained quantization technique during the coding of the residual layer so that all residual pixels at the interpolated positions will end up with an improved quality. To verify its effectiveness, we conduct extensive tests to show that the gap between the hierarchical coding scheme and its single-level counterpart (which is typically around 2-3 dB in the 2-level hierarchy) will be filled up by a rather big percentage.
