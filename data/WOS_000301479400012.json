The LTS-EDA introduces knowledge model and can extract knowledge during the search process of TS, and thus it adopts dual or cooperative evolution/search structure, consisting of probabilistic model space in clustered EDA and solution space searched by TS. The clustered EDA, as a learnable constructive method, is used to create a new starting solution, and the simple TS, as an improvement method, attempts to improve the solution created by the clustered EDA in the LTS-EDA. A distinguishing feature of the LTS-EDA is the usage of the clustered EDA with effective linkage learning to guide TS. In the clustered EDA, different clusters (models) focus on different substructures, and the combination of information from different clusters (models) effectively combines substructures. The LTS-EDA is tested on 50 large size benchmark problems with the size ranging from 2,000 to 5,000. Simulation results show that the LTS-EDA is better than the advanced algorithms proposed recently.", "paper_title": "Learnable tabu search guided by estimation of distribution for maximum diversity problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000301479400012"}
