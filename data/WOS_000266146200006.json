Demand cannot be backlogged, but can be totally or partially lost. Safety stock is an objective to reach rather than an industrial constraint to respect. The problem is NP-hard. We propose a Lagrangian relaxation of the resource capacity constraints. We develop a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the induced sub-problems. An upper bound is also proposed using a Lagrangian heuristic with several smoothing algorithms. Some experimental results showing the effectiveness of the approach are reported.
