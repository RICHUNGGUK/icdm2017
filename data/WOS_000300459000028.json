In this paper, we propose a novel graph structure named k-regular nearest neighbor (k-RNN) graph as well as its constructing algorithm, and apply the new graph structure in the framework of manifold-ranking based retrieval. We show that the manifold-ranking algorithm based on our proposed graph structure performs better than that of the existing graph structures such as k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph and connected graph in image retrieval, 2D data clustering as well as 3D model retrieval. In addition, the automatic sample reweighting and graph updating algorithms are presented for the relevance feedback of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
