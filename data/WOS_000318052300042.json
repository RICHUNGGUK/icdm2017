These underground facilities contain all essential utilities serving large urban areas collected together in a tunnel; therefore they are an inviting target for sabotage or vandalism. This paper proposes an expert system combining color-coded scales, Delphi and AHP methods to analyze criticality and threats on utility tunnels to support planning of security policies for utilities in urban subsurface.
