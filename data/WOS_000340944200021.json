We are motivated by the observation that TCP does not fully exploit the potential of the underlying network coding opportunities. In order to improve the performance of TCP flows over coded wireless networks, without introducing changes to TCP itself, we propose a network-coding aware queue management scheme (NCAQM) that is implemented at intermediate network coding nodes and bridges the gap between network coding and TCP rate control. The design of NCAQM is grounded on the network utility maximization (NUM) framework and includes the following mechanisms. NCAQM: 1) stores coded packets at intermediate nodes in order to use the buffer space more efficiently; 2) determines what fraction of the flows should be coded together; and 3) drops packets at intermediate nodes so that it matches the rates of parts of different TCP flows that are coded together. We demonstrate, via simulation, that NCAQM significantly improves TCP throughput compared to TCP over baseline queue management schemes.", "paper_title": "Network Coding-Aware Queue Management for TCP Flows Over Coded Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000340944200021"}
