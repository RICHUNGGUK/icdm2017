However, their use is somewhat limited because of their deterministic transition matrices. Vague probabilistic information and imprecision appear in the modeling of real-life systems, thus causing difficulties in the pure probabilistic model set-up. Moreover, their accuracy suffers due to implementations on computers with floating point arithmetics. Our goal is to address these problems by extending the Dempster-Shafer with Intervals toolbox for MATLAB with novel verified algorithms for modeling that work with Markov chains with imprecise transition matrices, known as Markov set-chains. Additionally, in order to provide a statistical estimation tool that can handle imprecision to set up Markov chain models, we develop a new verified algorithm for computing relations between the mean and the standard deviation of fuzzy sets.", "paper_title": "Verified stochastic methods Markov set-chains and dependency modeling of mean and standard deviation", "paper_id": "WOS:000321644600010"}
