For the first problem, we propose a method to obtain a sparse generator matrix to construct network codes, and this sparse generator matrix is proven to be the sparsest. Benefiting from the sparse generator matrix, the energy consumption required to implement distributed storage is reduced. For the second problem, we designed a network coding-based iterative repair method, which adequately utilizes the idea of re-encoding at intermediate nodes from network coding theory. Benefiting from the re-encoding, the energy consumption required by data repair is significantly reduced. Moreover, we provide an explicit lower bound of field size required by this scheme, which implies that this scheme can work over a very small field and the required computation overhead of coding is very low. The simulation result verifies that by using our scheme, the total energy consumption required to implement distributed storage system in WSNs can be reduced on the one hand, and on the other hand, this method can also balance energy consumption of the networks.", "paper_title": "Network Coding for Energy-Efficient Distributed Storage System in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000326743500004"}
