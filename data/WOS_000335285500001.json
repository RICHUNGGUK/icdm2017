The proposed method involved exploration of a 3D geometric network model (GNM)-based, building information model (BIM)-supported framework for fire-fighting simulation. The operations of ladder trucks were simulated in a virtual 3D environment. Using the method described in this paper, the best position for the deployment of the ladder trucks can be determined even before the arrival of firefighters at the scene. A real fire-fighting drill was also conducted as part of this study. The proposed method can assist firefighters quickly locate their ladder trucks, thereby reducing response time after an incident.
