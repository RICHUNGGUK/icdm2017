To address this problem, we developed a novel architecture of resource management framework for multi-tier applications based on virtualization mechanisms. Key techniques presented in this paper include (1) establishment of the analytic performance model which employs probabilistic analysis and overload management to deal with non-equilibrium;(2) a general formulation of the resource management problem which can be solved by incorporating both deterministic and stochastic optimizing algorithms; (3) deployment of virtual servers to partition resource at a much finer level; and (4) investigation of the impact of the failure rate to examine the effect of application isolation. Simulation experiments comparing three resource allocation schemes demonstrate the advantage of our dynamic approach in providing differentiated service qualities, preserving QoS levels in failure scenarios and also improving the overall performance while reducing the resource usage cost.
