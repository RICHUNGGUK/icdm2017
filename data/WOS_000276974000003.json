We prove that fully-extended, orthogonal iCRSs are confluent modulo identification of hypercollapsing sub-terms. As a corollary, we obtain that fully-extended, orthogonal iCRSs have the normal form property and the unique normal form property (with respect to reduction). We also show that, unlike the case in first-order infinitary rewriting, almost non-collapsing iCRSs are not necessarily confluent.", "paper_title": "INFINITARY COMBINATORY REDUCTION SYSTEMS: CONFLUENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000276974000003"}
