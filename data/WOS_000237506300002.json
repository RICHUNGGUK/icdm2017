CAF belongs to the family of global address space parallel programming languages; such languages provide the abstraction of globally addressable memory accessed using one-sided communication. At Rice University we are developing cafc, an open source, multiplatform CAF compiler. Our earlier studies show that cafc-compiled CAF programs achieve similar performance to that of corresponding MPI codes for the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. In this paper, we present a study of several CAF implementations of Sweep3D on four modern architectures. We analyze the impact of using one-sided communication in Sweep3D, identify potential sources of inefficiencies and suggest ways to address them. Our results show that we achieve comparable performance to that of the MPI version on three cluster-based architectures and outperform it by up to 10 % on the SGI Altix 3000.", "paper_title": "Experiences with Sweep3D implementations in Co-array Fortran", "paper_id": "WOS:000237506300002"}
