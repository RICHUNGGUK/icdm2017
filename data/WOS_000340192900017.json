By this method, one can directly construct a controllability matrix using the measured state data without identifying system parameters. Hence, one can save time in practice and avoid corresponding identification errors. Moreover, its calculation precision is higher than some other traditional approaches, which need to identify unknown parameters. Our methods are feasible to the study of characteristics of deterministic systems. A numerical example is given to show the advantage of our results.", "paper_title": "Data-based controllability analysis of discrete-time linear time-delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340192900017"}
