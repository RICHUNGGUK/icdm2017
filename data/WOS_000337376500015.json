First, a closed-form solution for the throughput rate of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, with a truncated selective repeat automatic repeat request (TSR-ARQ) or selective repeat plus go-back-N automatic repeat request (SR+GBN-ARQ) protocol at the data link layer, is proposed. In addition, a throughput-based AS technique with adaptive modulation is also investigated. For this purpose, the throughput and packet error rates of a MIMO system with a transmit AS and TSR-ARQ protocol at the data link layer are analyzed. This study is conducted in 2 different cases. In the single-transmit AS case, the probability density functions (PDFs) of the throughput and packet error rates at the data link layer are derived. Moreover, in the case with multiple-transmit AS, a lower bound for the throughput rate and an upper bound for the packet error rate at the data link layer are determined. Consequently, the PDFs of these lower and upper bounds are extracted.", "paper_title": "New throughput-based antenna selection scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000337376500015"}
