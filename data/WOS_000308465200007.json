To this end, the information system plays a decisive role in selecting the services that meet the applications' needs. This paper presents an information system for the Grid that provides transparent and scalable group communication services to standard Grid applications, with the objective of supporting dynamic collaborations that could help address problems that involve only some participants of a virtual organization. In particular, it enables more flexible delivery mechanisms, which allows applications to select the appropriate services before sending their data to the information system. This significantly enhances the protection of data from unauthorized access, and avoids the transmission of unnecessary messages over the network. The proposed information system is based on the use of XML technologies and replication. It introduces several new advanced features that are not currently supported as a whole by any Grid middleware, such as: several entry points to the information, persistent capabilities, support for advanced queries based on XQuery, and support for the industrial standard WS-Policy. The information system has been stress tested under realistic workloads in a Grid infrastructure with 50 sites. Scalability has been evaluated in up to 1000 messages that can be up to 10KB in size each, updated with a frequency of 5min.
