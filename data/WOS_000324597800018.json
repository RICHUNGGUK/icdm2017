Given a set of data points, these three components can be learned by solving a nuclear norm regularized optimization problem, which is convex and can be efficiently solved in polynomial time. Using the method as a tool, we propose a new discriminant analysis (i.e., supervised subspace learning) algorithm called Corruptions Tolerant Discriminant Analysis (CTDA), in which the intrinsic subspace is used to capture the features with high within-class similarity, the penalty subspace takes the role of modeling the undesired features with high between-class similarity, and the error container takes charge of fitting the possible corruptions in the data. We show that CTDA can well handle the gross corruptions possibly existing in the training data, whereas previous linear discriminant analysis algorithms arguably fail in such a setting. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark human face data sets and one object recognition data set show that CTDA outperforms the related algorithms.", "paper_title": "General Subspace Learning With Corrupted Training Data Via Graph Embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000324597800018"}
