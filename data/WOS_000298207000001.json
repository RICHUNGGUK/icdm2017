In particular we show the connection with the classical Richardson iteration and modified Richardson iteration. We propose to use GMRES as an alternative iterative method. Numerical experiments achieve much better approximations with only few iterations, which can be explained by an interpretation of the GMRES method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
