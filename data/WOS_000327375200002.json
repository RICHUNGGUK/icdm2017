Such technologies can aid a complete educational system to function successfully so to help the whole school educational life. For this to prove, we present the \"Coaching for Teacher\" system, a personal technological conversational coach; it aims to provide solutions to overcome difficulties that teachers face during their teaching and learning process. In real time, a teacher can appeal and seek advice rapidly by comfortably talking to an agent. In this paper, we present the steps we followed to design and develop this agent-based application, and a case study conducted in an educational centre for proof that the concept works in an authentic educational environment.", "paper_title": "Applying Professional Solutions within the Educational Environments by Means of Cloud Computing: Coaching for Teachers", "paper_id": "WOS:000327375200002"}
