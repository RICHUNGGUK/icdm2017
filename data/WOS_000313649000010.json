In this paper we show that the problem can be solved in linear time if the distances from s and t to all other vertices are given. Particularly our new algorithm runs in O(|V|log|V|+|E|) time for general graphs, which improves the previous result of O(|V|(2)) time and takes only linear time for unweighted graphs, planar graphs, and graphs with positive integer edge lengths.", "paper_title": "A Simpler and More Efficient Algorithm for the Next-to-Shortest Path Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000313649000010"}
