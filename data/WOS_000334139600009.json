A trade-off between H-infinity norm bounds and speed of convergence performance is taken into account in the design process. Actual experimental data are used to compare performance of the fuzzy polynomial design with classical ones based on the Takagi-Sugeno and linearized models, both using the same optimization criteria and design parameters.
