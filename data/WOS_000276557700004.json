There have been a wide range of algorithms developed for this model. Research on using this model in real-time system applications and building a scalable MASC architecture is currently quite active. In this paper, we present simulations between MASC and reconfigurable bus-based models, e.g., various versions of the Reconfigurable Multiple Bus Machine (RMBM). Constant time simulations of the basic RMBM by MASC and vice versa are obtained. Simulations of the segmenting RMBM, fusing RMBM, and extended RMBM by MASC in non-constant time are also discussed. By taking advantage of previously established relationships between RMBM and two other popular parallel computational models, namely, the Reconfigurable Mesh (RM) and the Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM), we extend our simulation results to further categorize the power of the MASC model in relation to RM and PRAM.
