Besides different solid phases the resulting coating microstructure often contains a non-negligible amount of pores. In this context a roller burnishing process with a hydrostatic ballpoint-tool is examined to compact the thermally sprayed coating, thereby reducing porosity. The rolling process is performed by a robot on free-formed workpieces. A simulation concept for the prediction of forces in a robot-guided roller burnishing process based on a series of detailed ABAQUS simulations is presented. It is shown that, based on these test configurations, the process forces can be calculated much faster and with sufficient precision. Thereby an optimal rolling path, which requires the least amount of normal force to be applied, can be determined efficiently leading to the decision whether a specific robot is equipped to handle the path. Furthermore, the described approach may be used as a pattern to apply similar methods to other engineering problems where accurate simulative solutions exist, but cannot be applied to problems of realistic size due to their expenditure of time.
