The new method is proposed based on basis function approximations and a group version of the adaptive LASSO penalty, which can select significant variables and estimate the non-zero smooth coefficient functions simultaneously. Under suitable conditions, we establish the consistency in variable selection and the oracle property in estimation. A simulation study and two real data examples are undertaken to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed variable selection procedure.", "paper_title": "Robust variable selection in modal varying-coefficient models with longitudinal", "paper_id": "WOS:000357936100006"}
