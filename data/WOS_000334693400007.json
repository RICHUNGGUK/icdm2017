Optimization methods, such as the normalized normal constraint (NNC), propose the use of a filter to achieve a smart Pareto front distribution. The NCC optimization method presents several disadvantages related with the procedure itself, initial condition dependency, and computational burden. In this article, the epsilon-variable multi-objective genetic algorithm (ev-MOCA) is presented. This algorithm characterizes the Pareto front in a smart way and removes the disadvantages of the NNC method. Finally, examples of a three-bar truss design and controller tuning optimizations are presented for comparison purposes.", "paper_title": "A Smart-Distributed Pareto Front Using the ev-MO GA Evolutionary Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000334693400007"}
