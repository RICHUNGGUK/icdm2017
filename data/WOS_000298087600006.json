In this article, we study this problem when the backbone is 2-edge connected and when user nodes are linked to concentrators by a point-to-point access network. We formulate this problem as an integer linear program and present a facial study of the associated polytope. We describe valid inequalities and give sufficient conditions for these inequalities to be facet defining. We investigate the computational complexity of the corresponding separation problems. We propose some reduction operations to speed up the separation procedures. Finally, we devise a branch-and-cut algorithm based on these results and present the outcome of a computational study.
