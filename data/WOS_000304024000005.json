Deontical impure systems are systems whose object set is formed by an s-impure set, whose elements are perceptuales significances (relative beings) of material and/or energetic objects (absolute beings) and whose relational set is freeways of relations, formed by sheaves of relations going in two-way directions. Objects and freeways form chains. Design/methodology/approach - The paper looks at the mathematical and logical development of human society structure. Findings - Existence of relations with positive imperative modality (obligation) would constitute the skeleton of the system. Negative imperative modality (prohibition) would be the immunological system of protection of the system. Modality permission the muscular system, that gives the necessary flexibility to the system, in as much to the modality faculty its neurocerebral system, because it allows him to make decisions. Transactions of energy, money, merchandise, population, etc. would be the equivalent one to the sanguineous system. These economic transactions and inferential relations, depend, as well, on the existence of a legislative body with their obligations, prohibitions and permissions that regulate them. Originality/value - The concepts of alysidal set are introduced, whose elements are chains and coupling function between alysidal sets. Environment is formed as well by different DIS. That is to say, by an alysidal set whose elements are simultaneously systems. Specific interchanges (stimulus-response) leave certain nodes and act on certain nodes of the alysidal sets (stimulus environment-DIS-response environment). The paper defines a special coupling function, denominated gnorpsic function, that can be used for algebraic operations between alysidal sets.", "paper_title": "An introduction to alysidal algebra (I)", "paper_id": "WOS:000304024000005"}
