The proposed DMHCCA consists of two-level evolutions: the neuro-level evolution (NULE) and the network-level evolution (NWLE). In NULE, a data mining-based evolutionary learning algorithm is utilized to evolve neurons. The good combinations of neurons evolved in NULE are reserved for being the initial populations of NWLE. In NWLE, the initial population are mated and mutated to produce new structure of networks. Similar to NULE, the good neurons of evolved network in NWLE are inserted into the NULE. Thus, by interactive two-level evolutions, the neurons and structure of network can be evolved locally and globally, respectively. Simulation results using DMHCCA are reported and compared with other existing models. Application of DMHCCA to a three-dimensional (3D) surface alignment task is also described, and experimental results are presented better performance than other alignment systems.", "paper_title": "Data mining-based hierarchical cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for TSK-type neuro-fuzzy networks design", "paper_id": "WOS:000322139500023"}
