In this paper, we trade some generality in estimating and aligning camera motion for reduced computational complexity and increased image-based nature. The main contribution is to use fundamental ratios to synchronize video sequences of distinct scenes captured by cameras undergoing similar motions. We also present a simple method to align 3D camera trajectories when the fundamental ratios are not able to match the noisy trajectories. Experimental results show that our method can accurately synchronize sequences even when the scenes are totally different and have dense depths. An application on 3D object transfer is also demonstrated. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
