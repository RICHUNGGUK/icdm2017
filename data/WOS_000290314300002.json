RAID1 (mirrored disks) and RAID5 (distributed parity arrays) are the two RAID levels considered in this study. They are both single disk failure tolerant (1DFT), but differ significantly in their efficiency in processing database workloads. The goal of the study is to maximize the number of Virtual Array (VA) allocations in HDA. We develop an analysis to estimate the load per VA based on a few parameters: the fraction of accesses to small versus large blocks and the fraction of updates versus reads. A VA is allocated according to the RAID level, which minimizes the anticipated load based on input parameters. Operation in normal and degraded mode is considered for comparison purposes, but in fact allocations are carried out using the higher load in degraded mode to ensure that single disk failures will not result in overload. We report on parametric studies to gain insight into circumstances leading to a RAID1 or RAID5 classification. An allocation experiment with a synthetic workload is used to demonstrate the superiority of HDA with respect to purely RAID1 or RAID5 disk arrays. This analytic study can be extended to 2DFT arrays, namely RAID6 versus 3-way replication.", "paper_title": "RAID level selection for heterogeneous disk arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000290314300002"}
