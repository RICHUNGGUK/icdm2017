A simple approach to the problem is presented by developing re-organized innovation analysis for the systems with instantaneous and double time-delayed measurements. It is shown that the derived estimator involves solving three different standard Kalman filtering with the same dimension as the original system. The obtained results form the basis for solving some complicated problems such as H-infinity fixed-lag smoothing, preview control, H-infinity filtering and control with time delays.", "paper_title": "Kalman filtering for time-delayed linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240614500005"}
