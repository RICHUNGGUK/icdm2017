First, the tolerance which means the permissible range of the error is introduced into optimization problems which relate with clustering, and the tolerance is formulated. Next, the problems are solved using Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Last, the algorithms are constructed based on the results of solving the problems.", "paper_title": "On fuzzy c-means for data with tolerance", "paper_id": "WOS:000237084600034"}
