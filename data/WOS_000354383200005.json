Shortly afterwards, Neininger proved a central limit theorem for the error. As a consequence, he obtained the asymptotics of the L-3-distance. In this short note, we use the moment transfer approach to re-prove Neininger's result. As a consequence, we obtain the asymptotics of the L-p-distance for all 1p<Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
