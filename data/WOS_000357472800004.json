We propose a construction of parity-check matrices which allow to solve the syndrome equation even with an erroneous syndrome, in particular, parity-check matrices with minimum redundancy, which are analogs of Reed-Solomon codes for this problem. We also establish analogs of classical coding theory bounds, namely the Hamming, Singleton, and Gilbert-Varshamov bounds. We show that the new problem can be considered as a generalization of the well-known Ulam's problem on searching with a lie and as a discrete analog of the compressed sensing problem.", "paper_title": "On error correction with errors in both the channel and syndrome", "paper_id": "WOS:000357472800004"}
