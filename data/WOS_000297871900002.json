The basic framework for this research is formulated on the background of the theory of traces. We focus our interests on minimal shifts and t-shifts generated by them, that is shifts defined in the space of infinite real traces. We show that sets of infinite real traces generated by minimal shifts are always closed and, under some conditions, are also t-shifts. Additional discussion for the case of small alphabets (containing at most four letters) is also provided.", "paper_title": "Infinite Traces and Symbolic Dynamics - the Minimal Shift Case", "paper_id": "WOS:000297871900002"}
