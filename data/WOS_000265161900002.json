The traffic in a city can be simulated by a MAS with different agents, cars and traffic lights, that interact to obtain an overall goal: to reduce average waiting times for the traffic risers. In this Paper, we describe an agent-based simulator to model traffic in cities. Using this simulator, we present a sell-organizing solution to efficiently manage urban traffic. We compare our proposal with recent approaches, providing better results than classical and alternative self-organizing methods, with lower resources and investments.", "paper_title": "HISTORY-BASED SELF-ORGANIZING TRAFFIC LIGHTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000265161900002"}
