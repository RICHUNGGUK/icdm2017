For instance, a 2-factor of G is a set of cycles that span G. 2-factors have multiple applications in Graph Theory, Computer Graphics, and Computational Geometry. We define a simple 2-factor as a 2-factor without degenerate cycles. in general, simple k-factors are defined as k-regular spanning subgraphs where no edge is used more than once. We propose a new algorithm for computing simple k-factors for all values of k >= 2. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
