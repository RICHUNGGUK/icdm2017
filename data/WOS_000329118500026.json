We show that the fixed point approach introduced in [10] fails to converge for fast rotating BECs. A simple alternative approach based on Krylov subspace solvers with a Laplace or Thomas-Fermi preconditioner is given. Numerical simulations (obtained with the associated freely available Matlab toolbox GPELab) for complex configurations show that the method is accurate, fast and robust for 2D/3D problems and multi-components BECs.
