We show that this leads naturally to a recursive definition of hyper-heuristics and to a division of responsibility that is suggestive of a blackboard architecture, in which individual heuristics annotate a shared workspace with information that may also be exploited by other heuristics. Such a framework invites consideration of the kind of relaxations of the domain barrier that can be achieved without loss of generality. We give a concrete example of this architecture with an application to the 3-SAT domain that significantly improves on a related token-ring hyper-heuristic.", "paper_title": "Searching the Hyper-heuristic Design Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000332454800005"}
