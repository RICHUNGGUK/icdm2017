For the system under study, each subsystem interacts with others in an on-off way which can be employed to deal with communication congestion in signals transmission. By stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient conditions that guarantee mean square synchronization of the coupled system are established. Moreover, the underlying network needs not be undirected or strongly connected. Finally, some numerical simulations are given to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of our results.", "paper_title": "Synchronization Analysis of Coupled Stochastic Neural Networks with On-Off Coupling and Time-Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000360565300014"}
