The method is based on solving a related Hamilton -Jacobi -Isaacs equation of the corresponding finite-horizon zero-sum game. The neural network approximates the corresponding game value function on a certain domain of the state-space and results in a control computed as the output of a neural network. It is shown that the neural network approximation converges uniformly to the game-value function and the resulting controller provides closed-loop stability and bounded L-2 gain. The result is a nearly exact H-infinity feedback controller with time-varying coefficients that is solved a priori offline. The results of this article are applied to the rotational/translational actuator benchmark nonlinear control problem.", "paper_title": "Neural network solution for finite-horizon H-infinity state feedback control of nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251027700007"}
