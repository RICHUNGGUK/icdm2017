There are many criteria to efficiently determine the desired schedule of a project. In this paper, a well-known criterion namely project's makespan is considered. Due to the complexity of the problem, it is very difficult to obtain optimum solution for this kind of problems by means of traditional methods. Therefore, an enhanced scatter search, based on a new path relinking and two prominent permutation-based and crossover operators, is devised to solve the problem. In order to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, in terms of solution quality, the algorithm is applied to various test problems available on the literature and the reliability of it, is compared with well-reported benchmark algorithms. The computational results reveal that the proposed algorithm has appropriate results in comparison with the existing benchmark algorithms.", "paper_title": "Using an enhanced scatter search algorithm for a resource-constrained project scheduling problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000262702500007"}
