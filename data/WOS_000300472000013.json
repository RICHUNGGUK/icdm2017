First, the continuous and discrete cart-pendulum systems are explained. We next propose a transformation method that converts a discrete-time input derived from the discrete-time optimal regulator theory into a continuous-time zero-order hold input, and carry out some simulations on stabilization of the cart-pendulum system by the transformation method. Then, we apply not only our proposed method but also existing methods to an experimental laboratory of the cart-pendulum system and perform some experiments in order to verify the availability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Control of the Cart-Pendulum System Based on Discrete Mechanics - Part II: Transformation to Continuous-Time Inputs and Experimental Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000300472000013"}
