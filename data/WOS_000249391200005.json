Among the most commonly used moduli, in such systems, are those of 2(n)-1 and 2(n)+1 forms and among the most commonly used operations are multiplication and sum-of-squares. These operations are currently performed using distinct design units and/or consecutive machine cycles. Novel architectures for combined units that perform modulo 2(n)-1/diminished-1 modulo 2(n)+1 multiplication or sum-of-squares depending on the value of a control signal are proposed.", "paper_title": "RNS rnultiplication/surn-of-squares units", "paper_id": "WOS:000249391200005"}
