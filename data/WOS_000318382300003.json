Based on our interviews with some designers and researchers who regularly used pen-based tools, we conducted three experiments to establish baseline criteria to distinguish intentional pen tail gestures from incidental pen tail movements, and to understand the basic movement behaviors in pen tail gestures. We developed designs and recognition methods of pen gestures, and implemented three application prototypes based on them. Our research can inspire some new designs of pen-based tools and enrich the design repertoire of pen-based user interfaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
