The algorithm finds and verifies the optimal solution for every problem in the combined benchmarks of Hoffmann, Talbot, and Scholl in less than one-half second per problem, on average, including one problem that has remained open for over 10 years. The previous best-known algorithm is able to solve 257 of the 269 benchmarks. The new algorithm is based on a branch-and-bound method that uses memory to eliminate redundant subproblems.", "paper_title": "A Branch, Bound, and Remember Algorithm for the Simple Assembly Line Balancing Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000307207000008"}
