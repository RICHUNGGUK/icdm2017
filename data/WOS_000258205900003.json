In the current practice of parallel programming with MPI or OpenMP, the programmer should manually optimize the parallel code for each target architecture and for the design constraints. Thus, the design-space exploration of MPSoC (multiprocessor systems-on-chip) costs become prohibitively large as software development overhead increases drastically. To solve this problem, we develop a parallel-programming framework based on a novel programming model called common intermediate code (CIC). In a CIC, functional parallelism and data parallelism of application tasks are specified independently of the target architecture and design constraints. Then, the CIC translator translates the CIC into the final parallel code, considering the target architecture and design constraints to make the CIC retargetable. Experiments with preliminary examples, including the H. 263 decoder, show that the proposed parallel-programming framework increases the design productivity of MPSoC software significantly.", "paper_title": "A retargetable parallel-programming framework for MPSoC", "paper_id": "WOS:000258205900003"}
