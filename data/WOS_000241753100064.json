The criteria that govern the quality of the optimization procedure are based on two basic measures. A newly formulated performance metric for the digital IIR filter is formed for checking its performance while its system order which usually reflects upon the required computational power is also adopted as another objective function for the optimization. The proposed scheme in this paper was able to obtain frequency-selective filters for lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop with better performance than those previously obtained and the filter system order was also optimized with lower possible number.", "paper_title": "A jumping genes paradigm with fuzzy rules for optimizing digital IIR filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100064"}
