Nevertheless, the execution control of distributed activities in high performance computing environments by SWfMS presents challenges such as steering control and provenance gathering. Such challenges may become a complex task to be accomplished in bioinformatics experiments, particularly in Many Task Computing scenarios. This paper presents a data parallelism solution for a bioinformatics experiment supported by Hydra, a middleware that bridges SWfMS and high performance computing to enable workflow parallelization with provenance gathering. Hydra Many Task Computing parallelization strategies can be registered and reused. Using Hydra, provenance may also be uniformly gathered. We have evaluated Hydra using an Orthologous Gene Identification workflow. Experimental results show that a systematic approach for distributing parallel activities is viable, sparing scientist time and diminishing operational errors, with the additional benefits of distributed provenance support.
