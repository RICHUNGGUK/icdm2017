In particular, we will examine the case where the light source direction varies between the pictures, and we will show how this additional information allows us to obtain a uniqueness result solving the well-known convex/concave ambiguity of the shape-from-shading problem. We will prove a uniqueness result for weak (Lipschitz continuous) solutions that improves previous results in [R. Kozera, Appl. Math. Comput., 44 (1991), pp. 1-103] and [R. Onn and A. Bruckstein, Int. J. Comput. Vision, 5 (1990), pp. 105-113]. We also propose some approximation schemes for the numerical solution of this problem and analyze the properties of two approximation schemes: an upwind finite difference scheme and a semi-Lagrangian scheme. Finally, we present some numerical tests on smooth and nonsmooth surfaces coming from virtual and real images.", "paper_title": "Uniqueness and Approximation of a Photometric Shape-from-Shading Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000326032900023"}
