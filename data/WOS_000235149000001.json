First we derive the criteria by the Lyapunov theorem, then the problem can be represented by a set of matrix inequalities involving the vertices of system matrices. A feasible solution, if it exists, can be obtained by the proposed alternating projection method and thus assure the stability of the considered system. The given examples illustrate that the proposed method is effective and valid.", "paper_title": "Robustness analysis of discrete time-delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235149000001"}
