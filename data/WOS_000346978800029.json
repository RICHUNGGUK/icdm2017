We present the Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy probabilistic ordered weighted distance (IFPOWD) operator. Its main advantage is that it uses distance measures in a unified framework between the probability and the OWA operator that considers the degree of importance of each concept in the aggregation. Moreover, it is able to deal with uncertain environments represented in the form of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy information. We analyze the applicability of this new approach in a group decision making problem concerning selection of investments.", "paper_title": "Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy decision making with probabilistic information and distance measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000346978800029"}
