In this paper, we focus on the estimation and the minimization of the misclassification rate of decision tree classifiers. We apply Lidstone's Law of Succession for the estimation of the class probabilities and error rates. In our work, we take into account not only the expected values of the error rate, which has been the norm in existing research, but also the corresponding reliability (measured by standard deviations) of the error rate. Based on this estimation, we propose an efficient pruning algorithm, called k-norm pruning, that has a clear theoretical interpretation, is easily implemented, and does not require a validation set. Our experiments show that our proposed pruning algorithm produces accurate trees quickly, and compares very favorably with two other well-known pruning algorithms, CCP of CART and EBP of C4.5.", "paper_title": "A k-norm pruning algorithm for decision tree classifiers based on error rate estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253375600003"}
