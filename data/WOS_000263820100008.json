The design procedures of the two cases of controllers are presented in terms of the solutions to generalised algebraic Riccati inequalities. The designed controllers in each case guarantee that closed-loop singular systems are admissible and with H-norm bound on disturbance attenuation. Finally, a numerical example to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach is given.", "paper_title": "Decentralised H control for singular systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263820100008"}
