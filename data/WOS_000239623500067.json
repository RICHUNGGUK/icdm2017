A novel multi-class support vector classification strategy based on binary tree is also presented. The binary tree extends the pairwise discrimination capability of the SVC to the multi-class case naturally. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that proposed method can reduce computation complexity without decreasing classification accuracy compare to SVC without data preprocessing.", "paper_title": "Data dimension reduction using rough sets for support vector classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500067"}
