Because of the difficulty in scheduling simultaneous transmissions, we propose an opportunistic scheduling algorithm in the media access control (MAC) layer and analyze the achievable throughput of the Denoise-and-Forward (DF) PNC scheme for both symmetric and asymmetric channel statuses, where random errors may occur for both BPSK and QPSK modulation techniques. Simulation results show that our algorithm cannot only improve throughput but can also adapt to varying channel conditions. It is further revealed that for the same throughput, our algorithm is more power-efficient with an asymmetric channel status than with a symmetric channel status.
