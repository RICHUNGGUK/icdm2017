In particular, based on truncated Newton (TN) methods that have been an effective approach for large-scale unconstrained optimization, we develop the use of efficient multilevel schemes for computing the optical flow. More precisely, we compare the performance of a standard unidirectional multilevel algorithm-called multiresolution optimization (MR/Opt)-with that of a bidirectional multilevel algorithm-called full multigrid optimization (FMG/Opt). The FMG/Opt algorithm treats the coarse grid correction as an optimization search direction and eventually scales it using a line search. Experimental results on three image sequences using four models of optical flow with different computational efforts show that the FMG/Opt algorithm outperforms both the TN and MR/Opt algorithms in terms of the computational work and the quality of the optical flow estimation.", "paper_title": "Line Search Multilevel Optimization as Computational Methods for Dense Optical Flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000292131200007"}
