This notion was inspired by a striking result of Thue asserting that the path P(n) on n vertices has a nonrepetitive three-colouring, no matter how large n is. A k-list assignment of a graph G is a mapping L which assigns a set L(v) of k permissible colours to each vertex v of G. The Thue choice number of G, denoted by pi(eh) (G), is the least integer k such that for every k-list assignment L there is a nonrepetitive colouring c of G satisfying c(v). L(v) for every vertex v of G. Using the Lefthanded Local Lemma we prove that pi(eh) (P(n)) <= 4 for every n. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
