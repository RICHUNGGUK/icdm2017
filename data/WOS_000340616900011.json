The applied method is a generalization of the triangulation technique using a fringe projection pattern (by Gray code technique) to achieve a higher operating speed. The hardware equipment includes a single digital camera and a video projector. MATLAB was used for the calibration operation, the production of images by the above method, the image processing, and data calculation; while the Geomagic Qualify software was used to estimate the accuracy of the three-dimensional model obtained after scanning and to compare it with the tested object. Regarding the point cloud of the test object, the results demonstrate the precision of the used method and the possibility of developing a 3D scanner with a dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.05 mm.", "paper_title": "Building Three-Dimensional Scanner Based on Structured Light Technique Using Fringe Projection Pattern", "paper_id": "WOS:000340616900011"}
