We first review a rate-distortion (RD) optimization framework that can be employed in such scenarios. As part of the framework, a scheduling algorithm selects the data to send over the network at any given time, so as to minimize the end-to-end distortion, given an estimate of channel resources and a history of previous transmissions and received acknowledgements. In practice, a greedy scheduling strategy is often considered to limit the solution search space, and reduce the computational complexity associated to the RD optimization framework. Our work observes that popular greedy schedulers are strongly penalized by early retransmissions. Therefore, we propose a scheduling algorithm that avoids premature retransmissions, while preserving the low computational complexity aspect of the greedy paradigm. Such a scheduling strategy maintains close to optimal RD performance when adapting to network bandwidth fluctuations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed patient greedy scheduler provides a reduction of up to 50% in transmission rate relative to conventional greedy approaches, and that it brings up to 2 dB of quality improvement in scheduling classical MPEG-based packet video streams.", "paper_title": "The virtue of patience in low-complexity scheduling of packetized media with feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000244131900013"}
