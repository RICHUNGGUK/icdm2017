Peculiarity factor (PF) is one of the most important concepts in POM. In this paper, it is proved that PF can accurately characterize the peculiarity of data sampled from a normal distribution. However, for a general one-dimensional distribution, it does not have the property. A local version of PF, called LPF, is proposed to solve the difficulty. LPF can effectively describe the peculiarity of data sampled from a continuous one-dimensional distribution. Based on LPF, a framework of local peculiarity oriented mining is presented, which consists of two steps, namely, peculiar data identification and peculiar data analysis. Two algorithms for peculiar data identification and a case study of peculiar data analysis are given to make the framework practical. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show their good performance.", "paper_title": "LOCAL PECULIARITY ORIENTED DATA MINING AND ITS APPLICATION IN OUTLIER DETECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000312456800007"}
