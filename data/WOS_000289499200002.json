It provides high memory bandwidth and low power operating mode for energy savings. However, making full use of these architectural features is a challenging problem for code optimization. In this paper, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) model to optimize the performance and energy consumption of multi-module memories by solving variable assignment, instruction scheduling and operating mode setting problems simultaneously. The combined effect of performance and energy saving requirements has been considered as well. Specially, we develop two optimization techniques to improve the computation efficiency of our ILP model. The experimental results show that the optimal performance and energy solution can be achieved within a reasonable amount of time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
