Most existing approaches nevertheless, neglect dictionary statistics. In this work, we explore the linguistic and statistical properties of dictionaries in an image retrieval task, representing the dictionary as a multiset. This is extracted by means of the LZW data compressor which encodes the visual patterns of an image. For this reason the image is first quantized and then transformed into a 1D string of characters. Based on the multiset notion we also introduce the Normalized Multiset Distance (NMD), as a new dictionary-based dissimilarity measure which enables the user to retrieve images with similar content to a given query. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in retrieval performance compared to related dictionary-based techniques or to several other image indexing methods that utilize classical low-level image features.
