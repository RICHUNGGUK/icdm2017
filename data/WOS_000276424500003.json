To this end, we introduce an optimization problem whose solution refines former methods, thus producing a better upper bound. In particular, we show that an analogue of Minkowski's second theorem on successive minima with the volume replaced by lattice point enumerator is true up to an exponential factor, whose base is approximately 1.64.", "paper_title": "An Optimization Problem Related to Minkowski's Successive Minima", "paper_id": "WOS:000276424500003"}
