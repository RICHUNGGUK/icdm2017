The effect of a stent placed in the parent artery is not only to protect the parent artery from occlusion, due to extension of coils and thrombosis, but also to act as flow diverter to vary the haemodynamics in the aneurysm. In this article, two idealised cerebral wide-necked aneurysms were created, one was sidewall aneurysm with curved parent vessel and the other was terminal aneurysm with the bifurcated parent vessel. The plexiglass models of the two aneurysms were 'treated' with commercial porous intravascular stents. The stented physical models were scanned by Micro-CT and the numerical models of the two idealised cerebral wide-necked aneurysms after stent placement were constructed from the scanned image files. The pulsatile flow of non-Newtonian fluid inside the models was simulated by using computational fluid dynamics package. From the simulated flow dynamics, various haemodynamic characteristics such as velocity contours, wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index (OSI) were computed. The velocity of the jet entering the sacs reduced after stent was deployed across the necks of both sidewall and terminal aneurysms; the wall shear stress on the distal neck of sidewall aneurysm reduced, the wall shear stress on the dome of the terminal aneurysm increased and the OSI on the dome of the terminal aneurysm reduced. Therefore, stent placement not only promotes thrombus formation in both aneurysm models but also reduces the regrowth risk of the sidewall aneurysm and the rupture risk of the terminal aneurysm.", "paper_title": "Computational haemodynamics in two idealised cerebral wide-necked aneurysms after stent placement", "paper_id": "WOS:000299434200001"}
