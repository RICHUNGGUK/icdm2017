Their routing/dispatching from node to node is a very important issue as we need to safeguard application efficiency, achieve better load balancing and resource utilization throughout the underlying network. Selecting the best target server for dispatching a mobile agent is, therefore, a multi-faceted problem that needs to be carefully tackled. In this paper we propose distributed, adaptive routing schemes (next node selection) for mobile agents. The proposed schemes overcome risks like load oscillations, i.e., agents simultaneously abandoning a congested node in search for other, less saturated node. We try to induce different routing decisions taken by agents to achieve load balancing and better utilization of network resources. We consider five different algorithms and evaluate them through simulations. Our findings are quite promising both from the user/application and the network/infrastructure perspective.
