This algorithm is fully distributed and can generate within acceptable time and message complexities a multicast routing tree, which not only satisfies the required multiple QoS constraints but also has a sub-optimal network cost. The results of the simulations show that the multicast routing tree generated by our algorithm has better performance than the previous well-known results. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
