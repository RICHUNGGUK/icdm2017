We attempted a structure-based fragment library. For several typical target structures such as stem-loops, bulge-loops, and 2-way junctions, our method provided numerous good quality candidate structures in less computational time than previously proposed methods. By using a high-resolution potential energy function, we were able to select good predicted structures from candidate structures. This method of efficient conformational search and detailed structure evaluation using high-resolution potential is potentially useful for the tertiary structure prediction of RNA.", "paper_title": "Prospects for Tertiary Structure Prediction of RNA Based on Secondary Structure Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000300650400028"}
