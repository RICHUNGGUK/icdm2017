(independent and identically distributed) Rayleigh fading environment. Then. an approximation method of those marginal distributions is presented: We show that the theory of SIMO space diversity using maximal ratio combining (MRC) is applicable to the approximation of statistical distributions of all eigenvalues in MIMO systems with the same number of diversity branches. The derived approximation has a monomial form suitable for the calculation of various performance measures utilized in MIMO systems. Through computer simulations. the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Approximation of Statistical Distribution of Eigenvalues in i.i.d.
