Moreover, it is often carried out through argumentative discourses between the stakeholders involved. This paper exploits and elaborates on the synergy that occurs between the decision making and knowledge management processes in such contexts. The proposed multidisciplinary approach is supported by a web-based software tool. Being based on a well-defined ontology model, our approach facilitates decision makers in achieving a common understanding, while also enhancing collaboration and exploitation of organizational knowledge resources. Strategy development is the particular knowledge domain considered in this paper to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed tool.", "paper_title": "A multidisciplinary approach for supporting knowledge-based decision making in collaborative settings", "paper_id": "WOS:000252047100009"}
