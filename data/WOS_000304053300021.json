We have created CistromeMap as a web server to provide a comprehensive knowledgebase of all of the publicly available ChIPSeq and DNase-Seq data in mouse and human. We have also manually curated metadata to ensure annotation consistency, and developed a user-friendly display matrix for quick navigation and retrieval of data for specific factors, cells and papers. Finally, we provide users with summary statistics of ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq studies.", "paper_title": "CistromeMap: a knowledgebase and web server for ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq studies in mouse and human", "paper_id": "WOS:000304053300021"}
