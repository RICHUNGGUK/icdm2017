By using the properties of \"M-cone\", eigenspace of the spectral radius of nonnegative matrices, Lyapunov functional, Ito's formula and inequality techniques, several sufficient conditions guaranteeing the mean square exponential stability of its equilibrium solution are obtained. These results extend and improve the earlier publications. Two examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the results. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
