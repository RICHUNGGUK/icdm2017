The proposed score is an approximation of the conditional log-likelihood criterion. The approximation is devised in order to guarantee decomposability over the network structure, as well as efficient estimation of the optimal parameters, achieving the same time and space complexity as the traditional log-likelihood scoring criterion. The resulting criterion has an information-theoretic interpretation based on interaction information, which exhibits its discriminative nature. To evaluate the performance of the proposed criterion, we present an empirical comparison with state-of-the-art classifiers. Results on a large suite of benchmark data sets from the UCI repository show that fCLL-trained classifiers achieve at least as good accuracy as the best compared classifiers, using significantly less computational resources.", "paper_title": "Discriminative Learning of Bayesian Networks via Factorized Conditional Log-Likelihood", "paper_id": "WOS:000293757900003"}
