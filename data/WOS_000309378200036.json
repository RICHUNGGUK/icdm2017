The autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) model is a linear process in time series: whilst in the nonlinear system, the generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and Markov switching GARCH (MS-GARCH) have been widely applied. In statistical learning theory, support vector regression (SVR) plays an important role in predicting nonlinear and nonstationary time series variables. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, differential Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for improving prediction of exchange rates under support vector regression (SVR). The new algorithm of Differential EMD has the capability of smoothing and reducing the noise, whereas the SVR model with the filtered dataset improves predicting the exchange rates. Simulations results consisting of the Differential EMD and SVR model show that our model outperforms simulations by a state-of-the-art MS-GARCH and Markov switching regression (MSR) models.
