However, in conventional control architectures, the computation of the basis functions of a NURBS curve is very time-consuming due to serial computing constraints. In this paper, a novel FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based motion controller utilizing its high-speed parallel computing power is proposed to realize the Cox-de Boor algorithm for second and higher degrees NURBS interpolation. The motion control algorithm is also embedded in the FPGA chip to implement real-time control and NURBS interpolation simultaneously for multi-axis servo systems. The proposed FPGA-based motion controller is capable of performing the Cox-de Boor algorithm and the IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) control algorithm in about 46 clock cycles, as compared to the 1303 clock cycles by the traditional approach. Numerical simulations and experimental tests using an X-Y table verify the outstanding computation performance of the FPGA-based motion controller. The result indicates that shorter sampling time (10 mu s) can be achieved for NURBS interpolation which is highly critical to the success of high-speed and high-accuracy motion control.
