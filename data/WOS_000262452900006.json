By name creation we mean the capacity of dynamically producing pure names, with no relation between them other than equality or inequality. By replication we understand the ability of systems of creating new parallel identical threads, that can synchronize with each other. We have developed our study in the framework of Petri nets, by considering several extensions of P/T nets. In particular, we prove that in this setting name creation and replication are equivalent, but only when a garbage collection mechanism is added for idle threads. However, when simultaneously considering both extensions the obtained model is, a bit surprisingly, Turing complete and therefore, more expressive than when considered separately.", "paper_title": "Name Creation vs. Replication in Petri Net Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262452900006"}
