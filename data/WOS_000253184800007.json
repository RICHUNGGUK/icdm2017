However, prediction accuracy remains a, primary issue surrounding the practicality of WLAN-based location determination systems. This study proposes a novel scheme that utilizes mobile user orientation information to improve prediction accuracy. Theoretically, if the precise orientation of a user can be identified, then the location determination system can predict that user's location with a high degree of accuracy by using the training data of this specific-orientation. In reality, a mobile user's orientation can be estimated only by comparing variations in received signal strength; and nevertheless the predicted orientation may be incorrect. Incorrect orientation information causes the accuracy of the entire system to decrease. Therefore, this study presents an accumulated orientation strength algorithm which can utilize uncertain estimated orientation information to improve prediction accuracy. Implementation of this system is based on the Bayesian model, and the experimental results indeed show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
