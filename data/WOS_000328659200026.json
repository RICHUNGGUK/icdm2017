Using the inverse of phenomenological hysteresis model in order to compensate the input-output hysteresis behavior of these actuators shows the effectiveness of this approach. In this paper, in order to control the tip deflection of a large deformation flexible beam actuated by an SMA actuator wire, a feedforward-feedback controller is proposed. The feedforward part of the proposed control system, maps the beam deflection into SMA temperature, is based on the inverse of the generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model. An adaptive model reference temperature control system is cascaded to the inverse hysteresis model in order to estimate the SMA electrical current for tracking the reference signal. In addition, a closed-loop proportional-integral controller with position feedback is added to the feedforward controller to increase the accuracy as well as eliminate the steady state error in position control process. Experimental results indicate that the proposed controller has great accuracy in tracking some square wave signals. It is also experimentally shown that the suggested controller has precise tracking performance in presence of environmental disturbances. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
