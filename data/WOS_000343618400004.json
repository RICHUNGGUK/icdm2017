In this context, the paper investigates some aspects of the mechanical behavior of artificially cemented sands (ACS) by means of experimental characterization and micromechanics-based modeling. Particular emphasis is given to the increase in elastic stiffness and strength brought by cementation. Based on the concept of a fictitious continuum medium and the homogenization theory, the effective elastic properties of ACS are evaluated using the Mori-Tanaka and self-consistent schemes. The elastic micromechanical approach is supported by bender element tests. Finally, the effective strength properties of ACS are assessed by means of micromechanics-based failure criterion formulated within the context of non-associated plasticity. Validation and calibration of the theoretical model are achieved by comparison with data from unconfined compression tests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
