In this paper, we propose two simple and effective stochastic strategies for controlling the budget. Both algorithms have an expected regret that is sublinear in the horizon. Experimental results on a number of benchmark data sets demonstrate encouraging performance in terms of both efficacy and efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
