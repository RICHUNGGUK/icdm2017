It limits the flexibility of the retrieval framework to conduct sophisticated cross-image analysis, resulting in higher memory consumption and sub-optimal retrieval accuracy. To conquer this issue, we propose cross indexing with grouplets, where the core idea is to view the database images as a set of grouplets, each of which is defined as a group of highly relevant images. Because a grouplet groups similar images together, the number of grouplets is smaller than the number of images, thus naturally leading to less memory cost. Moreover, the definition of a grouplet could be based on customized relations, allowing for seamless integration of advanced image features and data mining techniques like the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in off-line indexing. To validate the proposed framework, we construct three different types of grouplets, which are respectively based on local similarity, regional relation, and global semantic modeling. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of our approach.", "paper_title": "Cross Indexing With Grouplets", "paper_id": "WOS:000364102400010"}
