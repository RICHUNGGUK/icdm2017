DDC systems work in that way that they divide data according to their access patterns and then they use different caching algorithms on the divided data. One possible classification taxonomy is proposed in the first part of this chapter together with major examples thereof. After that, an analysis of the existing solutions is presented, emphasizing three most important issues: speed, complexity, and power consumption.", "paper_title": "Dual Data Cache Systems: Architecture and Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000370523800006"}
