In this paper, we present a model that is capable of learning such structures using a random field of parameterized features. These features can be functions of arbitrary combinations of observations, labels, and auxiliary hidden variables. We also present a simple induction scheme to learn these features, which can automatically determine the complexity needed for a given data set. We apply the model to two real-world tasks, information extraction and image labeling, and compare our results to several other methods for discriminative labeling.", "paper_title": "Learning flexible features for conditional random fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000256679700008"}
