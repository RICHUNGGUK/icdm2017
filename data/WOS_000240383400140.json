Therefore, W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) proposes the Semantic Web as the new web paradigm to present semantic information. But there is always a security problem in Semantic Web such as WWW and the study about this is insufficient. Therefore, the authors of this paper propose that the SecuSemantic system should be used to present semantic information using ontology and prevents that users flow out the information. This system is an Access Control Matrix based access control model basically, and It is a system that prevent information leakage by user's deliberation and by user's mistake.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of web security access control system for semantic Web ontology", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400140"}
