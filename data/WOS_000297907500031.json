Such analyses are characterized by cables switching between taut and slack states. The approach is based on casting the computation in each time increment as a complementarity problem. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the approach. Despite the nonsmooth nature of cables switching between taut and slack states, the computed solutions exhibit remarkable long-term energy balance. Furthermore, by exploiting some features of the tensegrity model, significant computational efficiency can be gained in the solution of the complementarity problem in each time increment. Due to the use of linearized kinematics, the method is not applicable as is to tensegrity structures with internal mechanisms or where the geometric stiffness is significant compared to the material stiffness. The method however plays a role in a more general nonlinear kinematics formulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
