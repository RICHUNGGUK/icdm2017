This methodology performs denoising projection in order to accurately fill the missing values in the database. The improved methodology is called empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) pruning, and it is based on an original linear projection method called empirical orthogonal functions (EOF). The experiments demonstrate the performance of the improved methodology and present a comparison with the original EOF and with a widely used optimal interpolation method called objective analysis.", "paper_title": "An improved methodology for filling missing values in spatiotemporal climate data set", "paper_id": "WOS:000273352600004"}
