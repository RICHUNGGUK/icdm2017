Internet service providers, which support MPLS technology, are increasingly demanded to provide high quality of service (QoS) guarantees. One of the aspects of QoS is fault tolerance. It is defined as the property of a system to continue operating in the event of failure of some of its parts. Fault tolerance techniques are very useful to maintain the survivability of the network by recovering from failure within acceptable delay and minimum packet loss while efficiently utilizing network resources. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for fault tolerance in MPLS networks. Our approach uses a modified (k, n) threshold sharing scheme with multi-path routing. An IP packet entering MPLS network is partitioned into n MPLS packets, which are assigned to node/link disjoint LSPs across the MPLS network. Receiving MPLS packets from k out of n LSPs are sufficient to reconstruct the original IP packet. The approach introduces no packet loss and no recovery delay while requiring reasonable redundant bandwidth. In addition, it can easily handle single and multiple path failures.
