In the recent literature there are various promising approaches to account for these numerical difficulties, relying on alternative decompositions or approximations. Recently, a general method of moments approach for estimating these models was developed. We compare all these different approaches with respect to their root mean-squared errors of the estimates and investigate the size and power of hypotheses tests with respect to the spatial correlation and the regression parameters.", "paper_title": "Performance contest between MLE and GMM for huge spatial autoregressive models", "paper_id": "WOS:000253266000005"}
