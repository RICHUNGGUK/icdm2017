However, offering services for mobile requirements without dynamic and adaptive migration may hurt the performance of deployed services. In this paper, we propose MAMOC, a cost-effective approach for selecting the server and migrating services to attain enhanced QoS more economically. The goal of MAMOC is to minimize the total operating cost while guaranteeing the constraints of resource demands, storage capacity, access latency and economies, including selling price and reputation grade. First, we devise an objective optimal model with multi-constraints, describing the relationship among operating cost and the above constraints. Second, a normalized method is adopted to calculate the operating cost for each candidate VM. Then we give a detailed presentation on the online algorithm MAMOC, which determines the optimal server. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we conducted extensive simulations on three typical network topologies and a realistic data center network. Results show that MAMOC is scalable and robust with the larger scales of requests and VMs in cloud environment. Moreover, MAMOC decreases the competitive ratio by identifying the optimal migration paths, while ensuring the constraints of SLA as satisfying as possible.", "paper_title": "A cost-effective scheme supporting adaptive service migration in cloud data center", "paper_id": "WOS:000368588400004"}
