It provides components addressing basic issues related to security, resource discovery, data movement and management, etc. However, it still lacks from advanced management frameworks that may be linked to GT4 services and thus providing a system-wide view of these services. This is especially true in the case of security related services. They need to be properly managed all across different organizations collaborating in the grid infrastructure. This paper presents the major achievements when designing and developing a semantic-aware management framework for GT4 security services.", "paper_title": "Distributed provision and management of security services in Globus Toolkit 4", "paper_id": "WOS:000243318600020"}
