Unlike existing models with a constant sum of output, the proposed OCDEA can deal with a situation where the sum of outputs is not constant. It is found that OCDEA efficiency is not less than the CCR type for each decision-making unit (DMU). A CCR-efficient DMU is also an OCDEA-efficient one. An algorithm is provided to solve the OCDEA model, which is based on non-linear programming. Finally, the OCDEA model is applied to evaluate the efficiencies of the British Premier League.", "paper_title": "An output-constrained DEA model as applied to efficiency analysis of football clubs", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366900007"}
