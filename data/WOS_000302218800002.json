Poor quality images with lens debris are unacceptable and need to be identified before state DOTs accept the collections of video-log images from contractors. However, manually reviewing the tens of millions of video-log images to detect lens debris deficiencies is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, automatic lens debris detection in video-log images is needed. Based on joint domain-range representation of lens debris candidates that are obtained from dark channel prior depth map estimation and Canny lens debris edge detection, a nonparametric Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) model for lens debris detection has been developed for the first time. The model detects the lens debris areas in the video-log images using recursive bandwidth selection and hysteresis updating strategy. An experimental test, using 13,007 video-log images provided by the Alberta DOT, was conducted to validate the proposed algorithm. Test results show that the proposed algorithm can detect lens debris in video-log images with a detection rate greater than 84%. The proposed algorithm is promising for improving video-log image data quality control and assurance. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000121.
