The proposed controller is designed based on the prescribed performance control methodology and it is a reaching regulator in which the target pose for the hand acts as an attractor for the arm. It provides configuration consistency in return motions and hand and joint velocity smoothness. Its use in an admittance control scheme given measurements or estimates of external forces is also proposed providing active compliance capabilities in robot environment interactions. Simulation studies for a 5dof human arm-like robot and experiments with a 7dof arm are performed to verify the approach and demonstrate the proposed controller's performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
