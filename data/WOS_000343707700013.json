It poses new challenges because mobile devices are typically resource-constrained and exhibit unique characteristics such as instability in network connections. New scheduling strategies are imperative in mobile grid to efficiently utilize the devices. This paper presents a scheduling algorithm that considers dynamic properties of mobile devices such as availability, reliability, maintainability, and usage pattern in mobile grid environments. In particular, usage patterns caused by voluntarily or involuntarily losing a connection, such as switching off the device or a network interruption could be important criteria for choosing the best resource to execute a job. The experimental results show that our scheduling algorithm provides superior performance in terms of execution time, as compared to the other methods that do not consider usage pattern. Throughout the experiments, we found it essential to consider usage pattern for improving performance in the mobile grid.", "paper_title": "A scheduling algorithm with dynamic properties in mobile grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000343707700013"}
