The relation matrix coding scheme of genome is its basis. In this genetic algorithm, a new evolution function of population is presented. Furthermore, an especial population selection policy is proposed based on the combination of population diversity handling and simulated annealing. The policy accords with the evolution characteristic of population diversity much more. It enhances convergence of genetic algorithm and can get more excellent composite service plan. The simulation results on web services selection with global QoS constraints have shown that the prematurity was overcome effectively, and that the convergence of genetic algorithm was improved very well.
