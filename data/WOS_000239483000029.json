The face area is scanned with scalable small windows from which Local Binary Pattern (LBP) histograms are obtained to effectively express the local feature of a face image. The Chi square distance between corresponding Local Binary Pattern histograms of sample image and template is used to construct weak classifiers pool. Adaboost algorithm is applied to build the final strong classifiers by selecting and combining the most useful weak classifiers. In addition, two experiments are made for classifying gender based on local binary pattern. The male and female images set are collected from FERET databases. In the first experiment, the features are extracted by LBP histograms from fixed sub windows. The second experiment is tested on our boosting LBP based method. Finally, the results of two experiments show that the features extracted by LBP operator are discriminative for gender classification and our proposed approach achieves better performance of classification than several others methods.", "paper_title": "Gender classification based on boosting Local Binary Pattern", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000029"}
