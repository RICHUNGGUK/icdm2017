The underlying idea of this approach is to transfer segmentation masks of globally and locally (glocally) similar exemplars into the query image. For this purpose, we propose a novel high-level image representation method named as object-oriented descriptor. Using this descriptor, a set of exemplar images glocally similar to the query image is retrieved. Then, using over-segmented regions of these retrieved exemplars, a discriminative classifier is learned on-the-fly and subsequently used to predict foreground probability for the query image. Finally, the optimal segmentation is obtained by combining the online prediction with typical energy optimization of Markov random field. The proposed approach has been extensively evaluated on three datasets, including Pascal VOC 2010, VOC 2011 segmentation challenges, and iCoseg dataset. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and has the potential to segment large-scale images containing unknown objects, which never appear in the exemplar images.", "paper_title": "Online Glocal Transfer for Automatic Figure-Ground Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000334677700001"}
