However the problem of user bandwidth availability arises as one of the most limit of this solution. In fact, the IEEE 802.11 standards do not provide any mechanism of load distribution among different access points (APs). Then an AP can be heavily overloaded leading to station throughput degradation. This paper deals with this problem. It focuses on the presentation of QoS (Quality of Service) management solution for wireless communication system. It, mainly, presents a protocol structure between mobiles and APs. This protocol is intended to provide best resources allocation and efficiency on communication metrics. An SDL description and MSC simulation is provided as a first step in the development of this protocol.", "paper_title": "Load balancing approach for wireless IEEE 802.11 QoS enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000241592200008"}
