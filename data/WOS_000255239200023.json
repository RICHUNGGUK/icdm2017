It maps the classical TSP onto a single-layered recurrent neural network by embedding the constraints of the problem directly into the dynamics of the network. The proposed method differs from the classical Hopfield network in the update of state dynamics as well as the use of network activation function. Furthermore, parameter settings for the proposed network are obtained using a genetic algorithm, which ensure a stable convergence of the network for different problems. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed network performs better than the classical Hopfield network for optimization. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
