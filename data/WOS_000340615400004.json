By exploiting the intrinsic segregation of the signalling and media planes that the IMS service model offers, a virtual IMS client could be developed that simplifies terminal device implementation by offloading signalling and session management tasks to a remote server. In this paper, we study how the IMS/PCC architecture can be deployed in conjunction with a virtual IMS client. Although a virtual IMS client assigns the signalling tasks (accomplished through session initiation protocol and session description protocol) to a remote server, information related to QoS should be propagated back to the access network and also the end user's terminal device. Therefore, designing a virtual IMS client that only deals with the media plane is challenging. In this paper, we propose a PCC architecture for the virtual IMS client that keeps the end user's terminal as simple as possible while providing the necessary functions of the IMS/PCC architecture. Since QoS provisioning is access network specific, we explore the proposed architecture for two predominant networks access methods: UMTS from 3GPP and WLAN from IP-based access.", "paper_title": "Policy and Charging Control for Virtual IMS Client", "paper_id": "WOS:000340615400004"}
