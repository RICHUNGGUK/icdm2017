A worst-case scenario is that nanoparticles might cause health issues such as skin damage or even induce cancer. As a first step to study the toxicity of nanoparticles, we investigate the energy behaviour of a C-60 fullerene interacting with a lipid bilayer. Using the 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential function and the continuous approximation, the equilibrium spacing between the two layers of a bilayer is predicted to be 3.36 . On assuming that there is a circular hole in the lipid bilayer, a relation for the molecular interaction energy is determined, involving the circular radius b of the hole and the perpendicular distance Z of the spherical fullerene from the hole. A graph of the minimum energy location Z (min) verses the hole radius b shows that a C-60 fullerene first penetrates through a lipid bilayer when b > 6.81 , and shows a simple circular relation Z(min)(2) + b(2) = 6.81(2) for Z(min) positive and b a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 6.81 . For b > 6.81, the fullerene relocates from the surface of the bilayer to the interior, and as the hole radius increases further it moves to the centre of the bilayer and remains there for increasing hole radii. Accordingly, our modelling indicates that at least for the system with no external forces, the C-60 fullerene will not penetrate through the lipid bilayer but rather remains encased between the two layers at the mid-plane location.", "paper_title": "Instability of C-60 fullerene interacting with lipid bilayer", "paper_id": "WOS:000299769700013"}
