In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, called AM-Trie (Asymmetrical Multi-bit Trie). Our algorithm creatively use redundant expression to shorten the height of Trie: use compression to reduce the storage cost and eliminate the trace back to enhance the search speed further. Moreover, AM-Trie is a parallel algorithm and very fit for the \"multi-thread and multi-core\" features of Network Processor; it has good scalability, the increase of policy number influences little to its performance. Finally: a prototype is implemented based on Intel IXP2400 Network Processor. The performance testing result proves that AM-Trie is high-speed and scalable, the throughput of the whole system achieves 2.5 Gbps wire-speed in all situations.", "paper_title": "AM-Trie: A high-speed parallel packet classification algorithm for network processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500006"}
