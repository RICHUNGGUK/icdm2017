We modify a priority-based decoding procedure proposed by Gen et al. [1] to adapt with the fcTP structure. After comparing well-known representation methods for a transportation problem, we explain our proposed pb-GA. We compare the performance of the pb-GA with the recently used spanning tree-based genetic algorithm (st-GA) using numerous examples of linear and nonlinear fcTPs. Finally, computational results show that the proposed pb-GA gives better results than the st-GA both in terms of the solution quality and computation time, especially for medium- and large-sized problems. Numerical experiments show that the proposed pb-GA better absorbs the characteristics of the nonlinear fcTPs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
