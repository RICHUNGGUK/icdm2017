We deal with the problem of email classification by conceiving suitable strategies for: (1) organizing messages into homogeneous groups, (2) redirecting further incoming messages according to an initial organization, and (3) building reliable descriptions of the message groups discovered. We propose a unified framework for handling and classifying email messages. In our framework, messages sharing similar features are clustered in a folder organization. Clustering and pattern discovery techniques for mining structured and unstructured information from email messages are the basis of an overall process of folder creation/maintenance and email redirection. Pattern discovery is also exploited for generating suitable cluster descriptions that play a leading role in cluster updating. Experimental evaluation performed on several personal mailboxes shows the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Mining categories for emails via clustering and pattern discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000254202100004"}
