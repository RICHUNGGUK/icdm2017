More precisely, we consider the problems of synthesizing the minimal and maximal costs of reaching a given target location. These problems generalize conditional optimal reachability, i.e., the problem of minimizing one primary cost under individual upper bound constraints on the remaining, secondary, costs, and the problem of maximizing the primary cost under individual lower bound constraints on the secondary costs. Furthermore, under the liveness constraint that all traces eventually reach the goal location, we can synthesize all costs combinations that can reach the goal. The decidability of the minimal reachability problem is proven by constructing a zone-based algorithm that always terminates while synthesizing the optimal cost tuples. For the corresponding maximization problem, we construct two zone-based algorithms, one with and one without the above liveness constraint. All algorithms are presented in the setting of two cost variables and then lifted to an arbitrary number of cost variables. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
