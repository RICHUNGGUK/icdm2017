To capture a very thin liquid film of bubbles, we have developed a regional level set method allowing multi-manifold interface tracking. Based on the definitions of regional distance and its five operators. the implementation of the regional level set method is very easy. An implicit surface of liquid film with arbitrary thickness can be reconstructed from the regional level set function. To overcome the numerical instability problem, we exploit a new semi-implicit Surface tension model which is unconditionally stable and makes the simulation of surface tension dominated phenomena much more efficient. An approximated film thickness evolution model is proposed to control the bubble's lifecycle. All these new techniques combine into a general framework that can produce various realistic dynamic effects of bubbles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
