Numerical modelling may provide insight. To date, however, few finite element (FE) spine models have been developed which are both multi-segmental and capture a more complete anatomy of the vertebrae. A 3-D, two-functional unit, CT-based, lumbar spine, FE model was developed and used to predict load transfer and likelihood of fracture following balloon kyphoplasty. The fractured anterior wall and injected cement were modelled in a two-functional spinal unit model with osteoporotic bone properties. Parameters investigated included: cement stiffness, cement volume and height restoration. Models were assessed based on stresses and a user-defined fracture-predicting field. Augmentation altered the stress distribution; shielding was dependent on positioning of the cement; and fracture algorithm found incomplete height restoration to increase the likelihood of fracture, particularly in adjacent vertebrae.", "paper_title": "Mechanical variables affecting balloon kyphoplasty outcome - a finite element study", "paper_id": "WOS:000301596800001"}
