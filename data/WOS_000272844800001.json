Different video packets have different levels of contribution to the overall video presentation quality at the receiver side. In this work, we develop a fine-granularity transmission distortion model for the encoder to predict the quality degradation of decoded videos caused by lost video packets. Based on this packet-level transmission distortion model, we propose a content-and-deadline-aware scheduling (CDAS) scheme for multi-session video streaming over multi-hop mesh networks, where content priority, queuing delays, and dynamic network transmission conditions are jointly considered for each video packet. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed transmission distortion model and the CDAS scheme significantly improve the performance of multi-session video streaming over mesh networks.", "paper_title": "Fine-Granularity Transmission Distortion Modeling for Video Packet Scheduling Over Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000272844800001"}
