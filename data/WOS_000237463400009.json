In this paper, we propose two core-stateless fair bandwidth allocation schemes. Both schemes do not need to maintain per-flow state. Packet is labeled using smart market model according to the characteristics of the flow to which the packet belongs. No matter TCP or UDP flows can get their fair share rate by the proposed schemes. The first scheme is called core-stateless labeling fairness (CSLF). In CSLF scheme, packets are labeled only once at the entrance of the network and estimators of number of active flows based on Bloom filter are employed at the core routers. The estimation can be used to provide a fair rate to perform auction. Packets of a flow whose rate exceeds the estimated fair share rate are dropped at a congested router. The second scheme, called congestion-responsive-CSFQ (CR-CSFQ), is one extension from CSFQ. Congestion-responsive flows should get a different treatment from non-responsive flows at each core router. Fairness can be achieved by one extra smart market label in each packet. Through simulations, CSLF and CR-CSFQ are shown to achieve fair allocation effectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
