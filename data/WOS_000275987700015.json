This framework is able to improve the binarization results and to restore weak connections and strokes, especially in the case of degraded historical documents. This is achieved thanks to localized nature of the framework on the spatial domain. The framework requires several binarizations on different scales, which is addressed by introduction of fast grid-based models. This enables us to explore high scales which are usually unreachable to the traditional approaches. In order to expand our set of adaptive methods, an adaptive modification of Otsu's method, called AdOtsu, is introduced. In addition, in order to restore document images suffering from bleed-through degradation, we combine the framework with recursive adaptive methods. The framework shows promising performance in subjective and objective evaluations performed on available datasets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
