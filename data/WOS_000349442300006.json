Clinical laxity assessments are commonly performed along a single axis of motion, and lack analyses of primary and coupled motions in terms of translations and rotations of the knee. Radial basis functions (RBFs) allow multiple DOF to be incorporated into a single method that accounts for all DOF equally. To evaluate this method, tibiofemoral kinematics were experimentally collected from a single cadaveric specimen during a manual laxity assessment. A radial basis function (RBF) analysis was used to approximate new points over a uniform grid space. The normalized root mean square errors of the approximated points were below 4% for all DOF. This method provides a unique approach to describing joint laxity that incorporates multiple DOF in a single model.", "paper_title": "Technical note: a multi-dimensional description of knee laxity using radial basis functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000349442300006"}
