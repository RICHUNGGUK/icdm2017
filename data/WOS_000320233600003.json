Heterogenous information networks contain vertices of several entity types, such as papers, authors and terms, and hence can fully reflect multiple linkage relationships among different entities. Such a heterogeneous information network is similar to a mixed media graph (MMG). By representing a bibliographic dataset as an MMG, the performance obtained when searching relevant entities (e.g., papers) can be improved. Furthermore, our academic search enables multiple-entity search, where a variety of entity search results are provided, such as relevant papers, authors and conferences, via a one-time query. Explicitly, given a bibliographic dataset, we propose a Global-MMG, in which a global heterogeneous information network is built. When a user submits a query keyword, we perform a random walk with restart (RWR) to retrieve papers or other types of entity objects. To reduce the query response time, algorithm Net-MMG (standing for NetClus-based MMG) is developed. Algorithm Net-MMG first divides a heterogeneous information network into a collection of sub-networks. Afterward, the Net-MMG performs a RWR on a set of selected relevant sub-networks. We implemented our academic search and conducted extensive experiments using the ACM Digital Library. The experimental results show that by exploring heterogeneous information networks and RWR, both the Global-MMG and Net-MMG achieve better search quality compared with existing academic search services. In addition, the Net-MMG has a shorter query response time while still guaranteeing good quality in search results.", "paper_title": "Exploring heterogeneous information networks and random walk with restart for academic search", "paper_id": "WOS:000320233600003"}
