The proposed ADRC consists of the tracking differentiator (TD), the extended state observer (ESO) and the nonlinear state error feedback (NLSEF). In this approach, the double-loop system with time delay is treated as two correlated control loops according to the best variable pairs selection, the interactions of two control loops are estimated by the extended state observers, and the nonlinear state error feedback compensates the interactions. Those two filters were designed to reduce the interactions of each loop, so that a good decoupling control performance is obtained. The theoretical results are illustrated via simulation studies.", "paper_title": "ACTIVE DECOUPLING FOR DOUBLE-LOOP DELAYED SYSTEMS WITH ADRC TECHNIQUES", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033100010"}
