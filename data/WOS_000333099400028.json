For n odd, we prove that the PMEPR of each standard binary Golay sequence of length 2(n) is exactly 2, and determine the location(s), where peaks occur for each sequence. For n even, we prove that the envelope power of such sequences can never reach 2(n+1) at time points t is an element of {(v/2(u))vertical bar 0 <= v <= 2(u), v, u is an element of N}. We further identify eight sequences of length 2(4) and eight sequences of length 2(6) that have PMEPR exactly 2, and raise the question whether, asymptotically, it is possible for standard binary Golay sequences to have PMEPR less than 2 - epsilon, where epsilon > 0.", "paper_title": "On the PMEPR of Binary Golay Sequences of Length 2(n)", "paper_id": "WOS:000333099400028"}
