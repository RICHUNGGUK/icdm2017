For the two samples, the IF and the h-index rankings of the journals are very different. The correlation coefficient between the IF and the h-index is high for Psychiatry but lower for Pharmacology. The linearity test performed between the h-index and IF(alpha/alpha+1).n(1/alpha+1) showed the great sensitivity of the model compared with alpha. The IF and h-index can be completely complementary when evaluating journals of the same scientific discipline.", "paper_title": "Comparative analysis between impact factor and h-index for pharmacology and psychiatry journals", "paper_id": "WOS:000278267100007"}
