However, integrating MANETs cwith the Internet gives rise to a number of challenges such as the extensions to both Mobile IP and ad hoc routing protocols. Many technical issues still remain unsolved in this field. This article presents a detailed survey of state-of-the-art designs. Open research issues are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
