However, some systems can only be properly described when time constraints are considered, advocating the adoption of models with the notion of time. In this paper, a method for deriving conformance tests with the guaranteed fault coverage from a Timed FSM (TFSM) with a single clock is presented. Test derivation is based on a given fault domain that allows the derivation of test suites with reasonable length. More precisely, the fault domain includes every possible faulty TFSM implementation with the known largest time constraints boundaries and minimal duration of time guards. Given a deterministic possibly partial TFSM specification, a complete test suite that guarantees the detection of all faulty implementations with respect to the above fault domain is derived. Experiments with randomly generated timed FSMs are conducted to determine length of obtained test suites and assess the impact of varying the TFSM specification parameters on length of obtained test suites. Further, experiments with both untimed and timed machines are conducted and these experiments show that similar patterns for timed and untimed machines are obtained with respect to varying the number of states, inputs, and outputs of machines.
