Two flexible and generic frameworks are proposed to achieve supervised DR (SDR) for multilabel classification. One is able to extend any existing single-label SDR to multilabel via sample duplication, referred to as MESD. The other is a multilabel design framework that tackles the SDR problem by computing weight (proximity) matrices based on simultaneous feature and label information, referred to as MOPE, as a generalization of many current techniques. A diverse set of different schemes for label-based proximity calculation, as well as a mechanism for combining label-based and feature-based weight information by considering information importance and prioritization, are proposed for MOPE. Additionally, we summarize many current spectral methods for unsupervised DR (UDR), single/multilabel SDR, and semi-supervised DR (SSDR) and express them under a common template representation as a general guide to researchers in the field. We also propose a general framework for achieving SSDR by combining existing SDR and UDR models, and also a procedure of reducing the computational cost via learning with a target set of relation features. The effectiveness of our proposed methodologies is demonstrated with experiments with document collections for multilabel text categorization from the natural language processing domain.", "paper_title": "Proximity-Based Frameworks for Generating Embeddings from Multi-Output Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000308755000013"}
