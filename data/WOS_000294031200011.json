Thus, these problems do not allow polynomial time preprocessing that results in instances whose size is bounded by a polynomial in the parameter at hand. We build upon recent results by Bodlaender et al. [6] and Fortnow and Santhanam [20], that show that NP-complete problems that are 'or-compositional' do not have polynomial kernels, unless NP subset of coNP/poly. To this machinery, we add a notion of transformation, and obtain that DISJOINT CYCLES, and DISJOINT PATHS do not have polynomial kernels, unless NP subset of coNP/poly. For the proof, we introduce a problem on strings, called DISJOINT FACTORS, and first show that this problem has no polynomial kernel unless NP subset of coNP/poly. We also show that the related DISJOINT CYCLES PACKING problem has a kernel of size O(k log k). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
