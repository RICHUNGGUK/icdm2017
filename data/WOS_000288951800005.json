Both plate shape optimisation and plate fit quantification are conducted in a virtual environment utilising computer graphical methods and 3D bone and plate models. Two optimised shapes of the undersurface of an existing distal medial tibia plate were generated based on a dataset of 45 3D bone models reconstructed from computed tomography image data of Japanese tibiae. The existing plate shape achieved an anatomical fit on 13% of tibiae from the dataset. Modified plate 1 achieved an anatomical fit for 42% and modified plate 2 a fit for 67% of the bones. If either modified plate 1 or plate 2 is used, then the anatomical fit can be increased to 82% for the same dataset. Issues pertaining to any further improvement in plate fit/shape are discussed.", "paper_title": "Fit optimisation of a distal medial tibia plate", "paper_id": "WOS:000288951800005"}
