For example, the recent work on routing on the Internet over multiple paths and Multipath TCP both seek to make the best possible use of multiple connecting paths between two end points. In deployments where multiple users could share multiple paths, one of the very first questions that comes to mind is, should we schedule packets from the users on a per-flow or per-packet basis? In this paper we study networking scenarios in which several networks are connected to each other via multiple paths. We seek to understand how a multi-homed router should schedule packets and packet flows out towards other networks. Our primary interests are to study path utilization and analyze the bandwidth fairness of various approaches using different traffic loads. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
