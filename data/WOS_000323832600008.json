Since wrong configurations may lead to loss of an enormous amount of customer traffic, highly experienced network administrators are typically the ones who are trusted for the management and configuration of a running ISP network. We frame the management and experimentation of a network as a \"game\" for training network administrators without having to risk the network operation. The interactive environment treats the trainee network administrators as players of a game and tests them with various network failures or dynamics.", "paper_title": "Network Management Game", "paper_id": "WOS:000323832600008"}
