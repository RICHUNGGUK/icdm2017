The number of unknowns. equals the number of discretization panels n, which is much greater than the number of conductors m The authors present a capacitance-extraction algorithm RedCap that first reduces the BEM system of size n into a small system of size 0 (m) and then solves the small system to compute the capacitances. RedCap uses a number of techniques, including the hierarchical-refinement technique of HiCap [Shi et al., 20021, the dense-to-sparse transformation of PHiCap [Yan et al., 2005], a reordering of the sparse linear system, and an incomplete LU factorization, to obtain the reduced system. RedCap achieves a significant speed improvement over previous methods. On benchmark problems with conductors in uniform and multilayer dielectrics, RedCap is up to 100 times faster than FastCap [Nabors and White, 1991] and up to four times faster than PHiCap [Yan et al., 20051, while restricting error to within 2% of FastCap.", "paper_title": "Fast 3-D capacitance extraction by inexact factorization and reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000240926700033"}
