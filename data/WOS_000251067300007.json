One of the possible alternatives to achieve a faster convergence is to use a relaxed form of Pareto dominance that allows us to regulate the granularity of the approximation of the Pareto front that we wish to achieve. One such relaxed forms of Pareto dominance that has become popular in the last few years is epsilon-dominance, which has been mainly used as an archiving strategy in some multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Despite its advantages, epsilon-dominance has some limitations. In this paper, we propose a mechanism that can be seen as a variant of epsilon-dominance, which we call Pareto-adaptive epsilon-dominance (pa epsilon-dominance). Our proposed approach tries to overcome the main limitation of c-dominance: the loss of several nondominated solutions from the hypergrid adopted in the archive because of the way in which solutions are selected within each box.", "paper_title": "Pareto-adaptive epsilon-dominance", "paper_id": "WOS:000251067300007"}
