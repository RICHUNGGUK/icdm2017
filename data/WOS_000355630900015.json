Suppose that d >= 2, r > 0 and 0 < p < 1 are constants, and k >= alpha ln n/ ln d for any fixed alpha > 1/2. We prove that lim(n ->infinity) Pr [I is satisfiable] = {(1)(0) (r < 1)(r > 1), . Similar results also hold for the k-hyper-F-linear CSP which is obtained by incorporating certain algebraic structures to the domains and constraint relations of k-CSP.", "paper_title": "On the constraint length of random -CSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000355630900015"}
