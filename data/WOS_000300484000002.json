To this end, evolutionary optimization algorithms (EA) stand as viable methodologies mainly due to their ability to find and capture multiple solutions within a population in a single simulation run. With the preselection method suggested in 1970, there has been a steady suggestion of new algorithms. Most of these methodologies employed a niching scheme in an existing single-objective evolutionary algorithm framework so that similar solutions in a population are deemphasized in order to focus and maintain multiple distant yet near-optimal solutions. In this paper, we use a completely different strategy in which the single-objective multimodal optimization problem is converted into a suitable bi-objective optimization problem so that all optimal solutions become members of the resulting weak Pareto-optimal set. With the modified definitions of domination and different formulations of an artificially created additional objective function, we present successful results on problems with as large as 500 optima. Most past multimodal EA studies considered problems having only a few variables. In this paper, we have solved up to 16-variable test problems having as many as 48 optimal solutions and for the first time suggested multimodal constrained test problems which are scalable in terms of number of optima, constraints, and variables. The concept of using bi-objective optimization for solving single-objective multimodal optimization problems seems novel and interesting, and more importantly opens up further avenues for research and application.", "paper_title": "Multimodal Optimization Using a Bi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000300484000002"}
