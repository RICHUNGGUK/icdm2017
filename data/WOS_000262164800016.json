In this paper, a novel power gating approach by using the controlling value of logic elements is proposed, In the proposed method, sleep signals of the power-gated blocks are extracted completely front the original circuits Without any extra logic element. A basic algorithm and it probability-based heuristic algorithm have been developed to implement the basic idea. The steady maximum delay constraint has also been introduced to handle the delay issues. Experiments on the ISCAS'85 benchmarks show that averagely 15-36% of logic elements could he power gated at a time for random input patterns, and 3-31% of elements could be stopped under the steady maximum delay constraints. we also show a power optimizition method for AND/OR tree circuits, in which more than 80% of gates can be power-gated.", "paper_title": "Fine-Grained Power Gating Based on the Controlling Value of Logic Elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800016"}
