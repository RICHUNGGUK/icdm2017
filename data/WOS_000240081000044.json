For example, in supply chain applications, the company can constantly track the movements of goods. Also, for Body Area Network or Personal Area Work, the tag is used for identifying a person. However, the movements and current locations of goods and a person's activity profiles are the sensitive information and should be kept secret. This paper develops the interaction protocols between readers and tags to address this privacy issue of protecting tagged objects from tracking and tracing by nonauthorized readers.", "paper_title": "Authorized tracking and tracing for RFID tags", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000044"}
