An instance of the problem on a set of embedded sources and a sink asks for a directed tree T spanning of these nodes and a bounded number of Steiner points, such that Sigma(e is an element of E(T)) f(e)vertical bar e vertical bar(2) is a minimum, where f(e) is the flow on edge e. The edges are uncapacitated and the flows are determined additively, that is, the flow on an edge leaving a node u will be the sum of the flows on all edges entering u. Our motivation for studying this problem is its utility as a model for relay augmentation of wireless sensor networks. In these scenarios, one seeks to optimize power consumption-which is predominantly due to communication and, in free space, is proportional to the square of transmission distance-in the network by introducing additional relays. We prove several geometric and combinatorial results on the structure of optimal and locally optimal solution-trees (under various strategies for bounding the number of Steiner points) and describe a geometric linear-time algorithm for constructing such trees with known topologies.
