It is quite important as well as very complicated to determine the time-optimum sequence of the task-points visited by the end-effector's tip only once assuring that the manipulator's motion through the successive task-points is collision-free. This paper introduces a method for simultaneously planning collision-free motion and scheduling time-optimal route along a set of given task-points. This method is based on the projection of the workspace and the robot on the B-Surface to formulate an objective function for the minimization of the cycle time in visiting multiple task-points and taken into account the multiple solutions of the inverse kinematics and the obstacle avoidance. A modified GA with special encoding to encounter the multiplicity of the robot inverse kinematics and the required intermediate configurations is used for the searching of the optimal solution on the B-Surface. The simulation results show the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed approach to determine a suboptimal tour for multi-goal motion planning in complex environments cluttered with obstacles.
