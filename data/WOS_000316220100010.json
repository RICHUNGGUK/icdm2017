Specifically, we are targeting applications characterized by complex geometrical features. Viscous fingering instabilities play a very important role in carbon sequestration in brine aquifers. The proposed method has the ability to preserve high order of accuracy on completely unstructured meshes, a feature that makes it ideal for high-fidelity computations of the challenging fingering flow patterns and very complex geometries of actual reservoirs and aquifers. An extensive set of numerical computations is also included, to confirm the stability, accuracy, and robustness of the method.", "paper_title": "Computing gravity-driven viscous fingering in complex subsurface geometries: A high-order discontinuous Galerkin approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000316220100010"}
