PIANA can also be used as a stand-alone application to create protein interaction networks and perform tasks such as predicting protein interactions and helping to identify spots in a 2D electrophoresis gel.", "paper_title": "PIANA: protein interactions and network analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000236612900020"}
