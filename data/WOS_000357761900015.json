Moving object detection is relatively difficult for video captured by a moving camera, since camera motion and object motion are mixed. In the proposed method, the feature points in the frames are found and then classified as belonging to foreground or background features. Next, moving object regions are obtained using an integration scheme based on foreground feature points and foreground regions, which are obtained using an image difference scheme. Then, a compensation scheme based on the motion history of the continuous motion contours obtained from three consecutive frames is applied to increase the regions of moving objects. Moving objects are detected using a refinement scheme and a minimum bounding box. Finally, moving object tracking is achieved using a Kalman filter based on the center of gravity of a moving object region in the minimum bounding box. Experimental results show that the proposed method has good performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
