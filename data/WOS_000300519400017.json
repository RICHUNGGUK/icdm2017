Different from traditional circuit-switched network, in IMS, the media traffic and signaling are delivered through IP transport. The media traffic may affect the signaling efficiency in core network, due to traffic collisions and best effort packets delivery. This paper proposes a novel path-migration mechanism for enhancing the traffic efficiency in integrated NGN-IMS. The simulation results show that the interference and traffic collision can be reduce by applying proposed path-migration mechanism and the signaling efficiency in core network can be improved with higher system capability and voice quality.", "paper_title": "Advanced Path-Migration Mechanism for Enhancing Signaling Efficiency in IP Multimedia Subsystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000300519400017"}
