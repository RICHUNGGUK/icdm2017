Experimental dataset employed for the purpose has been generated through full factorial experimental design. Laser power, welding speeds and wires feed rate are considered as controllable input parameters. These soft computing models employ a trained ANN for calculation of objective function value and thereby eliminate the need of closed form objective function. Among 11 tested networks, the ANN with best prediction performance produces maximum percentage error of only 3.21%. During optimisation ANN-GA is found to show best performance with absolute percentage error of only 0.09% during experimental validation. Low value of percentage error indicates efficacy of models. Welding speed has been found as most influencing factor for welding strength. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
