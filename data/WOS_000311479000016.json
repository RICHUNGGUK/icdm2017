Several sufficient conditions for finite-time boundness and stability of switched system are proposed in this article. By comparing the proposed results, it is shown that more the information about the switching signal is known, less conservative results can be derived. Then, based on the finite-time stability analysis results, static state and dynamic output feedback controllers are designed to finite-time stabilise switched linear systems. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed results within this article.", "paper_title": "Finite-time stability and stabilisation for switched linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000311479000016"}
