Simulated results for six benchmark functions show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the original IWO algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm is used to the pattern synthesis of array antennas. Compared to the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), the advantages of IWO-SQA algorithm are shown. As another application, the phase-only pattern reconfigurable arrays are synthesized by IWO-SQA algorithm, and the numerical results show that IWO-SQA algorithm is superior to GA. All the testing results show that it is an effective improvement to embed SQA into IWO algorithm. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
