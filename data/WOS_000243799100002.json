Most existing wireless P2P applications concern merely the sharing of a variety of contents. For magnifying the sharing extent for wireless service provision in the vicinity (i.e., the wireless P2P environments), this paper presents the UbiSrvInt approach and this is the first attempt to enable a pure P2P solution that is context aware and fault tolerant for ad hoc wireless service provision. This approach empowers an autonomous peer to propel distributed problem solving (e.g., in the travel domain) through service sharing and execution in an intelligent P2P way. This approach of ad hoc wireless service provision is not only highly robust to failure (based on a specific clustering analysis of failure correlation among peers) but also capable of inferring a user's service needs (through a BDI reasoning mechanism utilizing the surrounding context) in ad hoc wireless environments. We have implemented UbiSrvInt into a system platform with P-JXTA that shows fairly promising performance results on fault tolerance and context awareness. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
