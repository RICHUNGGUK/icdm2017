The existing methods for monitoring PDP performance, however, are either cumbersome or fail to connect the competitive priorities to the performance management process. Accordingly, in this paper, a model to evaluate PDP performance is considered as a multi-criteria decision-making problem; and a solution method, based on DEMATEL and ANP, is proposed. The evaluation criteria set was developed using the concept of competitive priorities, and the overall model was applied to an actual data set from a group of machine manufacturers in Turkey. The use scenarios for the model are also discussed.", "paper_title": "A TOOL FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PERFORMANCE MONITORING (PDPM) FOR ALIGNMENT WITH COMPETITIVE PRIORITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000329048600012"}
