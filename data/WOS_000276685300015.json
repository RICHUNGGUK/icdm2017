It is shown that DM(N) network possesses many good properties simultaneously. These good properties include all those of existing rearrangeable nonblocking photonic multi-log(2) N networks and new ones such as O(log N)-time fast parallel self-routing, nonblocking multiple-multicast, and cost-effective crosstalk-free wavelength dilation, which existing rearrangeable nonblocking multi-log(2) N networks do not have. The advantages of DM(N) over existing multi-log(2) N networks, especially Log(2) (N,0,2(left perpendicularlog2N/2right perpendicular)), are achieved by employing a two-level load balancing scheme-a combination of static load balancing and dynamic load balancing. DM(N) and Log(2) (N,0,2(left perpendicularlog2N/2right perpendicular)) are about the same in structure. The additional cost is for the intraplane routing preprocessing circuits. Considering the extended capabilities of DM(N) and current mature and cheap electronic technology, this extra cost is well justified.", "paper_title": "A Parallel Self-Routing Rearrangeable Nonblocking Multi-log(2) N Photonic Switching Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000276685300015"}
