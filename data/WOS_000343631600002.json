The system is based on use of the Microsoft Kinect device and a novel software developed by the authors which enables a tridimensional digital model of a selected area of an outcrop to be captured. With the tridimensional model, clasts are stacked using new segmentation algorithms based on level sets and Fourier analysis. The resulting binary image (clasts and matrix) is analyzed by means of the Rosiwal stereological method. The granulometric Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), obtained automatically by this new methodology, was compared to the granulometric CDF, obtained manually by the Rosiwal technique, by means of a Kolmogorov-Smimov test. The comparison showed good agreement between the methods and demonstrated that this inexpensive system (already used in several scientific fields) with great potential can also be used to obtain fast, automatic and accurate grain size distributions of sedimentary deposits. The software tools used to control the Kinect device, which provide the three-dimensional elevation models of the outcrops and allows its analysis, are freely available from the author.
