Guaranteeing RT in the presence of such timing imperfections is essential for building dependable NAS, and to avoid costly upgrades after deployment in industries. This investigation proposes a methodology and work-flow that combines modelling, simulation, verification, experiments, and software tools to verify the RT of the NAS during the design, rather than after deployment. The RT evaluation work-flow has three phases: model building, modelling and verification. During the model building phase component reaction times are specified and their timing performance is measured by combining experiments with simulation. During the modelling phase, component based mathematical models that capture the network architecture and inter-connection are proposed. Composition of the component models gives the NAS model required for studying the RI performance on system level. Finally, in the verification step, the NAS formal models are abstracted as UPPAAL timed automata with their timing interfaces. To model timing interfaces, the action patterns, and their timing wrapper are proposed. The formal model of high level of abstraction is used to verify the total response time of the NAS where the reactions to be verified are specified using a subset of timed computation tree logic (TCTL) in UPPAAL model checker. The proposed approach is illustrated on an industrial steam boiler deployment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
