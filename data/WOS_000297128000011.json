First, the definition of fuzzy XNOR connective is proposed and its properties are analyzed. Then, two forms of fuzzy XNOR connectives are obtained by the composition of t-norms, t-conorms and fuzzy negations. Moreover, the relationships between fuzzy XNOR connectives and fuzzy Xor connectives introduced in Bedregal et al. (Electron Notes Theor Comput Sci 247:5-18, 2009) are discussed. At last, two new kinds of fuzzy implications are constructed by fuzzy XNOR connectives and other connectives, their main properties are also studied.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy XNOR connectives in fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000297128000011"}
