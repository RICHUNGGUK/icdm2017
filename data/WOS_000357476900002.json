Interestingly, error due to ignoring dependence can be negligible for a highly reliable system. This paper investigates the reasons and the factors affecting the error. Error in system probability of failure (PF) is small for high reliability when tail-dependence is not very strong or the ratio between individual PFs is large. We created various conditions using copulas and observed the effect of ignoring dependence. Two reliability-based design optimization problems with a 2-bar and a 10-bar trusses are presented to show the effect of error on the optimum design and the system PF calculation. For the 10-bar truss, there were 5 % error in system PF and mass penalty less than 0.1 % in the optimum design for a target system PF of 10(-7) even though five truss failures were strongly correlated.", "paper_title": "The effect of ignoring dependence between failure modes on evaluating system reliability", "paper_id": "WOS:000357476900002"}
