These models allow injury evaluations to be conducted under a variety of conditions, but must be validated against experimental data. An FE model of a cadaveric tibia was developed using geometry from CT scans, and the quality of the mesh was evaluated. Loading and boundary conditions from experimental tests were simulated, and the model was optimised to best represent the response of natural bone to impacts. The model was shown to have good agreement for impact force, duration, impulse and strain during simulation of three non-injurious and one injurious axial impact when compared with experimental test data for the specimen. Failure criteria were evaluated for their ability to predict fracture. This model of the tibia can be used for future injury prediction assessment studies.", "paper_title": "Development of a finite element model of the tibia for short-duration high-force axial impact loading", "paper_id": "WOS:000287492800009"}
