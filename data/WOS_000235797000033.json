Given the time lags, the time-delayed second-order correlation matrices are first diagonalized simultaneously. Then, a genetic algorithm is used to update the time lags. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently accomplish the aforementioned task. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
