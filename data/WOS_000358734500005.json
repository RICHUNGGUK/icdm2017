These computation systems have two key features: the ability to have infinite copies of some objects (within an active environment) and to generate an exponential workspace in polynomial time. In this work, we extend the P-Lingua framework for simulating that kind of P systems taking into account these two features. Consequently, a new simulator has been developed and included in pLinguaCore library. The functioning of the simulator has been checked by simulating efficient solutions to SAT problem using a family of cell-like P systems with symport/antiport rules and membrane division rules or membrane separation rules. The corresponding MeCoSim based application is also provided.", "paper_title": "A P-Lingua Based Simulator for P Systems with Symport/Antiport Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000358734500005"}
