By transforming an OWL DL concept to a set of axioms in description logic SWOIN(D), the fuzzy contrast model computes the similarity of concepts from their semantic descriptions in SWOIN(D). In order to imitate human perception of sameness and difference, fuzzy set is introduced to built intersection and set difference of feature set in our model. An iterative method is proposed to compute the similarity of concepts. Two experimental results are provided to show the effectiveness of fuzzy contrast model.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy contrast model to measure semantic similarity between OWL DL concepts", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000119"}
