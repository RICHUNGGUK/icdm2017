In this paper we describe the CEDR language for expressing complex event queries that filter and correlate events to match specific patterns, and transform the relevant events into new composite events for the use of monitoring applications. Stream-based execution of these standing queries offers instant insight for users to see what is occurring in their systems and to take time-critical actions.", "paper_title": "Event correlation and pattern detection in CEDR", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200070"}
