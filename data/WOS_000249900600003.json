Closed-form solutions are developed for both the inverse and direct kinematics about the redundant parallel manipulator. In performance analysis phase, the dexterity is analyzed, three kinds of singularities are investigated, and the stiffness is estimated. Compared with the corresponding non-redundant parallel manipulator with the redundant link removed, the redundantly actuated one has better dexterity, litter singular configurations and higher stiffness. The redundantly actuated parallel manipulator was applied to the design of a 4-DOF hybrid machine tool which also includes a feed worktable to demonstrate its applicability.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis and application of a redundantly actuated parallel manipulator for milling", "paper_id": "WOS:000249900600003"}
