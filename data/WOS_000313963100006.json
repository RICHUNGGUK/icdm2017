In addition we determine some primitive designs that are held by codewords of particular weights in the codes, and using the properties of the graphs and their geometry we provide a geometrical description of the nature of several classes of codewords. The codes with parameters [120, 100, 6](2) and [120, 101, 6](2) are near optimal as they are a distance 2 and 1 respectively more than the theoretical upper bound on the minimum distance for a code of the given length and dimension. Those with parameters [105, 87, 5](2) and [253, 231, 5](2) are a distance 1 less that the known recorded distance.", "paper_title": "Binary codes of some strongly regular subgraphs of the McLaughlin graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000313963100006"}
