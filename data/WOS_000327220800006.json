One approach to face this drawback relies on changing the curve for an isogenous one, until a resistant curve is found. This paper focuses on an alternative strategy: exploiting the properties of a recently introduced form of elliptic curves, Edwards curves. We show that these curves achieve conditions for being resistant to ZVP-attacks. Hence, using Edwards curves is a good countermeasure to avoid these attacks.", "paper_title": "On Edwards curves and ZVP-attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327220800006"}
