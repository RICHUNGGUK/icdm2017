Many schemes have been proposed to mitigate or tolerate such attacks, but very few can effectively and efficiently identify the intruders. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective scheme, which can identify misbehaving forwarders that drop or modify packets. Extensive analysis and simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme.", "paper_title": "Catching Packet Droppers and Modifiers in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301890400005"}
