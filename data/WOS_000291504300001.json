Large-scale systems, often with high dimensions, nonlinear interconnections and stochastic parameters, are those that can be decomposed into subsystems or their constituencies are not centrally located together. LSS can be integrated to form complex systems called a system of systems or cyber-physical systems. This new class of systems has created new challenges for systems engineering (SE) to extend theoretical foundations of SE to SoS Engineering (SoSE). Therefore an opportunity may exist now to start a new engineering field may be on the horizon - System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) or CPS Engineering. A SoS or a CPS is a collection of individual, possibly heterogeneous, but are functional, wirelessly integrated together to enhance the overall robustness, lower the cost of operation, and increase reliability of the complex system. Many key issues like architecture, modeling, simulation, identification, emergence, standards, net-centricity, control, etc. are all begging for attention. In this paper, we will be going through one key issue - control.", "paper_title": "From Large-Scale Systems to Cyber-Physical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000291504300001"}
