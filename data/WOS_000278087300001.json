Specifically, the class of denial constraints is considered. We show that, given a database and a set of denial constraints, there exists a (unique) disjunctive database, called canonical, which represents the repairs of the database w.r.t. the constraints and is contained in any other disjunctive database with the same set of minimal models. We propose an algorithm for computing the canonical disjunctive database. Finally, we study the size of the canonical disjunctive database in the presence of functional dependencies for both subset-based repairs and cardinality-based repairs.", "paper_title": "Disjunctive databases for representing repairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000278087300001"}
