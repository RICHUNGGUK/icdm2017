By using the properties of M-cone, eigenspace of the spectral radius of nonnegative matrices, Lyapunov functional, It's formula and inequality techniques, several new sufficient conditions guaranteeing the mean square exponential stability of its equilibrium solution are obtained. The derived results are less conservative than the results recently presented in Wang and Xu (Chaos Solitons Fractals 42:2713-2721, 2009), Zhang and Li (Stability analysis of impulsive stochastic fuzzy cellular neural networks with time varying delays and reaction-diffusion terms. World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology 2010), Huang (Chaos Solitons Fractals 31:658-664, 2007), and Wang (Chaos Solitons Fractals 38:878-885, 2008). In fact, the systems discussed in Wang and Xu (Chaos Solitons Fractals 42:2713-2721, 2009), Zhang and Li (Stability analysis of impulsive stochastic fuzzy cellular neural networks with time varying delays and reaction-diffusion terms. World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology 2010), Huang (Chaos Solitons Fractals 31:658-664, 2007), and Wang (Chaos Solitons Fractals 38:878-885, 2008) are special cases of ours. Two examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the results.", "paper_title": "Exponential stability of impulsive stochastic fuzzy cellular neural networks with mixed delays and reaction-diffusion terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200055"}
