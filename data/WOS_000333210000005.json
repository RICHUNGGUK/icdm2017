We discuss its annotation scheme, consisting of three interlinked tiers, designed to handle a wide range of error types present in the input. Each tier corrects different types of errors; links between the tiers allow capturing errors in word order and complex discontinuous expressions. Errors are not only corrected, but also classified. The annotation scheme is tested on a data set including approx. 175,000 words with fair inter-annotator agreement results. We also explore the possibility of applying automated linguistic annotation tools (taggers, spell checkers and grammar checkers) to the learner text to support or even substitute manual annotation.", "paper_title": "Evaluating and automating the annotation of a learner corpus", "paper_id": "WOS:000333210000005"}
