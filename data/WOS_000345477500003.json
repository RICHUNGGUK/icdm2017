The inner cylinder is rotating and the outer one is held at rest. As the endwall effects play a significant role in determining the vortical structure, three endwall conditions are taken into account in present study: all are fixed, all are rotating with the inner cylinder, one is fixed but the other is rotating with the inner cylinder. All the boundaries are assumed to be insulating, and the chosen aspect ratio, the height of the cylinder to the gap width, is moderate Gamma = 10, hence the endwall effects and the Taylor vortex can be both considered. The governing equations are solved using collocation spectral method and projection method which allows pressure-velocity decoupling. The flow patterns and developments of vortical structure with different endwall conditions are presented at various strength of axial magnetic field. The effects of axial magnetic field on magnetohydrodynamics flow are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
