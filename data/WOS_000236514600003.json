First, geometric holes can be robustly identified from noisy and defective data sets without the need for any normal or orientation information. The geometry and texture information of the holes can then be determined either automatically from the models' context, or interactively from users' selection. We use local parameterizations to align patches in order to extract their curvature-driven digital signature. After identifying the patch that most resembles each hole region, the geometry and texture information can be completed by warping the candidate region and gluing it onto the hole area. The displacement vector field for the exact alignment process is computed by solving a Poisson equation with boundary conditions. Our experiments show that the unified framework, founded upon the techniques of deformable models, local parameterization, and PDE modeling, can provide a robust and elegant solution for content completion of defective, complex point surfaces.", "paper_title": "Surface completion for shape and appearance", "paper_id": "WOS:000236514600003"}
