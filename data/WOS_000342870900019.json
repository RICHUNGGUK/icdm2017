A sample separation margin based minimum classification error criterion is adopted in IVN-based training, while an Rprop algorithm is used for optimizing the objective function. For the IVN approach based on piecewise linear transforms, the corresponding recognizer can be made both compact and efficient by using a two-level fast-match tree whose internal nodes coincide with the labels of feature transforms. Furthermore, the IVN system using weighted sum of linear transforms outperforms that based on piecewise linear transforms. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is first confirmed using an in-house developed online Chinese handwriting corpus with a vocabulary of 9306 characters, and then further verified on a standard benchmark database for an online handwritten character recognition task with a vocabulary of 3755 characters.
