In the proposed solution, first a set of 3D facial landmarks are automatically detected, then the local characteristics of the face in the neighborhoods of the facial landmarks and their mutual distances are used to model the facial deformation. Training two hidden Markov models for each facial expression to be recognized, and combining them to form a multiclass classifier, an average recognition rate of 79.4 % has been obtained for the 3D dynamic sequences showing the six prototypical facial expressions of the Binghamton University 4D Facial Expression database. Comparisons with competitor approaches on the same database show that our solution is able to obtain effective results with the advantage of being capable to process facial sequences in real-time.", "paper_title": "Automatic facial expression recognition in real-time from dynamic sequences of 3D face scans", "paper_id": "WOS:000326929200009"}
