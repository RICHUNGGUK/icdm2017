It is known that testing 1-planarity of a graph is NP-complete. In this paper, we consider maximal 1-planar graphs. A graph G is maximal 1-planar if addition of any edge destroys 1-planarity of G. We first study combinatorial properties of maximal 1-planar embeddings. In particular, we show that in a maximal 1-planar embedding, the graph induced by the non-crossing edges is spanning and biconnected. Using the properties, we show that the problem of testing maximal 1-planarity of a graph G can be solved in linear time, if a rotation system Phi (i.e., the circular ordering of edges for each vertex) is given. We also prove that there is at most one maximal 1-planar embedding xi of G that is consistent with the given rotation system Phi. Our algorithm also produces such an embedding in linear time, if it exists. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
