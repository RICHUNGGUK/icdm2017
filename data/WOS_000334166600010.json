First, we introduce a novel general estimation of distribution algorithm to deal with permutation-based optimization problems. The algorithm is based on the use of a probabilistic model for permutations called the generalized Mallows model. In order to prove the potential of the proposed algorithm, our second aim is to solve the permutation flowshop scheduling problem. A hybrid approach consisting of the new estimation of distribution algorithm and a variable neighborhood search is proposed. Conducted experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to outperform the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, from the 220 benchmark instances tested, the proposed hybrid approach obtains new best known results in 152 cases. An in-depth study of the results suggests that the successful performance of the introduced approach is due to the ability of the generalized Mallows estimation of distribution algorithm to discover promising regions in the search space.", "paper_title": "A Distance-Based Ranking Model Estimation of Distribution Algorithm for the Flowshop Scheduling Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000334166600010"}
