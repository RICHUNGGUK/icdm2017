Furthermore, when using traditional association rule mining, regional patterns frequently fail to be discovered due to insufficient global confidence and/or support. In this paper, we systematically study this problem and address the unique challenges of regional association mining and scoping: (1) region discovery: how to identify interesting regions from which novel and useful regional association rules can be extracted; (2) regional association rule scoping: how to determine the scope of regional association rules. We investigate the duality between regional association rules and regions where the associations are valid: interesting regions are identified to seek novel regional patterns, and a regional pattern has a scope of a set of regions in which the pattern is valid. In particular, we present a reward-based region discovery framework that employs a divisive grid-based supervised clustering for region discovery. We evaluate our approach in a real-world case study to identify spatial risk patterns from arsenic in the Texas water supply. Our experimental results confirm and validate research results in the study of arsenic contamination, and our work leads to the discovery of novel findings to be further explored by domain scientists.", "paper_title": "A framework for regional association rule mining and scoping in spatial datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000286433600001"}
