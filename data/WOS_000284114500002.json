Sound is produced without loudspeakers using electromagnetic actuators to directly manipulate the piano strings, expanding its vocabulary to include infinite sustain, notes that crescendo from silence, harmonics, and a variety of timbres. A feedback-based approach senses string vibrations from a single pickup on the soundboard, using filters and phase-locked loops to generate signals which reinforce the natural motion of each string. Signal-routing hardware enables coverage of all 88 notes of the piano using a standard digital audio interface. This paper describes the hardware, software, and performing interface of the instrument and presents measurements of amplitude, frequency response, and phase-locked loop performance. Sounds generated by the actuators achieve similar amplitudes to the traditional piano, and while they cannot replicate the rapid attack produced by a piano hammer, they complement the percussive nature of the piano by enabling continuous legato control of amplitude, frequency, and timbre.", "paper_title": "The Magnetic Resonator Piano: Electronic Augmentation of an Acoustic Grand Piano", "paper_id": "WOS:000284114500002"}
