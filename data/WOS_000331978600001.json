In this paper we present a new mobile robotics orientated 3D registration method that improves previous Iterative Closest Points based solutions both in speed and accuracy. As an initial step, we perform a low cost computational method to obtain descriptions for 3D scenes planar surfaces. Then, from these descriptions we apply a force system in order to compute accurately and efficiently a six degrees of freedom egomotion. We describe the basis of our approach and demonstrate its validity with several experiments using different kinds of 3D sensors and different 3D real environments.", "paper_title": "A robust and fast method for 6DoF motion estimation from generalized 3D data", "paper_id": "WOS:000331978600001"}
