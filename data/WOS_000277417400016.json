The previous two-layer distributed intrusion detection system has been expanded into a three-layer structure, the new layer of which can monitor the livelihood of each detection agent and utilize the negotiation-coordination mechanism to adjust the working way of each agent for protecting the security of system. In this paper, we propose a quantitative analysis method of agent livelihood in distributed intrusion detection system and further present the design method of living agent. Finally, through the analysis of system working flow and the detection effect of distributed denial of service attack, we have shown that the security and stability of the novel distributed intrusion detection system is effectively enhanced and the agent can work normally in strict restraint strong countermeasure environment.", "paper_title": "Research on distributed intrusion detection system based on multi-living agent", "paper_id": "WOS:000277417400016"}
