In this paper, for a prime p 1 mod 4 and an odd integer k, we study the cross correlation between a p-ary m-sequence {s(t)} of period p(n) - 1 and its decimated sequence {s(dt)}, where d =(p(k)+1)(2)/2(p(e)+1), e vertical bar k and n = 2 k. Using quadratic form polynomial theory, we obtain the distribution of the cross correlation which is six-valued. Specially, our results show that the magnitude of the cross correlation is upper bounded by 2 root p(n) + 1 for p = 5 and e = 1, which is meaningful in CDMA communication systems.", "paper_title": "THE CROSS-CORRELATION DISTRIBUTION OF A p-ARY m-SEQUENCE OF PERIOD p(2k)-1 AND ITS DECIMATED SEQUENCE BY (p(k)+1)(2)/2(p(e)+1)", "paper_id": "WOS:000326231000002"}
