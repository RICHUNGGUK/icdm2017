The formulation is based on alternative boundary conditions which is not restricted to periodic assumptions of the unit cell response that is required in the classical theory. This approach provides a reduced computational cost model of the macroscopic/global problem while preserving the accuracy at the microscale problem. We conclude with a numerical verification study.
