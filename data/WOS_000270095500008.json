This is,in open problem for automated theorem proving. Our system solves all but six out of 121 instances formed from 11 common axiomatizations of seven modal logics. Thus, although the problem is undecidable in general, our approach is empirically successful in practically relevant situations. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
