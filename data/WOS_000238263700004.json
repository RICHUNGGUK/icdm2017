In these applications, human visual system (HVS) often gives the final evaluation of the processed results. In this paper, we first propose a novel color image enhancement method, which is named HVS Controlled Color Image Enhancement and Evaluation algorithm (HCCIEE algorithm). We then applied the HCCIEE to color image by considering natural image quality metrics. This HCCIEE algorithm is base on multiscale representation of pattern, luminance, and color processing in the HVS. Experiments illustrated that the HCCIEE algorithm can produce distinguished details without ringing or halo artifacts. (These two problems often occur in conventional multiscale enhancement techniques.) As a result, the experimental results appear as similar as possible to the viewers' perception of the actual scenes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
