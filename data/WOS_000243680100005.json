This program couples a molecular dynamics code to a Graphical User Interface and runs on a UNIX-X11 Window System platform with the MOTIF library, which is contained in many standard Linux releases. ALINE is written in C, thus giving the user the possibility to modify the source code, and, at the same time, provides an effective and user-friendly framework for numerical experiments, in which the main parameters can be interactively varied and the system visualized in various ways. We illustrate the main features of the program through some examples of detection and dynamical tracking of point-defects, linear defects, and planar defects, such as stacking faults in lattice-mismatched heterostructures. Method of solution: Simplifications of the simulation work described above strongly depend also oil the computer performance. It has now become possible to realize some of such simplifications thanks to the real possibility of using interactive programs. The solution proposed here is based on the development of an interactive graphical simulation program both for avoiding large storage of data and the subsequent elaboration and analysis as well as for visualizing and tracking many phenomena inside three-dimensional samples. However, the full Computational power of traditional simulation programs may not be available in general in programs with graphical user interfaces, due to their interactive nature. Nevertheless interactive programs can still be very useful for detecting processes difficult to visualize, restricting the range or making a fine tuning of the parameters. and tailoring the faster programs toward precise targets. Restrictions on the complexity of the problem: The restrictions on the applicability of the program are related to the computer resources available. The graphical interface and interactivity demand computational resources that depend on the particular numerical simulation to be performed. To preserve a balance between speed and resources, the choice of the number of atoms to be simulated is critical. With an average current computer, simulations of systems with more than 105 atoms may not be easily feasible on an interactive scheme. Another restriction is related to the fact that the program was originally designed to simulate systems in the solid phase, so that problems in the simulation may occur if some particular physical quantities are computed beyond the melting point. Typical running time: It depends on the machine architecture, system size, and user needs. Unusual features of the program: In the program, besides the window in which the system is represented in real space, an additional graphical window presenting the real time distribution histogram for different physical variables (such as kinetic or potential energy) is included. Such tool is very interesting for making demonstrative numerical experiments for teaching purposes as well as for research, e.g., for detecting and tracking crystal defects. The program includes: an initial condition builder, an interactive display of the simulation, a set of tools which allow the user to filter through different physical quantities the information-either displayed in real time or printed in the output files-and to perform an efficient search of the interesting regions of parameter space.
