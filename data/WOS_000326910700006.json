This paper proposes a Bouc-Wen model based inverse hysteresis compensator for rate-dependent hysteresis in PZT. The classical Bouc-Wen model for hysteresis is introduced firstly, then the identification of the parameters through the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is conducted. A novel modified inverse Bouc-Wen model is proposed and verified through experiment. The proposed modified inverse Bouc-Wen model with a parametric selector constructs a real-time online rate-dependent compensator for handling PZT's hysteresis. During experiments of tracking multi-frequency composed of signals, the rate-dependent hysteresis of the PZT can be consistently compensated. The experimental results show that the proposed open loop hysteresis canceling method greatly improves the PZT's tracking control accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
