The formalism is used to express the security of a KE protocol and to reason about beliefs in the protocol. We observe that a freshness identifier such as a nonce may not be fresh for a legitimate party in a particular protocol run, hence we distinguish a trusted freshness identifier from the commonly used freshness identifier in the sense of a participant's beliefs about the security. A central ingredient in our approach is that all the beliefs should be established on the basis of a trusted freshness identifier. The reasoning results of our approach, comparing with the security conditions, can either establish the correctness of a KE protocol when the protocol is in fact correct, or identify the absence of the security properties, which leads to the structure to construct attacks directly. Two examples, the Kerberos pair-key agreement approach in distributed sensor networks and the Needham-Schroeder public key protocol, are given to show the usability and the efficiency of our approach.
