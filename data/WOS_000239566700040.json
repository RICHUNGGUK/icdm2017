This is the first nontrivial rigorous estimate for the collision probability for the unaltered Pollard p graph, and is close to the conjectured optimal bound of O(root n). The result is derived by showing that the mixing time for the random walk on this graph is O((logn)(3)); without the squaring step in the Pollard p algorithm, the mixing time would be exponential in log n. The technique involves a spectral analysis of directed graphs, which captures the effect of the squaring step.", "paper_title": "Spectral analysis of Pollard Rho collisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566700040"}
