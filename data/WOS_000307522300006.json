The objective of the VMM is to be able to easily regenerate random mobility patterns that accurately match the stochastic characteristics of vehicles (e. g., cars and buses) better than other random synthetic stochastic mobility simulators, which include random walk, Gauss-Markov mobility, fluid flow, and random way point. An essential characteristic of vehicle mobility is that it has directionality and is targeted toward a destination while showing a certain degree of randomness in speed and angle changes as it moves toward its destination. To model these characteristics, a destination targeted VMM (DTVMM) is proposed, which can be made to randomly move toward the exact location or the neighborhood of the targeted destination based on the setting of the DTVMM stochastic parameters. When the stochastic parameters of actual traffic traces are used, the simulation results show that the DTVMM movement patterns are very similar to actual traces and have the same stochastic characteristics.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Vector Mobility Model for Mobile and Vehicular Ad Hoc Network Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000307522300006"}
