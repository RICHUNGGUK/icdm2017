In this paper, we compare ELB with a more empirical procedure, based on the idea of modifying the value of the relaxation time in such a way as to enforce the positivity of the kinetic distribution function (fix-up method). The stability enhancement due to ELB and fix-up are compared for the case a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow. It is shown that ELBM offers higher stability at a moderate price in terms of computational overhead. On the other hand, even the simple fix-up procedure can provide significant savings over the standard single-time relaxation method, virtually cost-free in terms of computational requirements.", "paper_title": "A comparison of single-time relaxation lattice Boltzmann schemes with enhanced stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000242248700001"}
