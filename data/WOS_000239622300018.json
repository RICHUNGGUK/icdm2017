This proposal is based on an architecture for publishing biological data and services, and is designed to be a flexible client for making use of BioMOBY servers, extending them with persistency of the information retrieved for each user. We also present in this paper some biological results, which have been obtained by taking advantage of the proposed workflow execution system. This work has been developed and implemented in the National Institute for Bioinformatics (INB) in Spain (available at http://www.inab.org/MOWServ).", "paper_title": "Distributed execution of workflows in the INB", "paper_id": "WOS:000239622300018"}
