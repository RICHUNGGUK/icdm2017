First, a fuzzy model is identified offline through inputs-states data with delay measurement also the parameters for the estimation of Round Trip Time delay are obtained. The fuzzy control is designed by Linear Quadratic Regulation and a stability analysis is presented. A Real-Life hardware-in-the-loop Magnetic Levitation System is used as case study to show the effectiveness of control and robustness to traffic.", "paper_title": "NEURO-FUZZY CONTROL WITH TIME DELAY ESTIMATION FOR NONLINEAR NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626900026"}
