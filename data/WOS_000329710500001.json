To implement the cooperation, a finite rate conferencing link is deployed at the transmitters side in order to share the message. A new transmit scheme with private message sharing is proposed based on the dirty paper coding. The achievable rate region is established in both strong interference regime and weak interference regime. In weak interference regime, the asymptotically rate region shows the conferencing link can improve the achievable rate region for cooperative receiver. In strong interference regime, the conferencing link not only improves the achievable rate for cooperative receiver but also improves the sum rate of the cooperative network. Numerical results demonstrate these theories in a Gaussian interference channel.", "paper_title": "Research on Achievable Rate of Interference Channel with Cooperative Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000329710500001"}
