Numerical results have shown that this method is efficient and very accurate. Moreover, it is particularly suitable for problems that are of too high an index for present DAE solvers. This paper develops an effective method for computing a DAE's System Jacobian, which is needed in the structural analysis of the DAE and computation of Taylor coefficients. Our method involves preprocessing of the DAE and code generation employing automatic differentiation. Theory and algorithms for preprocessing and code generation are presented. An operator-overloading approach to computing the System Jacobian is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Solving differential-algebraic equations by Taylor series (II): Computing the System Jacobian", "paper_id": "WOS:000244887900007"}
