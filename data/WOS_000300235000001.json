A,geodesic disk GD(p, r) with center p and radius r is the set of points in P that have a geodesic distance <= r from p (where the geodesic distance is the length of the shortest polygonal path connection that lies in P). In this paper we present an output sensitive algorithm for finding all N geodesic disks centered at the points of S, for a given value of r. Our algorithm runs in O((n + (kn)(2/3) + k) log(c) n) time for some constant c and output size k. It is the basis of a cluster reporting algorithm where geodesic distatices are used.", "paper_title": "GEODESIC DISKS AND CLUSTERING IN A SIMPLE POLYGON", "paper_id": "WOS:000300235000001"}
