Although ARIMA can be adopted to obtain a highly accurate linear forecasting model, it cannot accurately forecast nonlinear time series. Artificial neural network (ANN) can be utilized to construct more accurate forecasting model than ARIMA for nonlinear time series, but explaining the meaning of the hidden layers of ANN is difficult and, moreover, it does not yield a mathematical equation. This study proposes a hybrid forecasting model for nonlinear time series by combining ARIMA with genetic programming (GP) to improve upon both the ANN and the ARIMA forecasting models. Finally, some real data sets are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed forecasting model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
