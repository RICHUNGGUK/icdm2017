Therefore a human body detection and pose estimation system must be adaptable and customizable. This paper presents such a system that extracts skeletons from RGB-D sensor data. The system adapts on-line to difficult unstructured scenes taken from a moving camera (since it does not require background subtraction) and benefits from using both color and depth data. It is customizable by virtue of requiring less training data, having a clearly described training method, and a customizable human kinematic model. Results show successful application to data from a moving camera in cluttered indoor environments. This system is open-source, encouraging reuse, comparison, and future research.
