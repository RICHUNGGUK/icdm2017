We study the combinatorics of guarding polyominoes in terms of the parameter m, in contrast with the traditional parameter n, the number of vertices of P. In particular, we show that [m+1/3] point guards are always sufficient and sometimes necessary to cover an m-polyomino, possibly with holes. When m <= 3n/4 - 4 , the sufficiency condition yields a strictly lower guard number than [n/4] given by the art gallery theorem for orthogonal polygons.", "paper_title": "The Art Gallery Theorem for Polyominoes", "paper_id": "WOS:000307507800010"}
