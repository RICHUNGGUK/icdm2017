In this paper, we propose a video retrieval algorithm based on the integration of several visual cues. In contrast to key-frame based representation of shot, our approach analyzes all frames within a shot to construct a compact representation of video shot. In the video matching step, by integrating the color and motion features, a similarity measure is defined to locate the occurrence of similar video clips in the database. Therefore, our approach is able to fully exploit the spatio-temporal information contained in video. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and outperforms some existing technique.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATION OF COLOR AND MOTION FEATURES FOR VIDEO RETRIEVAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000265094700007"}
