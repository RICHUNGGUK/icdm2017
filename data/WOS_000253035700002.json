Using the categorical properties established for L-Frm in Part I for L a complete chain, this paper constructs \"upper\" free functor L and \"lower\" free functor A. The functor L is used to create a class of non-generated L-frames, factor the LPT spectrum functor through the Sigma spectrum functor, resolve the relationship between L-sobriety and IL-sobriety, and give insight into the construction of \"universal\" L-topological spaces; and the functor R is used to create a class of non-generated L-frames, factor the omega(L) functor through a new spectrum functor Sigma*, and give insight into the construction of \"co-universal\" L-topological spaces. These facts-universal spaces are anti-stratified, co-universal spaces are stratified, L-Frm produces both kinds of spaces via L and R, L-Frm (via its dual L-Loc) is adjunctive with L-Top-comprise a coherent argument that L-Top must accommodate both kinds of spaces, resolving the philosophical debate over the place of the constant maps condition with respect to the axioms of L-topologies.
