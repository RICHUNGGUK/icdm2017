This is a well-known fairness problem. Such a problem becomes more serious in wavelength-routed optical networks (WRONs) due to the wavelength continuity constraint. This paper aims to enhance the fairness characteristic in WRONs by the novel classified alternate routing (CAR) approach. As a foundation of this approach, the first K-shortest paths (KSP) between a designated source/destination node pair in a given network should be obtained simultaneously. This has been studied as the KSP problem in the literature. In this paper, a new loopless deviation (LD) algorithm for solving such a loopless KSP problem will be proposed. It outperforms existing solutions in terms of running time in real-life implementations. In order to measure the fairness characteristic, we first classify all connection requests into categories such as 1-hop traffic, 2-hop traffic, etc., according to the number of minimal hop count between the corresponding source/destination node pair. We then quantify the fairness characteristic by the ratio of the average CBP of each traffic category to that of 1-hop traffic such that CBP ratios with a value closer to 1 are preferred. We will show that such a measure criterion is more precise and robust than existing ones in the literature. Finally, numerical experiments will reveal that the CAR approach outperforms existing fairness enhancement methods when considering the comprehensive performance in terms of the balance between the fairness characteristic and the overall CBP feature.", "paper_title": "A new solution to the K-shortest paths problem and its application in wavelength routed optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240902400004"}
