Although such queries arise naturally in many important reasoning tasks, they are difficult to automate in the situation calculus due to the presence of a second-order induction axiom. We show how to reduce queries about property persistence, a common type of universally-quantified query, to an equivalent form that does not quantify over situations and so is amenable to existing reasoning techniques. Our algorithm replaces induction with a meta-level fixpoint calculation; crucially, this calculation uses only first-order reasoning with a limited set of axioms. The result is a powerful new tool for verifying sophisticated domain properties in the situation calculus. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
