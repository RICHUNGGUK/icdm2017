This implies, for instance, that every positive-genus surface can be covered seamlessly with any of the 17 plane symmetric wallpaper patterns. We identify sufficient conditions for meshes to be classified as \"quad-pattern-coverable\", and we present several methods to construct such meshes. Moreover, we identify some mesh operations that preserve the quad-pattern-coverability property. For instance, since vertex insertion remeshing, which is the remeshing operation behind Catmull-Clark subdivision, preserves quad-pattern-coverability, it is possible to cover any surface of positive genus with iteratively finer versions of the same texture.
