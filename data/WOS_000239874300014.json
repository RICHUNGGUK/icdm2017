Here we consider the problem of sorting signed permutations by fixed-length reversals. Indeed, limiting the transformations to reversals of length exactly k can be very restrictive, for example, (+1, +3,+2, +4,..., +n) can never be sorted to (+1, +2, +3, +4,..., +n) by 2-reversals. That is, for given two signed permutations it is not obvious whether they can be sorted to each other by k-reversals. Thus in 1996, Chen and Skiena gave the following open problem: what is the connectedness of signed permutations under fixed-length reversals? In this paper, we resolve this open problem when \"fixed-length\" is even, and give a characterization of the connectedness of signed n-permutations under 2l-reversal, for both linear and circular permutations.", "paper_title": "Sorting signed permutations by fixed-length reversals", "paper_id": "WOS:000239874300014"}
