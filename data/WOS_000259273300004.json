The proposed method not only retains the advantages of the conventional sliding mode control such as robustness against parameter variations and external disturbances, but also uses measurable output signals to define the sliding surface function. A fuzzy controller is developed to modify the control law to avoid state measurement. Control system stability is proved by using the Lyapunov stability theorem. The system robustness is guaranteed. Simulations results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method for uncertain nonlinear robotic arms.", "paper_title": "Robust fuzzy output sliding control without the requirement of state measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000259273300004"}
