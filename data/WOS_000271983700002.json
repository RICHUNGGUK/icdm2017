They are also included in various tests within the procedures for testing NIBP monitors. In practice simulators are often subject to mechanical and electromagnetic shocks which could effect their measuring function. Our objective was to design a procedure for testing the reliability and quality of simulators in order to ensure reliable testing of NIBP monitors. Procedure for evaluation of NIBP simulators, consisting of a static and dynamic test, is proposed. Static test consisted of procedures derived from common electro-mechanical manometer calibration, while dynamic test included testing of repeatability of simulator's output. A commercial simulator was tested. Among others, the results indicated that evaluations of NIBP simulators should be performed regularly with a suitable time interval in order to track the metrological quality of the simulator in time. Acceptance criteria for a reliable simulator in both static and dynamic sense are proposed.", "paper_title": "A procedure for evaluation of non-invasive blood pressure simulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000271983700002"}
