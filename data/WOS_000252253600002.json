Moreover, statistical multiplexing of the smoothed traffic can substantially improve network utilization. In this paper we propose a new smoothing scheme, which exploits statistical multiplexing gain that can be obtained after smoothing of individual video streams. We present a new bandwidth allocation algorithm that allows for responsive interactivity. The local re-smoothing algorithm is carried out using an iterative process. In the proposed scheme the smoothed video streams are divided into fixed intervals and then a new transmission schedule for each interval is calculated. The problem of applying an optimal transmission schedule for aggregated smoothing video streams is shown to be NP-hard problem. Partitioning the whole stream into sections enables parallel processing of the smoothing algorithm in real-time before transmission. This approach allows partial transmission of the multiplexed stream while smoothing other intervals. The simulation results show a significant reduction in peak rate and rate variability of the aggregated stream, compared to the non-smoothing case. Therefore the proposed scheme allows us to increase the number of simultanusally-served video streams.", "paper_title": "EPCRTT-based smoothing and multiplexing of VBR video traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000252253600002"}
