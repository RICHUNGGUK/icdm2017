In this paper we show that (1/2) n(2)/k-1 - n/2 <= f (n, k) <= 2 n(n-2)/k/2. For the case when k - n, we show that 2 <= f (n, n) <= 3. For the case when k = n and G is a geometric graph on a set of points in convex position, we completely solve the problem and prove that at least three edges must be removed.", "paper_title": "The Erdos-Sos Conjecture for Geometric Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000319613200007"}
