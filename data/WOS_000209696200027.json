In contrast to the previous work, CodeOn, vehicles in the proposed method only exchange content reception information in the service channel. The packet injection probability in the proposed method is proportional to the estimated innovation that a vehicle can provide to its neighbors. We also give an analytical model to analyze the system throughput when vehicles apply rank-based network coding to broadcast data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the throughput by more than 32% while maintaining lower end-to-end delay and protocol overhead than the previous work.", "paper_title": "Rank-Based Network Coding for Content Distribution in Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200027"}
