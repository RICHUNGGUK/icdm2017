Simulation results show that (a) additive noise, topology randomness, and stochastic message loss may improve the convergence rate; (b) presence of faulty nodes degrades the convergence rate; and (c) explicit randomization of consensus algorithms can be exploited to improve the convergence rate. Watts-Strogatz and Waxman graphs are used as underlying network topologies. A consensus algorithm is proposed that exchanges state information with dynamically randomly selected neighbors and, through this randomization, achieves almost sure convergence in some scenarios.", "paper_title": "Distributed Binary Consensus in Networks with Disturbances", "paper_id": "WOS:000363674700006"}
