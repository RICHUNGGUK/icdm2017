Recently, heterogeneous network on chip (NoC) has been proposed not only to achieve performance comparable to that of the NoCs with buffered routers but also to reduce buffer cost and energy consumption. However, heterogeneous NoC design for heterogeneous CPU-CPU architectures has not been studied in depth. This paper first evaluates the performance and power consumption of a variety of static hot-potato based heterogeneous NoCs with different buffered and bufferless router placements, which is helpful to explore the design space for heterogeneous GPU-CPU interconnection. Then it proposes Unidirectional Flow Control (UFC), a simple credit-based flow control mechanism for heterogeneous NoC in CPU-CPU architectures to control network congestion. UFC can guarantee that there are always unoccupied entries in buffered routers to receive flits coming from adjacent bufferless routers. Our evaluations show that when compared to hot-potato routing, UFC improves performance by an average of 14.1% with energy increased by an average of 5.3% only.", "paper_title": "Exploring Heterogeneous NoC Design Space in Heterogeneous GPU-CPU Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000349577600007"}
