Compared with previous work, this color space proved to be the optimal color space for hand segmentation with linear thresholds. We also propose a novel fingertip detection method based on the concomitance between finger and fingernail. The two techniques together improve the performance of hand contour and fingertip extraction in hand gesture recognition.", "paper_title": "Efficient Hand Segmentation and Fingertip Detection Using Color Features of Skin and Fingernail", "paper_id": "WOS:000323236700038"}
