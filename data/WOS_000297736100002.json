In this paper, the sedimentation flow is investigated. This method uses a pressure correction method to solve incompressible flow fields. A direct-forcing method is introduced to capture the particle motions. It is found that the direct-forcing method can also be served as a wall-boundary condition. By applying Gauss's divergence theorem, the formulas for computing the hydrodynamic force and torque acting on the particle from flows are derived from the volume integral of the particle instead of the particle surface. The order of accuracy of the present method is demonstrated by the errors of velocity, pressure, and wall stress. To demonstrate the efficiency and capability of the present method, sedimentations of many spherical particles in an enclosure are simulated.
