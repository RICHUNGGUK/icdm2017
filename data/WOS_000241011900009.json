But it ignores the label information conveyed by data samples, and can not be used for classification directly. In this paper, a transductive manifold classification method, called QLAT (LDA/QR and LTSA based Transductive classifier) is presented, which is based on LTSA and TCM-KNN (transduction confidence machine-k nearest neighbor). In the algorithm, local low-dimensional coordinates is constructed using 2-stage LDA/QR method, which not only utilize the label information of sample data, but also conquer the singularity problem of traditional LDA, then the global low-dimensional embedding manifold is obtained by local affine transforms, finally TCM-KNN method is used for classification on the low-dimensional manifold. Experiments on labeled and unlabeled mixed data set illustrate the effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "A local tangent space alignment based transductive classification algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241011900009"}
