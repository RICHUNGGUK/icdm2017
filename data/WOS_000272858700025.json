We show that the model of the problem is a constrained non-linear integer program and propose a genetic algorithm to solve it. Moreover, design of experiments is employed to calibrate the parameters of the algorithm for different problem sizes. At the end, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
