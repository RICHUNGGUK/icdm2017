Compared with conventional filters, wavelet shrinkage can respect this requirement to reduce noise from received signal in wavelet coefficients. However, wavelet threshold depends on an estimate of noise deviation and a weight relating signal's length cannot be applied in every case. This paper uses particle swarm optimization (PSO) to explore a suitable threshold in a complete solution space, named PSOShrink. A general-purpose objective function which is derived from blind signal separation (BSS) theory is further proposed. In simulation, four benchmarks signals and three degrading degrees are testing; meanwhile, three existing algorithm with state-of-the-art are performed for comparison. PSOShrink can not only recovers source signals from a heavy blurred signal but also remains details of a source signal from a light blurred signal; moreover, it performs outstanding denoising in every simulation case.
