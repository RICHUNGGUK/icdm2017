Program summary Program title: Spinors Catalogue identifier: AEMQ_v 1_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEMQ_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 117039 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 300404 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Mathematica. Computer: Any computer running Mathematica 7.0 or higher. Operating system: Any operating system compatible with Mathematica 7.0 or higher. RAM: 94Mb in Mathematica 8.0. Classification: 1.5. External routines: Mathematica packages xCore, xPerm and xTensor which are part of the xAct system. These can be obtained at http://www.xact.es. Nature of problem: Manipulation and simplification of spinor expressions in General Relativity. Solution method: Adaptation of the tensor functionality of the xAct system for the specific situation of spinor calculus in four dimensional Lorentzian geometry. Restrictions: The software only works on 4-dimensional Lorentzian space-times with metric of signature (1, -1, -1, -1). There is no direct support for Dirac spinors. Unusual features: Easy rules to transform tensor expressions into spinor ones and back. Seamless integration of abstract index manipulation of spinor expressions with component computations. Running time: Under one second to handle and canonicalize standard spinorial expressions with a few dozen indices. (These expressions arise naturally in the transformation of a spinor expression into a tensor one or vice versa.) (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
