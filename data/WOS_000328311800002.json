Based on the RSA cryptosystem, Hong proposed an efficient (t, n) threshold proxy signature for mobile agents. Cal et al. found that the scheme due to Hong is proxyunprotected, meaning that the original signer can generate a valid proxy signature by himself. However, it is unclear whether the scheme can be used in reality after fixing the security problem discovered by Cai et al. In this letter, we provide a detailed analysis on Hong's scheme and show that the scheme fails to achieve the properties of secrecy, proxy protected, undeniability, identifiability and even time constraint and thus adopted of this efficient construction in practice is not recommended.
