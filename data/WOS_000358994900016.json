Focusing on such a circumstance, a localized mutual information active contour model is discussed in the paper. By defining neighborhood of each point on the level set, mutual information is introduced to describe the relationship between the zero level set and image field. A driving energy term is then generated by integrating all the information. In addition, an expanding energy and internal energy are designed to regularize the driving energy. Contrary to piecewise constant model, new model has a better command of driving the contours without initialization.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Active Contour Model: a Localized Mutual Information Approach for Medical Image Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000358994900016"}
