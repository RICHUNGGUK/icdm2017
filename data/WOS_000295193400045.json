Opinion mining is the task of identifying whether the opinion expressed in a document is positive or negative about a given topic. In this paper we explore this new research area applying Support Vector Machines (SVM) for testing different domains of data sets and using several weighting schemes. We have accomplished experiments with different features on three corpora. Two of them have already been used in several works. The last one has been built from Amazon.com specifically for this paper in order to prove the feasibility of the SVM for different domains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
