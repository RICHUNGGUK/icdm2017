The paper formalizes 32refactoring recommendations to repair violations raised by static architecture conformance checking approaches; it describes a toolcalled ArchFixthat triggers the proposed recommendations; and it evaluates the application of this tool in two industrial-strength systems. For the first systema 21 KLOC open-source strategic management systemour approach has indicated correct refactoring recommendations for 31 out of 41 violations detected as the result of an architecture conformance process. For the second systema 728 KLOC customer care system used by a major telecommunication companyour approach has triggered correct recommendations for 624 out of 787 violations, as asserted by the system's architect. Moreover, the architects have scored 82% of these recommendations as having moderate or major complexity.
