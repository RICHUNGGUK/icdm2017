The Kendall coefficient of concordance W, the Friedman ranks statistic F (r) , and the Page L statistic are often used to determine the association among M sets of rankings. However, they may get some anomalies because they all use the cardinal variable \"variance\" to judge the association. In order to correct the anomalies, we use the modified Hopfield neural network instead to determine the association among M sets of rankings. The results are not only to reduce the unidentified cases but also to solve the anomalies.", "paper_title": "Ordinal preference and inter-rater pattern recognition: Hopfield neural network vs. measures of association", "paper_id": "WOS:000272614000006"}
