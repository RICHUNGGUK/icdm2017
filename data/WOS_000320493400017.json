In stage one, consumers assess product uncertainty with product reviews. In stage two, they assess seller uncertainty with seller reviews, conditional on their assessment of product uncertainty in stage one. We further develop an operationalization of our conceptual model using the expected utility theory and derive hypotheses on the effects of online user reviews on consumers' WTP. We test our hypotheses using data from an experimental study and an empirical study. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
