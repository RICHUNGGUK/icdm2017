To overcome this limitation, we propose an integrated DSS framework by combining both business and engineering systems with a dashboard. The dashboard serves as a human-computer interface and allows a decision maker to adjust decision variables and exchange information with the DSS. The proposed framework provides a two-stage decision making mechanism based on optimization and agent-based models. Under the proposed DSS, the decision maker decides on the values of a subset of decision variables. These values, or the first-stage decision, are forwarded through the dashboard to the DSS. For the given set of first-stage decision variables, a multi-objective robust optimization problem, based on an integrated business and engineering simulation model, is solved to obtain the values for a set of second-stage decision variables. The two-stage decision making process iterates until a convergence is achieved. A simple oil refinery case study with an example dashboard demonstrates the applicability of the integrated DSS.
