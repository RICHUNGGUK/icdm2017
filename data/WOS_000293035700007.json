A similarity function requires the definition of a threshold value in order to decide whether two different data instances match, i.e., if they represent the same real world object. In this context, threshold definition is a central problem. This paper proposes a method for estimating the quality of a similarity function. Quality is measured in terms of recall and precision calculated at several different thresholds. Based on the results of the proposed estimation process and the requirements of a specific application, a user is able to choose a suitable threshold value. The estimation process is based on a clustering phase performed over a data collection (or a sample thereof) and requires no human intervention since the choice of similarity threshold is based on the silhouette coefficient, which is an internal quality measure for clusters. An extensive set of experiments on artificial and real datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results of the experiments show that in most cases the estimation error was below 10% in terms of precision and recall. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
