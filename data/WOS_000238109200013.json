In this paper, we study dimer tilings, which generalize domino tilings and are indeed equivalent to perfect matchings of planar graphs. We use height functions, a notion previously introduced by Thurston in [10] for domino tilings, to prove that a dimer tiling of a given domain can be computed using any Single-Source-Shortest-Paths algorithm on a planar graph. We also endow the set of dimers tilings of a given domain with a structure of distributive lattice and show that it can be effectively visited by a simple algorithmical operation called flip.", "paper_title": "Planar dimer tilings", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200013"}
