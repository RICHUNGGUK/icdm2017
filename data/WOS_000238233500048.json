In this letter, we consider the adaptive code-rate OFDM system in which code-rate of each subcarrier is adapted optimally. RCPC code is used to obtain different code-rate for each subcarrier. Performance analysis shows that 3-6 dB SNR gain or up to 30-50% data rate increase is achieved at bit error rate 10(-6).", "paper_title": "Adaptive OFDM system with optimal RCPC code-rate for each subcarrier", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500048"}
