With components as the building blocks, it is important to predict the performance of the system based on the performance of individual components. In this paper, performance prediction of a system consisting of a small number of components is investigated under different inter-component communication patterns, and the number of threads provided by components. Based on the experimental results, it can be inferred that the proposed composition rules provide a reasonably accurate prediction of the performance of a system made out of these components.", "paper_title": "Compositional reasoning of performance in component-based distributed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000260551200002"}
