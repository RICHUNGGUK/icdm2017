In this paper, we propose an approach to obtain the sparse codesets for the data objects across different modalities via joint multi-modal dictionary learning, which we call sparse multi-modal hashing (abbreviated as). In, both intra-modality similarity and inter-modality similarity are first modeled by a hypergraph, then multi-modal dictionaries are jointly learned by Hypergraph Laplacian sparse coding. Based on the learned dictionaries, the sparse codeset of each data object is acquired and conducted for multi-modal approximate nearest neighbor retrieval using a sensitive Jaccard metric. The experimental results show that outperforms other methods in terms of mAP and Percentage on two real-world data sets.", "paper_title": "Sparse Multi-Modal Hashing", "paper_id": "WOS:000330245800012"}
