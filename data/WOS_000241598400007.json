The most interesting aspect of this framework is the capability of building classification systems with high accuracy in dynamical environments, which achieve, at the same time, high processing and training speed. We apply this framework to the specific problem of gender classification. We built several gender classification systems under the proposed framework using different features (LBP, wavelets, rectangular, etc.). These systems are analyzed and evaluated using standard face databases (FERET and BioID)), and a new gender classification database of real-world images.", "paper_title": "Gender classification of faces using Adaboost", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400007"}
