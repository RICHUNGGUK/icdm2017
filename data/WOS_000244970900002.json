The new architecture, called pyramidal neural network (PyraNet), has a hierarchical structure with two types of processing layers: Pyramidal layers and one-dimensional (1-D) layers. In the new network, nonlinear two-dimensional (2-D) neurons are trained to perform both image feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. We present and analyze five training methods for PyraNct [gradient descent (GD), gradient descent with momentum, resilient back-propagation (RPROP), Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient (CG), and Levenberg-Marquadrt (LM)] and two choices of error functions [mean-square-error (mse) and cross-entropy (CE)]. In this paper, we apply PyraNet to determine gender from a facial image, and compare its performance on the standard facial recognition technology (FERET) database with three classifiers: The convolutional neural network (NN), the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and the support vector machine (SVNI).", "paper_title": "A pyramidal neural network for visual pattern recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000244970900002"}
