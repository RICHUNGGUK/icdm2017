[1] proposed a fuzzy TOPSIS method based on interval-valued fuzzy sets. They changed the information of example that expressed by Chen [2] for the purpose of adjustment with their method and applied their method for solving the changed example. When we investigated their method, we found that Although, Ashtiani et al.'s method is really interesting, but applying it for some fuzzy MCDM problems leads to the incorrect solution and results. In other words, Ashtiani et al.'s method is not applicable to some fuzzy MCDM problems. In this paper we try to eliminate this problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
