This is especially true for sports dealing with acrobatics, because acrobatics mix complex spatial rotations over multiple axes and may be combined with various postures. This paper presents a new vision-based system focused on the analysis of acrobatic gestures of several sports. Instead of classical systems requiring modelizing human bodies, our system is based on the modelling and characterization of acrobatic movements. To show the robustness of the system, it was successively tested first on movements from trampoline, and also in other sports (gymnastics, diving, etc.). Within the system, the gestures analysis is mainly carried out by using global measurements, extracted from recorded movies or live video.", "paper_title": "Real-time acrobatic gesture analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000237042600011"}
