We describe our implementations of the recent dynamic algorithms of King [1999] and of Demetrescu and Italiano [2006], and compare them to the dynamic algorithm of Ramalingam and Reps and to static algorithms on random, real-world and hard instances. Our experimental data suggest that some of the dynamic algorithms and their algorithmic techniques can be really of practical value in many situations.", "paper_title": "Experimental Analysis of Dynamic All Pairs Shortest Path Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000208300600006"}
