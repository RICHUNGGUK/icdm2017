Our interactive scheme has the ability to globally change the visual properties of texture elements, and locally change texture elements with little user interaction. Given a small sample texture, the design process starts with applying a set of global deformation operations (rotation, translation, mirror, scale and flip) to the sample texture to obtain a set of deformed textures automatically. Then we further make the local deformation to the deformed textures interactively by replacing the local-texture elements regions from other textures. By utilizing the energy optimization method, interactive selections and deformations of local-texture elements are accomplished simply through indicating the positions of texture elements very roughly with a brush tool. Finally the deformed textures are further utilized to create large textures with the fast layer-based texture deformation algorithm, and the wavelet-based energy optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can help design a large variety of textures from a small example, change the locations of texture elements, increase or decrease the density of texture elements, and design cyclic marbling textures.
