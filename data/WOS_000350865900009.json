New capabilities of the algebraic method in system design are shown, in particular related to enumeration of working states. The algebraic method should be a useful tool in reliability, both for performing different computations on system features, and to study the structure of systems.", "paper_title": "Hilbert Functions in Design for Reliability", "paper_id": "WOS:000350865900009"}
