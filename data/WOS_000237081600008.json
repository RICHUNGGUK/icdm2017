To help users submit queries to different Web databases, the query interface matching problem needs to be addressed. To solve this problem, we propose a new complex schema matching approach, Holistic Schema Matching (HSM). By examining the query interfaces of real Web databases, we observe that attribute matchings can be discovered from attribute-occurrence patterns. For example, First Name often appears together with Last Name while it is rarely co-present with Author in the Books domain. Thus, we design a count-based greedy algorithm to identify which attributes are more likely to be matched in the query interfaces. In particular, HSM can identify both simple matching i.e., 1: 1 matching, and complex matching, i.e., 1:n or m:n matching, between attributes. Our experiments show that HSM can discover both simple and complex matchings accurately and efficiently on real data sets.", "paper_title": "Holistic Schema Matching for Web query interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000237081600008"}
