For timed automata, we replace cardinality by volume and define (volumetric) entropy similarly. It represents the average quantity of information per event in a timed word of the language. We exhibit a criterion for telling apart \"thick\" timed automata with non-vanishing entropy, for which typical runs are non-Zeno and discretizable, from \"thin\" automata for which all runs behave in a Zeno-like way, implying a quick volume collapse. We associate to every timed automaton a positive integral operator; the entropy equals the logarithm of its spectral radius. This operator has a spectral gap, thus allowing for fast converging numerical procedures to approximate entropy. In a special case, entropy is even characterized symbolically. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
