For these systems, the main challenge lies in the efficient and accurate solution of the self-consistent one-band and multi-band Schrodinger-Poisson equations. After a brief introduction of the physical background, we first demonstrate that unphysical solutions of the Schrodinger equation due to the presence of material boundaries can be avoided by combining a suitable ordering of the differential operators with a robust discretization method like box discretization. Next, we discuss algorithms for the efficient solution of the resulting sparse matrix problems even on small computers. Finally, we introduce a predictor-corrector-type approach for the stabilizing the outer iteration loop that is needed to obtain a self-consistent solution of both Schrodinger's and Poisson's equation.", "paper_title": "Efficient solution of the Schrodinger-Poisson equations in semiconductor device simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000236456400069"}
