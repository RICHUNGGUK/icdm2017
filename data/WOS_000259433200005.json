For the sake of portability, simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency, the FGMRES solvers have been implemented in Fortran 77 using the reverse communication mechanism for the matrix-vector product, the preconditioning, and the dot-product computations. For distributed-memory computation, several orthogonalization procedures have been implemented to reduce the cost of the dot-product calculation, which is a well-known bottleneck of efficiency for Krylov methods. Furthermore, either implicit or explicit calculation of the residual at restart is possible depending on the actual cost of the matrix-vector product. Finally, the implemented stopping criterion is based on a normwise backward error.", "paper_title": "A set of flexible GMRES routines for real and complex arithmetics on high-performance computers", "paper_id": "WOS:000259433200005"}
