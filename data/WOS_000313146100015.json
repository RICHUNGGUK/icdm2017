In this paper, we propose a sophisticated routing architecture for a region oriented FPGA which supports dynamic power gating. This is the first routing solution of dynamic power gating for coarse-grained FPGA. This paper has 2 main contributions. First, it improves the routing resource graph and routing architecture to support special routing for a region oriented FPGA. Second, some routing channels are made wider to avoid congestion. Experimental result shows that 7.7% routing area can lie reduced compared with the symmetric Wilton switch box in the region. Also, our proposed FPGA architecture with sophisticated P&R can reduce the power consumption of the system implemented in FPGA.", "paper_title": "Region Oriented Routing FPGA Architecture for Dynamic Power Gating", "paper_id": "WOS:000313146100015"}
