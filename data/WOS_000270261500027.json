In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised DR method called sparsity preserving projections (SPP). Unlike many existing techniques such as local preserving projection (LPP) and neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE), where local neighborhood information is preserved during the DR procedure, SPP aims to preserve the sparse reconstructive relationship of the data, which is achieved by minimizing a L1 regularization-related objective function. The obtained projections are invariant to rotations, rescalings and translations of the data, and more importantly, they contain natural discriminating information even if no class labels are provided. Moreover, SPP chooses its neighborhood automatically and hence can be more conveniently used in practice compared to LPP and NPE. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on three popular face databases (Yale, AR and Extended Yale B) with promising results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
