In addition to translational degrees of freedom also the cylinder chamber pressures are taken as state variables. In static analysis the chamber pressures are embedded thus a purely mechanical simulation can be performed. In dynamic analysis we end up to a coupled problem where the chamber pressures are separate variables. The sealing friction is taken into account in both static and dynamic analysis. For numerical solution we use a monolithic algorithm and the coupling matrices between the hydraulic and mechanic variables are presented. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
