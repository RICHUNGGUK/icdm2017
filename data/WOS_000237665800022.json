Keywords make possible to summarize the contents of documents in a compact form, and may also be used as an efficient measure of similarity between texts. This work is focused on the extraction of keywords for theses on several fields of knowledge. To identify the keywords the KEA algorithm was used, together with a stemming technique specific to Portuguese and a manually created list of stopwords. It is shown that the results obtained are good enough for practical use and similarly match what have been done for the English Language.", "paper_title": "Automatic extraction of keywords for the Portuguese language", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800022"}
