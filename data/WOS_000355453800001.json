The long term evolution advanced (LTE-A) system, commercialized as the 4th generation (4G) mobile communication system, is based on the following key features: the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the relay, the multiple input multiple outputs (MIMO), the carrier aggregation (CA), and the coordinated multipoint transmission and reception (CoMP). In this paper, the impact of these features on the existing positioning technology specified in the LTE-A standards is systematically investigated. Moreover, two approaches are proposed to take full advantage of these features in terms of positioning technologies and the key positioning parameters, including the reference signal time difference (RSTD) in the observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA) technology and user equipment receiving time subtracting transmitting time (UE Rx-Tx) in the enhanced cell identity (E-CID) technology.", "paper_title": "The Impact of New Features on Positioning Technology in LTE-A System", "paper_id": "WOS:000355453800001"}
