This paper will introduce particle swarm optimization (PSO) its it heuristic intelligent search method to optimize in real time elevator traffic scheduling solution of EGSCS. The proposed PSO-based scheduling approach will be applied to effectively handle the peak elevator traffic. The overall experimental results will be used to validate its scheduling efficiency and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "PSO-BASED REAL-TIME SCHEDULING FOR ELEVATOR GROUP SUPERVISORY CONTROL SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000272111400010"}
