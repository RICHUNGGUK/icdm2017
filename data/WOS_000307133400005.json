We formulate this problem as a mixed integer programming problem, relate this formulation to other problems in combinatorial optimization, strengthen the formulation and propose cutting planes, and finally present experimental results for real-world instances of the collection network design problem.", "paper_title": "Optimizing the Design of a Wind Farm Collection Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000307133400005"}
