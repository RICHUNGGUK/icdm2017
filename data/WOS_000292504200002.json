However, at present large number of requirements documents are still written in natural languages. Therefore, generating formal requirements specification from informal textual requirements description has become a big challenge. In this paper, a concern-based approach to generating formal requirements specification from textual requirements document is proposed, which applies separation of concerns during requirements analysis and utilizes concerns and their relationships to bridge the gap between textual requirements statements and formal requirements documentation. A tool suite has been developed for supporting our approach, and a case study has been performed to illustrate the process of our approach. Results indicate that our approach facilitates guiding the process of formal requirements documentation with concerns and their relationships.", "paper_title": "A concern-based approach to generating formal requirements specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000292504200002"}
