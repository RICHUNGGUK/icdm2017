Here, we focus on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems, in which access permissions are assigned to roles and roles are then assigned to users. User-role assignment is subject to role-based constraints, such as mutual exclusion constraints, prerequisite constraints, and role-cardinality constraints. Also, whether a user is qualified for a role depends on whether his/her qualification satisfies the role's requirements. In other words, a role can only be assigned to a certain set of qualified users. In this paper, we study fundamental problems related to access control constraints and user-role assignment, such as determining whether there are conflicts in a set of constraints, verifying whether a user-role assignment satisfies all constraints, and how to generate a valid user-role assignment for a system configuration. Computational complexity results and/or algorithms are given for the problems we consider.", "paper_title": "On the Complexity of Authorization in RBAC under Qualification and Security Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000294783800008"}
