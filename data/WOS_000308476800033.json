The fuzzy two-dimensional differential transform method of fixed grid size is used to find approximate solutions of FPDEs. An adaptive grid size mechanism based on the fixed grid size technique is also proposed. The proposed algorithm is illustrated by numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Solving fuzzy partial differential equations by fuzzy two-dimensional differential transform method", "paper_id": "WOS:000308476800033"}
