By using some new and innovative techniques, several existence theorems for the generalized set-valued variational inclusions in Banach spaces are established, and a perturbed three-step iterative algorithms for solving this kind of set-valued variational inclusions are suggested and analyzed. Our results include Ishikawa, Mann and Noor iterations as special cases. The results presented in this paper improve and extend almost all the current results in the more general setting.", "paper_title": "Three-step iterative algorithm for generalized set-valued variational inclusions in Banach spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000244875100002"}
