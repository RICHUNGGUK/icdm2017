This asks for advanced data assimilation methods that can work with the complex structures and nonlinear behaviors associated with the simulation models. This article presents a data assimilation framework using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods for wildfire spread simulations. The models and algorithms of the framework are described, and experimental results are provided. This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying SMC methods to data assimilation of wildfire spread simulations. The developed framework can potentially be generalized to other application areas where sophisticated simulation models are used.", "paper_title": "Data Assimilation Using Sequential Monte Carlo Methods in Wildfire Spread Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000311299500006"}
