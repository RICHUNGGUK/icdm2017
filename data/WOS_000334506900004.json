Illuminated by a continuous laser sheet, the interface morphology is characterized by glycol droplets and captured by a high-speed camera. It is found that different phenomena are observed for different end wall distances. The effect of the reshock is more pronounced on the interface morphology if interaction occurs at later times for the reshock times studied, i.e. for farther end wall positions. The variations of interface dimensions over time are given to demonstrate the influence of reshock on the interface development. Moreover, the velocities of the upper and lower interfaces are measured and compared with the theoretical ones calculated from the one-dimensional model and a good agreement is obtained. The change of the interface height shows that reshock promotes the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability process.", "paper_title": "Evolution of heavy gas cylinder under reshock conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000334506900004"}
