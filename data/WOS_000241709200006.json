In this paper we present an algorithm for computing all algebraic intermediate subfields in a separably generated unirational field extension (which in particular includes the zero characteristic case). One of the main tools is Grobner bases theory. Our algorithm also requires computing primitive elements and factoring over alaebraic extensions. Moreover, the method can be extended to finitely generated K-algebras. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
