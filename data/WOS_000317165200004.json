This is a strongly NP-hard problem for which a hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC) algorithm with bi-directional planning is developed to minimize makespan. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments were tested on two well-known benchmark problem sets. The computational evaluations manifestly support the high performance of the proposed HABC against the best-so-far algorithms applied in the literature for the same benchmark problem sets.
