The stiffness matrix is obtained in symbolic form and the results obtained agree with those obtained with the force and displacement methods available in literature. Additional advantages of this approach are that the mobility of a mast can be evaluated, redundant links and joints in the mast can be identified and practical masts with revolute joints can be analysed. Simulations for a hexagonal mast and an assembly with four hexagonal masts is presented as illustrations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
