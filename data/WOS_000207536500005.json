The study of such systems requires the evaluation of the error probabilities associated to the fabrication process complexity. In this paper we compare two layouts for a basic NAND gate used to implement NAND Multiplexing (NM) redundant gates. To analyse the erects of the layouts, we derive models to calculate the error probability of each gate part according to the resolution errors of the manufacturing process. Our results indicate that gates built with diode-logic topologies are more reliable than gates built with CMOS like topologies and that there solution errors and the area cost limit the redundancy of practical NM gates.", "paper_title": "Implementation Limitations of Reliable Nanogates", "paper_id": "WOS:000207536500005"}
