Different from many previous works on simulating vehicles or pedestrians separately, our approach aims to capture the realistic process of vehicle-pedestrian interaction for mixed traffic simulation. We model a decision-making process for their interaction based on a gap acceptance judging criterion and then design a novel environmental feedback mechanism for both vehicles' and pedestrians' behavior-control models to drive their motions. We demonstrate that our proposed method can soundly model vehicle-pedestrian interaction behaviors in a realistic and efficient manner and is convenient to be plugged into various traffic simulation systems.
