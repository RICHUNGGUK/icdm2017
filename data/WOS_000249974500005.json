First, pose estimation and 3D face model adaptation are achieved by means of a three-layer linear iterative process. Frontal view face images are synthesised using the estimated 3D models and poses. Then the discriminant 'waveletfaces' are extracted from these synthesised frontal view images. Finally, corresponding nearest feature space classifier is implemented. Experimental results show that the proposed method can recognise faces under variable poses with good accuracy.", "paper_title": "3D model-based pose invariant face recognition from multiple views", "paper_id": "WOS:000249974500005"}
