Delay-independent results are obtained using Lyapunov function approach and formulated as feasibility solution for a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In particular, second moment stability for the proposed feedback-delayed DTFTCS is considered. Tractable sufficient conditions that guarantee the second moment stability and achieve delta-level of disturbance rejection are derived. An FDI-driven state feedback controller is designed as a feasible solution for a set of LMIs. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the theoretical findings.", "paper_title": "SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR THE STABILIZATION OF FEEDBACK DELAYED DISCRETE TIME FAULT TOLERANT CONTROL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266024700001"}
