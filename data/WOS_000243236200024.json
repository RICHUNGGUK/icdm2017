Our approach considers a rigorous definition of an admissible segmentation, avoiding over and under segmentation problems. A fast algorithm leading to such a segmentation is proposed. The approach is tested both with synthetic and real data. An application to the segmentation of written documents is also presented. We shall see that this application requires the detection of very small histogram modes, which can be accurately detected with the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A nonparametric approach for histogram segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000243236200024"}
