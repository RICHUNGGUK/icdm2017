The best currently available denoising methods take advantage of the sparsity from image self-similarity, pre-learned, and fixed representations. Most of these methods, however, still have difficulties in tackling high noise levels or noise models other than Gaussian. In this paper, the multiresolution structure and sparsity of wavelets are employed by nonlocal dictionary learning in each decomposition level of the wavelets. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms two state-of-the-art image denoising algorithms on higher noise levels. Furthermore, our approach is more adaptive to the less extensively researched uniform noise.", "paper_title": "Nonlocal Hierarchical Dictionary Learning Using Wavelets for Image Denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000325223300010"}
