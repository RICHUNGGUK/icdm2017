Service selection based on QoS, which is a globally optimal selection issue, is a NP-hard problem. Taking engine into consideration, this paper develops a QoS model for service selection in the web composite services. We use the algorithm on the estimation of distribution to solve the NP-hard problem of service selection and present a web service selection method based on the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA). Simulation analysis and experimental study based on the UMDA method are carried out. It is proved that the method is effective in solving the NP-hard problem.", "paper_title": "Globally optimal selection of web composite services based on univariate marginal distribution algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000329407500005"}
