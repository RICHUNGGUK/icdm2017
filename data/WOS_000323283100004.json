The molecular theory density, heats of formation, bond dissociation energies and detonation performance are investigated at DFT-B3LYP/6-311G** level. The isodesmic reaction method is employed to calculate the HOFs of the energies obtained from electronic structure calculations. Results show that the position of nitramine groups can influence the values of HOFs. The bond dissociation energies and the impact sensitivity are analyzed to investigate the thermal stability of the purine derivatives. The calculated bond dissociation energies of ring-NHNO2 and NH-NO2 bond show that the NH-NO2 bond should be the trigger bond in pyrolysis processes. The H-50 of most compounds are larger than that of CL-20 and RDX.", "paper_title": "Looking for high energy density compounds among polynitraminepurines", "paper_id": "WOS:000323283100004"}
