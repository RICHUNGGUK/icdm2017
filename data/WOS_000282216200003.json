Until now, several sequential EDT algorithms have been described in the literature, however they are time- and memory-consuming for images with large resolutions. Therefore, parallel implementations of the EDT are required specially for 3D images. This paper presents a parallel implementation based on domain decomposition of a well-known 3D Euclidean distance transform algorithm, and analyzes its performance on a cluster of workstations. The use of a data compression tool to reduce communication time is investigated and discussed. Among the obtained performance results, this work shows that data compression is an essential tool for clusters with low-bandwidth networks.", "paper_title": "A HIGH PERFORMANCE 3D EXACT EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE TRANSFORM ALGORITHM FOR DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000282216200003"}
