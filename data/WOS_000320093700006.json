To derive the optimal policy, we design an algorithm based on the Impulse Control Maximum Principle. In this way, this paper presents one of the first real-life applications of the Impulse Control Maximum Principle developed by Blaquiere. We show that the proposed impulse control (IC) approach performs better than dynamic programming with respect to computational time. This is caused by the fact that IC does not need discretization in time.", "paper_title": "An impulse control approach to dike height optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000320093700006"}
