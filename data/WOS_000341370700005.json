The cascade depth is correlated with community structure of signed networks where communities are defined such that positive inter-community and negative intra-community links are minimized. The cascade is initialized from a number of nodes that are selected randomly. Finally, the number of nodes that have participated in the cascade is interpreted as cascade depth; the more the number of such nodes, the more the depth of the cascade. We investigate influence of community structure (i.e., percentage of inter-community positive and intra-community negative links) on the cascade depth. We find significant influence of community structure on cascade depth in both model and real networks. Our results show that the more the intra-community negative links (i.e., the worse the community structure), the more the cascade depth.", "paper_title": "Community Structure and Information Cascade in Signed Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000341370700005"}
