The advantages of CCN provide new opportunities for Internet multimedia applications. The retransmission-based loss recovery approach used by CCN, however, is not efficient enough for delay-sensitive video streaming services. This paper proposes an Adaptive Loss Protection scheme for video transmission over Content-Centric Networks (ALP-CCN). The proposed ALP-CCN introduces the Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanism with the CCN retransmission approach. By monitoring the packet loss rate and transmission delay, our proposed ALP-CCN coordinates FEC and retransmission adaptively. The experimental results demonstrate that the ALP-CCN is able adaptively to adjust and control the redundancy rate and achieve better video quality than the existing approaches under various network conditions.", "paper_title": "An adaptive loss protection for video transmission over content-centric networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360564600003"}
