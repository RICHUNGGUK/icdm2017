Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual approach is taken. Findings - Without directly employing the concepts of potential and actual infinities, the authors show that the concept of the set N = {x vertical bar n(x)}, where n(x) =(df) \"x is a natural number\" of all natural numbers is a self-contradicting, incorrect concept. Originality/value - The paper shows the system of natural numbers to be inconsistent.", "paper_title": "The inconsistency of the natural number system", "paper_id": "WOS:000256048100012"}
