Finland, since 1984 IDS includes two main modules. the IDS module and the ADC (Austenite DeComposition) module IDS module simulates the solidification phenomena from liquid down to 1000 degrees C and ADC the austenite decomposition down to room temperature Both modules have their own recommended composition ranges The IDS module is based on the so-called sharp interface concept The ADC is mainly statistical based on empirical CCT (Continuous Cooling Transformation) diagrams IDS tool is also coupled with the thermodynamic programmer's library, called ChemApp. developed by a German company, GTT-Technologies This coupled package is used to simulate among other things multiphase inclusions during solidification The present paper summarises the features of the IDS tool including the coupling with the ChemApp library (C) 2009 IMACS Published by Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "IDS: Thermodynamic-kinetic-empirical tool for modelling of solidification, microstructure and material properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000277905600015"}
