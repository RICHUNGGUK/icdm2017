Also, this author defined the notion of neutrosophic topology on the non-standard interval. One can expect some relation between the intuitionistic fuzzy topology OFT) on an IFS and the neutrosophic topology. This paper aims to show that this is false. Design/methodology/approach - The possible relation between the IFT and the neutrosophic topology is studied. Findings - Relations on neutrosophic topology and IFT are found. Research limitations/implications - Clearly, this paper is confined to IFSs and NSs. Practical implications - The main applications are in the mathematical field. Originality/value - The paper shows original results on fuzzy sets and topology.", "paper_title": "On neutrosophic topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000257527800009"}
