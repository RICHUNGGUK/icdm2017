By adopting a novel orthogonal framework, keyboards are defined as two-dimensional regular arrays of keys. Non-expert users can fast and intuitively input any possible combination of pseudo-syllables, which are text entry units with simpler consonant-vowel phonemic structure. Moreover, it is possible to input single characters in the typical letter-by-letter way. For transparent languages such as Italian and Spanish, the performed tests have shown a significant improvement in the efficiency of typing texts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
