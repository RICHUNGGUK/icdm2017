By utilizing the idea inductively in the nested orthogonal complement subspaces, the proposed algorithm succeeds to relax the numerical sensitivity which has been annoying conventional adaptive minor subspace extraction algorithms for example, Oja algorithm ('82) and its stabilized version: O-Oja algorithm ('02). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm realizes more stable convergence than O-Oja algorithm.", "paper_title": "An efficient adaptive minor subspace extraction using exact nested orthogonal complement structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300003"}
