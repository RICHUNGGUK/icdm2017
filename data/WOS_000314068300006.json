Despite their efficiency and robustness, the complexity of these algorithms results in reduced performance when executed on general purpose processors. This paper proposes an application-specific system for accelerating a neuromorphic vision system for object recognition. The system is based on HMAX, a biologically-inspired model of the visual cortex. The neuromorphic accelerators are validated on a multi-FPGA system. Results show that the neuromorphic accelerators are 13.8x (2.6x) more power efficient when compared to CPU (GPU) implementation.", "paper_title": "Hardware Acceleration for Neuromorphic Vision Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000314068300006"}
