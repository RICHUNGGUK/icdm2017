However, developing and evolving a DSML is typically a difficult and time-consuming task because it requires to develop and maintain a code generator, which transforms application models into framework-based code. In this paper, we propose a new approach for extending object-oriented frameworks that aims to alleviate this problem. The approach is based on developing an additional aspect-oriented layer that encodes a DSML for building framework-based applications, eliminating the need of implementing a code generator. We further show how a language workbench is capable of automating the construction of DSMLs using the proposed layer. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
