In this article, a new deterministic algorithm for the problem is developed that integrates and improves a number of known techniques, including greedy localization, dynamic programming, and color coding. The new algorithm, which either constructs a matching of k triples in a given triple set or correctly reports that no such a matching exists, runs in time O*(2.80(3k)), improving a long list of previous algorithms for the problem.", "paper_title": "Iterative Expansion and Color Coding: An Improved Algorithm for 3D-Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000301391300006"}
