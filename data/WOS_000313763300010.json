However, true imitation is based on abstraction and conceptualization. This article presents a model for conceptual imitation through interaction with the teacher to abstract spatio-temporal demonstrations based on their functional meaning. Abstraction, concept acquisition, and self-organization of proto-symbols are performed through an incremental and gradual learning algorithm. In this algorithm, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used to abstract perceptually similar demonstrations. However, abstract (relational) concepts emerge as a collection of HMMs irregularly scattered in the perceptual space but showing the same functionality. Performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in two experimental scenarios. The first one is a human-robot interaction task of imitating signs produced by hand movements. The second one is a simulated interactive task of imitating whole body motion patterns of a humanoid model. Experimental results show efficiency of our model for concept extraction, proto-symbol emergence, motion pattern recognition, prediction, and generation.", "paper_title": "Conceptual Imitation Learning in a Human-Robot Interaction Paradigm", "paper_id": "WOS:000313763300010"}
