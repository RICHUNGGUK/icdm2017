The main contribution of the proposed phase resetting scheme is its predefined constant response time given a single-pulse perturbation and an arbitrary phase resetting curve (PRC) that can be modified at any time. Phase resetting is a feature present in physiological oscillating systems, which can be utilized in robotics and other control applications as a feedback strategy to provide robust adaptation to unexpected external stimuli. The proposed technique can be applied to CPG networks based on the Matsuoka neuron's model. The performance of this phase resetting strategy is assessed through both simulation and a real application to locomotion control of a biped robot. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
