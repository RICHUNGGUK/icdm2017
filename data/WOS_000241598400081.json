This paper presents a novel methodology, based on a deterministic walk, to texture analysis and texture characterization. Most of the methods adopted to classify textures deal with a defined fixed scale of texture. The method proposed here explores the set in all scales and is able to characterize efficiently different texture classes. The paper presents the deterministic walk technique and its results for two experiments using Brodatz images.", "paper_title": "Deterministic tourist walks as an image analysis methodology based", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400081"}
