We identify iteration overlapping as a knob in the synthesis process by which one can trade application throughput for its memory requirement. Given an initial processor assignment and non-overlapped task schedule, we formally present underlying properties of the problem, such as constraints on a valid iteration overlapping, maximum possible throughput, and minimum memory footprint. Moreover, we develop an effective algorithm for generation of a rich set of design points that provide a range of trade-off options. Experimental results on a number of applications and architectures validate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Throughput-Memory Footprint Trade-Off in Synthesis of Streaming Software on Embedded Multiprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000329136000006"}
