In this note, we deal with the pumping lemma in L-valued automata theory. After recalling some preliminaries related to complete residuated lattices and L-valued automata, we define a number of L-valued accepting predicates. In particular, the pumping lemma for L-valued automata theory is set up. We show that if those related L-valued predicates are defined by using connective A instead of &, then the pumping lemma may not hold again. Furthermore, we investigate the L-valued automata with e-transitions, and present the equivalence between the L-valued automata without e-transitions and those with epsilon-transitions. Finally, a number of related questions is addressed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
