A multisymplectic pseudospectral discretization for the Zakharov system is presented in this paper. The preservation of discrete normal conservation law is proved theoretically. The propagation and the collision behaviors of the solitary waves are investigated numerically. Numerical results show the present method with advantages such as exponential convergence rate in space. Also it keeps the well preservation of other discrete conserved quantities during long-time numerical calculation.
