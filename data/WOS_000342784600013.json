Carbon nanotube field effect transistors are used in this paper to design new Ternary Half and Full Adders, which are essential components of Ternary ripple-carry adder. The novel designs take the sum of input variables as a single input signal, and generate outputs in a way which is far more efficient than the previously presented similar structures. The new ripple-carry adder operates rapidly, with high performance, and low-transistor-count.", "paper_title": "Optimized Adder Cells for Ternary Ripple-Carry Addition", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784600013"}
