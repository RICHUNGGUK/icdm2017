We first establish a new parametric model with unknown plant parameters and actuator failure parameters, which differs from some existing results. Then, an adaptive compensation controller is constructed by utilizing the backstepping technique. The boundedness of all closed-loop signals is guaranteed. The tracking error is proved to converge to zero asymptotically. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme.
