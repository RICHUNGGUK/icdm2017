For schemata of propositional clause sets, we prove that this calculus is sound, refutationally complete, and terminating. The calculus is extended to first-order clauses, for which termination is lost, since the satisfiability problem is not semi-decidable for non-propositional schemata. The expressive power of the considered logic is strictly greater than the one considered in our previous work.", "paper_title": "A Resolution Calculus for First-order Schemata", "paper_id": "WOS:000322027600001"}
