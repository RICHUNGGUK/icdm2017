Since only few samples can be obtained in the early stages of a system and fewer exemplars usually lead to a low learning accuracy, this research compares different machine learning methods through their classification accuracies to improve small-data-set learning. Techniques used in this paper include the mega-trend diffusion technique, a backpropagation neural network, a support vector machine, and decision trees to explore the machine learning issue with two real medical data sets concerning cancer. The result of the experiment shows that the mega-trend diffusion technique and backpropagation approaches are effective methods of small-data-set learning.", "paper_title": "Acquiring knowledge with limited experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000247125400003"}
