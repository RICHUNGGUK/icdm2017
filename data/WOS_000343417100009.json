In this paper, we show that Jarecki et al.'s second protocol has some drawbacks. We propose a new affiliation-hiding protocol. Differing from Jarecki et al.'s protocol, our protocol is asymmetric. Compared with existing AH-AGKA protocols, our scheme not only exhibits the affiliation-hiding property, but also holds the properties of detectability and perfect forward secrecy.", "paper_title": "Affiliation-Hiding Authenticated Asymmetric Group Key Agreement Based on Short Signature", "paper_id": "WOS:000343417100009"}
