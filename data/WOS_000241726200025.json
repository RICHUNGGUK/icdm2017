This architecture is based on a data-repairing framework exploiting integrity constraints defined on the input data to support the detection and the repair of inconsistencies in the data arising from errors occurring in the acquisition phase. In particular, a specific but expressive form of integrity constraints (steady aggregate constraints) is defined which enables the computation of a repair to be expressed as a mixed integer linear programming problem.", "paper_title": "DART: A data acquisition and repairing tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200025"}
