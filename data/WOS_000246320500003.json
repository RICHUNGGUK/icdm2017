This is a part-time graduate program where students are required to complete 10 courses and a research project for the degree over 2 years. The course delivery is through a mixture of real-time virtual classes, asynchronous online forums/resources, two capstone courses each summer as a 2-week intensive on-campus workshop, and a major workplace related field research project. Examples of innovation include the use of Web-based conferencing for real-time virtual classes, simulated tele-debriefing for policy/decision makers, roundtable sessions with chief information officers, modularized professional development courses, and joint field research project oversight with employers. The paper then discusses the need to refine the program/course offering to ensure its consistency to current HI curriculum and competency standards, pleas for a coordinated approach to HI capacity building in Canada, and outlines planned next steps for the School in the coming year.
