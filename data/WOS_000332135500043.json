Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes a novel fast multipole method (FMM) called Super-FMM to solve the PFEF problems in substations. The paper substitutes the original approaches for analytic expansions and translations through equivalent density representations. Findings - The paper shows that the Super-FMM is more efficient in terms of the complexity of its storage spaces and computational costs compared with the best-known FMM when placed under scenarios with exactly the same error rates. Research limitations/implications - Using the fast Fourier transform algorithm can further improve the optimization algorithm and computational efficiency. Originality/value - A novel FMM called Super-FIVIM is proposed, which has a structure similar to that of the adaptive FIVIM algorithm, but the paper substitutes the original approaches for analytic expansions and translations through equivalent density representations.", "paper_title": "Super-fast multipole method for power frequency electric field in substations", "paper_id": "WOS:000332135500043"}
