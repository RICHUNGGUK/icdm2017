Upstream, this method is based on a theoretical choice, the use of a spatio-temporal reference frame to construct urban areas over the long term, defined by a maximum range of one hour's travel for each period. We used an automatic aggregation from a Reilly model. Urban measures (growth, concentration) derived from this harmonized database are then presented, providing a unified picture of urbanization in the United States over more than two centuries. They are compared with results derived from more classical databases established using the official figures from the Census Bureau, or from other constructions differing from the present system. The results diverge considerably in some instances, which confirms the impact of the method of delineation of geographical areas in measures of growth.", "paper_title": "Urbanization of the United States over two centuries: an approach based on a long-term database (1790-2010)", "paper_id": "WOS:000355680500008"}
