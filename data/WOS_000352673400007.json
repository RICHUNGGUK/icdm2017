Thereby CLOSTT is part of a control architecture developed to coordinate existing single heterogeneous autonomous marine vehicles as a team. Within this control architecture CLOSTT separately offers a solution to the task of following a moving underwater target with a team of unmanned marine vehicles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
