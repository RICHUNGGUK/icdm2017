The proposed method makes use of object silhouettes to classify objects and actions of humans present in a scene monitored by a stationary camera. An adaptive background subtracttion model is used for object segmentation. Template matching based supervised learning method is adopted to classify objects into classes like human, human group and vehicle; and human actions into predefined classes like walking, boxing and kicking by making use of object silhouettes.", "paper_title": "Silhouette-based method for object classification and human action recognition in video", "paper_id": "WOS:000238080300007"}
