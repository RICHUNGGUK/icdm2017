Known algorithms solve this problem in time polynomial in the sum of the lengths of the generators of H and exponential in the rank of F. We show that the latter dependency can be made exponential in the rank difference rank(F) - rank(H), which often makes a significant change.", "paper_title": "On an algorithm to decide whether a free group is a free factor of another", "paper_id": "WOS:000254189700012"}
