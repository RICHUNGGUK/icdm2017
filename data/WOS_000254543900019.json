There is practical evidence that combinatorial optimization in power-law graphs is easier than in general graphs, prompting the basic theoretical question: Is combinatorial optimization in power-law graphs easy? Does the answer depend on the power-law exponent beta? Our main result is the proof that many classical NP-hard graph-theoretic optimization problems remain NP-hard on power-law graphs for certain values of beta. In particular, we show that some classical problems, such as CLIQUE and COLORING, remain NP-hard for all beta >= 1. Moreover, we show that all the problems that satisfy the so-called \"optimal substructure property\" remain NP-hard for all beta >= 0. This includes classical problems such as MINIMUM VERTEX COVER, MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT SET, and MINIMUM DOMINATING SET. Our proofs involve designing efficient algorithms for constructing graphs with prescribed degree sequences that are tractable with respect to various optimization problems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
