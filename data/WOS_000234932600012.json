Currently, because a large number of documents are divided into several subgroups in a hierarchy, we can appropriately use a hierarchical classification method. However, we have no systematic method to build a hierarchical classification system that performs well with large collections of practical data. In this article, we introduce a new evaluation scheme for internal node classifiers, which can be used effectively to develop a hierarchical classification system. We also show that our method for constructing the hierarchical classification system is very effective, especially for the task of constructing classifiers applied to hierarchy tree with a lot of levels.", "paper_title": "An effective procedure for constructing a hierarchical text classification system", "paper_id": "WOS:000234932600012"}
