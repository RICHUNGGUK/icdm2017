This paper presents a model concept which is denoted 'phenomenological' in terms of the processes responsible for soil deformation, since the effects of deformation on flow and transport are only considered by constitutive relations that allow an adaptation of the hydraulic properties. This new model is validated in a detailed intercomparison study with two state-of-the-art models that are capable of explicitly describing the processes relevant for the deformation. A 'numerical experiment' with a state-of-the-art reference model is used to produce 'measurement data' for an inverse-modelling-based estimation of the model input parameters for the phenomenological concept.", "paper_title": "A model for multiphase flow and transport in porous media including a phenomenological approach to account for deformation-a model concept and its validation within a code intercomparison study", "paper_id": "WOS:000268771300003"}
