By taking advantage of the common-gate transistor's noise and distortion cancellation property in CG-CS-based balun topology, this balun-LNA just focuses on CS-stage's noise and linearity improvement. Post-distortion technique with a p-MOSFET as auxiliary transistor is adopted to suppress the 2nd and 3rd nonlinear terms of the main transistor in CS-stage, and then across 0.2-4.35 GHz, above 34 dBm IIP2 and 7.5 dBm IIP3 with typical process corner is achieved. In addition, in order to reduce the considerable substrate noise from the main transistor in CS-stage, a large resistor is connected between its bulk and source terminal, which reduces the substrate noise contribution from 7.68 to 0.2 % and improves the noise figure (NF) at 1 GHz about 0.38 dB. This balun-LNA was designed in 0.18-mu m CMOS, operates from 0.2 to 4.35 GHz, and dissipates 17.8 mW with 1.5-V supply. With typical process corner, this amplifier provides 17.2-dB maximum voltage gain and 2.5-3.2 dB NF.", "paper_title": "0.2-4.35 GHz highly linear CMOS balun-LNA with substrate noise optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000354055300001"}
