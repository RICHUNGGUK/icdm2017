In this context, many XML filtering systems have been proposed to efficiently identify XML data that matches user interests expressed as queries in an XML query language like XPath. However, in order to offer XML filtering functionality on an Internet-scale, we need to deploy such a service in a distributed environment, avoiding bottlenecks that can deteriorate performance. In this work, we design and implement FoXtrot, a system for filtering XML data that combines the strengths of automata for efficient filtering and distributed hash tables for building a fully distributed system. Apart from structural-matching, performed using automata, we also discuss different methods for evaluating value-based predicates. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our system, FoXtrot, on a local cluster and on the PlanetLab network and demonstrate that it can index millions of user queries, achieving a high indexing and filtering throughput. At the same time, FoXtrot exhibits very good load-balancing properties and improves its performance as we increase the size of the network.", "paper_title": "FoXtrot: Distributed Structural and Value XML Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000309426900003"}
