The recognition of a hand-shape is a difficult problem, as appearance of the hand changes largely depending on viewpoint, illumination conditions and individual characteristics. To overcome this problem, we apply the Kernel Orthogonal Mutual Subspace Method (KOMSM) to shift-invariance features obtained from multi-viewpoint images of a hand. When applying KOMSM to hand recognition with a lot of learning images from each class, it is necessary to consider how to run the KOMSM with heavy computational cost due to the kernel trick technique. We propose a new method that can drastically reduce the computational cost of KOMSM by adopting centroids and the number of images belonging to the centroids, which are obtained by using k-means clustering. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through evaluation experiments using multi-viewpoint image sets of 30 classes of hand-shapes.", "paper_title": "Hand-Shape Recognition Using the Distributions of Multi-Viewpoint Image Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000305203800006"}
