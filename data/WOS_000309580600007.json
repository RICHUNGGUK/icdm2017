In recent years, a large number of algorithms have been proposed for recommendation systems. In this paper, we describe an open-source toolkit implementing many recommendation algorithms as well as popular evaluation metrics. In contrast to other packages, our toolkit implements recent state-of-the-art algorithms as well as most classic algorithms.", "paper_title": "PREA: Personalized Recommendation Algorithms Toolkit", "paper_id": "WOS:000309580600007"}
