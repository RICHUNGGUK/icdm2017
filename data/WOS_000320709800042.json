For this purpose, random sequential (RS) relaying is studied. It is shown that random unitary matrix multiplication at the relay nodes empowers the RS scheme to achieve a better diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) as compared to the traditional AF relaying. First, the RS scheme is proved to achieve the optimum DMT for a multiantenna full-duplex single-relay two-hop network. Applying this result, a new achievable DMT is derived for the case of multiantenna half-duplex parallel relay network. Interestingly, it turns out that the DMT of the RS scheme is optimum for the case of multiantenna two parallel noninterfering half-duplex relays. Furthermore, random unitary matrix multiplication is shown to also improve the DMT of the nonorthogonal AF relaying scheme for the case of a multiantenna single relay channel. Finally, the general case of multiantenna full-duplex relay networks is studied. First, a new lower-bound is derived on its DMT using the RS scheme. Furthermore, maximum multiplexing gain of the network is also shown to be achievable by traditional amplify-forward relaying. The gain value is equal to the minimum vertex cut-set of the underlying graph of the network, which can be computed in polynomial time in terms of the number of network nodes.", "paper_title": "Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff in Multiantenna Multirelay Networks: Improvements and Some Optimality Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000320709800042"}
