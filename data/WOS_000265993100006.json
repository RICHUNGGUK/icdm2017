The main idea is to firstly extract the feature lines of the object, and secondly construct the subdivision surface over this network. Control points are created by approximating these lines while the connectivity is built with respect to the anisotropy of the object. Our algorithm reinforces the similarity between the subdivision surface and the original shape by affecting an integer sharpness degree to each control edge in order to accurately reproduce the different curvature radii of corresponding fillets and blends.
