The algorithms are inequivalent to Laderman's one with respect to the transformation introduced by de Groote. We present a simple and fast numerical heuristic for finding valid algorithms. Then we show that many of the obtained algorithms are inequivalent to the published ones. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
