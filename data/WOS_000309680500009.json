On the other hand, there are many classes of graphs which are hard to make triangle-free, in the sense that it is necessary to remove roughly m/2 edges in order to eliminate all triangles. We prove that dense graphs that are hard to make triangle-free have a large packing of pairwise edge-disjoint triangles. In particular, they have more than m(1/4 + c beta) pairwise edge-disjoint triangles where beta is the density of the graph and c >= 1/100 is an absolute constant. This improves upon a previous m(1/4 - o(1)) bound which follows from the asymptotic validity of Tuza's conjecture for dense graphs. We conjecture that such graphs have an asymptotically optimal triangle packing of size m(1/3 - o(1)). We extend our result from triangles to larger cliques and odd cycles.", "paper_title": "Dense Graphs With a Large Triangle Cover Have a Large Triangle Packing", "paper_id": "WOS:000309680500009"}
