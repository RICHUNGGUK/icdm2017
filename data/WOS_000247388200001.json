Denote the set of all copies of K in G by K. A non-negative real-valued function f : K -> R+ is called a fractional K-factor if Sigma(K:v is an element of K is an element of K), f(K) <= 1 for every v is an element of V and Sigma(K is an element of K) f(K) = n/r. For a non-empty graph K let d(K) = e(K)/v(K) and d((1))(K) = e(K)/(v(K) - 1). We say that K is strictly K-1-balanced if for every proper subgraph K-(1) K, d((1))(K) < d((1))(K). We say that K is imbalanced if it has a subgraph K' such that d(K') > d(K). Considering a random graph process el on n vertices, we show that if K is strictly K-1 -balanced, then with probability tending to 1 as n -> 1.00, at the first moment tau(0) when every vertex is covered by a copy of K, the graph G(tau 0) has a fractional K-factor. This result is the best possible. As a consequence, if K is K-1 -balanced, we derive the threshold probability function for a random graph to have a fractional K-factor. On the other hand, we show that if K is an imbalanced graph, then for asymptotically almost every graph process there is a gap between ro and the appearance of a fractional K-factor. We also introduce and apply a criteria for perfect fractional matchings in hypergraphs in terms of expansion properties.
