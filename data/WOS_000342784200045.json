The core process is based on adaptive diagonal color separation to recover color components from a white signal using diagonal reference blocks and location-based color ratio estimation in the luminance space. The experiments, which are compared with the RGB and state-of-the-art WRGB approaches, show that our imaging system performs well for various spatial frequency images and color restoration in low-light environments.", "paper_title": "An Improved White-RGB Color Filter Array Based CMOS Imaging System for Cell Phones in Low-Light Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784200045"}
