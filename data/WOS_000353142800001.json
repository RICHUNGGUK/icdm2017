In this paper, a new local image descriptor, termed distinctive efficient robust features (DERF), is derived by modeling the response and distribution properties of the parvocellular-projecting ganglion cells in the primate retina. DERF features exponential scale distribution, exponential grid structure, and circularly symmetric function difference of Gaussian (DoG) used as a convolution kernel, all of which are consistent with the characteristics of the ganglion cell array found in neurophysiology, anatomy, and biophysics. In addition, a new explanation for local descriptor design is presented from the perspective of wavelet tight frames. DoG is naturally a wavelet, and the structure of the grid points array in our descriptor is closely related to the spatial sampling of wavelets. The DoG wavelet itself forms a frame, and when we modulate the parameters of our descriptor to make the frame tighter, the performance of the DERF descriptor improves accordingly. This is verified by designing a tight frame DoG, which leads to much better performance. Extensive experiments conducted in the image matching task on the multiview stereo correspondence data set demonstrate that DERF outperforms state of the art methods for both hand-crafted and learned descriptors, while remaining robust and being much faster to compute.", "paper_title": "DERF: Distinctive Efficient Robust Features From the Biological Modeling of the P Ganglion Cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000353142800001"}
