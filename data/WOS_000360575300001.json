The authors also examine how customers' prior transaction experience could impact their social commerce trust development and the trust transfer process. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed research model is empirically examined using a survey method consisting of 375 users of a social commerce web site (SCW). The statistical analysis applies a method based on variance using partial least squares. Findings - The results confirm positive impacts of social commerce trust on company trust, and their subsequent influences on consumers' eWOM intention. Also, consumers' prior experience is found to moderate the trust transfer process from information-based social commerce trust to company trust. Originality/value - The present study is one of the first few studies that attempts to explain trust development and transfer with SCWs with a theoretical foundation as well as examine the role of consumers' prior experience during trust transfer. It provides practical guidance for the improvement of trust and eWOM in social commerce.", "paper_title": "Trust development and transfer in social commerce: prior experience as moderator", "paper_id": "WOS:000360575300001"}
