Our method includes an analysis of group personality composition and trust between each group member to improve the accuracy of group recommenders. This way we simulate the argumentation process followed by groups of people when agreeing on a common activity in a more realistic way. Moreover, we reflect how they expect the system to behave in a long term recommendation process. This is achieved by including a memory of past recommendations that increases the satisfaction of users whose preferences have not been taken into account in previous recommendations.", "paper_title": "Social Factors in Group Recommender Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000321962000008"}
