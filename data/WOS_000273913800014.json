It has three distinctive features. First, the same method can be applied to single or multiple time series. Second, it employs a flexible family of information criteria, whose loss functions can be adapted to the statistical properties of the data. Last, it does not require the specification of a model for the analysed series. In addition, we provide a subspace-based consistent estimator for the cointegrating rank and the cointegrating matrix. Simulation exercises show that these procedures have good finite sample properties.", "paper_title": "Unit roots and cointegration modelling through a family of flexible information criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000273913800014"}
