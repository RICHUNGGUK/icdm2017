DNA microarray gene expression datasets are readily utilized for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a feature selection method using improved regularized linear discriminant analysis technique to select important genes, crucial for human cancer classification problem. The experiment is conducted on several DNA microarray gene expression datasets and promising results are obtained when compared with several other existing feature selection methods.", "paper_title": "A feature selection method using improved regularized linear discriminant analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000333364300016"}
