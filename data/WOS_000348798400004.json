The present paper focuses on identifying a tractable subset of this problem, namely verifying whether a structured business process is compliant with a single global obligation. Global obligations are those whose validity spans for the entire execution of a business process. We identify two types of obligations: achievement and maintenance. In the present paper we firstly define an abstract framework capable to model the problem and secondly we define procedures and algorithms to deal with the compliance problem of checking the compliance of a structured business process with respect to a single global obligation. We show that the algorithms proposed in the paper run in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for tractable compliance problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000348798400004"}
