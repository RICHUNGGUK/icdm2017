As well as the core Rivet library, this manual describes the usage of the rivet program and the AGILe generator interface library. The depth and level of description is chosen for users of the system, starting with the basics of using validation code written by others, and then covering sufficient details to write new Rivet analyses and calculational components.

Rivet is such a framework, and contains at the same time a large collection of existing measurements. Solution method: Rivet is based on HepMC events, a standardised output format provided by many theory simulation tools. Events are processed by Rivet to generate histograms for the requested list of analyses, incorporating all experimental phase space cuts and histogram definitions. Restrictions: Cannot calculate statistical errors for correlated events as they appear in NLO calculations. Unusual features: It is possible for the user to implement and use their own custom analysis as a module without having to modify the main Rivet code/installation. Running time: Depends on the number and complexity of analyses being applied, but typically a few hundred events per second. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
