In a previous paper, we showed that a bipartite graph G can be drawn as a generalized thrackle on an oriented closed surface M if and only if G can be embedded in M. In this paper, we use Lins' notion of a parity embedding and show that a non-bipartite graph can be drawn as a generalized thrackle on an oriented closed surface M if and only if there is a parity embedding of G in a closed non-orientable surface of Euler characteristic (X)( M) - 1. As a corollary, we prove a sharp upper bound for the number of edges of a simple generalized thrackle.", "paper_title": "Generalized Thrackle Drawings of Non-bipartite Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000261831500007"}
