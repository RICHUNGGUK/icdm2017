Two algebraic methods for solving the observability problems are given, one global approach based on null-spaces and a step by step procedure allowing updating the information once each item of information (OD-pair or link flow) becomes available. In particular, seven different observability problems are stated and solved using the proposed methods, which are illustrated by their application to the Nguyen-Dupuis network problem. The results show that the proposed methods provide useful information on which OD-pair or link flows are informative on other OD-pair and link flows, and that the methods are applicable to large networks.", "paper_title": "The observability problem in traffic network models", "paper_id": "WOS:000253148500004"}
