It is aimed at making more numerous admissible representations of motion in the algorithm. The representations allow designing a shape of trajectories joining the initial and final configuration of the motion planning task. This feature is especially important in motion planning in a cluttered environment. Some natural functions are introduced to measure the shape of a trajectory in the configuration space and to evaluate trajectories corresponding to different representations of motion.", "paper_title": "MOTION REPRESENTATIONS FOR THE LAFFERRIERE-SUSSMANN ALGORITHM FOR NILPOTENT CONTROL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000295124400011"}
