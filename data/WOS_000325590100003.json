As a security requirement, it is typically stated that the programs of such languages should satisfy noninterference. However, this property has not been defined and proven semantically. In this paper, we first propose a semantics based on Henkin models for a predicative polymorphic access control language based on lambda-calculus. A formal semantic definition of noninterference is then proposed through logical relations. We prove a type soundness theorem which states that any well-typed program of our language meets the noninterference property defined in this paper. In this way, it is guaranteed that access requests from an entity do not interfere with those from unrelated or more trusted entities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
