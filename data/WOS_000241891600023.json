This paper investigates a formulation using the two-norm for the misclassification error and appending a bias norm to objective function that leads to a positive definite quadratic program only with the nonnegative constraint under a duality construction. An unconstrained convex program problem, which minimizes a differentiable convex piecewise quadratic function, is proposed as the Lagrangian dual of the quadratic program. Then an exact semismooth Newton support vector machine (ESNSVM) is obtained to solve the program speedily. Some numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is very efficient comparing with the similar algorithms such as LSVM.", "paper_title": "Exact semismooth Newton SVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600023"}
