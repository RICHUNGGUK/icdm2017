We developed an initial attack airtanker system (IAAS) model and a heuristic procedure that fire managers can use to help resolve their daily airtanker deployment decisions The IAAS model is a spatial time-dependant multi-server queueing system with fires as customers and airtankers as mobile servers The differential-difference equations that describe the system are solved numerically and the results are used to predict the time-dependent performance of the airtanker system in terms of expected virtual response time (the elapsed time from the time a fire is reported until the time an airtanker arrives at the fire to begin initial attack action) over time given a specified deployment of airtankers to airports. We evaluate the IAAS model by comparing its results with those produced by a more realistic simulation model. The spatial deployment heuristic uses the IAAS model to identify improved daily airtanker deployment strategies We also suggest a myopic replanning heuristic to provide pragmatic solutions to the daily airtanker deployment problem", "paper_title": "A Time-Dependent Spatial Queueing Model for the Daily Deployment of Airtankers for Forest Fire Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000283637600006"}
