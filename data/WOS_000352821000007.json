Based on the mathematical model of DFIG under unbalanced and distorted voltage, the proportional and integral (PI) regulator is adopted to regulate the DFIG average active and reactive powers, while the vector PI (VPI) resonant regulator is used to achieve three alternative control targets: (1) balanced and sinusoidal stator current; (2) smooth instantaneous stator active and reactive powers; (3) smooth electromagnetic torque and instantaneous stator reactive power. The major advantage of the proposed control strategy over the conventional method is that neither negative and harmonic sequence decomposition of grid voltage nor complicated control reference calculation is required. The insensitivity of the proposed control strategy to DFIG parameter deviation is analyzed. Finally, the DFIG experimental system is developed to validate the availability of the proposed DPC strategy under unbalanced and distorted grid voltage.", "paper_title": "Multiple target implementation for a doubly fed induction generator based on direct power control under unbalanced and distorted grid voltage", "paper_id": "WOS:000352821000007"}
