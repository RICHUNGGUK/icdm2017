Also, there is not a wide agreement on the best procedure for bounding the 3D errors within an uncertainty volume. In this work, this problem is solved by implementing the whole set of computations, including calibration and triangulation, with interval data. This is in contrast with previous works that rely on Direct Linear Transform (DLT) as a camera model. To keep better with real lens aberrations, a local iterative modification is proposed that provides an on-demand set of calibration parameters for each 3D point, comprising those nearest in 3D space. In this way, the estimated camera parameters are closely related with camera aberrations at the lens area through which that 3D point is imaged. To further reduce the triangulation uncertainty volume, a Soft Computing approach is proposed that represents each 3D point uncertainty as a cloud of crisp points compatible with interval-valued calibration data. Real data from previous works in related research areas is used to judge whether the new approach improves the precision and accuracy of other crisp and interval-valued estimations without degrading precision, and it is concluded that the new technique is able to significantly improve the uncertainty volumes.
