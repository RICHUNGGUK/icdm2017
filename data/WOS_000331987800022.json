We investigate and report the effects of using multi-radio, multi-channel relay nodes in the mesh networking infrastructure in terms of network and application layer performance metrics. We also study the effects of physical channel separation on achievable end-to-end goodput perceived by the applications in the multi-radio case by varying the channel separation between the radio interfaces of a multi-radio relay node. We have observed that the difference between TCP and UDP goodput performances together with the delay and jitter performance depends on the hop count. We also observed that assigning overlapping channels with a central frequency separation of 5-15 MHz may render the CSMA mechanism used in 802.11 MAC ineffective and hence reduce the overall network performance. Finally, we provide some suggestions that can be considered while designing related protocols and algorithms to deal with the observed facts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
