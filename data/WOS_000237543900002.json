This paper presents a middleware system called GLWSA (Geo-Located Web Services Architecture) that aims to satisfy these requirements in addition to providing a thematic factorization of common location functions in order to locate mobile clients. The GLWSA supports a set of GLWSMs (Geo-Located Web Services Manager) distributed over the mobile network. It defines protocols to discover and inform a Supplier Application Server ( SAS) to migrate the service execution ( from a specific client) to the nearest SAS based on the client's location. This architecture is suitable to assist mobile clients to discover the geo-located Web services and to maintain the service execution closest to their location.", "paper_title": "Discovering the architecture of geo-located Web services for next generation mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237543900002"}
