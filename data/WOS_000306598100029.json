To solve this problem, a set of multifocal images can be used to extend the depth of the field by fusing the best-focused image regions to an overall well-focused composite image. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based method that avoids the computational cost problem of previous extended-depth-of-field algorithms. On the basis of the special optical geometry properties of catadioptric systems, the proposed model describes the shapes of the best-focused image regions in multifocal images by a series of neighboring concentric annuluses. Then we propose a method to estimate the model parameters. On the basis of this model, an overall well-focused image is obtained by combining the best-focused regions with a fast and reliable online operation. Experiments on catadioptric images of a variety of different scenes and camera settings verify the validity of the model and the robust performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Overall Well-Focused Catadioptric Image Acquisition With Multifocal Images: A Model-Based Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000306598100029"}
