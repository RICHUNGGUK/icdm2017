For a component made of heterogeneous materials, its functional requirements can be satisfied by changing the component's configuration or materials' distribution. Thus, its geometric feature and material feature are coupled with each other. For the reason of the coupling of geometry with material and the non-linearity of design problem, the conventional gradient-based algorithm is not very competent. To address this issue, the combining algorithm is used in such a way that, the increments of geometric variables can be calculated by MFD while that of material variables are obtained through GA, which implements their simultaneous optimization and solves their coupling. An isothermal heat utensil made of ZrO2 and Ni is designed and the optimization result shows that the method proposed is of good engineering applicability.", "paper_title": "Concurrent design of heterogeneous object based on method of feasible direction and genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600102"}
