It is found that a phase separation phenomenon, in which the system separates into coexistence of free flow and jam, could be observed in intermediate vehicle density range when traffic light period T >= 4. We have explained the reason of occurrence of phase separation and investigated its behavior in different traffic light period. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
