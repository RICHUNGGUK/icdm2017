The proposed design can deliver the required stimulus current within a specific range of loading impedance. Besides, this design in 0.18-mu m low-voltage CMOS process can be operated with high supply voltage (VCC) of 5-10 V without using the high-voltage transistors, and the process steps of high-voltage transistors can be reduced. The proposed design can be further integrated for an electronic epilepsy prosthetic system-on-chip.", "paper_title": "Design of high-voltage-tolerant stimulus driver with adaptive loading consideration to suppress epileptic seizure in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process", "paper_id": "WOS:000333611000003"}
