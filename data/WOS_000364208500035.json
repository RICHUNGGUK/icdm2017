At high sampling rates, such techniques face the problems of high algorithmic complexity and component delays. We present a new resistive switching-based threshold logic cell which encodes the pixels of a template image. The cell comprises a voltage divider circuit that programs the resistances of the memristors arranged in a single-node threshold logic network, and the output is encoded as a binary value by using a CMOS inverter gate. When a test image is applied to the template-programmed cell, a mismatch in the respective pixels is seen as a change in the output voltage of the cell. The proposed cell when compared with CMOS equivalent implementation shows improved performance in area, leakage power, power dissipation, and delay.", "paper_title": "Memristive Threshold Logic Circuit Design of Fast Moving Object Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208500035"}
