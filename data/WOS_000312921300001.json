Conditions on the nondivergence and global attractivity are established by using local inhibition, respectively. Moreover, exponential convergence of the networks is studied by using local invariant sets. The analysis in the paper employs results from the theory of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand sides as introduced by Filippov. The obtained results extend some previous works on conventional recurrent neural networks. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
