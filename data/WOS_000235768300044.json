It is shown that optimizing spatial sampling interval of fingerprint image has equivalent effect of optimizing high limit frequency of low-pass filter in the process of phase based correlation. The processing time is 83% shorter for the former than the latter. An ASIC has been designed, and it is shown that fingerprint matching based access controller for residential applications can be successfully realized.", "paper_title": "Fast and robust fingerprint identification algorithm and its application to residential access controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300044"}
