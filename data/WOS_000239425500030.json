In addition, the track also expanded by offering an alternative document collection, by including two additional tasks, and by attracting more participating groups: A total of 11 research groups and 119 test persons participated in the three different tasks that were included in the track. In this paper, we describe the main issues that the Interactive Track at INEX 2005 attempts to address and the methodology and tasks that were used in the track.", "paper_title": "The Interactive Track at INEX 2005", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425500030"}
