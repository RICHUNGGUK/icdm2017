The nodes in WSN are battery operated in general; therefore, every operation in WSN should be energy aware. Routing in WSN is handled by network layer across the network from source to destination that should perform its task in energy aware fashion. There are different types of routing protocols and cluster routing is one of those. In literature, it has been suggested that hybrid routing is energy aware and load balanced routing technique. In this research work, we have analyzed different intra cluster routing techniques and have proposed the best intra cluster routing technique which is good for load balancing in order to increase the life time of the network. We have analyzed three different types of hybrid intra cluster routing techniques. In order to reach conclusion, we have implemented/ simulated and compared different intra cluster routing techniques proposed in the literature. The recommended algorithm extends the life time of the WSN and distributes the load among the nodes more uniformly.", "paper_title": "Dependability and reliability analysis of intra cluster routing technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000358990200009"}
