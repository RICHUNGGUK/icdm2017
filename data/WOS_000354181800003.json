The long-term evolution (LTE)/LTE-advanced standards have been introduced aiming to cope with this challenge. In particular, the resource allocation problem in downlink needs to be carefully considered. Herein, a solution is proposed by resorting to a modified multidimensional multiple-choice knapsack problem modeling, leading to an efficient solution. The proposed algorithm is able to manage different traffic flows taking into account users priority, queues delay, and channel conditions achieving quasi-optimal performance results with a lower complexity. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution with respect to other alternatives.
