The L(2, I)-labeling number.(G) of G is the smallest number k such that G has an L(2, I)-labeling with max{f (v) : v is an element of V(G)} = k. Griggs and Yeh conjecture that lambda(G) <=Delta(2) for any simple graph with maximum degree Delta >= 2. This paper considers the graph formed by the skew product and the converse skew product of two graphs with a new approach on the analysis of adjacency matrices of the graphs as in [W.C. Shin, Z.
