It generates isotropic simplicial meshes-surface triangular meshes or volume tetrahedral meshes-from input surfaces, 3D domains, and 3D multidomains, with or without sharp features. The underlying meshing algorithm relies on restricted Delaunay triangulations to approximate domains and surfaces and on Delaunay refinement to ensure both approximation accuracy and mesh quality. CGALmesh provides guarantees on approximation quality and on the size and shape of the mesh elements. It provides four optional mesh optimization algorithms to further improve the mesh quality. A distinctive property of CGALmesh is its high flexibility with respect to the input domain representation. Such a flexibility is achieved through a careful software design, gathering into a single abstract concept, denoted by the oracle, all required interface features between themeshing engine and the input domain. We already provide oracles for domains defined by polyhedral and implicit surfaces.", "paper_title": "CGALmesh: A Generic Framework for Delaunay Mesh Generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000363733000001"}
