We show that the sequence of solution functions defined by the unique solution of the regularized LCP is monotonically increasing and converges to the implicit solution function as the regularization parameter goes down to zero. Moreover, each component of the implicit solution function is convex. We find that the solution set of the irreducible P-0 and Z matrix LCP can be represented by the least element solution and a Perron-Frobenius eigenvector. These results are applied to convex reformulation of mathematical programs with P-0 and Z matrix LCC. Preliminary numerical results show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the reformulation.", "paper_title": "Implicit solution function of P-0 and Z matrix linear complementarity constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000290588600001"}
