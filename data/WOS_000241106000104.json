Aimed at an experimental platform of mobile robot with two rocker-bogie suspensions and four drive wheels, the dead-reckoning error of the proprioceptive sensors (odometry, fiber optic gyros) and the ranging performance of the exteroceptive sensor (213 time of fight laser scanner) are analyzed in this paper. Then, the environmental map using occupancy grids is adopted to fuse the information of the robot's pose by dead-reckoning method and the range to obstacles by laser scanner. In this condition, the map matching method, combined fuzzy logic and maximum likelihood estimation, is presented to improve mobile robot self-localization. By experiments of the robot platform, the effectiveness of this method is validated and the self-localization performance of mobile robot is enhanced.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy likelihood estimation based map matching for mobile robot self-localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000104"}
