Given an N-vertex graph G that is regular with the common degree d and has no cycle of three or four vertices, this study shows that G is (2d - 2)/(2d - 2)-diagnosable if N >= 4d - 3 > 0. Based on this result, the t/t-diagnosabilities of several classes of graphs can be computed efficiently.", "paper_title": "t/t-Diagnosability of Regular Graphs under the PMC Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000317427700004"}
