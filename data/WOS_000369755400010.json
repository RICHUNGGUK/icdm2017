The analysis of static interaction data to derive dynamic protein complexes leads to several challenges, of which we identify three. First, many proteins participate in multiple complexes, leading to overlapping complexes embedded within highly-connected regions of the PPI network. This makes it difficult to accurately delimit the boundaries of such complexes. Second, many condition-and location-specific PPIs are not detected, leading to sparsely-connected complexes that cannot be picked out by clustering algorithms. Third, the majority of complexes are small complexes (made up of two or three proteins), which are extra sensitive to the effects of extraneous edges and missing co-complex edges. We show that many existing complex-discovery algorithms have trouble predicting such complexes, and show that our insight into the disparity between the static interactome and dynamic protein complexes can be used to improve the performance of complex discovery.", "paper_title": "From the static interactome to dynamic protein complexes: Three challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000369755400010"}
