The transmit diversity can also be employed by cooperative spectrum sensing to improve the performance of decision reporting. Hence, in the reporting channels between the cognitive users and the base station(BS), space time block code (STBC) scheme is considered in each cluster with time division multiple access (TMDA) method. In this paper, to improve the time efficiency in the case that one cluster makes sensing report, whereas the others do nothing but wait for their orders, we set each cluster with different sensing durations and the clusters will not stop the spectrum sensing until their results are reported. Furthermore, we also adopt the flexible sensing durations to decrease unnecessary energy consumption based on the clusters' sensing sensitivities. Simulation results and analysis show the better detection performance and time efficiency of the proposed scheme.
