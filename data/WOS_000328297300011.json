In continuous maps multi-band chaotic attractors are cyclic, that means every generic trajectory visits the bands in the same order. We demonstrate that in discontinuous maps multi-band chaotic attractors may be acyclic. Additionally, a simple criterion is proposed which allows to distinguish easily between cyclic and acyclic chaotic attractors. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
