At each iteration, the set of all collision-free directions are calculated using velocity vectors of the robot relative to each obstacle, forming the Directive Circle (DC), which is the fundamental concept of our proposed method. Then, the best feasible direction close to the optimal direction to the target is selected from the DC, which prevents the robot from being trapped in local minima. Local movements of the robot are governed by the exponential stabilizing control scheme that provides a smooth motion at each step, while considering the robot's kinematic constraints. The robot is able to catch the target at a desired orientation. Extensive simulations demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed method and its success in coping with complex and highly dynamic environments with arbitrary obstacle shapes.", "paper_title": "Sensor-Based Motion Planning of Wheeled Mobile Robots in Unknown Dynamic Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000336449900019"}
