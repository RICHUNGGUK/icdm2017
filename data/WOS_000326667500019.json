In this paper, the autocorrelation values of binary Whiteman generalized cyclotomic sequences of order six and period pq are discussed. Our result shows that the autocorrelation of these sequences is four-valued and that the corresponding values are in {-1, 3, -5, pq} if the parameters are chosen carefully.", "paper_title": "Autocorrelation Values of Generalized Cyclotomic Sequences of Order Six", "paper_id": "WOS:000326667500019"}
