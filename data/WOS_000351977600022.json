Such recommender systems are being used commercially with popular methods being based on collaborative filtering. While collaborative filtering-based recommenders perform well in terms of accuracy, they lack the ability of finding fresh and novel items, due to the nature of its inner workings. We propose a new graph-based recommender system that uses only positively rated items in users' profiles to construct a highly-connected, undirected graph, with items as nodes and positive correlations as edges. Using the concept of entropy and the linked items in the graph, the proposed system can find recommendations that are both novel and relevant. We test the system on Last.fm data to recommend music to users and show that the proposed recommender system is indeed able to provide novel recommendations while keeping them relevant to the user profile, consistently outperforming a state-of-the-art matrix factorization-based recommender.
