This study develops and tests a variation on the Technology Acceptance Model in order to investigate factors influencing consumers' intention to use e-readers. A survey of 234 consumers revealed that perceived usefulness and subjective norm positively influence intention to use, whereas there was little evidence to support the significance of image, cost, or ease of use. Findings have both theoretical and practical implications. Results provide empirical support for some existing TAM relationships, and a basis from which to examine additional factors in order to further develop knowledge affecting intention to use e-readers. Confirmation of the influence of perceived usefulness and subjective norm has implications for practitioners, particularly in terms of product design and marketing.", "paper_title": "CONSUMERS' INTENTIONS TO USE E-READERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000332186900007"}
