Checkpointing is a viable solution that enables simulations to be resumed from the point of failure. We study three models to determine the optimal checkpoint interval between contiguous checkpoints so that the total execution time is minimized and we demonstrate that optimal checkpointing can facilitate self-optimizing. This study greatly advances our knowledge of and practice in optimizing long-running scientific simulations.", "paper_title": "Optimizing checkpoint for scientific simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000312185500003"}
