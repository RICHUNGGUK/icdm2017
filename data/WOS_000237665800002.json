Among other contributions that this work intends to bring to natural language processing research, the employment of more biologically plausible connectionist architecture and training for automatic summarization is emphasized. The choice relies on the expectation that it may lead to an increase in computational efficiency when compared to the so-called biologically implausible algorithms.", "paper_title": "SABio: An automatic Portuguese text summarizer through artificial neural networks in a more biologically plausible model", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800002"}
