The impeller rotation was modeled using the sliding mesh technique In this study the CFD code was used for simulation of a standard vessel agitated by a 6-blade Rushton turbine and results were evaluated in terms of the predicted flow field, power number, mean velocity components, mixing time, turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate using published experimental data Subsequently, the effects of varying injection position of the passive scalar have been investigated The results show that LES is a reliable tool to investigate the unsteady behavior of the turbulent flow in stirred tank Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
