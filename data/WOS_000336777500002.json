Since then, many diverse automatic summarization approaches have been proposed, but no single technique has solved the increasingly urgent need for automatic summarization. Rather than proposing one more such technique, we suggest that the best solution is likely a system able to combine multiple summarization techniques, as required by the type of documents being summarized. Thus, this paper presents HAUSS: a framework to quickly build specialized summarizers, integrating several base techniques into a single approach. To recognize relevant text fragments, rules are created that combine frequency, centrality, citation and linguistic information in a context-dependent way. An incremental knowledge acquisition framework strongly supports the creation of these rules, using a training corpus to guide rule acquisition, and produce a powerful knowledge base specific to the domain. Using HAUSS, we created a knowledge base for catchphrase extraction in legal text. The system outperforms existing state-of-the-art general-purpose summarizers and machine learning approaches. Legal experts rated the extracted summaries similar to the original catchphrases given by the court. Our investigation of knowledge acquisition methods for summarization therefore demonstrates that it is possible to quickly create effective special-purpose summarizers, which combine multiple techniques, into a single context-aware approach.
