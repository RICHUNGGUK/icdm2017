This method is based on the acquisition of three-way data structures [wavelength (nm) x time (s) x concentration (mg/L)] followed by chemometric analysis by an appropriate PARAFAC2 or MCR-ALS second-order calibration model. The results obtained are compared with those obtained by direct determination, at maximum wavelength, and by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standard chromatographic method. For all the pharmaceutical formulations analysed good quantification results were found with PARAFAC2 and MCR-ALS second-order calibration models. For bulk drug analysis, detection limits of 6 and 2 mg/L, and for pharmaceutical formulations analysis, an average detection limit of 41 and 39 mg/L were found, respectively with PARAFAC2 and MCR-ALS.
