For this purpose, we propose a new general Weighted Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm to deal with the mixed data including different sample distributions and different features, in which the idea of the probability density of samples is used to assign the weights to each sample and the ReliefF algorithms is applied to give the weights to each feature. By weighting the samples and their features, the fuzzy c-means, fuzzy c-modes, fuzzy c-prototype and sample-weighted algorithms can be unified into a general framework. The experimental results with various test data sets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithm.", "paper_title": "A general weighted fuzzy clustering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600010"}
