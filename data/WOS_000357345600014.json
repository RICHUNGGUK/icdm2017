The idea basically consists in combining several current smaller single-chip switches to obtain switches that have a greater number of ports. The performance of these kinds of switches varies depending on their internal configuration because the subnetwork interconnecting all the internal switches could become a bottleneck if an inappropriate internal configuration is established. In this paper, we show how to obtain the optimal internal switch configuration by applying a specific methodology. We highlight the impact of internal switch configuration on the network performance by means of case studies.", "paper_title": "Optimizing the configuration of combined high-radix switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000357345600014"}
