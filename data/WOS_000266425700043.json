In the approach, service configuration is reduced to a Fuzzy Control System (FCS) which aims to achieve critical QoS variations on minimal level with less power cost. Two configuration strategies, service chain re-configuration and QoS parameters adjustment, along with a configuration algorithm, are implemented to handle different types of QoS variations. A self-optimizing algorithm is designed to enhance the adaptation of the FCS. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Control-Based Service Configuration Approach for Ubiquitous Computing Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000266425700043"}
