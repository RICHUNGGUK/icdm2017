In this letter, the outage performance of decode-and-forward (DnF) and amplify-and-forward (AnF) relaying schemes with directional antennas are analyzed and compared. Our derived exact and closed-form expressions using Moschopoulos's gamma series in the presence of multiple CCIs with dissimilar Nakagami fading channels at relays offer more accurate analytic result with practically computational efficiency. Numerical results show that relaying with directional antennas, in the forms of uniformly spaced linear antenna arrays, helps improve the system performance significantly in the presence of CCIs.", "paper_title": "Outage Performance of Relaying with Directional Antennas in the Presence of Co-Channel Interferences at Relays", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200007"}
