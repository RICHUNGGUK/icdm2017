In this study, we propose a new kind of SSM and a fast computation method. The computation method does not require time-consuming pre-processing to find bounding boxes of the human body, instead it processes difference images to obtain action patterns which can be done very quickly. The proposed SSM is experimentally confirmed to have high power/capacity to achieve a better classification performance than four typical kinds of SSMs.", "paper_title": "Self-Similarities in Difference Images: A New Cue for Single-Person Oriented Action Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085800031"}
