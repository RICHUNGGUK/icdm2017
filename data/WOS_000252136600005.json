The discovery of interesting information is an advance on basic text mining in that it aims to identify text that is novel, unexpected or surprising to a user, whilst still being relevant. This article investigates the use of artificial immune systems (AIS) applied to discovery of interesting information. AIS are thought to confer the adaptability and learning required for this task. Artificial immune system for interesting information discovery (AISIID) is described in some detail, then an evaluative study is undertaken involving the subjective evaluation of the results by users. AISIID is found to discover pages rated more interesting by users than a comparative system. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
