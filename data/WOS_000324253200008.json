Meanwhile, decentralized service management protocols such as UPnP are believed to be more suitable for administrating applications in small-scale pervasive environments such as smart homes. However, administering MOM-based pervasive systems by UPnP often suffers from network flood problems due to the replications of too many unnecessary messages. This paper presents several traffic reduction schemes, namely, decomposing the multicast traffic, service-based node searching, heartbeat by decomposing the multicast traffic, and on-demand heartbeat, which reduce the replications of unnecessary messages in MOM-based UPnP networks. The analytical predictions agree well with the simulated and experimental results, which show that the message counts of presence and leave announcements, node searching, and heartbeat can be greatly reduced.", "paper_title": "Message-Efficient Service Management Schemes for MOM-Based UPnP Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000324253200008"}
