We establish an almost-tight upper bound of ( (3+) ), for any > 0, on the complexity of the space of all the lines that avoid all the members of . In particular, we prove that the balls of admit ( (3+) ) free isolated tangents, for any > 0. This generalizes the result of Agarwal et al. (Discrete Comput. Geom. 34:231-250, 2005), who established this bound only for balls, and solves an open problem posed in that paper. Our bound almost meets the recent lower bound of ( (3)) of Glisse and Lazard (Proc. 26th Annu. Symp. Comput. Geom., pp. 48-57, 2010). Our approach is constructive and yields an algorithm that computes the discrete representation of the boundary of in ( (3+) ) time, for any > 0.", "paper_title": "Lines Avoiding Balls in Three Dimensions Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000304119600005"}
