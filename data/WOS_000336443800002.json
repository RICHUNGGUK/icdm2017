In order to achieve high scalability, however, today's systems generally reduce transactional support, disallowing single transactions from spanning multiple partitions. This article describes Calvin, a practical transaction scheduling and data replication layer that uses a deterministic ordering guarantee to significantly reduce the normally prohibitive contention costs associated with distributed transactions. This allows near-linear scalability on a cluster of commodity machines, without eliminating traditional transactional guarantees, introducing a single point of failure, or requiring application developers to reason about data partitioning. By replicating transaction inputs instead of transactional actions, Calvin is able to support multiple consistency levels-including Paxos-based strong consistency across geographically distant replicas-at no cost to transactional throughput. Furthermore, Calvin introduces a set of tools that will allow application developers to gain the full performance benefit of Calvin's server-side transaction scheduling mechanisms without introducing the additional code complexity and inconvenience normally associated with using DBMS stored procedures in place of ad hoc client-side transactions.", "paper_title": "Fast Distributed Transactions and Strongly Consistent Replication for OLTP Database Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000336443800002"}
