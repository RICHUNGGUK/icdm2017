We preprocess the source signals in transmitters prior to transmission. Specifically, the source signals are first filtered by a set of properly designed precoders and then the coded signals are transmitted. On the receiving side, the Z-domain features of the precoders are exploited to separate the coded signals, from which the source signals are recovered. Based on the proposed precoders, a closed-form algorithm is derived to estimate the coded signals and the source signals. Unlike traditional blind source separation approaches, the proposed method does not require the source signals to be uncorrelated, sparse, or nonnegative. Compared with the existing precoder-based approach, the new method uses precoders with much lower order, which reduces the delay in data transmission and is easier to implement in practice.", "paper_title": "Novel Z-Domain Precoding Method for Blind Separation of Spatially Correlated Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000312844800009"}
