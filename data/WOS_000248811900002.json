We start by finding the joint probability density function (PDF) of the decision variables. This involves the derivation of the joint PDF of the L largest random variables (L maxima) of an input population of N > L correlated nonidentically distributed random variables, based on the statistics of the input population. The results obtained are then used in the derivation of the error probabilities of noncoherent FSK (NCFSK) and DPSK receivers.
