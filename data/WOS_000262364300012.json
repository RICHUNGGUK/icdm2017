In this article, we propose CogNet - a cognitive complete knowledge network system - which makes use of a large amount of information that can be gained from the experience of each node to improve the overall network and user performance. CogNet gathers, processes, analyzes, and stores information available through a variety of devices and protocols to build an omnipresent, distributed repository that holds the spatiotemporal, network-experience information. The inexpensiveness and plentifulness of storage resources and increasing processing power in handheld devices help accelerate the development of CogNet-like systems. Our contribution in this article is the proposal of the architecture and of the communication elements, as well as a transport layer application of CogNet as a proof of concept for possible application scenarios of such a system. We also present performance evaluation of CogTCP, the CogNet-enabled TCP, which exploits the transport layer experience of other nodes for improved performance. From our experiments, we found that the use of cognitive information is very useful for networking.", "paper_title": "COGNET: A COGNITIVE COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE NETWORK SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000262364300012"}
