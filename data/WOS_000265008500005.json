The potential energy surfaces for the CNNC dihedral torsion and CNN bond angle concerted-inversion pathway were mapped to explore the relaxation process of azobenzene (AB) photoisomerization. The results indicate that the rotational mechanism favors the photoisomerization of the S(1)(n,pi*) and S(2)(pi,pi*) trans-AB. The concerted-inversion mechanism may operate in the decay process of S(2)(pi,pi*) or higher state trans-AB. By borrowing the (n,pi*; pi,pi*) and (n(2),pi*(2)) electronic states, trans-AB upon excitation to the higher states can quickly relax to the S(1)(n,pi*) or ground state via the rotation or concerted-inversion pathway. The forming ground-state species with higher vibrational energy from the higher excited states will become the stable trans-isomer through the concerted-inversion pathway. These relaxation processes have been confirmed by the conical intersections calculated by the high-level CASSCF method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
