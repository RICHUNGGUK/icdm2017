The challenge here is to model foreground appearance with histograms in a way that is both efficient and accurate. In this algorithm, the constantly changing foreground shape is modeled as a small number of rectangular blocks, whose positions within the tracking window are adaptively determined. Under the general assumption of stationary foreground appearance, we show that robust object tracking is possible by adaptively adjusting the locations of these blocks. Implemented in MATLAB without substantial optimization, our tracker runs already at 3.7 frames per second on a 3 GHz machine. Experimental results have demonstrated that the algorithm is able to efficiently track articulated objects undergoing large variation in appearance and shape.
