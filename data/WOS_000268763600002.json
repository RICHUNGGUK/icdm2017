Every evolutionary processor is given with a finite set of one type of point mutations (an insertion, a deletion or a substitution of a symbol) which can be applied to certain positions of a string over the domain of the set of these rewriting rules. The HNEP functions by rewriting the words that can be found at the nodes and then re-distributing the resulting strings according to a communication protocol based on a filtering mechanism. The filters are defined by certain variants of random-context conditions. HNEPs can be considered as both language generating devices (GHNEPs) and language accepting devices (AHNEPs). In this paper, by improving the previous results, we prove that any recursively enumerable language can be determined by a GHNEP and an AHNEP with 7 nodes. We also show that the families of GHNEPs and AHNEPs with 2 nodes are not computationally complete. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
