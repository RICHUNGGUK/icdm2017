Popular wireless LAN standards, such as IEEE 802.11, provision for multiple channels. In this article, we consider the use of multiple wireless channels to improve network throughput. Commercially available wireless network interfaces can typically operate over only one channel at a time. Due to cost and complexity constraints, the total number of interfaces at each host is expected to be smaller than the total channels available in the network. Under this scenario, several challenges need to be addressed before all the available channels can be fully utilized. In this article, we highlight the main challenges, and present two link-layer protocols for utilizing multiple channels. We also present a new abstraction layer that simplifies the implementation of new multichannel protocols in existing operating systems. This article demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing multiple channels, even if each host has fewer interfaces than the number of available channels.", "paper_title": "Multichannel Mesh networks: Challenges and protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000237197100005"}
