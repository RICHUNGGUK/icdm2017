The basic idea is the same with that in 2D VOSET, but new methods are proposed to deal with new geometric problems in three dimensions. An iterative root-finding method is used for implementing Piecewise Linear Interface Construction (PLIC) in three dimensions. An iterative geometric method is presented to calculate the level-set function. The feasibility and accuracy of this method are analyzed by some classical test problems. Combining the use of projection method that solves the flow field, the 3D VOSET is adopted to simulate a liquid dam break problem and a single-bubble rising problem. Our numerical results are found to be in good accordance with those in previous studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
