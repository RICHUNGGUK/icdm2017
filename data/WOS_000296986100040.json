In this paper, a novel shaft orbit identification method based on chain code and probability neural network (PNN) is proposed. For this approach, firstly, a modified chain code histogram and shape numbers are used to represent the feature of the shaft orbit contour. It has properties of less data, easy to calculate, and invariance to rotation, scaling and translation. Then, the feature vectors are input to PNN to identify various kinds of shaft orbit for hydraulic generator unit. In comparison with previous methods, the experimental results show the proposed method is effective and training the network is faster, and identifying the shaft orbit achieves satisfactory accuracy.
