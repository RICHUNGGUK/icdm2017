Since the optimal load-balancing routing problem can be formulated as a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) by ignoring microscopic details, a simpler routing algorithm may be derived based on using WSNs themselves to solve the PDEs numerically. One example is the distributed Gauss-Seidel iteration (DGSI) algorithm which coordinates sensors to solve the PDEs by the Gauss-Seidel iteration in lexicographical order of unknowns. Although the parallelism of DGSI may be improved by using the red-black order, simply replacing the lexicographical order with the red-black order in DGSI may not work well since it cannot collect enough information to better determine the termination of the iteration. We propose the red-black distributed Gauss-Seidel routing (RB-DGSR) algorithm to address this problem. Furthermore, we present the five-color distributed De la Garza routing (FC-DDGR) algorithm for instances in which RB-DGSR may not converge, and theoretically prove that FC-DDGR achieves the optimum degree of parallelism. Our simulation results reveal that RB-DGSR and FC-DDGR significantly improve the parallelism and thus reduce the time to solve the PDEs without too much sacrifice of transmission overhead (in broadcast communication) and accuracy.", "paper_title": "A Study on Maximizing the Parallelism of Macroscopically Derived Routing Algorithms for WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000366469000007"}
