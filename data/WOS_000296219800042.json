This situation might arise if one works with a restricted set of historical data or because secrecy restricts access to the queueing facility. One might still be able to observe, from outside the system, the exact arrival and departure times of each customer. Using observations of arrival and departure times and knowledge of whether the service discipline is either first-come-first-served or last-come-first-served, one can exactly reconstruct the unobserved queue delays and service times of any sequence of arrivals during busy periods when the number of customers is greater than the number of servers. If the number of servers is also unknown, it too can be estimated. In this paper, we propose optimization models which determine the unknown number of servers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
