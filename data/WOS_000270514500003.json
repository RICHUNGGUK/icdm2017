Through three-stage validation, we are able to confirm all three levels of the proposed hierarchical structure where a customer's perceived m-service quality includes primary dimensions of interaction, outcome, and environment qualities. Each primary dimension further has its sub-dimensions. Our empirical results also show that corporate image moderates the effects of environment and outcome qualities on the service quality. Our proposed model provides implications for future research on mobile commerce. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
