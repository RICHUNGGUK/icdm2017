The aggregated information provides more robust and accurate biomarker detection. So far, published meta-analysis methods for this purpose mostly consider two-class comparison. Methods for combining multi-class studies and considering expression pattern concordance are rarely explored. Results: In this article, we develop three integration methods for biomarker detection in multiple multi-class microarray studies: ANOVA-maxP, min-MCC and OW-min-MCC. We first consider a natural extension of combining P-values from the traditional ANOVA model. Since P-values from ANOVA do not guarantee to reflect the concordant expression pattern information across studies, we propose a multi-class correlation (MCC) measure to specifically seek for biomarkers of concordant inter-class patterns across a pair of studies. For both ANOVA and MCC approaches, we use extreme order statistics to identify biomarkers differentially expressed (DE) in all studies (i.e. ANOVA-maxP and min-MCC). The min-MCC method is further extended to identify biomarkers DE in partial studies by incorporating a recently developed optimally weighted (OW) technique (OW-min-MCC). All methods are evaluated by simulation studies and by three meta-analysis applications to multi-tissue mouse metabolism datasets, multi-condition mouse trauma datasets and multi-malignant-condition human prostate cancer datasets. The results show complementary strength of the three methods for different biological purposes.", "paper_title": "Biomarker detection in the integration of multiple multi-class genomic studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000274342800006"}
