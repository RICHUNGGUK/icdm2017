The increasing complexity of information systems, and the high risks associated with violations of business rules, have created the need for Online Auditing Tools. In this paper we sketch a conceptual design for such a tool. The components of the tool are described briefly. The focus is on the database and the conformance checker, which are described in detail. The approach is illustrated with an example and some preliminary case studies from industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
