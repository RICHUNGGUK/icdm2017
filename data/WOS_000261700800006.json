The model T(n)(rho) was introduced in a companion article [Hansen and Jaworski, Random Struct Algorithms 33 (2008), 105-126] and the asymptotic structure of the associated directed graph G(n)(rho) which represents the action of T(n)(rho) on the set {1, 2, ..., n} was investigated in [Hansen and Jaworski, Random Struct Algorithms 33 (2008), 105-126] and [Hansen and Jaworski, Adv Appl Probab 40 (2008), 183-205] in the case when the attraction parameter rho > 0 is fixed as n -> infinity. In this article we consider the asymptotic structure of GP when the attraction parameter rho equivalent to rho(n) is a function of n as n -> infinity. We show that there are three distinct regimes during the evolution of GP: (i) rho n -> infinity as n -> infinity, (ii) rho n -> beta > 0 as n -> infinity, and (iii) rho n -> infinity as n -> infinity. It turns out that the asymptotic structure of GP is, in some cases, quite different from the asymptotic structure of well-known models such as the uniform random mapping model and models with an attracting center. In particular, in regime (ii) we obtain some interesting new limiting distributions which are related to the incomplete gamma function. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
