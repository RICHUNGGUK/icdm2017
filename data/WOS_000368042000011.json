In this way, many ratings, opinions, judgements, etc. mostly coming from human valuations can be appropriately described in terms of fuzzy data. To summarize the central tendency of a fuzzy dataset, some measures have been suggested in the literature. This paper aims to review some of the main ones, and examine their properties in a comparative way. A real-life example illustrates their application. Furthermore, the paper shows the statistical robustness (both through the finite sample breakdown point and a simulation study) and the empirical \"precision\" of the fuzzy number-valued sample measures. Finally, some related developments and future directions are pointed out.", "paper_title": "An Overview on the Statistical Central Tendency for Fuzzy Data Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000368042000011"}
