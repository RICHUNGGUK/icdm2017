An experimental SAHP desalination system has been constructed at the National University of Singapore, Singapore. The system consisted of two main sections: an SAHP and a water distillation section. Experiments were carried out under the different meteorological condition of Singapore and results showed that the system had a performance ratio close to 1.3. The heat pump has a coefficient of performance of about 8, with solar collector efficiencies of 80% and 60% for evaporator and liquid collectors, respectively. Economic analysis showed that at a production rate of 900 L/day and an evaporator collector area of around 70 m(2) will have a payback period of about 3.5 years.", "paper_title": "Desalination With a Solar-Assisted Heat Pump: An Economic Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000325403000022"}
