Later, we will show that there exists a close relationship between the fuzzy continuity behavior of a fuzzy almost quartic function, control function and the unique quartic mapping which approximates the almost quartic map. Finally, some applications of our results in the stability of quartic mappings from a linear space into a quasi p-norm space will be exhibited. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
