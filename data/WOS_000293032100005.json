While most of recent Full Adders are proposed with the purpose of using fewer transistors, they suffer from some disadvantages such as output or internal non-full-swing nodes and poor driving capability. Considering these drawbacks, they might not be a good choice to operate in a practical environment. Lowering the number of transistors can inherently lead to smaller occupied area, higher speed and lower power consumption. However, other parameters, such as robustness to PVT variations and rail-to-rail operation, should also be considered. While the robustness is taken into account, HSPICE simulation demonstrates a great improvement in terms of speed and power-delay product (PDP).", "paper_title": "A NEW ROBUST AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE HYBRID FULL ADDER CELL", "paper_id": "WOS:000293032100005"}
