The design incorporates a low voltage level shift current mirror using forward body-biased MOSFETs limited to a maximum of 0.4 V to minimize latchup and hot carrier effects. Some of the measured performances are as follows: 58 dB open-loop gain, 30 kHz bandwidth, 50 degrees phase margin and 80 mu W power dissipation and are in close agreement with the corresponding design and SPICE simulated values.", "paper_title": "A 0.8 VCMOS amplifier design", "paper_id": "WOS:000236963400007"}
