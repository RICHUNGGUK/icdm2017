In such a process, the input must be well designed, and the model transformations should be trustworthy. Because of the specificities of models and transformations, classical software test techniques have to be adapted. Among these techniques, mutation analysis has been ported, and a set of mutation operators has been defined. However, it currently requires considerable manual work and suffers from the test data set improvement activity. This activity is a difficult and time-consuming job and reduces the benefits of the mutation analysis. This paper addresses the test data set improvement activity. Model transformation traceability in conjunction with a model of mutation operators and a dedicated algorithm allow to automatically or semi-automatically produce improved test models. The approach is validated and illustrated in two case studies written in Kermeta.
