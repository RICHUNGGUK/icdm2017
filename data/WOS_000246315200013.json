More precisely, the task of persistent motion detection has been widely expressed by means of the AC method, whereas the ALI method has been used with the objective of moving objects detection, labelling and further tracking. This paper exploits the current knowledge of our research team on the mentioned problem-solving methods to model the Stereovision-Correspondence-Analysis (SCA) task. For this purpose, ALI and AC methods are combined into the Lateral Inhibition in Accumulative Computation (LIAC) method. The four basic subtasks, namely \"LIAC 2D Charge-Memory Calculation\", \"LIAC 2D Charge-Disparity Analysis\" and \"LIAC 3D Charge-Memory Calculation\" in our proposal of SCA are described in detail by inferential CommonKADS schemes. It is shown that the LIAC method may perfectly be used to solve a complex task based on motion information inherent to binocular video sequences. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
