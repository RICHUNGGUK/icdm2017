In particular, the program focuses on two-body nuclear interactions given in a JT-coupled harmonic oscillator basis and calculates correlation coefficients, a measure of similarity of any two interactions, as well as Hilbert-Schmidt norms specifying interaction strengths. An important feature of the program is its ability to identify the monopole part (centroid) of a 2-body interaction, as well as its 'density-dependent' one-body and two-body part, thereby providing key information on the evolution of shell gaps and binding energies for larger nuclear systems. As additional features, we provide statistical measures for 'density-dependent' interactions, as well as a mechanism to express an interaction in terms of two other interactions. This, in turn, allows one to identify, e.g., established features of the nuclear interaction (such as pairing correlations) within a general Hamiltonian. The program handles the radial degeneracy for 'density-dependent' one-body interactions and together with an efficient linked list data structure, facilitates studies of nuclear interactions in large model spaces that go beyond valence-shell applications.

Ireland Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 10 888 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 88 778 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C. Computer: Laptop, Workstation. Operating system: Linux [tested on Linux (Kernel 2.6.9) with a gcc, version 3.4.6]. RAM: Less than 10 MB Classication: 17.15. Nature of problem: The program calculates second-order energy moments, such as variances and correlation coefficients, widely used as measures of the overall strength of an interaction and its similarity to other interactions. It allows for studies of the physical properties of various interactions and their effect on many-particle systems. Solution method: Calculations are based on spectral distribution theory and invoke statistical measures provided by the theory. Running time: Less than 20 min (typically, several seconds) using a 1.80 GHz processor. References: [1] J.B. French and K.F. Ratcli, Phys. Rev. C3, 94(1971); [2] F.S. Chang, J.B. French, and T.H.
