We find that decentralization of the supply chain increases its leadtime while decreases the rival's leadtime; and the decentralization increases the retail prices. The existence of the outside competitor raises the leadtime. A higher reservation price or brand differentiation increases the retail prices but decreases the leadtimes; a higher transportation cost or lower leadtime sensitivity increases the retail prices and the leadtimes. The coordination of the supply chain facing integrated rival harms the integrated rival. We design contracts to coordinate the supply chain under leadtime-decision-first scenario and wholesale-price-decision-first scenario, respectively. Further, we find that the sequence of decisions affects the validity of the all-unit quantity discount scheme in coordinating the supply chain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
