Using a mixed methods study methodology, five online graduate-level courses were investigated and the experiences from twenty-two participants were described to identify key advantages and disadvantages of subgroup structures used to evaluate graduate students' and instructors' experiences. Outcomes revealed that online small group discussions have more advantages over face-to-face ones. Online small group discussions can be an effective strategy to interweave whole-class discussions with small group discussions in order to reduce overall information loads in large classes while providing more opportunities for interaction. However, online small group discussions have some disadvantages over face-to-face discussions. The findings may have implications for both practitioners and researchers studying online small group discourse. They could serve as a base for researchers to further explore the issue to achieve fruitful online discourse. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
