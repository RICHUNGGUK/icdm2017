In this paper, a practical QoS packet scheduler is introduced to efficiently accommodate various services in IEEE 802.16e systems. The key concepts of the scheduler are to determine scheduling intervals, to calculate the amount of assigned resources, and to decide which mobile station the base station should serve first among multiple mobile stations. The performance of the scheduler is evaluated using an NS-2 network simulator. Numerical results show that this new scheduler can increase the system capacity by 120% more than in the UGS scheme and 25% more than in the ertPS scheme, respectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
