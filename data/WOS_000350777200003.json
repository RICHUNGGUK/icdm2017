Regularization of the model surface is typically necessary due to the presence of noisy and incomplete boundaries. When simple regularizers are insufficient, linear basis shape models have been shown to be effective. However, for problems such as right ventricle (RV) segmentation from 3D+t echocardiography, where dense consistent landmarks and complete boundaries are absent, acquiring accurate training surfaces in dense correspondence is difficult. As a solution, this paper presents a framework which performs joint segmentation of multiple 3D+t sequences while simultaneously optimizing an underlying linear basis shape model. In particular, the RV is represented as an explicit continuous surface, and segmentation of all frames is formulated as a single continuous energy minimization problem. Shape information is automatically shared between frames, missing boundaries are implicitly handled, and only coarse surface initializations are necessary. The framework is demonstrated to successfully segment both multiple-view and multiple-subject collections of 3D+t echocardiography sequences, and the results confirm that the linear basis shape model is an effective model constraint. Furthermore, the framework is shown to achieve smaller segmentation errors than a state-of-art commercial semi-automatic RV segmentation package. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
