However, the computational interpretation of sequent calculus presentations of linear logic remains problematic, mostly because of the many rule permutations allowed in the sequent calculus. We address this problem by providing a simple interpretation of focused proofs, a complete subclass of linear sequent proofs known to have a much stronger structure than the standard sequent calculus for linear logic. Despite the classical setting, the interpretation relates proofs to a refined linear lambda-calculus, and we investigate its properties and relation to other calculi, such as the usual lambda-calculus, the lambda(mu)-calculus, and their variants based on sequent calculi.", "paper_title": "Focused Linear Logic and the lambda-calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000372714600008"}
