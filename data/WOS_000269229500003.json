Based on the sparse field level set method and the hierarchical run-length encoding level set data structure optimal figures for the computation time and for the memory consumption are achieved. Furthermore, we introduce a new multi-level-set technique, which is able to incorporate multiple material regions, and which can also handle material specific surface speeds accurately. We also describe an optimal algorithm for the visibility check for unidirectional etching. The presented techniques are demonstrated on various examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
