Here, a general method of analysing the reliability of systems using fuzzy stochastic Petri nets (FSPNs) based on the fuzzy parameters of FSPNs is proposed. First, the authors' present the degree of importance and node-to-node system dependence definitions and access rules and classify the state space using the weighted state norm. Second, using the firing rule of the FSPNs and the concept of hierarchical sub-nodes, the authors' propose an algorithm for the analysis of adaptive FSPNs and their reliability. An adaptive simulation system based on FSPNs is also proposed. Estimates are applied to the adaptive simulation system, rendering the multi-state system more reliable and enabling the use of a structured cooperative communication network of users to request services. The results of the case study demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy stochastic Petri nets and analysis of the reliability of multi-state systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000355918800003"}
