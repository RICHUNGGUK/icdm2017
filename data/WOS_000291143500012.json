The main contribution of this paper is to detail an integrated field campaign that demonstrates the viability of the key rover GN&C techniques needed to carry out this mission. Tests were conducted on Devon Island in the Canadian High Arctic during the summer of 2009, wherein a large field robot was driven on real polygonal terrain (a landform of interest on Mars). Lessons learned and recommendations for future work are provided. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
