The object of study is associated with certain intersection ideals. In the paper, we provide explicit algorithms to calculate these intersection ideals. We next deal with when a given subspace is \"free\" with respect to the solution set of a system of PDEs-this notion of freeness is related to restrictions and intersection ideals. We again provide algorithms and checkable algebraic criterion to answer the question of freeness of a subspace. Finally, we provide an upper bound to the dimension of free subspaces that can be associated with the solution set of a system of PDEs.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for the theory of restrictions of scalar -D systems to proper subspaces of R-n", "paper_id": "WOS:000350570900006"}
