However, those BCI systems cannot implement the wheelchair navigation flexibly and effectively. In this paper, we propose a hybrid BCI scheme based on two-class MI and four-class SSVEP tasks. It cannot only provide multi- degree control for its user, but also allow the user implement the different types of commands in parallel. In order for the subject to learn the hybrid mental strategies effectively, we design a visual and auditory cues and feedback-based training paradigm. Furthermore, an algorithm based on entropy of classification probabilities is proposed to detect intentional control (IC) state for hybrid tasks, and ensure that multi-degree control commands are accurately and quickly generated. The experiment results attest to the efficiency and flexibility of the hybrid BCI for wheelchair control in the real- world.", "paper_title": "EVALUATION AND APPLICATION OF A HYBRID BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR REAL WHEELCHAIR PARALLEL CONTROL WITH MULTI-DEGREE OF FREEDOM", "paper_id": "WOS:000334281800004"}
