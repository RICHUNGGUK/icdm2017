The popular hardware blanking technique tends to reduce this artifact, but generates a blanking artifact as a consequence of the transient state in the amplifier. In this paper we propose two techniques to deal with the blanking artifact. The proposed techniques are combined with conventional and generalized alternating stimulation in order to reduce both stimulus and blanking artifacts in the recording of the evoked potentials. A comparison over 126 evoked potential recordings reveals that the proposed blanking artifact reduction methods improve the quality of electrically evoked compound action potential recordings.
