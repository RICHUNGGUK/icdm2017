The technique we use is a combination of Trevisan's approach of constructing an extractor from a black-box pseudo-random generator, together with locally list-decodable codes and previous work done on quantum random access codes.", "paper_title": "SHORT SEED EXTRACTORS AGAINST QUANTUM STORAGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000292108900004"}
