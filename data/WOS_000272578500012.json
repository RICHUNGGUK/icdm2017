This paper proposes a model for integrated logistics network design to avoid the sub-optimality caused by a separate, sequential design of forward and reverse logistics networks. First, a bi-objective mixed integer programming formulation is developed to minimize the total costs and maximize the responsiveness of a logistics network. To find the set of non-dominated solutions, an efficient multi-objective memetic algorithm is developed. The proposed solution algorithm uses a new dynamic search strategy by employing three different local searches. To assess the quality of the novel solution approach, the quality of its Pareto-optimal solutions is compared to those generated by an existing powerful multi-objective genetic algorithm from the recent literature and to exact solutions obtained by a commercial solver.
