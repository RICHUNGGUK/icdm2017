In formal approaches, the messages exchanged over the network are modelled by a term algebra equipped with an equational theory axiomatising the properties of the cryptographic primitives ( e. g. encryption, signature). In this context, two classical notions of knowledge, deducibility and indistinguishability, yield corresponding decision problems. We propose a procedure for both problems under arbitrary convergent equational theories. Since the underlying problems are undecidable we cannot guarantee termination. Nevertheless, our procedure terminates on a wide range of equational theories. In particular, we obtain a new decidability result for a theory we encountered when studying electronic voting protocols. We also provide a prototype implementation.", "paper_title": "Computing Knowledge in Security Protocols Under Convergent Equational Theories", "paper_id": "WOS:000300495000005"}
