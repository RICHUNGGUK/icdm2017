Earlier results have either focused on the study of the properties that minimum (not minimal) dominating sets preserved or lacked to investigate which update affects a minimal dominating set and in what ways. In this paper, we first show how to incrementally compute a minimal dominating set on arc insertions. We then reduce the case of computing a minimal dominating set on arc deletions to the case of insertions. Some properties on minimal dominating sets are provided to support the incremental strategy. Lastly, we give a new bound on the size of minimum dominating sets based on those results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
