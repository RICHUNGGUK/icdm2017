Currently there exist two families of methodologies that ensemble candidate SPODEs for classification. One is to select only helpful SPODEs and uniformly average their probability estimates, a type of model selection. Another is to assign a weight to each SPODE and linearly combine their probability estimates, a methodology named model weighing. This paper presents a theoretical and empirical study comparing model selection and model weighing for ensembling SPODEs. The focus is on maximizing the ensemble's classification accuracy while minimizing its computational time. A number of representative selection and weighing schemes are studied, providing a comprehensive research on this topic and identifying effective schemes that provide alternative trades-off between speed and expected error.", "paper_title": "To select or to weigh: A comparative study of model selection and model weighing for SPODE ensembles", "paper_id": "WOS:000242308000045"}
