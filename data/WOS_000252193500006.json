In this paper, we propose and implement a novel Heterogeneous network Integration Support Node design (HISN) and a distributed HISN network architecture for the integration of heterogeneous networks, under which the Session Mobility, Personal Mobility, and Terminal Mobility for mobile users can be maintained through the Session Management mechanism. Thus, the HISN node can serve as an agent for the user to access Internet services independent of underlying communication infrastructure. Our design is transparent to the bearer networks and the deployment of the HISN network does not need to involve the operators of the heterogeneous wireless networks.", "paper_title": "HISNs: Distributed gateways for application-level integration of heterogeneous wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000252193500006"}
