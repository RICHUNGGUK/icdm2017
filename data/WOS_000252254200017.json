SPCBFs have several desirable properties: rotatability, ability to represent all-frequency signals, and support for efficient multiple product. By smartly partitioning the illumination sphere into a set of subregions and associating each subregion with an SPCBF valued 1 inside the region and 0 elsewhere, we precompute the light coefficients using the resulting SPCBFs. Efficient rotation of the light representation in SPCBFs is achieved by rotating the domain of SPCBFs. During runtime rendering, we approximate the BRDF and visibility coefficients using the set of SPCBFs for light, possibly rotated, through fast lookup of summed-area table ( SAT) and visibility distance table ( VDT), respectively. SPCBFs enable new effects such as object rotation in all-frequency rendering of dynamic scenes and on-the-fly BRDF editing under rotating environment lighting. With graphics hardware acceleration, our method achieves real-time frame rates.", "paper_title": "Spherical piecewise constant basis functions for all-frequency precomputed radiance transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000252254200017"}
