However, CBIR comes with a fundamental flaw: the semantic gap between high-level semantic concepts and low-level visual features. Consequently, relevance feedback is introduced into CBIR to learn the subjective needs of users. However, in practical applications the limited number of user feedbacks is usually overwhelmed by the large number of dimensionalities of the visual feature space. To address this issue, a novel semi-supervised learning method for dimensionality reduction, namely kernel maximum margin projection (KMMP) is proposed in this paper based on our previous work of maximum margin projection (MMP). Unlike traditional dimensionality reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which only see the global Euclidean structure, KMMP is designed for discovering the local manifold structure. After projecting the images into a lower dimensional subspace, KMMP significantly improves the performance of image retrieval. The experimental results on Corel image database demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed nonlinear algorithm. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
