The satisfiability problem for quantified Boolean formulas with maximal deficiency 1 is shown to be solvable in polynomial time. For k >= 1, it is shown that true formulas with fixed maximal deficiency k have models in which all Boolean functions can be represented as CNF formulas over at most 2(4k/3) universal variables. As a consequence, the satisfiability problem for QCNF formulas with fixed maximal deficiency is in NP and for fixed deficiency the minimal falsity problem is in D-P. For two subclasses of quantified Boolean formulas with PSPACE-complete evaluation problem, QEHORN and QE2-CNF, we show that for fixed deficiency the minimal falsity problem can be decided in polynomial time.
