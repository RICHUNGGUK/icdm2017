The parameters introduced in the power type equation are related to the type and size of commercial pipes. Thus, several dimensionless physical numbers, obtained by suitably combining the variables relevant for the solution of Type B and Type C problems, are also introduced. For solution of the general case of a Type B problem (sloping pipe with pumping power), a user-friendly MathCAD procedure, which produces a consistent framework for analyzing and solving common piping-system applications problem, is also developed. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed procedure, several design examples are analyzed for three types of commercial pipes and a wide range of uniform pipe slope, and the results are shown as design curves. These curves have practical importance, because they permit to quickly determine the values of required variables for a given pipe slope. The results of the proposed method are compared with those obtained from the methods existing in the professional practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
