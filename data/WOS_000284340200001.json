In this paper we consider the problem of embedding multi-dimensional meshes into twisted cubes in a systematic way. We present a recursive method for embedding a family of disjoint multi-dimensional meshes into a twisted cube with dilation 1 and expansion 1. We also prove that a single multi-dimensional mesh can be embedded into a twisted cube with dilation 2 and expansion 1. Our work extends some previously known results.", "paper_title": "Embedding multi-dimensional meshes into twisted cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000284340200001"}
