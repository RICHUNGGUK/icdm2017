Moreover, let ex(n,F) be the usual extremal or Turan function, i.e., the maximum number of hyperedges of an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph which contains no copy of F. For complete graphs F = K(l) and r = 2, Erdos and Rothschild conjectured that c(2,Kl)(n) = 2(ex(n,K1)). This conjecture was proved by Yuster for l = 3 and by Alon, Balogh, Keevash and Sudakov for arbitrary l. In this paper, we consider the question for hypergraphs and show that, in the special case when F is the Fano plane and r = 2 or 3, then c(r,F)(n) = r(ex(n,F)), while c(r,F)(n) >> r(ex(n,F)) for r >= 4.", "paper_title": "On Colourings of Hypergraphs Without Monochromatic Fano Planes", "paper_id": "WOS:000269984900013"}
