Most of the theory associated with NSCA does not distinguish between a two-way contingency table of ordinal variables and a two-way one of nominal variables. Typically, singular value decomposition (SVD) is used in classical NSCA for dimension reduction. A bivariate moment decomposition (BMD) for ordinal variables in contingency tables using orthogonal OF polynomials and generalized correlations is proposed. This method not only takes into account the ordinal nature of the two categorical variables, but also permits for the detection of significant association in terms of location, dispersion and higher order components.
