This paper presents D-Dupe, an interactive visualization tool designed to help users to discover and resolve duplicate nodes in a social network. Users can resolve the ambiguity by merging nodes, or by specifying that the nodes are in fact distinct. The entity resolution process is iterative; as pairs of nodes are merged, additional duplicates may become apparent.", "paper_title": "D-Dupe: An interactive tool for entity resolution in social networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300046"}
