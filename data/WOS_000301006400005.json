For example alpha = aleph(0) (the countable cardinal, i.e. the cardinal of N the set of integers), or alpha = C (the cardinal of the set R of real numbers). Is it possible to do secret-key cryptography? Public-key cryptography? Encryption? Authentication? Signatures? Is it possible to generalize the notion of one way function? The aim of this paper is to give some elements of answers to these questions. We will see for example that for secret-key cryptography there are some simple solutions. However for public-key cryptography the results are much less clear.", "paper_title": "Transfinite Cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000301006400005"}
