The asymmetric Laplace distribution provides a mechanism for Bayesian inferences of quantile regression models based on the check loss. The advantage of this new method is that nonlinear, linear and zero function components can be separated automatically and simultaneously during model fitting without the need of pre-specification or parameter tuning. This is achieved by spike-and-slab priors using two sets of indicator variables. For posterior inferences, we design an effective partially collapsed Gibbs sampler. Simulation studies are used to illustrate our algorithm. The proposed approach is further illustrated by applications to two real data sets.", "paper_title": "Bayesian quantile regression for partially linear additive models", "paper_id": "WOS:000352705000011"}
