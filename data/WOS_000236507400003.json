We prove that (i) every intuitionistic phase space is a subspace of a classical phase space, and (ii) every intuitionistic phase space is phase isomorphic to an 'almost classical' phase space. Here, by an 'almost classical' phase space we mean ail intuitionistic phase space having a double-negation-like closure operator. Based oil these semantic considerations, we give a syntactic embedding of propositional ILL into LL.", "paper_title": "Intuitionistic phase semantics is almost classical", "paper_id": "WOS:000236507400003"}
