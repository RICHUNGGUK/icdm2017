Since this entropy is not applicable to a system which has survived for some units of time, the concept of residual entropy has been developed in the literature. Here we generalize the residual entropy by choosing a convex function phi with phi(1) = 0. In this paper, some orderings and aging properties have been defined in terms of the generalized residual entropy function and their properties have been studied. Quite a few results available in the literature have been generalized and some distributions (viz. uniform, exponential, Pareto, power series, finite range) have been characterized through the generalized residual entropy.
