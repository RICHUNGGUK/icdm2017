The sliding mode state observer is given with radial basis function neural networks, and then the robust control scheme is presented based on the designed sliding mode observer. The developed observer-based control scheme consists of two parts. One term is a linear controller and the other term is a neural network controller. Using the Lyapunov method, a criterion for bounded stability of the closed-loop system is developed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a simulation example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust control scheme.", "paper_title": "Robust control for a class of time-delay uncertain nonlinear systems based on sliding mode observer", "paper_id": "WOS:000281908300001"}
