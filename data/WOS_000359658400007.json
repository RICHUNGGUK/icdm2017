This logic, called 'TY03' takes objects of different syntactic categories and model-theoretic domains to be structured by the same logical type. Its language, a variant of the simply typed lambda calculus, is interpreted in partial Henkin models. We give a Gentzen-style sequent calculus for TY03 and prove its soundness and completeness with respect to the class of models. To show the logic's application adequacy, we provide a TY03 semantics for a standard fragment of English. Partial possible worlds, which are identified with elements in the logic's base domain, enable us to obtain the standard modal operators.", "paper_title": "A single-type logic for natural language", "paper_id": "WOS:000359658400007"}
