In addition, these designs imply also the existence of the other design families constructed from the Z(4)-Goethals codes G(1) by Ranto. In the existence proofs we count the number of solutions to certain systems of equations over finite fields and use Dickson polynomials and variants of cyclotomic polynomials and identities connecting them.", "paper_title": "3-Designs from Z(4)-Goethals-like codes and variants of cyclotomic polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000239426500006"}
