To suppress the deterioration caused by noise during the image deblurring process, we propose a new deblurring method with a known kernel. First, the noise in the measurement process is assumed to meet the Gaussian distribution to fit the natural noise distribution. Second, the first and second orders of derivatives are supposed to satisfy the independent Gaussian distribution to control the non-uniform noise. Experimental results show that our method is obviously superior to the Wiener filter, regularized filter, and Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm. Moreover, owing to processing in the frequency domain, it runs faster than the other algorithms, in particular about six times faster than the RL algorithm.", "paper_title": "Real-time motion deblurring algorithm with robust noise suppression", "paper_id": "WOS:000277763000006"}
