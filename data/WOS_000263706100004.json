But that promise can only be realized if the MICT applications are used by the medical staff. This paper reports on a study examining nurses' decisions to utilize MICTs. A mixed-methods approach is used, consisting of both qualitative and quantitative elements, that reveals and empirically tests the significance of novel constellations of fit (i.e., identification, information, patient interaction, physical, time criticality, user comfort, and workflow fit) and individual characteristics. presented as basic human drives (i.e., drive to acquire, bond, defend, and learn). Findings indicate that fit is a multi-faceted construct and that archetypical human drives have an influence on these various notions, which in turn, impact technology adoption in the healthcare context.
