In many situations, performance-limiting loss is due to scattering and radiation of waves into the surrounding structure. In this paper, we study the problem of systematically improving a structure by altering its design so as to decrease the loss. We use sensitivity analysis and local gradient optimization, applied to the scattering resonance problem, to reduce the loss within the class of piecewise constant structures. For a class of optimization problems where the material parameters are constrained by upper and lower bounds, it is observed that an optimal structure is piecewise constant with values achieving the bounds.", "paper_title": "Optimization of scattering resonances", "paper_id": "WOS:000258678100001"}
