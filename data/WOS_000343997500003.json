The so-called cloud model IWO (CMIWO) is adopted to direct the search of KM algorithm to ensure that the population has a definite evolution direction in the iterative process, thus improving the performance of CMIWO K-means (CMIWOKM) algorithm in terms of convergence speed, computing precision and algorithm robustness. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has such advantages as higher accuracy, faster constringency, and stronger stability.", "paper_title": "A HYBRID CLUSTERING ALGORITHM COMBINING CLOUD MODEL IWO AND K-MEANS", "paper_id": "WOS:000343997500003"}
