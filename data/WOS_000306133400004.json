Following the MVC design pattern, the programmer is able to develop applications using only three types of concepts: operations, data-typesand views. The framework provides the rest of the functionality present in typical scientific applications, including user parameter requests, logging facilities, multithreading execution, experiment repeatability and graphic user interface generation, among others. The proposed framework is implemented following a plugin-based architecture, which also allows assembling new applications by the reuse of modules from past development projects.
