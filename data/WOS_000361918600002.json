However, in real-world applications, data objects with both numeric and categorical features are ubiquitous. The coexistence of both categorical and numerical attributes make the initialization methods designed for single-type data inapplicable to mixed-type data. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, in the existing partitional clustering algorithms designed for mixed-type data, the initial cluster centers are determined randomly. In this paper, we propose a novel initialization method for mixed data clustering. In the proposed method, both the distance and density are exploited together to determine initial cluster centers. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by a series of experiments on three real-world datasets in comparison with that of traditional initialization methods.", "paper_title": "An Initialization Method for Clustering Mixed Numeric and Categorical Data Based on the Density and Distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000361918600002"}
