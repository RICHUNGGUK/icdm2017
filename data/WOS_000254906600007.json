Designing an efficient upstream bandwidth allocation scheme with differentiated services (DiffServ) support is a crucial issue for the successful deployment of EPON, carrying heterogeneous traffic with diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this article, we propose a new hybrid cycle scheme (HCS) for bandwidth allocation with DiffServ support. In this scheme, the high-priority traffic is transmitted in fixed timeslots at fixed positions in a cycle while the medium- and low-priority traffic are transmitted in variable timeslots in an adaptive dynamic cycle. A suitable local buffer management scheme is also proposed to facilitate QoS implementation. We develop a novel feature providing potentially multiple transmission opportunities (M-opportunities) per-cycle for high-priority traffic. This feature is significant in improving delay and delay-variation performance. The HCS provides guaranteed services in a short-cycle scale for delay and jitter sensitive traffic while offering guaranteed throughput in a moderately long-time scale for bandwidth sensitive traffic and at the same time maximizing throughput for non-QoS demanding best-effort traffic. We develop analytical performance analysis on the deterministic delay bound for high-priority traffic and minimum throughput guarantees for both high- and medium-priority traffic. On the other hand, we also conduct detailed simulation experiments. The results show a close agreement between analytical approach and simulation. In addition, the simulation results show that the HCS scheme is able to provide excellent performance in terms of average delay, delay-variation, and throughput as compared with previous approaches.", "paper_title": "A hybrid cycle bandwidth allocation scheme with differentiated services support in Ethernet passive optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254906600007"}
