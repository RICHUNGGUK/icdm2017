An expressive sequence is modelled to contain an onset followed by an apex and an offset. Feature selection methods are applied in order to extract features for each of the onset and offset segments of the expression. These features are then used to train GentleBoost classifiers and build a Hidden Markov Model in order to model the full temporal dynamics of the expression. The proposed fully automatic system was employed on the BU-4DFE database for distinguishing between the six universal expressions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Disgust, Surprise and Fear. Comparisons with a similar 2D system based on the motion extracted from facial intensity images was also performed. The attained results suggest that the use of the 3D information does indeed improve the recognition accuracy when compared to the 2D data in a fully automatic manner. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
