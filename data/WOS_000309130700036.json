We comprehensively investigate the map and explore its critical chaotic characteristics and parameters. We further present two circuit implementations for the zigzag map based on the switched current technique as well as the current-mode affine interpolation of the breakpoints. In practice, implementation variations can deteriorate the quality of the output sequence as a result of variation of the chaotic map parameters. In order to quantify the impact of variations on the map performance, we model the variations using a combination of theoretical analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations on the circuits. We demonstrate that even in the presence of the map variations, a TRNG based on the zigzag map passes all of the NIST 800-22 statistical randomness tests using simple post processing of the output data.", "paper_title": "Discrete-time chaotic-map truly random number generators: design, implementation, and variability analysis of the zigzag map", "paper_id": "WOS:000309130700036"}
