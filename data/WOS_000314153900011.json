The method is based on the use of a moving grid to describe the flow around the solid body, while the physical domain is resolved by the use of an Eulerian frame fixed grid. The moving grid displacements follows the same moving law of the body, and its shape does not change during the simulation. The communication between the moving grid and the fixed grid is performed at the beginning of each time step through interpolation. The ALE-LBM approach has been derived from the discretized Boltzmann equation by a Chapman-Enskog expansion procedure, the equivalence of the proposed method with the Navier-Stokes equations for a weakly compressible athermal flow being recovered. Numerical simulations of academical test cases have been performed in order to assess the method and to investigate the sensitivity of the error to the simulation parameters. Three different test cases have been considered, in order to perform a robust assessment of the ALE-LBM approach. More specifically, the Uniform Flow, the Poiseuille Flow and the Plane Wave test cases have been studied and the limits of application of the approach have been defined and discussed. Finally, the case of a rotating two dimensional square cylinder immersed in a Poiseuille Flow, Re - 80, has been numerically investigated. The results confirm that the ALE-LBM approach is able to correctly represent the physical flow features and, in particular, the transition zone between the two grids used is smooth and continuous, a sign that the error due to the interpolation process is bounded and does not diverge in time.
