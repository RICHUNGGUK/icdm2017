This can be costly, time consuming and error prone. In this paper we show how to develop a theory of robot-environment interaction, which would overcome the above problem. We show how we can model a mobile robot's task (so-called \"task identification\") using non-linear polynomial models (NARMAX), which can subsequently be formally analysed using established mathematical methods. This provides an understanding of the underlying phenomena governing the robot's behaviour. Apart from the paper's main objective of formally analysing robot-environment interaction, the task identification process has further benefits, such as the fast and convenient cross-platform transfer of robot control programs (\"Robot Java\"), parsimonious task representations (memory issues) and very fast control code execution times.
