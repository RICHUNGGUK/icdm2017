These properties may not only affect the function of the neuron and the local network it forms part of, but it may also eventually affect behavior. We were interested to study whether epileptogenic activity could be reduced by adding an ion channel. In this work, we used computational search techniques to optimize ion channel properties for the goal of modifying neural response characteristics. Our results show that this type of parameter search is possible and reasonably efficient. Successful searches were generated using the direct method PRAXIS, and by systematic searches in low-dimensional sub-spaces. We also report on unsuccessful searches using a simplex-type method, a gradient-based method, and attempts to reduce goal function evaluation time. Importantly, using this search strategy, our study has shown that it is possible to change a neuron's characteristics selectively with regard to response to degree of synchronicity in synaptic input.
