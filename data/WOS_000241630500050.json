But although Information and Communication technology (ICT) has improved enormously, civil engineering communication has by far not used its huge potentials. In the paper we are identifying some reasons for the slow introduction of emerging ICT in AEC sector; we emphasize some emerging technologies, their potentials, and implementation attempts, and then present a set of activities, which could improve the current situation.", "paper_title": "Civil engineering communication - Obstacles and solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630500050"}
