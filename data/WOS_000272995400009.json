We use the DTW to classify ECG frames because ECG and speech signals have similar non-stationary characteristics. The DTW mapping function is obtained by searching the frame from its end to start. A threshold is setup for DTW matching residual either to classify an ECG frame or to add a new class. Classification and establishment of a template set are carried out simultaneously. A frame is classified into a category with a minimal residual and satisfying a threshold requirement. A classification residual of 1.33% is achieved by the DTW for a 10-min ECG recording.", "paper_title": "Electrocardiogram data mining based on frame classification by dynamic time warping matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000272995400009"}
