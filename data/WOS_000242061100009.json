This paper respectively, studies their characteristics during traffic shaping at the edge node in synchronous optical packet-switched networks and highlights the functions of the First-Come-First- Service (FCFS) schedule queue for various offered loads and assembly parameters, including normalized timeout and normalized threshold. Simulation results demonstrate that under light-medium load the FCFS schedule queue works as a low pass filter, i.e., the statistical features before and after the FCFS schedule queue is nearly the same and each of the statistical features approximately follows the same trend. Heavy load drives the FCFS schedule queue into an overload or saturation state and the three statistical features all exhibit different behavior. By adjusting the assembly parameters, the deficiency can be modified.", "paper_title": "Traffic shaping at the edge node in synchronous optical packet-switched networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242061100009"}
