Methods: Adaptive support was given in the form of customization suggestions, generated based on behavioral user data, which participants could choose to accept or ignore. Twelve radiologists worked with the standard adaptable version of the PACS for six weeks, during which their actions on the PACS interface were logged. Based on these logging data, customization support was generated for each specific participant. Half of the participants received support and half did not. After the support was given, logging continued for another six weeks. Participants' customization behavior and performance, measured as the average time needed to review a radiography study, were compared between the groups. Subjective responses to the customization support were also measured. Results: Participants who received support used the PACS's customization facilities more effectively than participants who did not receive support. Participants receiving support accepted most of the customization suggestions and all participants indicated that the support was useful. We did not find an increase in efficiency due to the support, possibly because the performance measure we used was not sensitive enough. Subjective responses did show that participants perceived the support as increasing their efficiency. Conclusion: Adaptive customization support would be a useful addition to the standard adaptable PACS interface, because it allows radiologists to customize their interface more effectively.
