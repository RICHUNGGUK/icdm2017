The maximum integer k such that G has an edge covering coloring with k colors is called the edge covering chromatic index of G and denoted by chi'(C)(G). It is known that for any graph G with minimum degree delta(G), it holds that delta(G) - 1 <= chi'(c)(G) <= delta(G). Based on the subgraph of G induced by the vertices of minimum degree, we find a new sufficient condition for a graph G to satisfy chi'(c) (G)= delta(G).
