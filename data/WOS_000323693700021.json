By means of differential inclusions theory and the topological degree theory in set-valued analysis, the existence of periodic solution for the neural networks is obtained. Moreover, our results extend previous works not only on time-varying and distributed delayed neural networks with continuous or even Lipschitz continuous activations, but also on time-varying and distributed delayed neural networks with discontinuous activations. Finally, we give some numerical examples to show the applicability and effectiveness of our main results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
