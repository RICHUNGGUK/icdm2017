The proposed framework integrates Genetic Algorithms with Artificial Neural Networks or Support Vector Machines. Here, it is tested on a well known 3-values, 6-neighbors, k-totalistic cellular automata rule called the \"burning paper\" rule. Results are encouraging and should pave the way for the use of the proposed framework in real-life complex systems models.", "paper_title": "A Neuro-Genetic Framework for Pattern Recognition in Complex Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262368700006"}
