A program representing the problem is easily transformable into a parallel version, which can be executed on distributed machines. We describe the results of experiments for estimating a speedup, a work granularity and an overhead of a parallel version in comparison with sequential computations.", "paper_title": "Vertex-magic total labeling of a graph by distributed constraint solving in the Mozart system", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100115"}
