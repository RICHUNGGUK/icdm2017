The main constituents of tissue undergo different processes reacting to mechanical stimulus. Thereby, the characterisation of growth and remodelling requires an accurate estimation of the stresses and strains of their main components. Many soft tissues can be considered as composite materials and can be analysed using an appropriate rule of mixtures. Particularly, arterial tissue can be modelled as an isotropic soft matrix reinforced with preferentially oriented collagen fibres. An inverse approach to obtain the mechanical characterisation of each main component is proposed in this work. The procedure is based on a rule of mixtures raised in a finite deformation framework and generalised to include kinematics and compatibility equations for serialparallel behaviour. This methodology allows obtaining the stressstrain relationship of the components fitting experimental data.", "paper_title": "An inverse approach for the mechanical characterisation of vascular tissues via a generalised rule of mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000315719300001"}
