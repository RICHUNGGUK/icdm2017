The inherent relationships between these components make it vital to support users' natural browsing behaviour in order to offer effective and efficient access to structured documents. This paper examines the concept of best entry points, which are document components from which the user can browse to obtain optimal access to relevant document components. In particular this paper investigates the basic characteristics of best entry points. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
