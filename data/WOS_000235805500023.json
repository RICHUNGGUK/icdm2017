The proposed technique is a new approach for range queries that uses spatial indexing. Range queries are most often encountered under sensor networks for computing aggregation values. However, previous works just addressed the importance but didn't provide any efficient technique for processing range queries. A FDSI-tree is thus designed for efficiently processing them. Each node in the sensor network has the MBR of the region where its children nodes and the node itself are located. The range query is evaluated over the region which intersects the geographic location of sensors. It ensures the maximum power savings by avoiding the communication of nodes not participating over the evaluation of the query.", "paper_title": "FDSI-Tree: A fully distributed spatial index tree for efficient & power-aware range queries in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235805500023"}
