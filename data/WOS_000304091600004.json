Chosen-plaintext attacks have been proposed for KSAC when the same key is used to encrypt different messages. In this paper, we consider a stronger version of KSAC, where different keys are used to encrypt different messages. We then use message indistinguishability to prove that this version of KSAC is insecure under ciphertext-only attacks, a weaker form of attack than chosen-plaintext attacks. Indistinguishability in the presence of an eavesdropper is a security definition equivalent to semantic security. We prove the insecurity over the alphabet {A, B} with p(B) = (1/2(1 + 2(s))) and p(A) = 1 - p(B) where p(A) and p(B) are the probabilities of the source generating A and B, respectively, and s is the number of bits in each splitting key.", "paper_title": "On the Security of Key-Based Interval Splitting Arithmetic Coding With Respect to Message Indistinguishability", "paper_id": "WOS:000304091600004"}
