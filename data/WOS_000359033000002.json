Additionally, the emerging requirements on both security and real-time make it much more difficult to produce ideal solutions. In this work, we address the emerging scheduling problem existed in the design of secure and energy-efficient real-time embedded systems. The objective is to minimize the system energy consumption subject to security and schedulability constraints. Due to the complexity of the problem, we propose a dynamic programming based approximation approach to find efficient solutions under given constraints. The proposed technique has polynomial time complexity which is half of existing approximation approaches. The efficiency of our algorithm is validated by extensive experiments and a real-life case study. Comparing with other approaches, the proposed approach achieves energy-saving up to 37.6% without violating the real-time and security constraints of the system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
