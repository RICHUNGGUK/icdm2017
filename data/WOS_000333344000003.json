In the system considered (i) particles arrive according to a Poisson process with rate when an external Markov process (\"background process\") is in state , (ii) service times are drawn from a distribution with distribution function when the state of the background process (as seen at arrival) is , (iii) there are infinitely many servers. We start by setting up explicit formulas for the mean and variance of the number of particles in the system at time , given the system started empty. The special case of exponential service times is studied in detail, resulting in a recursive scheme to compute the moments of the number of particles at an exponentially distributed time, as well as their steady-state counterparts. Then we consider an asymptotic regime in which the arrival rates are sped up by a factor , and the transition times by a factor (for some ). Under this scaling it turns out that the number of customers at time obeys a central limit theorem; the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions is proven.", "paper_title": "Markov-modulated infinite-server queues with general service times", "paper_id": "WOS:000333344000003"}
