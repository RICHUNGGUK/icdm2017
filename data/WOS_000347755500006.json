DPL protocol requires compensated behavior between the corresponding rails, which differs from conventional logic principles. Thus it needs unusual design flows with repetitive and tedious workload. In this article, we present a custom execution tool to automatically realize a dual rail logic. This controllable and automated design flow relies on Xilinx FPGA platforms, to obtain dual rails with highly symmetric networks. The tool is able to automate the logic transformation from a raw single rail on Xilinx Design Language (XDL) to the Precharge Absorbed DPL (PA-DPL) format. Users can fully or partially convert the circuit in arbitrary placement schemes, without concerning the routing conflicts. Another significance is that this proposal is potentially to be used to other circuits that require precise routing control. SCA Security verification to an 8-bit AES coprocessor on SASEBO-GII indicates enhanced security grade due to the rigorous routing networks achieved by the repair process. Timing analysis further demonstrates that the net delay differences between complementary nets are minimized. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
