Database searches for emerging technologies can be problematic in many respects, for example the rapid evolution of terminology, the use of common phraseology, or the extent of \"legacy technology\" terminology. Searching on such legacy terms may or may not pick up R&D pertaining to the emerging technology of interest. A challenge is to assess the relevance of legacy terminology in building an effective search model. Common-usage phraseology additionally confounds certain domains in which broader managerial, public interest, or other considerations are prominent. In contrast, searching for highly technical topics is relatively straightforward. In setting forth to analyze \"Big Data,\" we confront all three challenges-emerging terminology, common usage phrasing, and intersecting legacy technologies. In response, we have devised a systematic methodology to help identify research relating to Big Data. This methodology uses complementary search approaches, starting with a Boolean search model and subsequently employs contingency term sets to further refine the selection. The four search approaches considered are: (1) core lexical query, (2) expanded lexical query, (3) specialized journal search, and (4) cited reference analysis. Of special note here is the use of a \"Hit-Ratio\" that helps distinguish Big Data elements from less relevant legacy technology terms. We believe that such a systematic search development positions us to do meaningful analyses of Big Data research patterns, connections, and trajectories. Moreover, we suggest that such a systematic search approach can help formulate more replicable searches with high recall and satisfactory precision for other emerging technology studies.", "paper_title": "A systematic method to create search strategies for emerging technologies based on the Web of Science: illustrated for 'Big Data'", "paper_id": "WOS:000365130100034"}
