Due to the computation-intensive nature of the QRD, its implementation has to be highly efficient. Flexibility in several forms, e.g. support for different algorithms, reusability of wireless implementations, portability, etc. is highly sought in wireless devices. The contradictory nature of flexibility and efficiency requires tradeoffs to be made between them in system development. In this paper, we have analyzed such tradeoffs by implementing two minimum mean squared error-sorted QRD algorithms. The algorithms have been implemented in four different methods with varying degree of reusability and in five different forms of portability. The performance of the implementations is evaluated by using the real-time constraints from the LTE standard. For all the implementations, modular equations for accurately estimating the execution time are derived.", "paper_title": "Implementations of Sorted-QR Decomposition for MIMO Receivers: Complexity, Reusability and Efficiency Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000304706300006"}
