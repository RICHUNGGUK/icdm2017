As a combination of ad-hoc and centralized communication mechanisms, D2D communication enables researchers to merge together the long-term development achievements in previously disjoint domains of ad-hoc networking and centralized networking. To help researchers to have a systematic understanding of the emerging D2D communication, we provide in this paper a comprehensive survey of available D2D related research works ranging from technical papers to experimental prototypes to standard activities, and outline some open research problems which deserve further studies.", "paper_title": "Device-to-Device Communication in LTE-Advanced Networks: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000365233100006"}
