To write even a simple transformation, these MTFs require a large amount of learning time. We describe in this paper a minimal, Java based, library that can be used to support the implementation of many practical transformations. Use of this library enables simple transformations to be implemented simply, whilst still providing some support for more complex transformations.", "paper_title": "SiTra: Simple transformations in Java", "paper_id": "WOS:000241450700025"}
