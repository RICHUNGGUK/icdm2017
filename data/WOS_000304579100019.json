A cross-layer scheduling scheme is proposed to exploit Link Going Down information from MIH to predict handover requirements, and then improve the performance Quality of Service (QoS) enabled transport services given the limited radio spectrum available for handovers in a heterogeneous network environment. According to simulation results, the proposed scheme can effectively increase the effective range of QoS sensitive services at the cell border while executing the handover procedure.
