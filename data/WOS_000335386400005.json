In cluster-based multi-hop communications, a cluster head (CH) closer to the sink is loaded heavier than those CHs farther away from the sink. In order to balance the energy consumption among CHs, we development a novel cluster-based routing protocol for corona-structured wireless sensor networks. Based on the relaying traffic of each CH conveys, adequate radius for each corona can be determined through nearly balanced energy depletion analysis, which leads to balanced energy consumption among CHs. Simulation results demonstrate that our clustering approach effectively improves the network lifetime, residual energy and reduces the number of CH rotations in comparison with the MLCRA protocols.", "paper_title": "Efficient Cluster Radius and Transmission Ranges in Corona-based Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000335386400005"}
