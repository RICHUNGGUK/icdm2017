The work in this paper improves on existing methods of MIP-MPLS interworking first by defining a simple framework based on Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) and second by outlining the relevant protocol design assumptions. In addition, the combined protocol is examined in detail under two scenarios and a comprehensive explanation of the operation of intra- and inter-cell handovers is presented.", "paper_title": "Handover operation in mobile IP-over-MPLS networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800048"}
