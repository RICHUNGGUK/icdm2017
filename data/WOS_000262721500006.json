We determine the pre-images under M of various (classes of) problems. For many parameterized problems whose underlying classical problem is in NP we show that the pre-images coincide with natural reparameterizations that take into account the amount of non-determinism needed to solve them.", "paper_title": "Subexponential Time and Fixed-parameter Tractability: Exploiting the Miniaturization Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000262721500006"}
