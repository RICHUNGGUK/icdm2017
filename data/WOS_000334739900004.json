Based on the structural characteristic and the monotonously increasing property of the system bounding functions, a variable separation method is first developed. By this method, an approximation-based adaptive backstepping approach is proposed for a class of nonlinear non-strict-feedback systems. It is shown that the proposed controller guarantees semi-global boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop systems. Three examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Approximation-Based Adaptive Neural Control Design for a Class of Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000334739900004"}
