It is based on negative-differential-resistance (NDR) MOS structures. Simulations have been carried out using a 0.13-mu m SOI CMOS technology. Since it uses Dynamic Current-Mode Logic (DyCML) comparators and features a dual-rail structure, the NDR-MOS SDFA shows a higher speed and lower power consumption than previously reported implementations. It can be used to design an N-bit constant-time adder with a 227-ps delay and a power consumption of 33 mu W per digit at 2-GHz clock frequency. The 64-bit version exhibits higher performance than a state-of-the-art fully optimized 64-bit carry-select adder implemented on the same technology.", "paper_title": "Efficient multiple-valued signed-digit full adder based on NDR MOS structures and its application to an N-bit current-mode constant-time adder", "paper_id": "WOS:000248013500003"}
