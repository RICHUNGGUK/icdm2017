The adoption of new technologies cause shifts in human behavior patterns, and a small body of research has considered the ways that criminals adjust their offending practices due to new technology. Few have, however, explored the ways that technology produces new forms of crime and deviance. This study addresses this gap in the literature by examining the argot of the technology-focused computer hacker subculture using multiple data sets. The findings explore the dynamic use of hacker argot and how these terms reflect the role of technology in shaping attitudes toward and support for deviance and crime.", "paper_title": "Examining the Role of Technology in the Formation of Deviant Subcultures", "paper_id": "WOS:000282317300004"}
