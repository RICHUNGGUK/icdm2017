Then, based on the proposed criterions and Lyapunov stability theory, pinning control schemes for this system are developed to achieve global synchronization. The obtained conditions are expressed within the framework of linear matrix inequalities and can be easily checked in practice. Finally, several numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Synchronization criteria and pinning control for complex networks with multiple delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000313062100017"}
