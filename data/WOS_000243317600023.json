The outer bound is tight for all cases where the capacity region is known. When specialized to the case of no common information, this outer bound is contained in the Korner-Marton outer bound. This containment is shown to be strict for the binary skew-symmetric broadcast channel. Thus, this outer bound is in general tighter than all other known outer bounds.", "paper_title": "An outer bound to the capacity region of the broadcast channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000243317600023"}
