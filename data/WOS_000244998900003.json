It generalizes the previous models based on the nucleotide mutation matrices 4 x 4 and the trinucleotide mutation matrices 64 x 64 with zero elements on its main diagonal. It determines at some time t the exact occurrence probabilities of trinucleotides mutating randomly according to these nine substitution parameters. Furthermore, applications of this model allow to generalize an evolutionary analytical solution of the common circular code of eukaryotes and prokaryotes and also to derive a codon phylogenetic distance.
