Our method is based on the study of conjugate direction fields (CDF) which allow the presence of +/- k/1 (k is an element of Z) singularities. Starting with a triangle discretization of a freeform shape, we first compute an as smooth as possible conjugate direction field satisfying the user's directional and angular constraints, then apply mixed-integer quadrangulation and planarization techniques to generate a PQ mesh which approximates the input shape faithfully. We demonstrate that our method is effective and robust on various 3D models.", "paper_title": "General Planar Quadrilateral Mesh Design Using Conjugate Direction Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000297681100018"}
