The results provide for a new stage of virtualization-one for which computation is no longer localized within a data center but rather can be migrated across geographical distances, with negligible downtime, transparently to running applications and external clients. A noteworthy data point indicates that a live VM was migrated between Amsterdam, NL and San Diego, USA with just 1-2 s of application downtime. When compared to intra-LAN local migrations, downtime is only about 5-10 times greater despite 1000 times higher round-trip times. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
