The method basically stops the minimization of the primal functional when moments of the error signal (LIP to fourth order) become stationary, rather than according to a tolerance threshold of primal convergence itself. This simple strategy induces lower computational efforts and no significant differences are observed in terms of performance and sparsity. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
