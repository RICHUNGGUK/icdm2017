A non-cooperative two-person non-zero-sum game is formulated where the base station and a new connection are the players of this game. The solution of the game formulation provides not only the decision on accepting or rejecting a connection, but also the amount of bandwidth allocated to a new connection (if admitted). A queueing model considering adaptive modulation and coding in the physical layer is used to analyze quality of service (QoS) performances, namely, the delay performance for real-time and the throughput performance for non-realtime polling services and best effort service. This queueing model is used by the proposed bandwidth allocation and admission control mechanism to ensure that the utilities for both the base station and the new connection are maximized. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by simulation and compared with that of each of the traditional admission control with static and adaptive bandwidth allocation schemes.
