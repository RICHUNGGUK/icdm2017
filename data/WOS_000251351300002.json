All use region based statistical measures using a combination of color features, linear features, and intensities combined with a collection of methods for subdividing the image into regions. All possible combinations were evaluated and the best (highest success rate) was selected to be used as a practical image similarity measure. Component algorithms are combined using a simple decision fusion voting scheme, giving success rates in the range of 50-60%. For a web search application this is quite reasonable.", "paper_title": "Composite algorithms in image content searches", "paper_id": "WOS:000251351300002"}
