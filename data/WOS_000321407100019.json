The controller associates peak-current and sliding mode controls. The advantages of the proposed approach are the capability to show the onset of fast-scale bifurcation, and the reduction of numerical calculation effort. To confirm the validity of the proposed method, simulation and experimental results are detailed. (c) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
