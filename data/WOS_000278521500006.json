Ishai et al. (CCC '07) raised the question of whether PCPs are inherent in efficient arguments, and if so, to what extent. We give evidence that they are, by showing how to convert any argument system whose soundness is reducible to the security of some cryptographic primitive into a PCP system whose efficiency is related to that of the argument system and the reduction (under certain complexity assumptions).", "paper_title": "Are PCPs Inherent in Efficient Arguments?", "paper_id": "WOS:000278521500006"}
