Cognitive radio (CR) has the ability of sensing the radio environment and dynamically reconfiguring the operating parameters, which can make SANET utilize the spectrum efficiently. However, due to the dynamic topology nature and no central entity for data fusion in SANET, the interference brought into the primary network caused by the hidden primary user requires to be carefully managed by a sort of decentralized cooperative spectrum sensing schemes. In this paper, we propose a self-weighted decentralized cooperative spectrum sensing (SWDCSS) scheme to solve such a problem. The analytical and simulation results show that the proposed SWDCSS scheme is reliable to detect the primary user in SANET. As a result, secondary network can efficiently utilize the spectrum band of primary network with little interference to primary network. Referring the complementary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we observe that with a given false alarm probability, our proposed algorithm reduces the missing probability by 27% than the traditional embedded spectrally agile radio protocol for evacuation (ESCAPE) algorithm in the best condition.", "paper_title": "Self-weighted Decentralized Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Based On Notification for Hidden Primary User Detection in SANET-CR Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000331613500001"}
