When such uncertainties occur, static DAG scheduling approaches may suffer, and some rescheduling may be necessary. Assuming that the uncertainty in task execution times is modelled in a stochastic manner, we may be able to use this information to improve static DAG scheduling considerably. In this paper, a novel DAG scheduling approach is proposed to solve this stochastic scheduling problem, based on a Monte Carlo method. The approach is built on the top of a classic static DAG scheduling heuristic and evaluated through extensive simulation. Empirical results show that a significant improvement of average application performance can be achieved by the proposed approach at a reasonable execution time cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
