Pursuing the work of Aardal, Lenstra et al. using the reformulation X = {x is an element of Z(n) vertical bar x - x(0) = Q lambda, lambda is an element of Z(n-m)}, our aim is to derive reformulations of the form {x is an element of Z(n) vertical bar P(x - x(0)) = T mu, mu is an element of Z(s)} with 0 <= s <= n - m where preferably all the coefficients of P are small compared to the coefficients of A and T. In such cases the new variables mu appear to be good branching directions, and in certain circumstances permit one to deduce rapidly that the instance is infeasible. We give a polynomial time algorithm for identifying such P, T if possible, and for the case that A has one row a we analyze the reformulation when s = 1, that is, one mu-variable is introduced. In particular, we determine the integer width of the extended formulations in the direction of the mu-variable, and derive a lower bound on the Frobenius number of a. We conclude with some preliminary tests to see if the reformulations are effective when the number s of additional constraints and variables is limited.", "paper_title": "Lattice based extended formulations for integer linear equality systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000267827500006"}
