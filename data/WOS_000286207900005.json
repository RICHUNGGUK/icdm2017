In order to accomplish this goal, an organization must resolve several types of heterogeneity problems, especially the entity heterogeneity problem that arises when the same real-world entity type is represented using different identifiers in different data sources. Statistical record linkage techniques could be used for resolving this problem. However, the use of such techniques for online record linkage could pose a tremendous communication bottleneck in a distributed environment ( where entity heterogeneity problems are often encountered). In order to resolve this issue, we develop a matching tree, similar to a decision tree, and use it to propose techniques that reduce the communication overhead significantly, while providing matching decisions that are guaranteed to be the same as those obtained using the conventional linkage technique. These techniques have been implemented, and experiments with real-world and synthetic databases show significant reduction in communication overhead.", "paper_title": "Efficient Techniques for Online Record Linkage", "paper_id": "WOS:000286207900005"}
