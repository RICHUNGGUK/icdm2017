There is currently a lack of tools that would automatically estimate the best k to use and/or quickly generate histograms of k-mer abundances that would allow the user to make an informed decision. Results: We develop a fast and accurate sampling method that constructs approximate abundance histograms with several orders of magnitude performance improvement over traditional methods. We then present a fast heuristic that uses the generated abundance histograms for putative k values to estimate the best possible value of k. We test the effectiveness of our tool using diverse sequencing data-sets and find that its choice of k leads to some of the best assemblies.", "paper_title": "Informed and automated k-mer size selection for genome assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000329059700005"}
