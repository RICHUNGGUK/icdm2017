More and more three-dimensional images have been obtained at the medium resolutions between 5 and 10 degrees A. At this resolution range, major alpha-helices can be detected as cylindrical sticks and beta-sheets can be detected as plain-like regions. A critical question in de novo modeling from cryo-EM images is to determine the match between the detected secondary structures from the image and those on the protein sequence. We formulate this matching problem into a constrained graph problem and present an O(Delta(2)N(2)2(N))algorithm to this NP-Hard problem. The algorithm incorporates the dynamic programming approach into a constrained K-shortest path algorithm. Our method, DP-TOSS, has been tested using alpha-proteins with maximum 33 helices and alpha-beta proteins up to five helices and 12 beta-strands. The correct match was ranked within the top 35 for 19 of the 20 alpha-proteins and all nine alpha-beta proteins tested. The results demonstrate that DP-TOSS improves accuracy, time and memory space in deriving the topologies of the secondary structure elements for proteins with a large number of secondary structures and a complex skeleton.", "paper_title": "Solving the Secondary Structure Matching Problem in Cryo-EM De Novo Modeling Using a Constrained K-Shortest Path Graph Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000337147300012"}
