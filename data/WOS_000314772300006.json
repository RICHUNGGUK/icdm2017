For the fast development of information and communication technologies, the relation between the web data and tourism is inseparable. However, the Web data include various types of information such as numerical, linguistic, and graded data. Furthermore, the expert tourism planner's subjectivity is also an important factor to develop new favorable plans. A simplified fuzzy reasoning method, which is one of the useful approaches in Data mining, is introduced in order to deal with these data mathematically. The analysis of the tourism data and the knowledge discovery are performed using actual data of bullet trains in Japan.", "paper_title": "Web intelligence for tourism using railway data by a simplified fuzzy reasoning method", "paper_id": "WOS:000314772300006"}
