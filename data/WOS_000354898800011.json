However, hiding data inevitably destroys the host image, even though the distortion is imperceptible. To enhance the hiding capacity and maintain the quality of the host image after embedding hidden data, in this paper, we present a high payload reversible data hiding scheme that is based on the absolute moment block truncation coding (AMBTC) compression domain. We explore the redundancy in a block of AMBTC-compressed images to determine if a block is embeddable or non-embeddable. Next, we create four disjoint sets for embeddable blocks to embed data using different combinations of the mean value and the standard deviation. Performance comparisons with other BTC-based schemes are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "A novel reversible data hiding scheme based on AMBTC compression technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000354898800011"}
