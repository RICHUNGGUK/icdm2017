The displacement vector satisfying the Lame system in linear elasticity is approximated using the meshless method of fundamental solutions (MFS). The fictitious source points are located both outside the (known) outer boundary of the body and inside the (unknown) void. The inverse geometric problem is then reduced to finding the minimum of a nonlinear least-squares functional that measures the gap between the given and computed data, penalized with respect to both the MFS constants and the derivative of the radial polar coordinates describing the position of the star-shaped void. The interior source points are anchored and move with the void during the iterative reconstruction procedure. The stability of the numerical method is investigated by inverting measurements contaminated with noise. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
