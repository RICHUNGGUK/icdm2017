All the substituted compounds have higher HOFs than their parent compounds. As the number of nitrogen atoms in the nitrobenzene ring increases, the HOFs of the derivatives with the same substituent rise gradually. Replacing carbon atoms in the nitrobenzene with nitrogen atoms to form N-N bonds is very helpful in improving their HOFs. Most of the substituted compounds have higher HOMO-LUMO gaps than the corresponding unsubstituted compounds. Substitution of the -NO2, -NF2, or -ONO2 group and an increase in the number of nitrogen atoms in the nitrobenzene rings are useful for enhancing their detonation performance. The substituents' substitution is not favorable for improving thermal stability. Considering detonation performance and thermal stability, five compounds may be considered potential candidates for high energy density compounds (HEDCs).", "paper_title": "Computational study of energetic nitrogen-rich derivatives of 1,4-bis(1-azo-2,4-dinitrobenzene)-iminotetrazole", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677600035"}
