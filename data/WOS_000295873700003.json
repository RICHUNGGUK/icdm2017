This work addresses the issues associated with using a level set as a generalized interface for fluid-solid coupling where the fluid-solid interface is embedded in an unstructured fluid grid. We outline the formulation used for the edge-based unstructured-grid Euler solver. The identification of the fluid-solid interface on the unstructured fluid mesh uses a super-sampled L-2 projection technique, which in conjunction with a Lagrangian interface position, permits fast identification of the interface and the concomitant imposition of boundary conditions. The use of a narrow-band approach for the identification of the wetted interface is presented with the details of the construction of interface conditions. A series of two and three-dimensional shock-body computations are presented to demonstrate the validity of the current approach on problems with static and dynamic interfaces, including projectile/shock interaction simulations.
