This paper emphasizes the problem of recovering both the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera using multiple silhouettes from one single image. View pairs among views in a single image can be divided into two kinds by the relationship between the two views in the pair: reflected by some mirror (real or virtual) and in a circular motion. Epipoles in the first kind of pairs can be easily determined from intersections of common tangent lines of silhouettes. Based on the projective properties of these epipoles, efficient methods are proposed to recover both the imaged circular points and the included angle between two mirrors. Epipoles in the second kind of pairs can be recovered simultaneously with the projection of intersection line between two mirrors by solving a simple 1D optimization problem using the consistency constraint of epipolar tangent lines. Fundamental matrices among views in a single image are all recovered. Using the estimated intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera, a euclidean reconstruction can be obtained. Experiments validate the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Self-Calibration of Catadioptric Camera with Two Planar Mirrors from Silhouettes", "paper_id": "WOS:000316126800014"}
