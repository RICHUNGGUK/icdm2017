It uses a shortest path algorithm to detect micro cracks in situations where the cracks are surrounded by plastic deformations and where a discrimination between cracks and plastic deformations is difficult. In a first step, crack clusters are detected as connected components of pixels with values below a given threshold value. Then the crack paths are determined by Dijkstra's algorithm as longest shortest paths through the darkest parts of the crack clusters. Linear parts of kinked paths can be identified with this. The new method was applied to over 2,000 images. Some statistical applications and a comparison with another free image tool are given.", "paper_title": "Micro crack detection with Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000302706400014"}
