After a brief overview of the IEEE 802.17 RPR protocol, this article investigates the weighted fairness aspects as well as the requirements for sizing the secondary transit queue of IEEE 802.17 RPR stations (in the aggressive mode of operation). The analysis and suggested improvements presented in this article are then supported by performance evaluation results and theoretical calculations.", "paper_title": "Weighted Fairness and Correct Sizing of the Secondary Transit Queue in Resilient Packet Rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000285516500006"}
