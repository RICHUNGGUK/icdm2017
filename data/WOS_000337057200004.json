However, constructing either fully automatically or with limited user control a low-distortion polycube from a detailed surface remains challenging in practice. We propose a variational method for deforming an input triangle mesh into a polycube shape through minimization of the l(1)-norm of the mesh normals, regularized via an as-rigid-as-possible volumetric distortion energy. Unlike previous work, our approach makes no assumption on the orientation, or on the presence of features in the input model. User-guided control over the resulting polycube map is also offered to increase design flexibility. We demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and controllability of our method on a variety of examples, and explore applications in hexahedral remeshing and quadrangulation.", "paper_title": "l(1)-Based Construction of Polycube Maps from Complex Shapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000337057200004"}
