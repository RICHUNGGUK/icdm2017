Thus, as a client is playing back successive frames (in time) for a given view, it can send a request to the server to switch to a different view while continuing uninterrupted temporal playback. Noting that standard tools for random access (i.e., I-frame insertion) can be bandwidth-inefficient for this application, we propose a redundant representation of I-, P-, and \"merge\" frames, where each original picture can be encoded into multiple versions, appropriately trading off expected transmission rate with storage, to facilitate view switching. We first present ad hoc frame structures with good performance when the view-switching probabilities are either very large or very small. We then present optimization algorithms that generate more general frame structures with better overall performance for the general case. We show in our experiments that we can generate redundant frame structures offering a range of tradeoff points between transmission and storage, e. g., outperforming simple I-frame insertion structures by up to 45% in terms of bandwidth efficiency at twice the storage cost.", "paper_title": "Interactive Streaming of Stored Multiview Video Using Redundant Frame Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000287400700012"}
