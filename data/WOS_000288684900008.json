A finite element approximation of the governing equation is designed within the framework of a conservative Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation. An implicit flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm is implemented to suppress spurious undershoots and overshoots appearing in convection-dominated problems. A detailed numerical study is performed for P(1) finite element discretizations on fixed and moving meshes. Simulation results for a Taylor dispersion problem (moderate Peclet numbers) and for a convection-dominated problem (large Peclet numbers) are presented to give a flavor of practical applications.
