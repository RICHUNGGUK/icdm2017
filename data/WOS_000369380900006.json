The multi-dimension refers to involvement of multiple types of evidence, and the multi-dimensional evidence, in this paper, involves mainly e-commerce business feedback evidence, online community business feedback evidence and network operation behavior evidence. On this basis, the evidence features can be incorporated into combination rule of evidence, design a new method to calculate the dynamic trust, and propose an improved D-S combination rule to synthesize multi-dimensional evidence, better to solve the problem of uncertainty of evidence. Experiments show it can effectively resist network fraud.", "paper_title": "Research on Dynamic Trust Computing Method Based on Multi-Dimensional Evidence", "paper_id": "WOS:000369380900006"}
