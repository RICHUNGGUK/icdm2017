In real projects, the trade-off between the project cost and the completion time, and the uncertainty of the environment are both considerable aspects for managers. In this paper, three new fuzzy time-cost trade-off models are proposed, in which credibility theory is applied to describe the uncertainty of activity duration times. A searching method by integrating fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm is produced to search the quasi-optimal schedules under some decision-making criteria. The purpose of the paper is to reveal how to obtain the optimal balance of the completion time and the project cost in fuzzy environments.", "paper_title": "New fuzzy models for time-cost trade-off problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000277413800005"}
