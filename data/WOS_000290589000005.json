From the viewpoints of user interests retention and granular information processing, we examine various strategies for user-centric unification of search and reasoning. Inspired by the basic level for human problem-solving in cognitive science, we refine a query based on retained user interests. We bring the multi-level, multi-perspective strategies from human problem-solving to large-scale search and reasoning. The power/exponential law-based interests retention modeling, network statistics-based data selection, and ontology-supervised hierarchical reasoning are developed to implement these strategies. As an illustration, we investigate some case studies based on a large-scale scientific literature dataset, DBLP. The experimental results show that the proposed strategies are potentially effective.", "paper_title": "User-centric query refinement and processing using granularity-based strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000290589000005"}
