Using matched CIO business executive responses from 174 firms, we test a staged maturity relationship between CIO supply-side and demand-side leadership and examine three antecedents (CIO human capital, CIO structural power, and organizational support for IT) and two effects (IT contribution to firm efficiency and strategic growth) of CIO leadership. The staged maturity model is supported by our findings and provides insight into how these two stages of CIO leadership influence IT impact within the organization and how they are influenced by these key antecedents.", "paper_title": "Antecedents and Effects of CIO Supply-Side and Demand-Side Leadership: A Staged Maturity Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000280784500011"}
