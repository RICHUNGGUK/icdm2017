Surprisingly, DHF cooperation with a relay that harvests energy from a wireless source achieves the same DMT as when the relay is connected to a fixed power supply, by supplying the energy harvesting (EH) period to be asymptotically small. For nontrivial EH period, however we show that the same DMT is achieved for a sufficiently small multiplexing gain (or corresponding large diversity gain), beyond which the DMT degrades.", "paper_title": "Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff of Dynamic Harvest-and-Forward Cooperation", "paper_id": "WOS:000377706800015"}
