We observe that the hidden information, the information hidden in the cover images, of stego-images are clustered in a plane while all other information of cover images are scattered more evenly in the whole space and have no other clusters. Based on this fact, we develop a steganalysis scheme to discriminate stego-images from innocent images. The experiment results show the effectiveness of the propose approach.", "paper_title": "Steganalysis based on distribution characters of stego-images in reduced dimension space", "paper_id": "WOS:000338317400008"}
