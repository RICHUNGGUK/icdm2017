Although the visual quality assessment of an instrument is a subjective matter, it is also influenced by some of its photometric features, such as the light intensity distribution. This work presents a methodology for identifying and quantifying non-homogeneous regions in the lighting distribution of these instruments, starting from a digital image. In order to accomplish this task, a set of 107 digital images of instruments were acquired and preprocessed, identifying a set of instrument regions. These instruments were also evaluated by common drivers and specialists to identify their non-homogenous regions. Then, for each region, we extracted a set of homogeneity descriptors, and also proposed a relational descriptor to study the homogeneity influence of a region in the whole instrument. These descriptors were associated with the results of the manual labeling, and given to two machine learning algorithms, which were trained to identify a region as being homogeneous or not. Experiments showed that the proposed methodology obtained an overall precision above 94% for both regions and instrument classifications. Finally, a meticulous analysis of the users' and specialist's image evaluations is performed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
