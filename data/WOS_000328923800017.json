By constructing proper Lyapunov functionals and using M-matrix theory and LaSalle invariant principle, the sets of global exponentially dissipativity are characterized parametrically. It is proven herein that there are 2(2n2-n) equilibria for an n-neuron memristor-based neural network and they are located in the derived globally attractive sets. It is also shown that memristor-based recurrent neural networks with time-varying delays are stabilizable at the origin of the state space by using a linear state feedback control law with appropriate gains. Finally, two numerical examples are discussed in detail to illustrate the characteristics of the results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
