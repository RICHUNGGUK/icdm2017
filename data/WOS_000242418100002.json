We focus on the formal deductive apparatus L-R, that is sound and complete with respect to a semantics based on rough truth. L-R turns out to be equivalent to the paraconsistent logic J due to Jaskowski. A significant feature of rough truth is that, a proposition and its negation may well be roughly true together. Thus, in [5], rough consistency was introduced. Completeness of L-R is proved with the help of this notion of consistency. The properties of L-R motivate us to use it for a proposal of rough belief change. During change, the operative constraints on a system of beliefs are that of rough consistency preservation and deductive closure with respect to L-R. Following the AGM [1] line, eight basic postulates for defining rough revision and contraction functions are presented. Interrelationships of these functions are also proved. The proposal is, therefore, an example of paraconsistent belief change.", "paper_title": "Rough belief change", "paper_id": "WOS:000242418100002"}
