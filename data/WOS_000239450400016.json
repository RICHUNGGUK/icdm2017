In many cases, however, there is an information gap between the actual occurrences of events to which such a system must respond, and the data generated by monitoring tools regarding these events. For example, some events, by their very nature, may not be signaled by any monitoring tools, or the inaccuracy of monitoring tools may incorrectly reflect the information associated with events. The result is that in many cases, there is uncertainty in the active system associated with event occurrence. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of the sources of this uncertainty. Furthermore, we provide a formal way to represent this uncertainty, which is the first step towards addressing the aforementioned information gap.", "paper_title": "A taxonomy and representation of sources of uncertainty in active systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239450400016"}
