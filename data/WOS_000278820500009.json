As an example of application, we consider the team workshop problem 28 for an electrodynamic levitation device. The connection between the background mesh including the two exciting coils and the foreground mesh of the conducting plate is established by using a stable projection operator onto the plate boundary. The aim is to determine the dynamic characteristics of the levitating plate: to this end, a coupled solution of the electromagnetic and mechanical problem is necessary. (C) 2009 IMACS.
