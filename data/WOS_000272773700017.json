In analyzing ACSR models, the existing techniques such as bisimulation checking and Hennessy-Milner Logic (HML) model checking are very important in theory of ACSR, but they are difficult to use for large complex system models in practice. In this paper, we suggest a framework to verify ACSR models against their requirements described in an expressive timed temporal logic. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach with a real world case study.", "paper_title": "Model Checking of Real-Time Properties of Resource-Bound Process Algebra", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773700017"}
