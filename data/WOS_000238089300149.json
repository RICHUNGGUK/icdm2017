Moreover, a method based on Virtual Visual Servoing (VVS) is utilized to compute the pose of the device to be tracked. With the proposed method, the pose computation can be considered as the dual problem of visual servoing, thus an accurate and robust result can be obtained. The proposed system can be regarded as a 6-DOF controller and can be widely applied in the fields of entertainment, education and industry, etc.", "paper_title": "Single camera based optical tracking system for personal entertainment", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300149"}
