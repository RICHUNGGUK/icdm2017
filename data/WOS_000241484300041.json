One such method, is the relaxation element method, which maintains an unambiguous connection between the stress-drop in the local volume of a solid with plastic deformation in it. Based on this method and with combination of cellular automata approach a simulation of the evolution of band structures in polycrystals has been studied. The model can be referred to the class of geometrical models, known as cellular automata. Physical principles, laid on the basis of the model, allowed to reveal in the simulated polycrystals self-organization of the band structures and the regularities of the development of localization patterns, observed in experiments. The fundamental property of a solid: \"plastic deformation in the local volumes of solid is accompanied by stress relaxation in it\" lies in the basis of the method.", "paper_title": "Simulation of the evolution of band structures in polycrystals on the basis of relaxation element method and cellular automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300041"}
