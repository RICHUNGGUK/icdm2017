The algorithm is based on approximating the logistic regression loss by a piecewise quadratic function, using Rosset and Zhu's path tracking algorithm on the approximate problem, and then applying a correction to get to the true path. Application of the algorithm to text classification and sparse kernel logistic regression shows that the algorithm is efficient.", "paper_title": "A fast tracking algorithm for generalized LARS/LASSO", "paper_id": "WOS:000250789100020"}
