The method is based on Asynchronous Adaptive Mesh Refinement. Extensions of the asynchronous time integration to Runge Kutta method and centered schemes are given. The method is then applied to the simulation of the airflow generated by Surface Dielectric Barrier Discharges driven by sine or nanosecond pulses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
