During the design procedure, a hybrid learning algorithm combining sliding mode control and Lyapunov stability criterion is adopted to tune the free parameters on line by output feedback control law and adaptive law. A weighting factor, which can be adjusted by the trade-off between plant knowledge and control knowledge, is adopted to sum together the control efforts from indirect adaptive fuzzy controller and direct adaptive fuzzy controller. To confirm effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, the fractional order chaotic response system is fully illustrated to track the trajectory generated from the fractional order chaotic drive system. The numerical results show that tracking error and control effort can be made smaller and the proposed hybrid intelligent control structure is more flexible during the design process.", "paper_title": "Uncertain Fractional Order Chaotic Systems Tracking Design via Adaptive Hybrid Fuzzy Sliding Mode Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000294513700004"}
