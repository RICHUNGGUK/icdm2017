In this article, we note that harmonic broadcasting is actually a special case of the priority encoded transmission scheme introduced by Albanese et al. in 1996, and prove-using an information theoretic argument-that it is impossible to achieve the design goals of harmonic broadcasting using a shorter encoding.
