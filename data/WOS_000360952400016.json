In addition to the expected symmetrical solutions, a set of two non-symmetrical solutions, mirror images of one another, are obtained for Reynolds number (Re) greater than a critical value, Re-1 by suitably eliminating one of the symmetrical solutions. The symmetrical solutions which are reported in this paper are obtained for Re <= 4000 and are all steady. The non-symmetrical solutions are computed for large values of Re until these solutions become unsteady, at a second critical Re, Re-2, viz., for Re >= Re-2 > Re-1. The transition from a non-symmetrical solution to its symmetrical counterpart upon reducing the Re below Re-1 is addressed. It is observed that the symmetric solutions are those which maximize the flow kinetic energy per unit input energy.
