This paper presents a method of how to obtain high frequency model of these transformers. For this purpose a detailed model is used and parameters of the model including inductances, capacitances and resistances are calculated using FEM (finite elements method). The effect of the frequency is considered in the inductance calculation using FEM. In order to validate the model, a setup was constructed for testing on high-voltage winding of dry-type transformer. The simulation results were compared with the experimental data measured from FRA (frequency response analysis) and impulse tests. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
