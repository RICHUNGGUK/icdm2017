It is shown that (g, u)-implications are not only the generalization of Yager'sg-implications, but also the generalization of (S, N)-, R-, QL-implications. Basic properties and characterization of these implications are discussed. Furthermore, the distributive equations of these implications are investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
