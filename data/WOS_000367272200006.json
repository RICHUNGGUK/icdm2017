However, as the Internet's underlying structural protocols and governance can be disturbed by intruders, for its smooth operation, it is important to minimize such disturbances. Of the available techniques for achieving this, computational intelligence methodologies, such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence approaches, are popular and have been successfully applied to detect intrusions. In this paper, we present an overview of these techniques and related literature on intrusion detection, analyze their research contributions, compare their approaches and discuss new research directions which will provide useful insights for intrusion detection researchers and practitioners.", "paper_title": "Survey of Uses of Evolutionary Computation Algorithms and Swarm Intelligence for Network Intrusion Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000367272200006"}
