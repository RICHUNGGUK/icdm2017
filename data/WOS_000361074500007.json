This restriction makes it possible to exclusively use rational linear transition maps between the pieces: transitions between the bi-cubic tensor-product spline pieces are either C-1 or they are G(1) (tangent continuous) based on one single rational linear reparameterization. The simplicity of the transition functions yields simple formulas for a hierarchy of splines on subdivided 3-6 polyhedra. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
