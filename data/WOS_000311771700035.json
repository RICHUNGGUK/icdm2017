This paper proposes a novel computing model, cloudgrid, able to achieve full cloud and grid integration. After presenting its three-layer architecture, the security issues involved are analyzed, proposing a solution based on fine-grained access control mechanisms and identity federation that allows cooperation and interoperability among untrusted cloud resources. The overhead introduced by the multiple-layer architecture and by the security system are measured by extensive testing on a prototype implementation, and a trade-off analysis between security and performance is presented.
