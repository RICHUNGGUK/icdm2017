Early detection of abnormal conditions prevents disastrous consequences, and the precise location of faults reduces downtime losses and maintenance costs. There is a myriad of solutions that deal with the diagnosis problem from different perspectives, but unfortunately, each solution usually does not benefit from the advantages of other approaches. This means that once one is committed with a particular solution, it is difficult to incorporate other tools and techniques. This paper presents a conceptual multi-agent system architecture for the improvement of monitoring and diagnosis capabilities in supervisory systems through the integration and coordination of heterogeneous tools and techniques. The analysis and design of this architecture, named SIGMA, is extensively described according to the Gaia methodology and Agent UML (AUML) diagrams. The feasibility of the architecture is verified with the implementation of a prototype using JADE 3.3 and is tested in a Nuclear Power Plant simulator.", "paper_title": "Agent-oriented architecture for monitoring and diagnosis in supervisory systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237214300006"}
