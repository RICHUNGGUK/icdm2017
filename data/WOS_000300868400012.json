When the number of candidate correspondences is large, the eigen-decomposition of the affinity matrix is time consuming and therefore is not suitable for real-time computer vision. To overcome the drawback, in this letter we propose to treat each candidate correspondence not only as a candidate but also as a voter. As a voter, it gives voting scores to other candidate correspondences. Based on the voting scores, the optimal correspondences are computed by simple addition and ranking operations. Experimental results on real-data demonstrate that the proposed method is more than one hundred times faster than the classical spectral method while does not decrease the matching accuracy.
