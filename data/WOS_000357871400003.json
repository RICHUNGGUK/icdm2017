This is even more urgent now that massive amount of linked data is being released by governments worldwide. The development of single dedicated visualization applications is increasing, but the problem of exploring unknown linked data to gain a good understanding of what is contained is still open. An effective generic solution must take into account the user's point of view, their tasks and interaction, as well as the system's capabilities and the technical constraints the technology imposes. This paper is a first step in understanding the implications of both, user and system by evaluating our dashboard-based approach. Though we observe a high user acceptance of the dashboard approach, our paper also highlights technical challenges arising out of complexities involving current infrastructure that need to be addressed while visualizing linked data. In light of the findings, guidelines for the development of linked data visualization (and manipulation) are provided.", "paper_title": "Exploring user and system requirements of linked data visualization through a visual dashboard approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000357871400003"}
