In this paper, we propose a virtual ruler approach, in which a vehicle equipped with multiple ultrasound beacons travels around the area to measure distances between pairwise sensors. Virtual Ruler can not only obtain sufficient distances between pairwise sensors, but can also eliminate incorrect distances in the distance measurement phase of sensor localization. We propose to measure the distance between pairwise sensors from multiple perspectives using the virtual ruler and filter incorrect values through a statistical approach. By assigning measured distances with confidence values, the localization algorithm can intelligently localize each sensor based on high confidence distances, which greatly improves localization accuracy. Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed approach can achieve better localization results than previous approaches in an indoor environment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
