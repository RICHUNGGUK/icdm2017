In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the bit rate and the CAVLC/UVLC decoding complexity. This relationship can help the encoder choose the best coding parameter to yield the best tradeoff between the rate, distortion, and the decoding complexity performance. A practical application of CAVLC/UVLC decoding complexity reduction is also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
