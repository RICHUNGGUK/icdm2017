The uniqueness, as well as the crucial part, is that we define rough sets under priority relationship. We also establish priority class using priority relationship R-angle as the categorization criteria. Then, we study the mathematical properities of the concepts, define the priority degree between, two objects, and define the summary priority degree as well, by using inclusion degree-priority degree measurement. Using summarization method, we can get the evaluation value for a given object and thus study the multi-attribute decision making. Finally, we present the decision-making example given an attribute as interval number and suggest decision-making steps by using the method of rough sets, which helps give us an insight into the method of fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making based on rough sets.", "paper_title": "A method of fuzzy multiple attribute decision making based on rough sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400016"}
