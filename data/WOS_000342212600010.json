In particular, this study introduces additional adaptive terms in an existing sliding mode control concept for standoff tracking guidance, in order to reduce the effect of unmodelled dynamics and disturbances. Decentralised angular separation control between UAVs, in conjunction with decentralised estimation, is also introduced using either velocity or orbit radius change by different information/communication structures. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the feasibility and benefits of the proposed approach under a realistic ground vehicle tracking scenario, using multiple UAVs having unknown parameters in the heading-hold autopilot.", "paper_title": "Decentralised Standoff Tracking of Moving Targets Using Adaptive Sliding Mode Control for UAVs", "paper_id": "WOS:000342212600010"}
