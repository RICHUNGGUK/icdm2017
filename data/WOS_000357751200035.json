Training the adaptive modeling parameters in ANFIS is still a challengeable problem which has been recently considered by researchers. Hybridizing of a robust optimization algorithm with ANFIS as its training algorithm provides a scope to improve the effectiveness of membership functions and fuzzy rules in the model. In this paper, a new Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA) by using a new type of population is proposed to optimize the modeling parameters for membership functions and fuzzy rules in ANFIS. As well, a case study on a machining process is considered to illustrate the robustness of the proposed training technique in prediction of machining performances. The prediction results have demonstrated the superiority of the presented hybrid ANFIS-MGA in term of prediction accuracy (with 97.74%) over the other techniques such as hybridization of ANFIS with Genetic Algorithm (GA), Taguchi-GA, Hybrid Learning algorithm (HL), Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grid Partition method (GP), as well as RBFN and basic Grid Partition Method (GPM). In addition, an attempt is done to specify the effectiveness of different improvement rates on the prediction result and measuring the number of function evaluations required. The comparison result reveals that MGA with improvement rate 0.8 raises the convergence speed and accuracy of the prediction results compared to GA. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
