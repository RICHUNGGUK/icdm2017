Moreover, creative designers and drafts-people often reuse data from previous projects and libraries of ready-to-use components. Usually, retrieving these drawings is a slow, complex and error-prone endeavor. While text-driven attempts at classifying image data have been recently supplemented with query-by-image content, these work only for bitmap-type data and cannot handle vectorial information. Furthermore, they are not very good at retrieving partial information, which makes it difficult to search complex documents. Here we present a new approach to allow efficient retrieval of complex vector drawings by content using simple sketches as queries. Our work uses a new hierarchical topology description mechanism, which allows comparing complex drawings to simple queries. In particular, we produce a multilevel description of drawings, from the topology graph, using different levels of detail and subparts of the information. We also show that the graph spectrum is stable and reliable for use as a topology description. Finally, experimental tests show that our approach is good at retrieving complex drawings from two different application domains, CAD and clip-art figures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
