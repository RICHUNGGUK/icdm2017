We focus on data where meaningful answers are given through the application semantics, e.g., pages in wikis, persons in social networks, or papers in a research network such as Mendeley. The PEW matrix generalizes the Google Matrix used in PageRank with a term-weight dependent leap and accommodates different levels of (semantic) closeness for different relations in the data, e.g., friend vs. co-worker in a social network. Its eigenvectors represent the distribution of a term after propagation. The eigenvectors for all terms together form a (vector space) index that takes the structure of the data into account and can be used with standard document retrieval techniques. In extensive experiments including a user study on a real life wiki, we show how put improves the quality of the ranking over a range of existing ranking approaches, yet achieves a query performance comparable to a plain vector space index.
