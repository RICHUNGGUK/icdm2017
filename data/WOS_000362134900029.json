We improve the recently proposed ITSVM and develop Generalized ITSVM. A linear function is chosen in the object function of Generalized ITSVM which leads to the primal problems of LPTWSVM. Comparing with TWSVM, a 1-norm regularization term is introduced to the objective function to implement structural risk minimization and the quadratic programming problems are changed to linear programming problems which can be solved fast and easily. Then we do not need to compute the large inverse matrices or use any optimization trick in solving our linear programs and the dual problems are unnecessary in the paper. We can introduce kernel function directly into nonlinear case which overcome the serious drawback of TWSVM. Also, we extend LPTWSVM to multi-class classification problem and get a new model MLPTWSVM. MLPTWSVM constructs M hyperplanes to make that the m-th hyperplane is far from the m-th class and close to the rest classes as much as possible which follow the idea of MBSVM. The numerical experiments verify that our new algorithms are very effective. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
