Besides directly addressing the issue of convergence of Nash equilibria via approximation, our investigation leads to a deeper understanding of various notions of functional convergence and their interconnections; more importantly, the investigation yields improved conditions for convergence of the approximate Nash equilibria via the variational approach. An illustrative application of our results to the approximation of a Nash equilibrium in a competitive capacity expansion model under uncertainty is presented.", "paper_title": "Approximations of Nash equilibria", "paper_id": "WOS:000257381200011"}
