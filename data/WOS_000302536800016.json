The parameters of the filter are assumed to be linearly dependent on the normalized fuzzy weighting functions. By using an augmentation technique, the design parameters are incorporated into a filtering error system. In order to derive less-conservative results and reduce the filtering error, a new condition is established to ensure the H-infinity performance of the filtering error system. By introducing more slack matrices, the solution set of the filter parameters is extended. By using a partitioning technique, a design method for the H-infinity filter is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An example demonstrates the improvement of the proposed design method over an existing approach.", "paper_title": "On H-infinity Filtering for Discrete-Time Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000302536800016"}
