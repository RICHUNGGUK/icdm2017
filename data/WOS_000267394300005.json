In MolFCA, multiple selectivity queries involving the comparison of an arbitrary number of targets and compound potency values or ratios can be defined and applied in a sequential manner to retrieve compounds with desired selectivity against targets of interest. In MolFCA applications, we extract compounds from a public domain database that share selectivity profiles with known drugs or drug candidates and study structure-selectivity relationships.", "paper_title": "Molecular Formal Concept Analysis for Compound Selectivity Profiling in Biologically Annotated Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000267394300005"}
