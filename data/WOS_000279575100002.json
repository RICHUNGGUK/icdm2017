The distribution characteristics of the connected regions on Jiagu rubbings is analyzed, and all the connected regions are recognized according to differences between these and their mathematical expectations. Regions are recognized as noise regions and filled if the differences are negative, while stroke regions are reserved. The attributes of the character image edges on Jiagu rubbings are also analyzed. The fractal dimensions of the character edge of Jiagu rubbings are calculated by means of statistics. The feature points are obtained using the cosine of the angle between the two vectors of the point and the consecutive two points. Different compression transformations with weighted coordinates are performed on different strokes and segments of the characters so as to smoothen the character edge of Jiagu rubbings images. Experimental results show that our scheme could successfully clear noise regions and polish the character edge of Jiagu rubbings.", "paper_title": "Restoration method of characters on Jiagu rubbings based on Poisson distribution and fractal geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000279575100002"}
