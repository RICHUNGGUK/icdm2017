In this paper, the OWA operators with uncertain weights such as interval or weak ordinal descriptions, coupled with interval input arguments, are presented in order to identify the superior course of action among a multitude of courses of action. With the help of relaxation of information representation, a burden of information specification imposed on decision maker can be, to some extent, relieved, and thus with regard to the parameters, we can obtain a less-specific expression that renders human judgments readily available. To perform the OWA aggregation, we take into account the strength of preference based on a probabilistic measure and present a way of ordering the input arguments specified by interval numbers as well as two heuristic algorithms to allocate uncertain weights to the ordered input arguments for prioritizing the courses of action.", "paper_title": "The OWA aggregation with uncertain descriptions on weights and input arguments", "paper_id": "WOS:000251699000011"}
