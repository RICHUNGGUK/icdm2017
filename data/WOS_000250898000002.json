Such control nets appear naturally for surfaces with the combinatorial structure of objects of revolution and at points of high valence in subdivision meshes. The resulting surfaces are C-2 except at a finite number of isolated points where the surface is C-1 and the curvature is bounded.", "paper_title": "Bicubic polar subdivision", "paper_id": "WOS:000250898000002"}
