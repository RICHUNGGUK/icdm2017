The complete capture enables not,just statistics as seen from outside the router, but also an accurate physical router model to be identified. This enables a comprehensive examination of congestion and delay from three points of view: the understanding of origins, measurement, and reporting. Our study defines new methodologies and metrics. In particular, the traffic reporting enables a rich description of the diversity of microcongestion behavior, without model assumptions, and at achievable computational cost.", "paper_title": "Capturing Router Congestion and Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000267379400009"}
