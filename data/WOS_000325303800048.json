In particular, Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Networks (CTRNNs) are evolved for odor source localization in simulated turbulent odor plumes. In the experiments, the simulated robot is equipped with a single chemical sensor and a wind direction sensor. Three main contributions are made. First, it is shown that the ER approach can be successfully applied to odor source localization in both low-turbulent and high-turbulent conditions. Second, it is demonstrated that a small neural network is able to successfully perform all three sub-tasks of odor source localization: (i) finding the odor plume, (ii) moving toward the odor source, and (iii) identifying the odor source. Third, the analysis of the evolved behaviors reveals two novel odor source localization strategies. These strategies are successfully re-implemented as finite state machines, validating the insights from the analysis of the neural controllers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
