After a normalization step, the triangle mesh is calibrated by one step of Laplacian smoothing and then a feature vector is computed, encoding geometric information corresponding to vertices, edges and faces. For a given steganographic or watermarking algorithm, we create a training set containing unmarked meshes and meshes marked by that algorithm, and train a classifier using Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on six well-known watermarking/steganographic schemes with satisfactory accuracy rates.", "paper_title": "Mesh Discriminative Features for 3D Steganalysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000334583800005"}
