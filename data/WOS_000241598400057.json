If we present to an associative memory (AM) an image we would expect that the AM would respond with something that describes the content of the image; for example, if the image contains a tiger we would expect that the AM would respond with the word \"tiger\". In order to achieve this goal, we first chose a set of images. Each image is next associated to the word that better describes the content of the image. With this information an AM is trained as in [10]. We then use the AM to categorize instances of images with the same content even if these images are distorted by some kind of noise. The accuracy of the proposal is tested using a set of images containing different species of flowers and animals.", "paper_title": "Associative memories applied to image categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400057"}
