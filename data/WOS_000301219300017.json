The time-varying property of industrial processes requires the adaptive ability of the PCA. This paper introduces a novel PCA algorithm, named on-line PCA (OLPCA). It updates the PCA model according to the process status. The approximate linear dependence (ALD) condition is used to check each new sample. A recursive algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the PCA model with selected samples. Three types of experiments, a synthetic data, a benchmark problem, and a ball mill load experimental data, are used to illustrate our modeling method. The results show that the proposed OLPCA is computationally faster, and the modeling accuracy is higher than conventional moving window PCA (MWPCA) and recursive PCA (RPCA) for time-varying process modeling.
