In this paper, we first present an architecture for service management in networks based on service level specifications (SLS). The architecture is designed to be independent both of the specific network technology adopted and of the high level service semantics. Then, we focus on a specific functionality of the proposed architecture: Resource allocation in the multi-domain scenario. A distributed admission control algorithm is introduced, its complexity is evaluated and a comparison with related solutions is provided.", "paper_title": "Resource allocation in multi-domain networks based on service level specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000236748800012"}
