Studying thiopeptide (e.g. thiostrepton) binding to the GAR's 23S center dot L11 ribosomal subunit using docking methods is challenging. Regarding the target, the binding site is composed of a flexible protein-RNA nonbonded interface whose available crystal structure is of medium resolution. Regarding the ligands, the thiopeptides are chemically complex, flexible, and contain macrocycles. In this study we developed a combined MD-docking-MD workflow that allows us to study thiopeptide-23S center dot L11 binding. It is shown that docking thiostrepton-like ligands to an MD-refined receptor structure instead of the medium resolution crystal leads to better convergence to the native-like docking pose and a better reproduction of experimental binding affinities. By applying an energy decomposition analysis, we identify key structural binding elements within GAR's rRNA-protein binding site and within the ligand structures.", "paper_title": "Structure-activity relationships of thiostrepton derivatives: implications for rational drug design", "paper_id": "WOS:000345590200004"}
