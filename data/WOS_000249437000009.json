The authors consider an approach in which every Web service provider offers a Web service registry news channel that serves as part of a globally distributed registry. They also apply this approach to a real-world case study. Their future plans include providing a Web service aggregator that offers additional metadata for Web service descriptions, which users could generate as they rate the services they rate the services they use.", "paper_title": "Active web service registries", "paper_id": "WOS:000249437000009"}
