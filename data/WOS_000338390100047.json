By allowing the co-positive type Lyapunov Krasovskii functional to increase during the running time of active subsystems, a new stability criterion for the underlying system with MDADT is first derived. Then, the obtained results are extended to study the issue of asynchronous L-1 control, where \"asynchronous\" means that the switching of the controllers has a lag with respect to that of system modes. Sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable and has an L-1-gain performance. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the developed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
