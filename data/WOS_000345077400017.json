Such models provide information about the power consumption behavior of workloads prior to running them. Power consumption depends on the characteristics of both the machine and the workload. However, combinational features such as the cache miss rate cannot be considered due to their unavailability before running the workload. Therefore, pre-execution power modeling requires both machine-independent workload characteristics and workload-independent machine characteristics. In this paper the predictive modeling problem is tackled by the proposal of a two-stage modeling framework. In the first stage, a machine learning approach is taken to predict single-threaded workload power consumption at a specific frequency. The second stage analytically scales this output to any intended thread/frequency configuration. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can yield highly accurate predictions about workload power consumption with an average error of 3.7 % on six different test platforms.", "paper_title": "Pre-execution power consumption prediction of computational multithreaded workloads", "paper_id": "WOS:000345077400017"}
