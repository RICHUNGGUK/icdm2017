In this paper, we select a sample of the various types of standard hydraulic cylinders. Each cylinder's near-optimal processing time and the processing order of the cylinder's parts are investigated using two different techniques. First, we study typical procedures, known as 'Dispatching Rules', which would be used in a job shop to resolve scheduling problems. Second, we investigate another kind of technique, called 'Genetic Algorithms'. The goal of this paper, we show that efficient scheduling solutions are calculated by using dispatching rules and genetic algorithms for manufacturing standard hydraulic cylinders, and we propose that a way to use dispatching rules in association with genetic algorithms should be considered for resolving job shop scheduling problems.", "paper_title": "A comparison of dispatching rules and genetic algorithms for job shop schedules of standard hydraulic cylinders", "paper_id": "WOS:000249312300003"}
