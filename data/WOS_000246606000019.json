The elliptical class provides a useful generalization of the normal model since it covers both light- and heavy-tailed distributions for the errors, such as Student-t, power exponential, contaminated normal, among others. It is well known that elliptical models with longer-than-normal tails may present robust parameter estimates against outlying observations. However, little has been investigated on the robustness aspects of the parameter estimates against perturbation schemes. We use appropriate derivative operators to express the normal curvatures in tractable forms for any correlation structure. Estimation procedures for the position and variance-covariance parameters are also presented. A data set previously analyzed under a normal linear mixed model is reanalyzed under elliptical models. Local influence graphics are used to select less sensitive models with respect to some perturbation schemes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
