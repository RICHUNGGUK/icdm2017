Agent and multi-agent system can be used to model real systems in complex and dynamic environments. However, most of them assume that there is no uncertain and fuzzy information in an agent's mental state and environment. In this paper, we remove this unrealistic assumption and propose a new agent programming language which allows agent programs to effectively perform with fuzzy knowledge under uncertain environment, and to dynamically adapt with changes of the environment. This language presents a new and practical approach to solve fuzzy constraints in uncertain environment which consists of three components for programming agent: uncertain belief updating, goal selection and revision and uncertain practical reasoning.", "paper_title": "Agent-oriented probabilistic logic programming with fuzzy constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100076"}
