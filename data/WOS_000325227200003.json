Our comparator exploits a novel scalable parallel prefix structure that leverages the comparison outcome of the most significant bit, proceeding bitwise toward the least significant bit only when the compared bits are equal. This method reduces dynamic power dissipation by eliminating unnecessary transitions in a parallel prefix structure that generates the N-bit comparison result after inverted right perpendicularlog(4) Ninverted left perpendicular + inverted right perpendicularlog(16) Ninverted left perpendicular + 4 CMOS gate delays. Our comparator is composed of locally interconnected CMOS gates with a maximum fan-in and fan-out of five and four, respectively, independent of the comparator bitwidth. The main advantages of our design are high speed and power efficiency, maintained over a wide range. Additionally, our design uses a regular reconfigurable VLSI topology, which allows analytical derivation of the input-output delay as a function of bitwidth. HSPICE simulation for a 64-b comparator shows a worst case input-output delay of 0.86 ns and a maximum power dissipation of 7.7 mW using 0.15-mu m TSMC technology at 1 GHz.", "paper_title": "Scalable Digital CMOS Comparator Using a Parallel Prefix Tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000325227200003"}
