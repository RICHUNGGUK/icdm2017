However, existing algorithms only consider the impact of mechanical strain in cell placement of flexible TFT circuits. Without taking temperature into consideration, mobility may be dramatically decreased which leads to circuit performance degradation. This article presents the first work to minimize the mobility variation caused by the change of both mechanical strain and temperature. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively and efficiently reduce the increasing critical path delay.", "paper_title": "Placement Optimization of Flexible TFT Circuits with Mechanical Strain and Temperature Consideration", "paper_id": "WOS:000343424100001"}
