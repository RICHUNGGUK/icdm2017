Each scheme exploits selected embedded structures. The research objective is to enhance the rate of DWD convergence in application to PADS through formulating a rationale for decomposition by analyzing potential schemes, adopting acceleration techniques, and assessing the impacts of schemes and techniques computationally. Test results provide insights that may be relevant to other applications of DWD.
