Thus, how to efficiently utilize the capacity of CDN (e.g., which peers receive services from the CDN nodes) is a problem of practical significance. Existing solutions adopt a passive, on-demand approach, which is inefficient in utilizing CDN resources. In this paper, we propose PROSE, a simple, novel scheme to achieve proactive, selective CDN participation for P2P streaming. PROSE introduces novel concepts such as choke point expansion nodes/super nodes and leads to efficient, light-weighted, and distributed algorithms to identify and serve these nodes using CDN. Our experimental results show that PROSE achieves at least 10%similar to 25% performance improvement and 2 similar to 4 times overhead reduction compared with existing general CDN-P2P-hybrid schemes.", "paper_title": "PROSE: Proactive, Selective CDN Participation for P2P Streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000318509400015"}
