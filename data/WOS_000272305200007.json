The initial description of the particle is assumed in the digital (voxel based) representation obtained (after appropriate processing) from computer tomography or magnetic resonance tomography. A smooth representation of the particle is derived from the digital description using the spherical harmonic analysis. The smooth surface of the aggregate particle is then subjected to the triangulation using the advancing front technique performed directly on the surface in the real space. This boundary mesh then serves as an input for the tetrahedrization, also based on the advancing front technique, of the particle itself and/or of the domain surrounding the particle.
