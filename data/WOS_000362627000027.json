Firstly, some notions are extended to fuzzy differential equations with the second type of Hukuhara derivative. Then with the help of Lyapunov-like functions, sufficient conditions are established for practical stability and practical quasi-stability for a class of fuzzy differential equations with the second type of Hukuhara derivative, respectively. Also, a comparison principle is derived which connects the practical stability relationships between fuzzy differential equations with the second type of Hukuhara derivative and scalar differential equations Finally some examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.", "paper_title": "Practical stability of fuzzy differential equations with the second type of Hukuhara derivative", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627000027"}
