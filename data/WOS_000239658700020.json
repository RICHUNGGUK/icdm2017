A Markovian queue with a number of servers depending upon queue length and finite capacity is discussed. The data of interarrival time and service times of requests are collected by observing a queuing system. An empirical Bayesian method is then applied to estimate the traffic intensity of the system, which denotes the need for host computers. The mean number of transfer requests in the system and the queue length of transfer requests are calculated as the characteristic values of the system.", "paper_title": "Optimizing the profit of on-demand multimedia service via a server-dependent queuing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700020"}
