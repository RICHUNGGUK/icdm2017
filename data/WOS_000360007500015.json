These large and high-dimensional datasets are usually characterized by an inherent sparseness. Hence, analyzing these datasets to figure out interesting and hidden knowledge is a challenging task. This article proposes a new data mining framework based on generalized association rules to discover multiple-level correlations among patient data. Specifically, correlations among prescribed examinations, drugs, and patient profiles are discovered and analyzed at different abstraction levels. The rule extraction process is driven by a taxonomy to generalize examinations and drugs into their corresponding categories. To ease the manual inspection of the result, a worthwhile subset of rules (i.e., nonredundant generalized rules) is considered. Furthermore, rules are classified according to the involved data features (medical treatments or patient profiles) and then explored in a top-down fashion: from the small subset of high-level rules, a drill-down is performed to target more specific rules. The experiments, performed on a real diabetic patient dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in discovering interesting rule groups at different abstraction levels.", "paper_title": "MeTA: Characterization of Medical Treatments at Different Abstraction Levels", "paper_id": "WOS:000360007500015"}
