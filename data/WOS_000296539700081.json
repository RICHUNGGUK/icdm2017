The proposed method finds the parameters of the output functions that produce such motion in the closed-loop system which fulfill the requirements of stability and minimal energy control by formulating a constrained optimization problem. A set of parameters which produces periodic motions with low energy control magnitudes and its closed-loop system trajectories are shown through a numerical study case of a 3-DOF biped robot.
