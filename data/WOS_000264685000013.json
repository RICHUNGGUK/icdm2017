A new aspect, presented in this paper, is the dependence on the cell geometry: applied on a triangular grid, the accuracy problem disappears, i.e. flows of arbitrarily small Mach numbers can be simulated on a fixed mesh. We give an asymptotic analysis of this, up to date unknown, phenomenon for the first-order Roe scheme and present a number of numerical results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
