We consider changes in pore volume from dissolution caused by chemical reactions, in addition to coupled flow and geomechanics. Moreover, we use the constitutive equations for the multiple porosity model for fractured geothermal reservoirs, employing failure-dependent permeability dynamically and updating it every time step. The proposed sequential algorithm is an extension of the fixed-stress split method to chemo-thermo-poro-mechanics, facilitating the use of existing flow-reactive transport and geomechanics simulators. We first validate a simulator that employs the proposed sequential algorithm, matching the numerical solutions with the analytical solutions such as Terzaghi's and Mandel's problems for poro-mechanics and the reference solutions of chemo-poro-mechanics and chemo-thermo-poro-mechanics in the ID elastic problems. We also perform convergence test, and the proposed algorithm shows fast convergence, when full iteration is taken, and first order accuracy in time for the staggered approach. We then investigate two test cases: 2D multiple porosity elastic and 3D single porosity elastoplastic problems, and explore the differences in coupled flow and geomechanics with and without reactive transport. We find that the change in pore-volume induced by mineral dissolution can impact on fluid pressure and failure status, followed by significant changes in permeability and flow variables, showing strong interrelations between flow-reactive transport and geomechanics.
