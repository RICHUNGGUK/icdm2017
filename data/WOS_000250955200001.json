The proposed scheme has great capacity to transmit the messages since the utilized SQC can encode more than one qubit of the secret message in the message transmission phase for one scheme run. By utilizing the syndromes of the destroyed qubits, the damaged states can be exactly recovered from the received travel photons, which means that the scheme can be implemented in the imperfect channel with high fidelity.", "paper_title": "Deterministic quantum key distribution using stabilizer quantum code", "paper_id": "WOS:000250955200001"}
