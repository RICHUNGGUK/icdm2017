After the lightning events are detected by the lightning detection network, the original detection data need to be collected and concentrated rapidly and timely for unified management and processing. In this paper, an online monitoring and transmission system for lightning detection information is presented. The system consists of two major components: the remote monitoring module and the response & transmission module. File system watcher (FSW) tool and the trigger mechanism are applied to the remote monitoring module to watch the generation of lightning detection data both in file directory or database. And then the newest origin detection data can be transmitted to the detection center of the lightning detection network by the response & transmit module based on the communication network. The proposed system is developed and exemplified in Wuhan lightning detection network, China. The application results indicates that the system is reliable and reasonable in the online monitoring and transmission for lightning detection data, which can provide a strong support to the lightning detection network.", "paper_title": "Online Monitoring and Transmission System for Lightning Detection Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000366996500002"}
