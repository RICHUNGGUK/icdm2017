FastME is such an approach that uses the balanced minimum evolution (BME) principle, which computer studies have demonstrated to have high accuracy. FastME includes two variants: balanced subtree prune and regraft (BSPR) and balanced nearest neighbor interchange (BNNI). These algorithms take as input a distance matrix and a putative phylogenetic tree. The tree is modified using SPR or NNI operations, respectively, to reduce the BME length relative to the distance matrix until a tree with (locally) shortest BME length is found. Following computer simulations, it has been conjectured that BSPR and BNNI are consistent, i.e., for an input distance that is a tree metric, they converge to the corresponding tree. We prove that the BSPR algorithm is consistent. Moreover, even if the input contains small errors relative to a tree metric, we show that the BSPR algorithm still returns the corresponding tree. Whether BNNI is consistent remains open.", "paper_title": "Consistency of Topological Moves Based on the Balanced Minimum Evolution Principle of Phylogenetic Inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000262853400014"}
