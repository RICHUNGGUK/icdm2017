Policies representing resource access based on knowledge-oriented descriptions have gained momentum with the emergence of semantic technologies. Traditional access control frameworks were syntactic and error prone, lacking the necessary expressivity and efficiency of a solution where soundness and completeness of the underlying logics in access control descriptions could be critical to harness their potential. In this paper, SecurOntology is presented. SecurOntology encompasses a three-fold strategy: an ontology for access control, a logical declarative framework and a software architecture as a proof-of-concept of the advantages of this solution. 0 2009 Elsevier B.V.
