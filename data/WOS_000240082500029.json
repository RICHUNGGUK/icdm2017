The goal of this paper is to estimate the relative error produced by this algorithm being applied to random 3-CNFs with fixed density rho. We prove that, for any rho, there is a constant c such that a weakened version of Local Search that we call One-Pass Local Search almost surely outputs an assignment containing cn + o(n) unsatisfied clauses. Then using a certain assumption we also show this for Local Search. Although the assumption remains unproved the results well matches experiments.", "paper_title": "Efficiency of Local Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000240082500029"}
