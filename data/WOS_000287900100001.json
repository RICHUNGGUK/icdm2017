The intention of the project was to enable a usage of shared materials for software engineering courses at wide range of universities in countries participating in the project. During school year 2004/2005: for the first time the same course; with the same case study; and the same assignments; have been conducted at the Humboldt University Berlin and University of Novi Sad. In this article, we share some of the experiences obtained during conducting the same course for the last several school years. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
