Supplier evaluation and order allocation are complex, multi criteria decisions. Initially, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model is developed for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of suppliers. Based on these evaluations, a goal programming (GP) model is developed for order allocation among suppliers. The models are integrated into a DSS that provides a dynamic, flexible and fast decision making environment. The DSS environment is tested at the purchasing department of a manufacturer and feedbacks are obtained. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
