Because of the limited energy in each sensor node, energy efficiency problem is crucial to be considered in information centric sensor network. In this paper, we cope with the energy efficient management problem in such network, in which both transmission energy and caching energy are considered. We derive the exact analytical expression for the energy consumption model in such network and propose cooperative energy efficient management scheme for multimedia information dissemination. We carry out extensive performance evaluations and our results show that the energy consumption can be minimized by cooperatively tuning the key parameters such as the cache size and caching probability.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Energy Efficient Management Scheme for Multimedia Information Dissemination", "paper_id": "WOS:000331764100001"}
