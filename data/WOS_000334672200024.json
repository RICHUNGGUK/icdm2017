These services are supported by infrastructure known as Internet data center (IDC). As demand for cloud computing services soars, energy consumed by IDCs is skyrocketing. Both academia and industry have paid great attention to energy management of IDCs. This paper studies an important energy management problem-how to minimize energy cost for IDCs in deregulated electricity markets. We propose a novel two-stage design and the eco-IDC (Energy Cost Optimization-IDC) algorithm to exploit the temporal diversity of electricity price and dynamically schedule workload to execute on IDC servers through an input queue. Extensive evaluation experiments are performed using real-life electricity price and workload traces at an enterprise production data center. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy cost for IDCs, guarantees a service delay bound, and alleviates workload drop if the service delay bound is sufficiently large.", "paper_title": "Temporal Load Balancing with Service Delay Guarantees for Data Center Energy Cost Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000334672200024"}
