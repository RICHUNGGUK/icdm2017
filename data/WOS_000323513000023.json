Namely, for any instance where a minimum spanning tree of the set of stations is guaranteed to cost at most rho >= 2 times the cost of an optimal solution for MEBR, we prove that our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio bounded by 2ln rho - 2ln 2 + 2. This result is particularly relevant for its consequences on Euclidean instances where we significantly improve previous results. In this respect, our experimental analysis confirms the better performance of the algorithm also in practice.", "paper_title": "An Exponential Improvement on the MST Heuristic for Minimum Energy Broadcasting in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000323513000023"}
