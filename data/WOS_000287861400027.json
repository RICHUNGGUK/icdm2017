This class can be useful in situations where some new better than used aging classes fail. Some properties are presented including the relationship of this class to other aging classes, and the preservation properties under some reliability operations. Finally, we discuss testing exponentially against this class, and apply this test to some data sets in the context of reliability.", "paper_title": "Starshaped Ordering of Life Distributions and Its Aging Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000287861400027"}
