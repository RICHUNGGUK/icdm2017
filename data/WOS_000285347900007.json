Some local polynomial smoothers or local likelihood estimators have been proposed to improve on the histogram, which would produce too many zero values. We propose a relativized local polynomial smoothing for this problem, weighting heavier the estimating errors in small probability cells. A simulation study about the estimators that are proposed show a good behaviour with respect to natural error criteria, especially when dealing with sparse observations.", "paper_title": "Relative smoothing of discrete distributions with sparse observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000285347900007"}
