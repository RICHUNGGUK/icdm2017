The scattering properties of each grating are calculated using an efficient finite element method (FEM) and allow the complete mode structure to be derived from a transfer matrix method. A range of numerical examples showing the accuracy, flexibility and utility of the method is presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
