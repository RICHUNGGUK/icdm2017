By means of a large soil container with Ductseal lining and an in-box shake-table system, a series of seismic tests on a sand stratum model of uniform density and a large width-to-depth ratio was conducted at multiple g-levels. With a focus on the vertical motion produced. the time-domain data was processed using the transfer function approach. By examining the measured resonant regimes for the vertical mode as a function of the g-level or length scale over the frequency spectrum, the capability of the Ductseal boundary approach in simulating vertical free-field motions in one-dimensional inhomogeneous site response theory is highlighted. In seeking a comprehensive basis of synthesis for the modeling methodology, the benefits of using the three-dimensional elastodynamic model in the interpretation of the vertical free-field measurements are demonstrated.
