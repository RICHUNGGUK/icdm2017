On the basis of the obtained stability condition, a static output feedback controller is designed by applying an iterative algorithm. A numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "MODELING AND STABILIZATION OF MIMO NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH NETWORK CONSTRAINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400011"}
