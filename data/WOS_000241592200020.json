Secure Global State Routing Protocol (SGSR) proposed here defines some rules to ensure secure neighbor discovery. Priority is introduced to prevent denial of service attacks. SGSR also can limit the packet in a certain area. So it can be employed as a stand-alone protocol, or fit naturally into a hybrid routing framework. This paper provides formal analysis to illuminate that SGSR is robust against individual attackers. The simulation result shows that the efficiency and the cost of the protocol are in an acceptable scope after adding the secure mechanisms.", "paper_title": "A secure global state routing for mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241592200020"}
