Such an expression is then specialized for systems with norm-based distances and for systems with quantized norm-based distance. Examples for scalar products and sup-norm are derived. When appticable, invariances with respect to the underlying distance and entities density are highlighted. Dimensionality effects are investigated.", "paper_title": "On the nearest neighbor of the nearest neighbor in multidimensional continuous and quantized space", "paper_id": "WOS:000258913400013"}
