Formula of size m on n Boolean variables are chosen uniformly at random from among all ((n(n-1))(m)) possible choices. When c < 1/2 and as n tends to infinity, the probability p(n, m = cn) that a random 2-XOR formula is satisfiable, tends to the threshold function exp(c/2) . (1 - 2c)(1/4). This gives the asymptotic behavior of random 2-XOR formula in the SAT/UNSAT subcritical phase transition. In this paper, we first prove that the error term in this subcritical region is O(n(-1)). Then, in the critical region c = 1/2, we prove that p(n, n/2) = Theta(n(-1/12)). Our study relies on the symbolic method and analytical tools coming from generating function theory which also enable us to describe the evolution of n(1/12) p(n, n/2(1 + mu n(-1/3))) as a function of mu. Thus, we propose a complete picture of the finite size scaling associated to the subcritical and critical regions of 2-XORSAT transition.", "paper_title": "Random 2 XORSAT Phase Transition", "paper_id": "WOS:000286525300005"}
