The central idea is to modify the neighborhood preserving embedding by maximizing the maximum margin distance while preserving the geometric structure of the manifold. Experimental results conducted on the ORL database, the Yale database and the VALID face database indicate the effectiveness of the proposed MMNPE. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
