The rough set approach introduced by Zdzislaw Pawlak provides a ground for concluding to what degree a particular set of similar image segments is a part of a set of image segments representing a norm or standard. The number of features (color difference and overlap between segments) typically used to solve the image segment matching problem is small. This means that there is not enough information to permit image segment matching with high accuracy. By contrast, many more features can be used in solving the image segment matching problem using a combination of evolutionary and rough set methods. Several different uses of a Darwinian form of a genetic algorithm (GA) are introduced as a means to partition large collections of image segments into blocks of similar image segments. After filtering, the output of a CA provides a basis for finding matching segments in the context of an approximation space. A coverage form of approximation space is presented in this article. Such an approximation space makes it possible to measure the the extent that a set of image segments representing a standard covers CA-produced blocks. The contribution of this article is the introduction of an approach to matching image segments in the context of an approximation space.", "paper_title": "Matching 2D image segments with genetic algorithms and approximation spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000242418100004"}
