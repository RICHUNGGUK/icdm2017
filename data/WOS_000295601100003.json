Although a 2D nonseparable lifting structure of 9/7 DWT has been proposed by interchanging some lifting, we generalize a polyphase representation of 2D non-separable lifting structure of DWT. Furthermore, by introducing the adaptive directional filteringingto the generalized structure, the 2D non-separable ADL structure is realized and applied into image coding. Our proposed method is simpler than the ID ADL, and can select the different transforming direction with ID ADL. Through the simulations, the proposed method is shown to be efficient for the lossy and lossless image coding performance.", "paper_title": "Two Dimensional Non-separable Adaptive Directional Lifting Structure of Discrete Wavelet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000295601100003"}
