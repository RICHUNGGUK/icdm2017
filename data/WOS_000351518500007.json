Our approach utilizes a simple observation that, by human design, objects in static scenes should be stable in the gravity field and be safe with respect to various physical disturbances such as human activities. This assumption is applicable to all scene categories and poses useful constraints for the plausible interpretations (parses) in scene understanding. Given a 3D point cloud captured for a static scene by depth cameras, our method consists of three steps: (i) recovering solid 3D volumetric primitives from voxels; (ii) reasoning stability by grouping the unstable primitives to physically stable objects by optimizing the stability and the scene prior; and (iii) reasoning safety by evaluating the physical risks for objects under physical disturbances, such as human activity, wind or earthquakes. We adopt a novel intuitive physics model and represent the energy landscape of each primitive and object in the scene by a disconnectivity graph (DG). We construct a contact graph with nodes being 3D volumetric primitives and edges representing the supporting relations. Then we adopt a Swendson-Wang Cuts algorithm to partition the contact graph into groups, each of which is a stable object. In order to detect unsafe objects in a static scene, our method further infers hidden and situated causes (disturbances) in the scene, and then introduces intuitive physical mechanics to predict possible effects (e.g., falls) as consequences of the disturbances. In experiments, we demonstrate that the algorithm achieves a substantially better performance for (i) object segmentation, (ii) 3D volumetric recovery, and (iii) scene understanding with respect to other state-of-the-art methods. We also compare the safety prediction from the intuitive mechanics model with human judgement.", "paper_title": "Scene Understanding by Reasoning Stability and Safety", "paper_id": "WOS:000351518500007"}
