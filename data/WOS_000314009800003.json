In order to provide data for developing a new simplified calculation method for fire design of HEA, HEB and HEM steel columns with restrained thermal elongation a parametric study using the advanced calculation model ABAQUS, was carried out. This method was established taking into account the axial and rotational restraint to the column in case of fire, the column slenderness and the load level. The critical times and temperatures can be obtained directly from formulae. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
