The pulse-voltammetric method is used to capture the electroanalytical/electrochemical characteristics of the sampled mineral waters by considering a real model for the liquid-electrode interface in a given e-tongue apparatus. Then the cross-correlation coefficients between the output and input signals are determined. Both PCA and Sammon's NLM create a subspace from high-dimensional mineral water data by considering the principal eigenvectors and minimising the stress function, respectively. The proposed cross-correlation-based PCA and Sammon's classifiers establish the highest separation distance among the investigated water brands and carries out the authentication of more than one unknown sample of the same brand with a certain degree of variability with respect to their sources.
