This poses great challenges to ensuring security through cryptography. Recently, cooperative jamming has been proved as a promising physical layer technique to provide the everlasting security for wireless networks. Based on this scheme, this paper proposes a two-hop transmission protocol with parameters l, k, r and tau (2HR-(l, k,r, tau)) to ensure secure and reliable big data transmissions in wireless networks with multiple eavesdroppers. We first determine the relay selection region (RSR) as the square of side-length I centered at the middle point between the source and the destination. Then one of the k best relays located in the RSR is randomly selected as the message relay. During the forwarding in both hops, the remaining relays at least distance r away from the intended receivers and with channel gain to the intended receivers less than tau are selected to generate jamming signals to confuse the eavesdroppers. The results in this paper indicate that our protocol can provide flexible control of security, reliability and the energy balance performance, which characterizes how energy consumption for forwarding message is balanced among all the relays.
