Its performance depends on the selection of kernels. In this paper, we consider the problem of multiple kernel learning (MKL) for RKDA, in which the optimal kernel matrix is obtained as a linear combination of pre-specified kernel matrices. We show that the kernel learning problem in RKDA can be formulated as convex programs. First, we show that this problem can be formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP). Based on the equivalence relationship between RKDA and least square problems in the binary-class case, we propose a convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) formulation for kernel learning in RKDA. A semi-infinite linear programming (SILP) formulation is derived to further improve the efficiency. We extend these formulations to the multi-class case based on a key result established in this paper. That is, the multi-class RKDA kernel learning problem can be decomposed into a set of binary-class kernel learning problems which are constrained to share a common kernel. Based on this decomposition property, SDP formulations are proposed for the multi-class case. Furthermore, it leads naturally to QCQP and SILP formulations. As the performance of RKDA depends on the regularization parameter, we show that this parameter can also be optimized in a joint framework with the kernel. Extensive experiments have been conducted and analyzed, and connections to other algorithms are discussed.", "paper_title": "Multi-class discriminant kernel learning via convex programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000256642100007"}
