Then only the cooperation of all the signers in the proxy group can generate the proxy signatures on behalf of the original signer. Plenty of multi-proxy signature schemes have been proposed under the certificate-based public key systems. Due to the various applications of the bilinear pairings in cryptography, many identity-based signature schemes have been proposed. In this paper, we give the first formal definition and security model of an identity-based multi-proxy signature scheme, then propose an identity-based multi-proxy signature scheme from bilinear pairings and prove its security in our security model.
