Using these methods, the treatment and discharge of wastewater in large waterbodies (estuaries, rivers, lakes ...) - one of the essential problems in environmental management - can be analyzed in order to avoid the usual controversy between economic and ecological interests. In this article we present a decision support software system referred to as Simulating Optimal Solutions (SOS). Software SOS is a Matlab toolbox (interfaced with Fortran codes for mathematical computation of hydrodynamics and contaminant dispersion) to assess in decision making related to treatment intensity in different purifying plants. The program allows a flexible analysis both from a cooperative viewpoint (Pareto optimality) and a non-cooperative one (Nash equilibria). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
