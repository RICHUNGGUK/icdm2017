This ILFD proposes a novel injection scheme that shapes the injection signal to a proper form and provides a convenient situation for divider locking. Furthermore, two new wide locking range, low power consumption, injection locked ring oscillators (ILROs) are proposed for quadrature generation in local oscillator architectures. A novel cognitive radio quadrature local oscillator (LO) architecture is presented by utilizing the proposed ILFDs and ILROs to verify the effectiveness of the proposed circuits. Moreover, a new technique is implemented on the LO architecture to widen the frequency range without consuming any extra power. Because of using a single LC tank, this architecture is very compact. Also, it has the benefit of low power consumption and low output phase noise.", "paper_title": "An LO architecture with novel wide locking range, quadrature output RILFDs and ILROs for cognitive radio applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000342079400016"}
