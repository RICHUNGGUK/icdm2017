The relative gas pressure and the electrode gap spacing are varied within the range of 100-500 kPa and of 5-15 mm, respectively. The results are first measured experimentally and then estimated by means of Feedforward Neural Network Approach. The comparisons of measured and computed values show that there is a good agreement between two Values. The breakdown voltages of the mixtures can be found correctly by the Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) approach. Therefore, the Feed-Forward Neural Network Approach can be considered an alternative tool to estimate the new values in or out of the measurement range.", "paper_title": "Neural networks for breakdown voltage estimation of various gas mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000262247700001"}
