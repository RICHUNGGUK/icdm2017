It may he the case that we have only chances for a unique experiment or no similar experiences are available, but it may be also the case that no standard experiment allows the observation of such a good behavior. simply because Such good behavior can not be properly defined, in terms of standard crisp experiments. This situation is quite often associated to complex decision making problems, Then the only support we can find for our decision is the decision process itself, i.e., the consistency of the arguments leading to such a decision. Checking the quality of such a procedure becomes in this framework a key issue. Since specification is being quite often poorly defined, we Postulate that the design and formal specification of algorithms and processes require a fuzzy approach.", "paper_title": "Formal Specification under Fuzziness", "paper_id": "WOS:000266509100007"}
