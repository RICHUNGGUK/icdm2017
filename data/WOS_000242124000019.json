We deal with a wide class of the partial monitoring problems: the combination of the label efficient and multi-armed bandit problem, that is, where the algorithm is only informed about the performance of the chosen expert with probability epsilon <= 1. For bounded losses an algorithm is given whose expected regret scales with the square root of the loss of the best expert. For unbounded losses we prove that Hannan consistency can be achieved, depending on the growth rate of the average squared losses of the experts.", "paper_title": "Hannan consistency in on-line learning in case of unbounded losses under partial monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000242124000019"}
