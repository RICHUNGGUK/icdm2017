Our strategy, SURF, classifies the available channels and uses them efficiently to increase data dissemination reliability in multi-hop cognitive radio networks. The classification is done on the basis of primary radio unoccupancy and of the number of cognitive radio neighbors using the channels. Through extensive NS-2 simulations, we study the performance of SURF compared to four related approaches. Simulation results confirm that our approach is effective in selecting the best channels for efficient communication (in terms of less primary radio interference) and for highest dissemination reachability in multi-hop cognitive radio networks.
