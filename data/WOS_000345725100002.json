In the early 1980s, Jan Heering and Paul Klint envisioned complete language specifications as libraries of reusable individual constructs, supported by a generic programming environment. This led to the development of the ASF+SDF specification language and its Meta-Environment. This paper first recalls how programming languages can be specified in ASF+SDF. It then analyses the apparent difficulty of reusing the specifications of individual constructs, and considers some alternative styles of semantics that have been supported using ASF+SDF and its Meta-Environment. It is suggested that these alternative styles could facilitate reuse when specifying programming languages in RASCAL, which has superseded ASF+SDF. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
