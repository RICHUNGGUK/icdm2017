In a queue fed by burst flows, the impact of flow dynamics over shorter timescales on the mean buffer length can be separated from the impact of flow dynamics over larger timescales. A queue with multiple inputs can be decomposed into multiple simpler queues and the two systems have the same mean buffer length. This study may find applications in fast evaluation and resource management of computer networks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
