It integrates several technologies related with data acquisition, visual analysis tools, communication protocols, and data storage. Moreover, hierarchical semantic representations are included in the framework to describe the application domain, the analysis capabilities, and the user preferences. The automatic determination of the analysis workflow is performed by selecting the most appropriate tools for each domain among the available ones in the framework by means of exploiting the relations between the semantic descriptions. The experimental results in the video surveillance domain demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully composes optimal workflows for video analysis applications.", "paper_title": "A semantic-guided and self-configurable framework for video analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000316361400004"}
