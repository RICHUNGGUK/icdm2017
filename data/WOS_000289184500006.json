The presence of metallic objects in human jaws, such as amalgam or gold fillings, provokes several artifacts like streaking and beam hardening which makes the reconstruction process difficult. In order to reduce these artifacts, several methods have been proposed using the raw data, directly obtained from the tomographs, in different ways. However, in DICOM-based applications this information is not available, and thus the need of a new method that handles this task in the DICOM domain. The presented method performs a morphological filtering in the polar domain yielding output images less affected by artifacts (even in cases of multiple metallic objects) without causing significant smoothing of the anatomic structures, which allows a great improvement in the 3D reconstruction. The algorithm has been automated and compared to other image denoising methods with successful results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
