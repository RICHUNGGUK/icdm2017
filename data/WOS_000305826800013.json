Computer science already has a number of useful clearly defined models of computation whose behaviors and capabilities are well understood. We should use such models as part of any definition of the term computation. However, for new domains of investigation where there are no appropriate models it may be necessary to invent new formalisms to represent the systems under study.", "paper_title": "Computation and Computational Thinking", "paper_id": "WOS:000305826800013"}
