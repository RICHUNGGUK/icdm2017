The continuous genetic algorithm (CGA) is employed to enhance its performance. Both the simulation and real-world problem results show that the proposed CGA-based FNN can obtain the relationship between fuzzy inputs and outputs. CGA can not only shorten the training time but also increase the accuracy for the FNN.
