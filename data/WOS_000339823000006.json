We discuss the Riemannian metrics that can be defined thereon, and what is known about the properties of these metrics. We put particular emphasis on the induced geodesic distance, the geodesic equation and its well-posedness, geodesic and metric completeness and properties of the curvature.", "paper_title": "Overview of the Geometries of Shape Spaces and Diffeomorphism Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000339823000006"}
