The universality of the proposed decoder is in the sense of being independent of the channel parameters, and at the same time, attaining the same random coding error exponent as the optimal maximum-likelihood decoder, which utilizes full knowledge of these unknown parameters. The proposed decoding rule can be regarded as a frequency domain version of the universal maximum mutual information decoder. Contrary to previously suggested universal decoders for ISI channels, our proposed decoding metric can easily be evaluated.", "paper_title": "Universal Decoding for Gaussian Intersymbol Interference Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000351470800006"}
