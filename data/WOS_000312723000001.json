In some of the earlier work, token based algorithms for mutual exclusion are proposed for the distributed environment assuming inverted tree topology. In a wireless setup, such a stable, hierarchical topology is quite unrealistic due to frequent link failures. The proposed token-based algorithm works for processes with assigned priorities on any directed graph topology with or without cycles. The proposed algorithm, in spite of considering priorities of processes, ensures liveness in terms of token requests from low priority processes. Moreover, the algorithm keeps control message traffic reasonably low. The simulation results exhibit the performance of the proposed algorithm under varied contexts besides presenting a comparative performance with other recent algorithms for mutual exclusion like FAPP (Fairness Algorithm for Priority Process).", "paper_title": "A New Link Failure Resilient Priority Based Fair Mutual Exclusion Algorithm for Distributed Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000312723000001"}
