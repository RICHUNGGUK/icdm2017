The motivation case is a study done on real data for a problem of bus trip time prediction. In this study we use three different training sets: all the examples, examples from past days similar to the day where prediction is needed, and examples selected by a CART regression tree. Then, we verify if the CART based example selection approach is appropriate on different regression data sets. The experimental results obtained are promising.", "paper_title": "Improving SVM-linear predictions using CART for example selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800070"}
