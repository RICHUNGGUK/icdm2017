To solve spectrum peak signal interfered by complicated noise, and to recognize irregular peak shape as well as quick monitoring, a real-time denoising and hyper-accuracy peak identification integrative approach for field mobile mass spectrometer using lifting-based wavelet transform (LWT) and Gaussian model has been developed. First, LWT was applied to eliminate the noise and to search for mass peak parameters in raw spectral peak data. Then, fitting the irregular mass peaks with Gaussian multi-peaks, a regular spectrum signal was obtained for further processing. Both of synthetic and apparatus experiment results show that LWT is a fast and effective denoising and peak identification method and retained the original peak features. The denoising effect (SNR/RMSE) by LWT was superior to Savitzky-Golay method used widely by experimental mass spectrometer, and the processing time was shortened obviously. Moreover integrated with Gaussian fitting algorithm, the peak parameters (the peak area A, centroid c, and half peak's width w) had been optimized. As the result, qualitative and quantitative accuracies of FMMS increased consequently. In addition, the approach achieved data compression. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
