As a consequence, we obtain the capacity formula for the averaged classical-quantum channels. The capacity result for compound channels demonstrates, as in the classical setting, the existence of reliable universal classical-quantum codes in scenarios where the only a priori information about the channel used for the transmission of information is that it belongs to a given set of memoryless classical-quantum channels. Our approach is based on a universal classical approximation of the quantum relative entropy which in turn relies on a universal hypothesis testing result.", "paper_title": "Classical Capacities of Compound and Averaged Quantum Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000267222000030"}
