Extended effort in early requirements gathering and analysis phases are unpopular at present, though poor requirements still impacts on IT project success. Intelligent tools may enhance these early phases but abstraction of the qualitative and wicked nature of Information Systems design problems (difficult enough for inexperienced humans) resists automation. An approach that moves from the concrete 'known' towards the abstract unknown in a prescriptive manner may be of use. This paper presents and offers the ATSA:OO methodology as a candidate for consideration as such an approach.", "paper_title": "Towards Intelligent Requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000383756800001"}
