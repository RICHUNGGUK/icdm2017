The performance of each technique is evaluated according to relevant performance metrics: acceptance rate, mean latency, and latency variance. A detailed discussion concludes that while traditional data vortex networks perform better in terms of throughput, FDL-based switching nodes have a favorable impact in reducing the system latency.
