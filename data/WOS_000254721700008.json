Given a protein, the automatic recognition of depressed regions, called pockets, on the surface of proteins is important for protein-ligand docking and facilitates fast development of new drugs. Recently, computational approaches have emerged for recognizing pockets from the geometrical point of view. Presented in this paper is a geometric method for the pocket recognition which is based on the Voronoi diagram for atoms. Given a Voronoi diagram, the proposed algorithm transforms the atomic structure to meshes which contain the information of the proximity among atoms, and then recognizes depressions on the surface of a protein using the meshes.
