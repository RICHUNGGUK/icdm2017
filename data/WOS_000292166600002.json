For this we search for similar subtrajectories. To measure spatial similarity we choose the Frechet distance and the discrete Frechet distance between subtrajectories, which are invariant under differences in speed. We give several approximation algorithms, and also show that the problem of finding the 'longest' subtrajectory cluster is as hard as MaxClique to compute and approximate.", "paper_title": "DETECTING COMMUTING PATTERNS BY CLUSTERING SUBTRAJECTORIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000292166600002"}
