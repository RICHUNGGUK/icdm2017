While reachability is decidable for these systems, equipping them with the possibility of testing regular properties on the contents of channels makes it undecidable. Decidability is preserved when only emptiness and nonemptiness tests are considered: the proof relies on an elaborate reduction to a generalized version of Post's Embedding Problem.", "paper_title": "ON REACHABILITY FOR UNIDIRECTIONAL CHANNEL SYSTEMS EXTENDED WITH REGULAR TESTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000359470700004"}
