Since this technology uses the coded communication and its communication paths are changed frequently, it is difficult to detect attacks of the hackers. In this situation, if the cyber-attack occurs between countries, there shall be a high potential for the hackers to use the anonymous network technology in order to hide themselves. Anyway, the anonymous network technology is continuously being updated by the hackers and a new technology is under development. Thus, this paper verified statistically the attacking methods which the hackers shall create by increasing the data transmission rate of TOR through manipulating the speed of the anonymous network, and proposed political countermeasures to detect hacker's attacks effectively which use this technology.", "paper_title": "New detection method and countermeasure of cyber attacks in mix networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000359864700027"}
