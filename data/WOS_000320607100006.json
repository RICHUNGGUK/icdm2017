The algorithm generates an optimized reconstruction kernel iteratively, where at each iteration the worst case error is minimized. An accurate estimate of the worst case error is available at any iteration step of the method. The proposed method, can be applied as an extension of state of the art existing methods, such as the null-field method with discrete sources. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
