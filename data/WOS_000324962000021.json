Theoretical studies show that providing incentive to the losing but competing suppliers can keep them interested to participate in future auctions thereby maintaining a healthy level of competition. We conduct web-based experiments to validate this theoretical observation in multi-attribute reverse auctions. We compare incentive-oriented and standard multi-attribute reverse auctions and demonstrate that the results in the laboratory setting corroborate the theoretical findings. Adopting incentive-oriented mechanism, the buyer is able to provide better utility to suppliers while protecting her own. We conclude that such a mechanism can reduce the negative perception of the suppliers and help build better buyer-supplier relationship in the long run. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
