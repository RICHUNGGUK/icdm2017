Concretely speaking, web pages consist of hyperlink and contents, and web images consist of the textual and visual information. In this paper, we propose a new multi-view semi-supervised learning method, named local co-training, for web page and image classification. Local co-training employs local linear models to represent data points on each view (i.e. one attribute set), and iteratively refines them using unlabelled data with co-training strategy. In each iteration, only a part of local models that we call dominant local models needs to be incrementally updated. The method is thus efficient and fit for the learning of large-scale web data. In addition, we introduce a new measurement based on both the confidence and the disagreement to describe which unlabelled examples are 'good' for the enrichment of training sets. Local co-training builds a bridge between two dominant types of semi-supervised methods: graph-based methods and co-training. Experiments on web page and web image datasets demonstrate that local co-training can effectively improve the classification performance by exploiting multiple attribute sets and unlabelled data.", "paper_title": "Web page and image semi-supervised classification with heterogeneous information fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000319292000001"}
