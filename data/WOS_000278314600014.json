Specifically, the regions of high capsule strain produced by glenohumeral joint positions commonly used during a clinical exam were identified. Kinematics that simulated a simple translation test with an anterior load at three external rotation angles were applied to a validated, subject-specific FE model of the glenohumeral joint at 60 degrees of abduction. Maximum principal strains on the glenoid side of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL) were significantly higher than the maximum principal strains on the humeral side, for all three regions of the IGHL at 30 degrees and 60 degrees of external rotation. These regions of localised strain indicate that these joint positions might be used to test the glenoid side of the IGHL during this clinical exam, but are not useful for assessing the humeral side of the IGHL. The use of FE models will facilitate the search for additional joint positions that isolate high strains to other IGHL regions, including the humeral side of the IGHL.", "paper_title": "Finite element modelling of the glenohumeral capsule can help assess the tested region during a clinical exam", "paper_id": "WOS:000278314600014"}
