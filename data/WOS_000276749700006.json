This article presents three LNA topologies including cascode, folded cascade, and differential cascode and then introduces image rejection filters for low-side and high-side injection. Then, a new method for design and optimization of the circuits based on a Pareto-based multiobjective genetic algorithm is proposed. A set of optimum device values and dimensions that best match design specifications are obtained. The optimization method is layout aware, parasitic aware, and simulation based. Circuit simulations are carried out based on TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS technology by using Hspice.
