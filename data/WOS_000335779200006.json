We give an overview of existing named entity annotation schemes, and motivate our own, which describes six main types (persons, organizations, locations, products, events and miscellaneous named entities) and finer-grained information on subtypes and metonymic usage. This was applied to a one-million-word subset of the Dutch SoNaR reference corpus. The classifier for main type named entities achieves a micro-averaged F-score of 84.91 %, and is publicly available, along with the corpus and annotations.", "paper_title": "Fine-grained Dutch named entity recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000335779200006"}
