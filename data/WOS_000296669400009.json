This feedback is used for PCN-based admission control and flow termination. While admission control is rather well understood, flow termination is a new flow control function and useful especially in case of failures or during flash crowds. We present marked flow termination as a new class of termination algorithms which terminate overload traffic gradually and that work well with multipath routing. We study their termination behavior, give recommendation for their configuration, and discuss their benefits and shortcomings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
