The main objective of this fault detection strategy is to design a system which consists of the online sensors, the SVI predicting plant and fault diagnosis method. The SVI predicting plant is designed utilizing a fuzzy neural network (FNN), which is trained by a historical set of data collected during fault-free operation of WWTP. The fault diagnosis method, based on the difference between the measured concentration values and FNN predictions, allows a quick revealing of the faults. Then this proposed fault detection method is applied to a real WWTP and compared with other approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed fault detection strategy can obtain the fault signals of the SVI sensor online. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
