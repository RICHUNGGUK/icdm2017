We consider the publications of the last decade (2000-2009) that appeared in the top conferences SIGMOD and VLDB and in the VLDBJ and TODS journals. We determine the top affiliations in terms of number of papers and aggregate the numbers at the levels of entire countries and continents. Further, we analyze to which degree authors from different affiliations and countries cooperate on jointly authored papers, and study the development over time. We also consider the number and size of affiliations of different countries.", "paper_title": "Affiliation analysis of database publications", "paper_id": "WOS:000297687700004"}
