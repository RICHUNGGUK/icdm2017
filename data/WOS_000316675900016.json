This problem has been intensively studied due to its importance to a wide range of industries where a single-stage approach is suitable for production planning. This is the case of the glass container, beer, and dairy production. Recent works have been performed by both mentioned communities, however, no intense communication between these research efforts has been observed. This work attempts a systematic analysis on recent formulation developments of both communities. Based on the result of this comparison, a reformulation is proposed that outperforms in the majority of the cases the previous existent formulations for a set of systematically generated random instances.
