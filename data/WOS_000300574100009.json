Asymmetric races are race conditions where one thread correctly acquires and releases a lock for a shared variable while another thread improperly accesses the same variable. ToleRace provides approximate isolation in the critical sections of lock-based parallel programs by creating a local copy of each shared variable when entering a critical section, operating on the local copies, and propagating the appropriate copies upon leaving the critical section. We start by characterizing all possible interleavings that can cause races and precisely describe the effect of ToleRace in each case. Then, we study the theoretical aspects of an oracle that knows exactly what type of interleaving has occurred. Finally, we present software implementations of ToleRace and evaluate them on multithreaded applications from the SPLASH2 and PARSEC suites.", "paper_title": "Efficient Runtime Detection and Toleration of Asymmetric Races", "paper_id": "WOS:000300574100009"}
