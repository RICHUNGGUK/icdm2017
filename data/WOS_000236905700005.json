One is a search for Web communities related to given keywords, and the other is a search for texts having a certain relation to given keywords. Our methods are based on both structure and contents of WWW. Our method of Web community search uses global structure of WWW to discover communities, and uses content information to label found communities, where global structure means Web graph composed of Web pages and hyperlinks between them. On the other hand, our method of related text search uses local structure of WWW to extract candidate texts, and uses content information to filter out wrongly extracted ones, where local structure means DOM-tree structure of each page. We report the latest results on these Web search methods.", "paper_title": "Specific-purpose web searches on the basis of structure and contents", "paper_id": "WOS:000236905700005"}
