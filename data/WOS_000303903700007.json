We apply it to majority functions and prove their formula size lower bounds improved from the classical result of Khrapchenko. Moreover, we introduce a notion of unbalanced recursive ternary majority functions motivated by a decomposition theory of monotone self-dual functions and give matching upper and lower bounds of their formula size. We also show monotone formula size lower bounds of balanced recursive ternary majority functions improved from the quantum adversary bound of Laplante, Lee and Szegedy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
