This paper proposed a novel probabilistic network named Bayesian-Neural Network (BNN). BNN reduces computational complexity by dividing input attribute set into two parts, each modelled by Bayesian network or Neural network. The outputs produced by different classifiers is then solved in the output space by estimating the class-conditional structural mixtures. Empirical studies on a set of natural domains show that BNN has clear advantages with respect to the generalization ability.", "paper_title": "Learning Bayesian-Neural Network from mixed-mode data", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100076"}
