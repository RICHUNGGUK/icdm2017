Even though the composite directed MRF model potentially has an exponential number of loops and becomes a context-sensitive grammar, we are nevertheless able to estimate its parameters in cubic time using an efficient modified Expectation-Maximization (EM) method, the generalized inside-outside algorithm, which extends the inside-outside algorithm to incorporate the effects of the n-gram and PLSA language models. We generalize various smoothing techniques to alleviate the sparseness of n-gram counts in cases where there are hidden variables. We also derive an analogous algorithm to find the most likely parse of a sentence and to calculate the probability of initial subsequence of a sentence, all generated by the composite language model. Our experimental results on the Wall Street Journal corpus show that we obtain significant reductions in perplexity compared to the state-of-the-art baseline trigram model with Good-Turing and Kneser-Ney smoothing techniques.", "paper_title": "EXPLOITING SYNTACTIC, SEMANTIC, AND LEXICAL REGULARITIES IN LANGUAGE MODELING VIA DIRECTED MARKOV RANDOM FIELDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000326732400004"}
