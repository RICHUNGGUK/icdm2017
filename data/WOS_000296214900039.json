Moreover, the vehicles start at the depot and terminate at one of the customers. This problem is an important variant of the classical vehicle routing problem and can cover more practical situations in transportation and logistics. We propose a multistart adaptive memory programming metaheuristic with modified tabu search algorithm to solve this new vehicle routing problem. The algorithmic efficiency and effectiveness are experimentally evaluated on a set of generated instances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
