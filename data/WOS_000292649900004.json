Compared to a conventional tripole cuff providing a single channel signal, additional information about the velocity and direction of nerve signals can be extracted from the multi-electrode recordings. Moreover, interference suppression is improved and overall power consumption reduced, as the analysis shows. In this paper a new recording system is proposed, each channel of which consists of a low-noise preamplifier employing lateral bipolar transistors to provide an impedance match to the tissue and a path to ground for the switching currents of a single high-gain amplifier, which is multiplexed between the channels. The proposed system provides low-noise, low-power operation and practically identical channel gains and is suitable for integration in a larger CMOS-based system.", "paper_title": "A low-noise front-end for multiplexed ENG recording using CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000292649900004"}
