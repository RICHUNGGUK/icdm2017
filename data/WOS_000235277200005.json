Previous results showed that the reduced order anti-windup design problem is non-convex. We propose here a convex approximation of the non-convex constraints leading to constructive design algorithms. The proposed algorithms are successfully tested on two simulation examples taken from the literature.", "paper_title": "Reduced order linear anti-windup augmentation for stable linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235277200005"}
