The rhythm span task with increasing and decreasing sequence length according to the participants' performance, measures the individual memory capacity for musical rhythms. Results show that musicians perform significantly better on the rhythm span task indicating that memory capacity for rhythms is superior after many years of formal musical training. Additionally performance correlates positively with an established pitch span task (Williamson & Stewart, 2010) as well as the five dimensions of the Gold-MSI self-report questionnaire (Mullensiefen et al., 2014) evaluating musical sophistication.", "paper_title": "The Rhythm Span Task: Comparing Memory Capacity for Musical Rhythms in Musicians and Non-Musicians", "paper_id": "WOS:000348306500002"}
