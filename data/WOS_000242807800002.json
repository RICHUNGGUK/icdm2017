With the advancement of internet technologies, customer services nowadays are supported through web-based systems. More recently, rapid development of the semantic web and semantic web services has prompted us to develop a semantic help-desk for supporting customer services over the semantic web environment, which is presented in this paper. In particular, a fuzzy formal concept analysis (FCA)-based approach is developed for automatic generation of fuzzy machine service ontology that can deal with uncertain information. The proposed automatic fuzzy ontology generation technique consists of the following steps: fuzzy formal concept analysis, fuzzy conceptual clustering, and ontology generation. As such, the supporting machine services provided by the proposed system will potentially improve customer satisfaction in terms of reducing machine down time and increasing productivity. In this paper, an experiment has also been conducted for performance evaluation. The experimental result shows that the proposed approach has attained good performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency when the queries are associated with appropriate membership values, and a suitable confident threshold is set.", "paper_title": "Automatic fuzzy ontology generation for semantic help-desk support", "paper_id": "WOS:000242807800002"}
