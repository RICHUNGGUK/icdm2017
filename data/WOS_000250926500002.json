The dominant triple HSV (Hue, Saturation, and Value), which are extracted from quantized HSV joint histogram in the image region, are used for representing color information in the image. Entropy and maximum entry from co-occurrence matrices are used for texture information and edge angle histogram is used for representing shape information. Due to its algorithmic simplicity and the several merits that facilitate the implementation of the neural network, Fuzzy ART has been exploited for image clustering. Original Fuzzy ART suffers unnecessary increase of the number of output neurons when the noise input is presented. Therefore, the improved Fuzzy ART algorithm is proposed to resolve the problem by differently updating the committed node and uncommitted node, and checking the vigilance test again. To show the validity of the proposed algorithm, experimental results on image clustering performance and comparison with original Fuzzy ART are presented in terms of recall rates.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy art-based image clustering method for content-based image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000250926500002"}
