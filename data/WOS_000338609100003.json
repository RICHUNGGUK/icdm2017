In this paper, we show acoustic feature similarity between spoken segments used with pseudo-relevance feedback and graph-based re-ranking can improve the performance of STD. This is based on the concept that spoken segments similar in acoustic feature vector sequences to those with higher/lower relevance scores should have higher/lower scores, while graph-based re-ranking further uses a graph to consider the similarity structure among all the segments retrieved in the first pass. These approaches are formulated on both word and subword lattices, and a complete framework of using them in open vocabulary retrieval of spoken content is presented. Significant improvements for these approaches with both in-vocabulary and out-of-vocabulary queries were observed in preliminary experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
