Different from conventional low-power BIST, this paper is the first to explicitly focus on achieving capture power safety with a novel and practical scheme, called capture-power-safe logic BIST (CPS-LBIST). The basic idea is to identify all possibly-erroneous test responses caused by excessive capture power and use the well-known approach of masking (bit-masking, slice-masking, vector-masking) to block them from reaching the multiple-input signature register (MISR). Experiments with large benchmark circuits and a large industrial circuit demonstrate that CPS-LBIST can achieve capture power safety with negligible impact on test quality and circuit overhead.", "paper_title": "On Achieving Capture Power Safety in At-Speed Scan-Based Logic BIST", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141100017"}
