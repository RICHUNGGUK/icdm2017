Before a reader processes packets from tags, the reader should detect the integrity of these packets. In existing research, these packets are detected by readers one by one. This process is time-consuming and impractical under some real-time scenarios. To decrease the detection time, we propose a fast radio-frequency identification batch detection protocol that is more suitable to detect whether the packets are modified by adversaries. The analysis and experimental results show that the proposed protocol has the following good properties: (i) it can detect the integrity of packets very fast; (ii) it has better performance in computational cost and storage cost of tags and servers; (iii) it can provide security protection in an efficient way.
