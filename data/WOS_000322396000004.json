Compared with the timing of rolling readout, compact readout extends the available pixel readout time by adjusting the time-domain offset between two adjacent rows and each integration time in one frame. Thus the column readout bus is working continuously rather than intermittently, which makes good use of the whole integration time and the available readout time can be extended. This dynamic range extension technology was implemented on a prototype chip with a 128 x 128 pixel array. The pixel readout time with compact readout method is almost as 3 times long as the one with rolling readout method while 39 dB dynamic range extension is achieved at 120 fps.", "paper_title": "DYNAMIC RANGE EXTENSION OF CMOS IMAGE SENSORS USING MULTI-INTEGRATION TECHNIQUE WITH COMPACT READOUT", "paper_id": "WOS:000322396000004"}
