Their applications include rigid body motion planning and computer graphics. We prove that, like classical B-spline curves, they are C(1) at knots of multiplicity at most m-1, where m is the degree. We then compute the difference between their left and right (covariant) accelerations at knots of multiplicity at most m-2. Unlike classical B-spline curves, generalised B-spline curves are not in general C(2) at such knots (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
