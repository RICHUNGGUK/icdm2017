The purpose of this paper is to use support vector regression with high dimensional model representation (SVR-HDMR) model to obtain accurate metamodels for high dimensional problems with a few sampling points. Design/methodology/approach - High-dimensional model representation (HDMR) is a general set of quantitative model assessment and analysis tools for improving the efficiency of deducing high dimensional input-output system behavior. Support vector regression (SVR) method can approximate the underlying functions with a small subset of sample points. Dividing Rectangles (DIRECT) algorithm is a deterministic sampling method. Findings - This paper proposes a new form of HDMR by integrating the SVR, termed as SVR-HDMR. And an intelligent sampling strategy, namely, DIRECT method, is adopted to improve the efficiency of SVR-HDMR. Originality/value - Compared to other metamodeling techniques, the accuracy and efficiency of SVR-HDMR were significantly improved. The SVR-HDMR helped engineers understand the essence of underlying problems visually.", "paper_title": "An adaptive SVR-HDMR model for approximating high dimensional problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000355829900005"}
