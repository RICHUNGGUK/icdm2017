The time-varying transition probabilities which evolve as a nonhomogeneous jump process are described by a polytope, and parameter-dependent and mode-dependent Lyapunov function is constructed for such system, and then a robust L-2 - L-infinity filter is designed which guarantees that the resulting error dynamic system is robustly stochastically stable and satisfies a prescribed L-2 - L-infinity performance index. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques.", "paper_title": "Robust L-2 - L-infinity filtering for a class of dynamical systems with nonhomogeneous Markov jump process", "paper_id": "WOS:000343303200003"}
