Both the numerical simulation and measurement of temperature distributions characterize the thermal features of TV panels under normal operation. Simulation results justified by experimental data verify the numerical modeling, and characterize thermal phenomena both on the panel and in the backlight unit (BLU) as well. Opening apertures on BLU provide heat dissipation on the direct-lit BLU, and effectively lower the whole temperature distribution of TFT-LCD TVs without adding extra heat dissipation modules. This leads to improve image quality on the panel. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
