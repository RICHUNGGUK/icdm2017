In this paper, we develop a simple yet robust tracking algorithm based on local structural cell graph (LSCG). This approach exploits both partial and spatial information of the target via representing the object with local structural cells (LSCs) and constructing a graph to model the spatial structure between the inner parts of the object. The tracking is formulated as matching LSCG, whose nodes are target parts and edges are the interaction between two parts. Within the Bayesian framework, we achieve object tracking by matching graphs between the reference and candidates. Eventually, the candidate with the highest similarity is the target. In addition, an updating strategy is adopted to help our tracker adapt to the fast time-varying object appearance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art trackers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
