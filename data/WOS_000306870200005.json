Bryant in 1986, that his binary decision diagram (BDD) algorithm computes any binary operation on two Boolean functions in linear time in the input-output sizes. We present Boolean functions for which the time required by Bryant's algorithm is a quadratic of the input-output sizes for all nontrivial binary operations, such as boolean AND, boolean OR, and circle plus. For the operations boolean AND and boolean OR. we show an even stronger counterexample where the output BDD size is constant, but the computation time is still a quadratic of the input BDD size. In addition, we present experimental results to support our theoretical observations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
