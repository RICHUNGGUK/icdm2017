Thus, methods of DEM hydrological correction must be used. The main objective of this paper is to extract drainage network through the combination of DEM and satellite imagery data. In this paper, an adaptive approach is proposed to use main drainage line which is extracted from satellite imagery as the known hydrology network and process depressions and flat areas in one procedure using heuristic information. It can be seen from the comparison and analysis of the drainage networks generated by the proposed approach and Agree, that the proposed approach, named adaptive approach for determinationing flow direction with heuristic information (A Hi), can get a closer match result with the ground truth network than Agree.", "paper_title": "AN ADAPTIVE APPROACH FOR EXTRACTION OF DRAINAGE NETWORK FROM SHUTTLE RADAR TOPOGRAPHY MISSION AND SATELLITE IMAGERY DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500025"}
