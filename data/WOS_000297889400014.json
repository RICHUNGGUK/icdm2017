This model is better fit and compatible with today's competitive, and constantly changing, business environment. The presented Profitable-To-Promise (PTP) approach is a novel modeling approach which integrates System Dynamics (SD) simulation with Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP). This Order Management model incorporates Activity-Based Costing and Management (ABC/M) as a link to merge the two models. MIP and SD. This combination is introduced as a hybrid Decision Support System. Such a system can evaluate the profitability of each Order Fulfillment policy and generate valuable cost information. Unlike existing optimization-based DSS models, the presented hybrid modeling approach can perform on-time cost analysis. This will lead to better business decisions based on the updated information.
