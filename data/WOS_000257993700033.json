The addressed problem has a multi-bus and under abundant harmonic current sources in the system. In this study, an orthogonal array is first conducted to obtain the initial solution. Next, an ant direction hybrid differential evolution (ADHDE) is applied to search for a near optimum solution. The objective is to minimize the cost of the filter, the total demand distortion of harmonic currents and the total harmonic distortion of voltages at each bus simultaneously. In order to determine a set of weights of each term in the objective function, the simplest and most efficient form of triangular membership functions has been considered. The designed heuristic ADHDEOA is applied to a practical harmonic problem in a steel plant, and three design schemes are compared to demonstrate the performance of the ADHDEOA.
