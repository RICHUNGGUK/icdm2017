Traditionally, the compilation and the architectural design sub-spaces have been explored independently. Only recently, some approaches have analyzed the problem of the concurrent exploration of the compilation/architecture sub-spaces. This paper proposes a framework to support the co-exploration phase of the design space composed of architectural parameters and source program transformations. The objective space is multi-dimensional, including conflicting objectives such as energy and delay. In the proposed framework, heuristic co-exploration techniques based on Pareto Simulated Annealing (PSA) have been used to efficiently explore the architecture/compiler co-design space. A first result of this paper consists of showing how the architecture/compiler co-exploration can be more effective than a traditional two-phase exploration. Since the co-exploration space is quite large, to speed up the co-exploration phase by several orders of magnitude over simulation-based approaches, a methodology based on analytical models has been introduced in the co-exploration framework. The goal of analytical models is to quickly evaluate energy/delay metrics at the systems level, while maintaining accuracy with respect to simulation-based co-exploration. The proposed co-exploration framework has been applied to a parameterized SoC superscalar architecture during the execution of a selected set of multimedia applications.", "paper_title": "Efficient architecture/compiler co-exploration using analytical models", "paper_id": "WOS:000244305100001"}
