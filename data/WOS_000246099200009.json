The primary aim of this investigation was to develop an algorithm to optimize stent design, allowing for consideration of competing solid mechanical concerns (wall stress, lumen gain, and cyclic deflection). Finite element modeling (FEM) was used to estimate artery wall stress and systolic/diastolic geometries, from which single parameter outputs were derived expressing stress, lumen gain, and cyclic artery wall deflection. An optimization scheme was developed using Lagrangian interpolation elements that sought to minimize the sum of these outputs, with weighting coefficients. Varying the weighting coefficients results in stent designs that prioritize one output over another. The accuracy of the algorithm was confirmed by evaluating the resulting outputs of the optimized geometries using FEM. The capacity of the optimization algorithm to identify optimal geometries and their resulting mechanical measures was retained over a wide range of weighting coefficients. The variety of stent designs identified provides general guidelines that have potential clinical use (i.e., lesion-specific stenting).", "paper_title": "Stented artery biomechanics and device design optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000246099200009"}
