As a consequence, the stationary distribution can be obtained by the matrix-geometric method, which requires the computation of the rate matrix. In this paper, we revisit an approach based on the homogenization of the state space. We provide the exact expression for the conditional mean number of customers based on the computation of the rate matrix R with the time complexity of O(c). We develop simplified equations for the memory-efficient implementation of the computation of the performance measures. We construct an efficient algorithm for the stationary distribution with the determination of a threshold that allows the computation of performance measures with a specific accuracy.
