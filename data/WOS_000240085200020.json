This paper investigates the problem of determining formal concepts based on the congruences on semilattices. The properties of congruences corresponding to formal contexts are discussed. The relationship between the closed sets generated by congruences and the elements of indiscernibility matrices is examined. Consequently, a new approach of determining concept lattices is derived.", "paper_title": "Construction of concept lattices based on indiscernibility matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200020"}
