We map the eight WBAN user priorities (UPs) into the four WLAN access categories (ACs) to provide the required quality of service and prioritization for the health variables generated by the WBAN nodes. By assignment of WBAN UPs with default medium access control parameters to eight different medical data streams and under the presence of ordinary nodes, we investigate the impact of WLAN AC differentiation by arbitrary inter-frame space (AIFS) and contention window (CW) on performance of medical and regular nodes' data streams. The results of this work indicate that the AC differentiation by AIFS outperforms the differentiation by CW in the sense that it does not deteriorate the end-to-end delay of relayed WBAN traffic and ordinary WLAN traffic.
