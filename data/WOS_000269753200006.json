The states of the controlled system are unavailable and the output signals are quantized before being communicated. An estimation method is introduced to cope with the effect of random packet loss that is modelled as a Bernoulli process. The quantized measurement signals are dealt with by utilizing the sector bound method, in which the quantization error is treated as sector-bounded uncertainty. The output-feedback controller is designed which guarantees the closed-loop system is exponentially mean-square stable. The simulation example is given to illustrate the proposed method.
