The C-PSO algorithm is employed for solving high dimensional bilevel multiobjective programming problem (HDBLMPP) in this study, which performs better than the existing method with respect to the generational distance and has almost the same performance with respect to the spacing. Finally, we use four test problems and a practical application to measure and evaluate the proposed algorithm. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive with respect to the algorithm representative of the state-of-the-art in high dimensional bilevel multiobjective optimization.
