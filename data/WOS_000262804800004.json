It examines relationships among variables associated with factors that influence technology acceptance. Data was collected from 475 participants using a survey questionnaire. Employing structural equation modelling, a hypothesized model was tested for model fit in the study. The resulting model is found to have a good fit. Perceived usefulness, attitude towards computer use, and computer self-efficacy have direct effect on pre-service teachers' technology acceptance, whereas perceived ease of use, technological complexity, and facilitating conditions affect technology acceptance indirectly. These six variables account for approximately 27.1% of the variance of behavioural intention. Perceived usefulness appeared to the strongest determinant of behavioural intention.
