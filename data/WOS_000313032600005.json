The performance of the grid system severely degrades if a method does not exist to efficiently schedule the user jobs. In this article, a fully distributed, learning automatabased job scheduling algorithm is proposed for grid environments. The proposed method is composed of two types of procedures: in the first, a procedure is run at the grid nodes and in the second, the procedure is run at the schedulers. The proposed algorithm synchronizes the performance of the schedulers by the learning automata that select their actions using the pseudo-random number generators with the same seed. In this method, the grid computational capacity that is allocated to each scheduler is proportional to its workload. To show the efficiency of the proposed method, several simulation experiments were conducted under different grid scenarios. The obtained results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several well-known methods in terms of makespan, flow time, and load balancing.", "paper_title": "A NEW DISTRIBUTED JOB SCHEDULING ALGORITHM FOR GRID SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000313032600005"}
