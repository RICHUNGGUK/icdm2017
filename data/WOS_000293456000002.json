In this paper, we define a low-level flowchart language for quantum programming, which can be used in implementation of high-level quantum languages and in design of quantum compilers. The formal semantics of the flowchart language is given, and the notion of correctness for programs written in this language is introduced. A structured quantum programming theorem is presented, which provides a technique of translating quantum flowchart programs into programs written in a high-level language, namely, a quantum extension of the while-language.", "paper_title": "A Flowchart Language for Quantum Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000293456000002"}
