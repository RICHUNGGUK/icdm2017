It is based on attribute profiles and area stability. Images are represented as component trees using a threshold decomposition. Then, some attributes are computed on each node of the tree. Finally, the attribute profile is analyzed to identify important events useful for segmentation tasks. In this work, a new attribute, combining geodesic elongation and area stability is defined. This methodology is successfully applied to the segmentation of cells in multiphoton fluorescence microscopy images of engineered skin. Quantitative results are provided, demonstrating the performance and robustness of the new attribute. A comparison with MSER is also given. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
