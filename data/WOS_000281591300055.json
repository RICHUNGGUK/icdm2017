The solution set of the fuzzy relation equations being nonconvex, in general, conventional nonlinear programming methods are not practical. Here, we propose a genetic algorithm with max-product composition to obtain a near optimal solution for convex or nonconvex solution set. Test problems are constructed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm showing alternative solutions obtained by our proposed model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
