The VPNs have evolved significantly over the years, leading to a range of open-source and proprietary solutions. In Converged, all-IP networks terminal mobility introduces, however, new challenges that have so far been addressed only partially and via proprietary solutions. In this article we assess the level of maturity, the viability and performance achieved in mobile VPNs, based merely on open-source software. Our prototype MVPN is obtained by integrating IPv6, Mobile IPv6 and IPsec, i.e., the protocols that 3GPP envisions for all-IP, mobile and fixed networks. We perform a series of tests on a multi-access wireless network (WLAN, GPRS and UMTS), aimed at identifying the issues arising when mobility management (vertical and horizontal handover) is combined with different levels of network security. Tests led to the discovery of various results such as the flushing of routing tables in MIPv6 during handover. Our performance analysis is complemented with lessons learnt and recommendations.", "paper_title": "Open source mobile VPNs over converged all-IP networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256522200003"}
