The recent IEEE 802.15.4 standard offers a promising platform for wireless sensor networks. Since each node can act as a coordinator or a device in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, 802.15.4- based sensor networks have various possible network topologies. To reduce power consumption, in this paper, we try to construct network topologies with a small number of coordinators while still maintaining network connectivity. By reducing the number of coordinators, the average duty cycle is reduced and the battery life is prolonged. Three topology control algorithms are proposed in this paper. Self-pruning (SP) is the simplest one with O(1) running time and provides the shortest path to the sink node. Ordinal pruning (OP) can significantly improve SP in terms of power saving with O(n) running time. Layered pruning (LP) is a trade off between the first two pruning algorithms with O(root n) running time and has a slightly higher power consumption than OP. Furthermore, all three algorithms are independent of the physical radio propagation characteristics. Extensive simulations have been performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed topology control schemes.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient localized topology control algorithms in IEEE 802.15.4-based sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000245136400012"}
