Our high level goal is therefore to inspect the possibilities of slightly smartening up the Open Flow switches. As a first step in this direction we demonstrate (with Bloom filters, greedy routing and network coding) that a very limited computational capability enables us to natively support experimental technologies while preserving performance. We distribute the demos(1) in source files and as a ready-to-experiment VM image to promote further improvements and evaluations.", "paper_title": "Towards SmartFlow: Case Studies on Enhanced Programmable Forwarding in Open Flow Switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000309217600013"}
