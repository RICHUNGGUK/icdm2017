This software can be an effective tool to give students better understanding of the behavior of power systems under various operating conditions, and can motivate them to learn more about power systems. It may also be useful for advanced users such as PhD students and researchers as they can implement their own algorithms and models, without the necessity of buying expensive licenses for commercial software. In addition, the software may well be used for teaching introductory courses into the analysis of network with high penetration of distributed generators. A detailed software description, comparison with similar available software, potential educational applications and future enhancements of this simulation tool are presented and discussed.
