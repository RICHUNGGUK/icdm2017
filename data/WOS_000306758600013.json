The work of Campanario and Coslado (2011), however, shows that Benford's law does not always fit practical data in a statistical sense. In this article, we use a generalization of Benford's law related to the general law of Zipf with exponent beta?>?0. Using data from Campanario and Coslado, we apply nonlinear least squares to determine the optimal beta and show that this generalized law of Benford fits the data better than the classical law of Benford.", "paper_title": "Applications of the generalized law of Benford to informetric data", "paper_id": "WOS:000306758600013"}
