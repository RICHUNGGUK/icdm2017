A novel multi-class dimensionality reduction approach, discriminant analysis via support vectors (SVDA), is proposed. First, the SVM is employed to compute an optimal direction to discriminant each two classes. Then, the criteria of class separability is constructed. At last, the projection matrix is computed. The kernel mapping idea is used to derive the non-linear version, kernel discriminant via support vectors (SVKD). In SVDA, only support vectors are involved to compute the transformation matrix. Thus, the computational complexity can be greatly reduced for kernel based feature extraction. Experiments carried out on several standard databases show a clear improvement on LDA-based recognition.
