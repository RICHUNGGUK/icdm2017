A number of methodologies have been developed to Assist in the creation and management of a Virtual Enterprise, using Enterprise Modelling as a useful way to enhance its performance. However, it is necessary to develop new mechanisms and methodologies to improve the interoperability and to synchronise changes among different inter-enterprise models. In this paper, we present a definition of a set of requirements needed to synchronise enterprise models in order to improve Virtual Enterprise interoperability. The work is based on previous projects dealing with interoperability and Enterprise Modelling, like UEML or INTEROP. The requirements described in this paper were selected and analysed with the aim of adapting them to the necessities of the synchronisation of enterprise models in a Virtual Enterprise.", "paper_title": "Requirements to improve the synchronisation of inter-enterprise models", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100027"}
