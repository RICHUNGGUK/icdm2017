First, these two problems are formulated in terms of solution of a polynomial equation with u and v variables expressed in the Bernstein basis. Then, based on subdivision of the Bezier surface and the recursive quadtree decomposition, a novel solution method is proposed. The computation of point projection is shown to be equivalent to the geometrically intuitive intersection of a surface with the u-v plane. Finally, by comparing the distances between the test point and the candidate points, the closest point is found. Examples illustrate the feasibility of this method.", "paper_title": "Geometric algorithm for point projection and inversion onto Bezier surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971200005"}
