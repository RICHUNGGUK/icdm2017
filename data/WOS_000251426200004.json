In particular lossy compression has been used in image compression (jpeg) audio compression (mp3) and video compression (mpg) to allow the transmission of audio and video over broadband network connections. Recently the sense of touch or haptics is becoming more important with its addition in computer games or in cruder applications such as vibrations in a cell phone. As haptic technology improves the ability to transmit compressed force sensations becomes more critical. Most lossy audio and visual compression techniques rely on the lack of sensitivity in humans to pick up detailed information in certain scenarios. Similarly limitations in the sensitivity of human touch could be exploited to create haptic models with much less detail and thus requiring smaller bandwidth. The focus of this paper is on the force thresholds of the human haptic system that can be used in a psychophysically motivated lossy haptic (force) compression technique. Most of the research in this field has measured the just noticeable difference (JND) of the human haptic system with a human user in static interaction with a stationary rigid object. In this paper our focus involves cases where the human user or the object are in relative motion. An example of such an application would be the haptic rendering of the user's hand in contact with of a high-viscous material or interacting with a highly deformable object. Thus an approach is presented to measure the force threshold based on the velocity of the user's hand motion. Two experiments are conducted to detect the absolute force threshold (AFT) of the human haptic system using methodologies from the field of psychophysics. The AFTs are detected for three different ranges of velocity of the user's hand motion. This study implies that when a user's hand is in motion fewer haptic details are required to be stored calculated or transmitted. Finally the implications of this study on a more complete future study will be discussed.", "paper_title": "Perception-based lossy haptic compression considerations for velocity-based interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000251426200004"}
