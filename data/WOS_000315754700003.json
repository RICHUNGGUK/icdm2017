Creating and maintaining such a description, in this work referred to as world model, is a non-trivial task in a domestic environment that typically has a high number of objects, and is unstructured and dynamically changing. This work introduces probabilistic multiple hypothesis anchoring to create and maintain a semantically rich world model using probabilistic anchoring. Multiple hypothesis tracking-based data association is included to be able to deal with ambiguous scenarios. Multiple model tracking is included to be able to easily incorporate different kinds of prior knowledge. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
