This paper presents an optimization-based decision support tool for supply chain management, by means of a robust MPC strategy. The proposed formulation: (i) captures uncertainty in model parameters and demand by stochastic programming, (ii) accommodates hybrid process systems with decisions governed by logical conditions/rulesets, and (iii) addresses multiple supply chain performance metrics including customer service and economics, within an integrated optimization framework. Two mechanisms for uncertainty propagation are presented - an open-loop approach, and an approximate closed-loop strategy. The performance of the robust MPC framework is analyzed through its application to two process supply chain case studies. The proposed approach is shown to provide a substantial reduction in the occurrence of back orders when compared to a nominal MPC implementation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
