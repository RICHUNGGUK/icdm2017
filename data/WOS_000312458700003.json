However, a wider bandwidth reduces the effective oversampling ratio between update rate and loop bandwidth, making quantization error a much bigger noise contributor. A successful implementation of a wideband frequency synthesizer is in managing jitter and spurious performance. In this paper we present a new PLL architecture for bandwidth extension. By using clock squaring buffers with built-in offsets, multiple clock edges are extracted from a single reference cycle and utilized for phase update, thereby effectively forming a reference multiplier. This enables a higher oversampling ratio for better quantization noise shaping and makes a wideband fractional-N PLL possible.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL FRACTIONAL-N PLL BASED ON A SIMPLE REFERENCE MULTIPLIER", "paper_id": "WOS:000312458700003"}
