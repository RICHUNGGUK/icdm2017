A HFLTS is more suitable than the traditional fuzzy linguistic set for describing decision-makers' preferences when they prefer to use several linguistic terms in expressions. After reviewing existing studies of HFLTSs, a novel outranking relational system of HFLTSs is developed and dominance relations for HFLTSs are introduced using outranking degrees of HFLTSs. In order to verify the efficacy of the developed method, an illustrative example is given and comparisons are made between the proposed method and other existing ones. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
