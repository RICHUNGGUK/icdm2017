In this scheme, pump wavelengths can be dynamically changed in all time slots, and more than one PWC is allowed to convert a wavelength in a chained manner. The objective of this scheme is to minimize the packet loss rates of the OPS. This scheme is called dynamic pump-wavelength selection with chained parametric wavelength conversion (DPS-C). DPS-C selects the pump wavelength for each PWC so as to maximize the number of successful requests, which refer to packets that wish to be forwarded to their requested output fibers. A PWC, which has the advantage of multiple wavelength conversion, uses a pump wavelength that can be flexibly chosen to define which wavelengths can be converted from/to. The set of original and converted wavelengths, where the pump wavelength is set in the middle of the two wavelengths, is called the conversion pair. Each PWC supports several conversion pairs. The OPS allows each wavelength to be converted using combinations of available conversion pairs, which are not used by any requests, from more than one PWC. A simulation shows that DPS-C outperforms the conventional scheme in terms of packet loss rates in both uniform and nonuniform traffic patterns.", "paper_title": "Performance of Dynamic Pump-Wavelength Selection for Optical Packet Switch With Chained Parametric Wavelength Conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000330475500008"}
