Hangzhou urban expressway is simulated and the result demonstrates that the neural network model is able to reproduce traffic congestion built in realty with considerable accuracy, thus making it suitable for evaluating various control strategies and performing further modeling and simulation tasks.", "paper_title": "Traffic flow modeling of urban expressway using artificial neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300003"}
