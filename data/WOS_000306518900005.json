Amplitude-to-amplitude (AM-AM) and amplitude-to-phase (AM-PM) distortions are two significant distortion effects in PAs at high output power levels, causing out of band interference in the transmitted signal and bit errors in the received signal. Traditional measurements of amplitude and phase distortion in RF PAs require the use of expensive vector network analyzers. In this work, we propose the use of phase-to-amplitude conversion to develop a low cost and accurate test methodology for AM-AM and AM-PM measurement using simple load board test circuitry along with software based difference generation and peak detection mechanisms. Using either simple sine wave stimulus with power sweep or a single amplitude modulated RF stimulus, both distortion effects can be measured with high accuracy for nominal devices as well as over process and voltage variations, while allowing significant reduction in test cost.", "paper_title": "Phase Distortion to Amplitude Conversion-Based Low-Cost Measurement of AM-AM and AM-PM Effects in RF Power Amplifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518900005"}
