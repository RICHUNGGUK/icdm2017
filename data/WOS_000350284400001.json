A pushbroom sensor acquires images in a line-scanning fashion, and this results in scattered input data that need to be resampled onto a uniform grid for geometrically correct visualization. To this end, we model the anisotropic spatial dependence structure caused by the acquisition process. Several methods for scattered data interpolation are then adapted to handle the induced anisotropic metric and compared for the pushbroom image rectification problem. A trick that exploits the semiordered line structure of pushbroom data to improve the computational complexity several orders of magnitude is also presented.", "paper_title": "Anisotropic Scattered Data Interpolation for Pushbroom Image Rectification", "paper_id": "WOS:000350284400001"}
