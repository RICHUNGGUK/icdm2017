Across the world, distribution system operators (DSO) are developing the smart grid concept, and one key tool for this new paradigm is solar power forecasting. This paper presents a new spatial-temporal forecasting method based on the vector autoregression framework, which combines observations of solar generation collected by smart meters and distribution transformer controllers. The scope is 6-h-ahead forecasts at the residential solar photovoltaic and medium-voltage (MV)/LV substation levels. This framework has been tested in the smart grid pilot of vora, Portugal, and using data from 44 microgeneration units and 10 MV/LV substations. A benchmark comparison was made with the autoregressive forecasting model (AR-univariate model) leading to an improvement on average between 8% and 10%.", "paper_title": "Spatial-Temporal Solar Power Forecasting for Smart Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000350356000024"}
