This task is difficult due to the inherent problems of echographic images (i.e. low contrast, speckle noise, signal dropout, presence of shadows). In this article, we propose a method to segment the whole myocardium (endocardial and epicardial contours) in 2D echographic images. This is achieved using a level-set model constrained by a new shape formulation that allows to model both contours. The novelty of this work also lays in the fact that our framework allows to segment the whole myocardium for the four main views used in clinical routine. The method is validated on a dataset of clinical images and compared with expert segmentation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
