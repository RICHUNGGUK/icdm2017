The plant in the networked control system (NCS) under consideration is a discrete stochastic time-delay nonlinear system represented by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. Exponential stability criteria of the NCS are developed by using a common quadratic Lyapunov function and a fuzzy Lyapunov function, respectively. A stabilization controller with convergence rate constraint can be designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities that is numerically feasible with commercially available software. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Stabilization of networked stochastic time-delay fuzzy systems with data dropout", "paper_id": "WOS:000256670200019"}
