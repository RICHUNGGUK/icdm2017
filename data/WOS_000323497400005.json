The parabolic bay shape equation, used to study the embayed beach planform, is a qualitatively assessed instrument to obtain information about beach equilibrium conditions. Nowadays the equation has been extended in order to be applicable not only to sand beaches but also to gravel beaches. In this paper Phoebus user-friendly software for an automatic use of the extended parabolic bay shape equation is presented. The software enables both technical experts and non-professionals to conduct expeditious analysis in order to evaluate the evolution and equilibrium conditions of embayed littoral beaches lying between natural headlands or man-made structures, as well as to artificially recreate stable embayed beaches by building new artificial structures on open beaches. The software can be also used for coastal planning, to anticipate beach modifications in response to new building or to changes in pre-existing structures. Highlights 1. Development of a free software to automatically compute embayed beach planform 2. The system can be used on every type of beach image 3. The software allows to display the planform both for sand and gravel beaches 4. Software reliability was demonstrated for natural and artificial bay beaches.", "paper_title": "A free software for sand and gravel embayed beach modelling: PhoEbuS- parabolic equation shape", "paper_id": "WOS:000323497400005"}
