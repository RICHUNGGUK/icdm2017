In this paper we construct a family of inclusion matrices associated with subspaces of F(q2)((2 nu+ delta)), and exhibit its disjunct property. Moreover, we compare the ratio efficiency of this construction with others, and find it smaller under some conditions.", "paper_title": "Pooling designs associated with unitary space and ratio efficiency comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000276504500005"}
