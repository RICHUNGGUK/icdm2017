In this study, it is assumed that topology of macro-structure is unchanged and that topology of micro-structure is unique over the macro-structure. The stiffness of the macrostructure is maximized with a prescribed material volume of constituents under linear elastic regime. A gradient-based optimization strategy is applied and an analytical sensitivity approach based on numerical material tests is introduced. It was verified from a series of numerical examples that the proposed method has great potential for advanced material design.", "paper_title": "Topology optimization of micro-structure for composites applying a decoupling multi-scale analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000335509900005"}
