The basic idea is similar to surface from parallel planar contours, such as 3D reconstruction from CT or laser range scanning techniques. However, our approach is implemented on a low-cost passive camera system. The object is placed in a water container and the level curves of the object's surface are generated by raising the water level. The 3D surface is recovered by multiple 2D projections of parallel level curves and the camera parameters. Experimental results are presented for both computer simulated data and real image sequences.", "paper_title": "A 3D model acquisition system based on a sequence of projected level curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100095"}
