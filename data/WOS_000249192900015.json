It applies a matrix-analytic approach to analyze the relevant performance measure, including the packet loss probability of high-priority traffic and the packet loss probability of low-priority traffic. Based on the proposed framework, we explore the properties of the fuzzy threshold-based space priority buffer management scheme. Numerical results reveal that the fixed threshold scheme, through its abrupt nature, causes a relatively higher low-priority packet drop. Intuitively, the fuzzy threshold adapts well to different input traffic conditions and packet loss rate requirements of high-priority packet, yielding a lower packet loss probability for low-priority packet.
