One of them has optimal O(k) step and O(n) space complexities, but assumes that processes' identifiers are in O(n), where n is the total number of processes in the system and k is the total contention. The step complexity of an unrestricted name space variant of this algorithm remains O(k), but its space complexity increases to O(n(2)).", "paper_title": "Efficient adaptive collect algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000250061600006"}
