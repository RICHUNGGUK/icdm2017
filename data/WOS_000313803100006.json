The problem is investigated for the well known ten-bar truss structure. Results show that decreasing the number of cross-sections from nine to four has a small impact on the weight of the structure of approximately 5.4%. Furthermore, as the number of cross-sections increases, so does the number of critical constraints. This indicates higher probability of failure.", "paper_title": "Structural optimization of composite structures with limited number of element properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000313803100006"}
