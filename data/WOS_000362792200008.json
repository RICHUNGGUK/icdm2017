In this paper, given two graphs G and H, which satisfy some specific properties, the edge-fault edge-bipancyclicity and edge-fault edge-r-pancyclicity (r is decided on the properties of G and H) of Cartesian product graphs G x H are efficiently evaluated. The obtained results are applied to two multiprocessor systems, the nearest neighbor mesh hypercubes and generalized hypercubes, both of which belong to Cartesian product graphs.", "paper_title": "Fault-Tolerant Cycle Embedding in Cartesian Product Graphs: Edge-Pancyclicity and Edge-Bipancyclicity with Faulty Edges", "paper_id": "WOS:000362792200008"}
