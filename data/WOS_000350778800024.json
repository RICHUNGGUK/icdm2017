First, a plastic-damage model for concrete was programmed in the elastic-plastic dynamic analysis procedure for CFRDs. Previous test simulations were processed to demonstrate the performance and capability of the plastic-damage model and the developed procedure. Numerical simulations of the construction stage, impoundment process, and seismic excitation were conducted to investigate the tensile damage development in the concrete slab of a CFRD during an earthquake. The main tensile damage positions and areas of weakness in the slabs during an earthquake were clarified, which is important for the design of CFRDs. The procedure developed in this study could be adopted in the analysis of interactions between soil and concrete structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
