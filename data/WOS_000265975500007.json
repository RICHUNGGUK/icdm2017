Comput. 30(3) (2008), pp.1490-1507] from a continuous supply chain model based on partial differential equations (PDEs). We develop new presolve techniques where knowledge about the continuous framework is involved. For this purpose, several presolve levels are introduced and compared numerically. The presented methods reduce the size of the MIP in terms of number of variables and constraints, accelerate the solution process of the MIP when using numerical solvers, and finally assure that such solvers are able to find feasible solutions at all, where in some cases they would fail without.", "paper_title": "MIP presolve techniques for a PDE-based supply chain model", "paper_id": "WOS:000265975500007"}
