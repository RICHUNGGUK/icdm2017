In this paper, we formulate the task of image annotation as a multi-label, multi class semantic image classification problem and propose a simple yet effective joint classification framework in which probabilistic multilabel boosting and contextual semantic constraints are integrated seamlessly. We conducted experiments on a medium-sized image collection including about 5000 images from Corel Stock Photo CDs. The experimental results demonstrated that the annotation performance of our proposed method is comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, showing the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed unified framework.", "paper_title": "Incorporating prior knowledge into multi-label boosting for cross-modal image annotation and retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200031"}
