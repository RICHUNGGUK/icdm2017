It is a variant of the traditional variational technique. It involves a combination of static and dynamic monitor functions, the former for mesh distribution in the vicinity of a complex boundary and the latter for mesh adaption with the evolving solution elsewhere. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on some example problems, and it is then applied to a chevron nozzle. The proposed method is shown to be capable of generating a mesh with a good balance of orthogonality and smoothness in the entire domain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
