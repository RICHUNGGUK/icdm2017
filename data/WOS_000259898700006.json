Optimizing logistics network is regarded as the key way to raise supply chain efficiency. This paper focuses on the definition and analysis of 4/R/I/T logistics network structure which is widely used in distribution logistics system, and puts forward 0-1 programming model to minimize logistics cost based oil 4/R/I/T network structure. The model takes into the restriction of service time limit and sole service characteristics account. This optimization model can be solved by Lingo. An example is given in the end, which introduces the application of this model in a medicine distribution logistics network planning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
