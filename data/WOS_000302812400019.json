The circuit's peak inductor current is well-controlled; the magnitude of the output ripple voltage is constant, even when the supply and output voltage levels are significantly different. Since the ripple voltage is a noise component, constant ripple voltage is important for predictable noise of a power management system.", "paper_title": "A buck converter with adaptive on-time PFM control and adjustable output voltage", "paper_id": "WOS:000302812400019"}
