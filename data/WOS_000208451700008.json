The new algorithm only memorised the individual information of finite steps in the iterations and utilised the average information of swarm. Due to the individuals forgetting the former best positions, the forgetting character was hold. The ability of exploration was improved because of using forgetting character and average information of swarm. The simulations of complicated function optimisation show that the new algorithm can find the global best solution more easily than the common particle swarm optimisation algorithm.", "paper_title": "Particle swarm optimisation algorithm with forgetting character", "paper_id": "WOS:000208451700008"}
