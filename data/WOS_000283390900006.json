In Sybil attack, malicious nodes forge a lot of fake identities to disrupt the network's protocols. Previous work used either authentication-based mechanisms which use shared encryption keys, or location information to verify the identities of the nodes. By contrast, this paper uses only neighboring node relation to verify the node identities. The evaluation results show that the detection rate was around 95% when the network was not very sparse.
