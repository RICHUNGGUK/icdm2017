As a result, a model acquired in one view is often inappropriate for use in other viewpoints. In this work we treat this appearance model distortion between two non-overlapping cameras as one in which some unknown color transfer function warps a known appearance model from one view to another. We demonstrate how to recover this function in the case where the distortion function is approximated as general affine and object appearance is represented as a mixture of Gaussians. Appearance models are brought into correspondence by searching for a bijection function that best minimizes an entropic metric for model dissimilarity. These correspondences lead to a solution for the transfer function that brings the parameters of the models into alignment in the UV chromaticity plane. Finally, a set of these transfer functions acquired from a collection of object pairs are generalized to a single camera-pair-specific transfer function via robust fitting. We demonstrate the method in the context of a video surveillance network and show that recognition of subjects in disjoint views can be significantly improved using the new color transfer approach.", "paper_title": "Object matching in disjoint cameras using a color transfer approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000259672400013"}
