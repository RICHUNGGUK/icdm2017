Test patterns used in VLSI testing are required to provide high quality and low cost. Don't care (X) identification techniques and X-filling techniques are methods to satisfy these requirements. However, conventional X-identification techniques are less effective for application-specific fields such as test compaction because the X-bits concentrate on particular primary inputs and pseudo primary inputs. In this paper, we propose a don't care identification method for test compaction. The experimental results for ITC'99 and ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show that a given test set can be efficiently compacted by the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A Test Compaction Oriented Don't Care Identification Method Based on X-bit Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000326409300012"}
