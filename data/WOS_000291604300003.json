The well-known conjecture of Hadwiger asserts that if G has chromatic number k then h(G) >= k. Hadwiger's conjecture is straightforward for k = 3 and was proved for k = 4 by Dirac [1]. Wagner [8] proved that the case k = 5 is equivalent to the Four Colour Theorem, and Robertson, Seymour and Thomas [6] did the same for the case k = 6. But for k >= 7 the conjecture remains unknown. In recent times, the case of graphs of very high chromatic number has attracted more attention. In particular, graphs with alpha = 2 (where alpha(G) is the independence number) have been studied: see Plummer, Stiebitz and Toft [5] for an essay on this case. It is easy to show that if G has order n and alpha(G) <= 2, then h(G) >= n/3 (see Lemma 2.1 below). The main result of this paper extends this bound to take account of the chromatic number chi(G).", "paper_title": "Minors in Graphs with High Chromatic Number", "paper_id": "WOS:000291604300003"}
