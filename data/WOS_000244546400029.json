The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance in terms of both objective and subjective image quality. The proposed algorithm also has a very computationally simple structure, and proves to be a good candidate for low-cost hardware interpolator.", "paper_title": "A low-complexity interpolation method for deinterlacing", "paper_id": "WOS:000244546400029"}
