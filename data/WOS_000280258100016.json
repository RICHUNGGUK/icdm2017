The SOFC has an online learning algorithm that can continually update fuzzy rules during the control process, beginning from an empty rule table. The SOFC was used to control a three-link robot with a complex dynamic model in order to evaluate its applicability. Stability and robustness of the SOFC were demonstrated using a state-space approach. Simulation results confirmed that the control performance of the SOFC outperforms that of the fuzzy logic controller for the control of the robot. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
