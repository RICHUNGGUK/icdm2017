In this article, we propose to investigate pure high-order dependence among a number of words forming an unseparable semantic entity, that is, the high-order dependence that cannot be reduced to the random coincidence of lower-order dependencies. We believe that identifying these pure high-order dependence patterns would lead to a better representation of documents and novel retrieval models. Specifically, two formal definitions of pure dependence-unconditional pure dependence (UPD) and conditional pure dependence (CPD)-are defined. The exact decision on UPD and CPD, however, is NP-hard in general. We hence derive and prove the sufficient criteria that entail UPD and CPD, within the well-principled information geometry (IG) framework, leading to a more feasible UPD/CPD identification procedure. We further develop novel methods for extracting word patterns with pure high-order dependence. Our methods are applied to and extensively evaluated on three typical IR tasks: text classification and text retrieval without and with query expansion.", "paper_title": "Mining Pure High-Order Word Associations via Information Geometry for Information Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000322829900002"}
