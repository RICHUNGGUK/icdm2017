The significant contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) a primal GSLFN (P-GSLFN) is implemented using randomly generated hidden nodes and polynomial output weights whereby the regression matrix is augmented by full or partial input variables and only polynomial coefficients are to be estimated; 2) a simplified GSLFN (S-GSLFN) is realized by decomposing the polynomial output weights of the P-GSLFN into randomly generated polynomial nodes and tunable output weights; 3) both P-and S-GSLFN are able to achieve universal approximation if the output weights are tuned by ridge regression estimators; and 4) by virtue of the developed batch and online sequential ridge ELM (BR-ELM and OSR-ELM) learning algorithms, high performance of the proposed GSLFNs in terms of generalization and learning speed is guaranteed. Comprehensive simulation studies and comparisons with standard SLFNs are carried out on real-world regression benchmark data sets. Simulation results demonstrate that the innovative GSLFNs using BR-ELM and OSR-ELM are superior to standard SLFNs in terms of accuracy, training speed, and structure compactness.", "paper_title": "Generalized Single-Hidden Layer Feedforward Networks for Regression Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000354957000004"}
