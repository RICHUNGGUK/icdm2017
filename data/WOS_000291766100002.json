Currently, vehicles are equipped with forward facing cameras to assist forensic investigations of events by proactive image-capturing from streets and roads. Due to content redundancy and storage imbalance in this in-network distributed storage system, how to maximize its storage capacity becomes a nontrivial challenge. In other words, how to maximize the average lifetime of sensory data (i.e., images generated by cameras) in the network is a fundamental problem to be solved. This paper presents, VStore, a cooperative storage solution in vehicular sensor networks for mobile surveillance, which has been designed to support redundancy elimination and storage balancing throughout the network. Compared with existing works, we propose a novel storage architecture for urban surveillance and deal with challenges in a mobile scenario. Field testing was carried out with a trace-driven simulator, which utilized about 500 taxis in Shanghai. The testing results showed that VStore can largely prolong the average lifetime of sensory data by cooperative storage. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
