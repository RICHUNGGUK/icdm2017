Programming languages play a key role in that education for both student profiles, even in curricula that include no core programming language concepts course. The \"fattening\" of our discipline into many subareas has prompted curricula reviews and rethinking of the undergraduate CS content, including programming language concepts (PL) and where they are taught in the curriculum. This paper proposes that we also rethink the pedagogy for teaching PL with diversity in mind.", "paper_title": "Rethinking Pedagogy for Teaching PL with More than PL Concepts in Mind", "paper_id": "WOS:000262036400020"}
