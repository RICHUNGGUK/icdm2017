In this paper, we propose and develop a methodological framework for applying individual and ensembles of polynomial projection models to hedge against oil commodity price risk. The study also comparatively evaluates the hedging performances of these projection models and benchmarks them against naive hedging, VEC-GARCH model, and the case of no hedging. In addition, the empirical analysis considers a trader's level Of risk aversion in commodity hedging as well as the adoption of transaction cost. Our findings indicate promising out-of-sample hedging capability by polynomial projection models. Also, different forms of integrated ensembles of projections outperform individual polynomial projections, suggesting the usefulness of ensemble structure in enhancement of hedging in an uncertain environment.
