Yet, traditional acceptance tests based on time-to-failure data will not be practical because today's highly reliable products may take a long time to fail. It may be good in this case to base a test on a suitable quality characteristic (QC) whose degradation over time is related to the reliability of the product. Motivated by resistor data, we first propose a degradation model to describe the degradation paths of the resistors. Next, we present an accelerated-stress acceptance test to reduce the acceptance testing time, and then derive the optimal accelerated-stress acceptance testing time for a product, and the probability of acceptance of the batch. A model incorporating cost is also used to determine the optimal design for an accelerated-stress acceptance experiment, and a motivating example is then presented to illustrate the proposed procedure. Finally, we examine the performance of the estimators, and the effect of misspecification of the parameters on the optimal test plan through a Monte Carlo simulation study, and a detailed sensitivity analysis.", "paper_title": "Optimal Design for Accelerated-Stress Acceptance Test Based on Wiener Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000355755200008"}
