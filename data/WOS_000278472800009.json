We present the family of generalized structured models which we wish to estimate. After highlighting the main idea of the theoretical smooth backfitting estimators, we introduce a general estimation procedure. We consider modifications and practical issues, and discuss inference, cross validation, and asymptotic theory applying the theoretical framework of Mammen and Nielsen (Biometrika 90: 551-566, 2003). An extensive simulation study shows excellent performance of our method. Furthermore, real data applications from environmetrics and biometrics demonstrate its usefulness.", "paper_title": "Feasible estimation in generalized structured models", "paper_id": "WOS:000278472800009"}
