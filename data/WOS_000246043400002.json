This paper introduces competitive dynamics research and social network analysis into the study of IOS. A model of the associations between the constructs of IOS use, competitive action, and network structure is developed, and hypotheses are advanced about the relationships among the constructs. As a step toward external validation, measures are devised for operationalizing the constructs and examining the linkages suggested by the hypotheses in the context of an IOS-intensive network consisting of sports car makers and their value/supply-chain partners. The study (1) addresses interactive firm behaviors in e-business and highlights the value of competitor analysis, (2) provides new operational measures that can be generalized and thus enables systematic analysis of 105 use, and (3) identifies new roles of IOS in influencing firm behavior and performance beyond its traditional focus on efficiency and power functions.", "paper_title": "Competitive dynamics in electronic networks: A model and the case of interorganizational systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000246043400002"}
