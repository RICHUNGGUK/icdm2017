Unconventional computers may be the answer to this problem. In this paper we use light to solve a Hamiltonian path problem in polynomial time. At first, the solution space of the problem is generated and then invalid solutions are eliminated from it. Our approach is based on filters which remove paths that are not Hamiltonian from the set of possible solutions. We perform polynomial preprocessing steps to produce the filters and find Hamiltonian paths of a graph based on the rays of light passing through them. Finally we report the design of filters and use light to solve the Hamiltonian path problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
