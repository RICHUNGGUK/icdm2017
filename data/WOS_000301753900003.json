We propose various practical improvements to this method and illustrate them with a large scale computation: we counted hundreds of curves, until one was found that is suitable for cryptographic use, with a state-of-the-art security level of approximately 2(128) and desirable speed properties. This curve and its quadratic twist have a Jacobian group whose order is 16 times a prime. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
