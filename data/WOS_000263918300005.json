Video summarization, aiming to provide a short video summary of the original video document, has drawn much attention these years. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for video summarization with a two-level redundancy detection procedure. By video segmentation and cast indexing, the algorithm first constructs story boards to let users know main scenes and cast (when this is a video with cast) in the video. Then it removes redundant video content using hierarchical agglomerative clustering in the key frame level. The impact factors of scenes and key frames are defined, and parts of key frames are selected to generate the initial video summary. Finally, a repetitive frame segment detection procedure is designed to remove redundant information in the initial video summary. Results of experimental applications on TV series, movies and cartoons are given to illustrate the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Dynamic video summarization using two-level redundancy detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000263918300005"}
