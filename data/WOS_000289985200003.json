In this paper, we consider the panconnectivity of Cartesian product graphs. As a consequence of our results, we prove that the n-dimensional generalized hypercube Q (n) (k (1),k (2),aEuro broken vertical bar,k (n) ) is panconnected if and only if k (i) >= 3 (i=1,.....n), which generalizes a result of Hsieh et al. that the 3-ary n-cube Q(n)(3) is panconnected.", "paper_title": "Panconnectivity of Cartesian product graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000289985200003"}
