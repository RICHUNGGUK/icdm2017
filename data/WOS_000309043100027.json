Recently, Zhou designed an algorithm for computing the k-error linear complexity of 2p(n) periodic sequences over GF(q). In this paper, we develop a genetic algorithm to confirm that one can't get the real k-error linear complexity for some sequenes by the Zhou's algorithm. Analysis indicates that the Zhou's algorithm is unreasonable in some steps. The corrected algorithm is presented. Such algorithm will increase the amount of computation, but is necessary to get the real k-error linear complexity. Here p and q are odd prime, and q is a primitive root (mod p(2)).", "paper_title": "Computing the k-Error Linear Complexity of q-Ary Sequences with Period 2p(n)", "paper_id": "WOS:000309043100027"}
