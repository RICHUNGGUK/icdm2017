In particular, for high precision and high-resolution devices, the technique should be accurate and fast. A new driving scheme is presented that enables control of the DC and transient shift in the threshold voltage (V(T)) and gate voltage of drive/amplifier TFT, while fulfilling the timing requirements for the different applications. The transient shift in the gate voltage has been known to contribute as much as 10% error in controlling the DC shift in the VT whereas it is less than 0.5% for the driving scheme presented here.", "paper_title": "Compensation technique for DC and transient instability of thin film transistor circuits for large-area devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000255788200016"}
