The optimized geometries, electronic absorption transitions, singlet-triplet energy gaps, spin-orbit matrix elements, ionization potentials, and electron affinities have been determined in gas phase and in solvent. Both type I and H PDT mechanisms have been considered. In addition, the variation of a series of relevant properties upon heavy atom substitution (Br and I) have been determined and discussed. Results show that only M4 is able to support the type I reaction, and one of its brominated and iodinated derivatives can produce cytotoxic singlet oxygen (type II reaction).", "paper_title": "Bisanthracene Bis(dicarboxylic imide)s as Potential Photosensitizers in Photodynamic Therapy: A Theoretical Investigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000330097200012"}
