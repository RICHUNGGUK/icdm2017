Experimental push-off tests were performed on osteochondral constructs with or without a teZCC. In parallel, a numerical model of the osteochondral defect treatment was developed and validated against experimental results. Experimental results showed that the shear strength at the bone-hydrogel interface increased by 100% with the teZCC. Numerical predictions of the osteochondral defect treatment showed that the shear stress at the bone-hydrogel interface was reduced with the teZCC. We conclude that a teZCC in osteochondral constructs can provide two improvements. First, it increases the strength of the bone-hydrogel interface and second, it reduces the stress at this interface.", "paper_title": "Mechanical evaluation of a tissue-engineered zone of calcification in a bone-hydrogel osteochondral construct", "paper_id": "WOS:000343814400011"}
