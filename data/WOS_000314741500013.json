The proposed method uses uncertainty propagation techniques to dynamically compensate the speech features and the acoustic models for the observation uncertainty determined at the beamforming stage. We present and analyze two methods that allow integrating classical multi-channel signal processing approaches like delay and sum beamformers or Zelinski-type Wiener filters, with uncertainty-of-observation techniques like uncertainty decoding or modified imputation. An analysis of the results on the PASCAL-CHiME task shows that this approach consistently outperforms conventional beamformers with a minimal increase in computational complexity. The use of dynamic compensation based on observation uncertainty also outperforms conventional static adaptation with no need of adaptation data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
