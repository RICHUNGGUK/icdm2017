We propose the concept of Pilot-Data to address the fundamental challenges of co-placement and scheduling of data and compute in heterogeneous and distributed environments with interoperability and extensibility as first-order concerns. Pilot-Data is an extension of the Pilot-job abstraction for supporting the management of data in conjunction with compute tasks. Pilot-Data separates logical data units from physical storage, thereby providing the basis for efficient compute/data placement and scheduling. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of the Pilot-Data prototype, demonstrate its use by data-intensive applications on multiple production distributed cyberinfrastructure and illustrate the advantages arising from flexible execution modes enabled by Pilot-Data. Our experiments utilize an implementation of Pilot-Data in conjunction with a scalable Pilot-job (BigJob) to establish the application performance that can be enabled by the use of Pilot-Data. We demonstrate how the concept of Pilot-Data also provides the basis upon which to build tools and support capabilities like affinity which in turn can be used for advanced data-compute co-placement and scheduling.
