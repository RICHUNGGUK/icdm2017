The proposed R-HELA combines the compact genetic algorithm (CGA), and the modified variable-length genetic algorithm (MVGA) performs the structure/parameter learning for dynamically constructing the RWNFS. That is, both the number of rules and the adjustment of parameters in the RWNFS are designed concurrently by the R-HELA. In the R-HELA, individuals of the same length constitute the same group. There are multiple groups in a population. The evolution of a population consists of three major operations: group reproduction using the compact genetic algorithm, variable two-part crossover, and variable two-part mutation. Illustrative examples were conducted to show the performance and applicability of the proposed R-HELA method.", "paper_title": "Reinforcement hybrid evolutionary learning for recurrent wavelet-based neurofuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000248703700016"}
