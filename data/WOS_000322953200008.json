We obtain asymptotic enumeration results for the number of rainbow perfect matchings in terms of the maximum number of occurrences of each colour. We also consider two natural models of random edge-colourings of K-n,K-n and show that if the number of colours is at least n, then there is with high probability a rainbow perfect matching. This in particular shows that almost every square matrix of order n in which every entry appears n times has a Latin transversal.", "paper_title": "Rainbow Perfect Matchings in Complete Bipartite Graphs: Existence and Counting", "paper_id": "WOS:000322953200008"}
