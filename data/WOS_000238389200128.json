SRGTrust assigns each peer a unique global trust value, which reflects the rating that the system as a whole gives to a peer. SRGTrust does not need any pre-trusted peers to ensure the convergence of the algorithm and invalidates one of the basic assumptions used in the previous models. Experiments show that SRGTrust converges quickly and significantly decreases the number of inauthentic files in the system.", "paper_title": "A reputation management framework based on global trust model for P2P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200128"}
