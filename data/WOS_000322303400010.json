Tissue deformation may play an important role in the aetiology, which can be investigated using an experimental-numerical approach. Recently, an animal-specific finite element model has been developed to simulate experiments in which muscle tissue was compressed with an indenter. In this study, the material behaviour and boundary conditions were adapted to improve the agreement between model and experiment and to investigate the influence of these adaptations on the predicted strain distribution. The use of a highly nonlinear material law and including friction between the indenter and the muscle both improved the quality of the model and considerably influenced the estimated strain distribution. With the improved model, the required sample size to detect significant differences between loading conditions can be diminished, which is clearly relevant in experiments involving animals.", "paper_title": "Which factors influence the ability of a computational model to predict the in vivo deformation behaviour of skeletal muscle?", "paper_id": "WOS:000322303400010"}
