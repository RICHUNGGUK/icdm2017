By replacing each arc of G(B)(n, m) with an undirected edge and eliminating loops and multi-edges, we obtain the generalized undirected de Bruijn graph UG(B)(n, m). In this article, we prove that when 2n(2) <= m <= n(3) the diameter of UG(B)(n, m) is equal to 3. We also show that for pairs (n, m) where n(2) < m < 2n(2) the diameter of UG(B) (n, m) can be 2 or 3.
