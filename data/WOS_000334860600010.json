To improve the robust controllability of the NSV, the parameter adaptive method is used to tackle the integrated effect of unknown time-varying disturbance and control input saturation. Based on the backstepping technique and parameter estimated outputs, a robust attitude control scheme is proposed for the NSV with input saturation. A novel robust attitude control scheme is then proposed based on a prescribed performance bound (PPB) which characterizes the convergence rate and maximum overshoot of the attitude tracking error. The closed-loop system stability under both the developed robust attitude control schemes is proved using Lyapunov's method and uniformly asymptotical convergence of all closed-loop signals is guaranteed. Finally, simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of both the proposed robust constrained attitude control schemes.", "paper_title": "Guaranteed transient performance based control with input saturation for near space vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000334860600010"}
