This method only needs a lookup-table size of total n x 2(n/4+1) + (n/4 - 2) x 2(n/4) bits, one (n + 1) x 3n/4-bit multiplier, one n x 3n/4-bit multiplier and two additional smaller multipliers, to generate both sine and cosine values (where n is the output precision). Compared with several notable DDFS's, the new design has a smaller lookup-table size and higher SFDR (Spurious Free Dynamic Range) for high-precision output cases, at comparable multiplier and adder complexities. The DDFS is verified by FPGA and EDA tools using Synopsys Design Analyzer and UMC 0.25 mu m cell library, assuming 16-bit output precision. The designed 16-bit DDFS has a small gate count of 2,797, and a high SFDR of 110 dBc.", "paper_title": "Direct digital frequency synthesis based on a two-level table-lookup scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000243586100002"}
