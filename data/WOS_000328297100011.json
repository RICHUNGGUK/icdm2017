Since any type of an assembly line balancing problem is known to be NP-hard, there has been a growing tendency toward using evolutionary algorithms to solve such a hard problem. This paper proposes a new population-based evolutionary algorithm, namely imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) inspired by the process of socio-political evolution, to address the multi-objective U-type assembly line balancing problem (UALBP). Two considered objectives are to minimize the line efficiency and minimize the variation of workload. Furthermore, the Taguchi design is applied to tune the effective parameters of the proposed ICA. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the associated results are compared against an efficient genetic algorithm (GA) in the literature over a large group of benchmarks taken from the literature. The computational results show that the proposed ICA outperforms GA. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
