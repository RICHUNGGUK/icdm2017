Resource is assigned to each user in a way which ensures maximizing energy efficiency, maintaining primary and second user quality of service (QoS) requirements. Optimum transmit power of user is got by analysis; validity of theory is verified by simulation, and the proposed algorithm can adaptively allocate resource for CCRN.", "paper_title": "Energy- and Spectral-Efficiency Trade-Off in OFDMA-Based Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000332298100001"}
