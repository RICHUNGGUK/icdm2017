SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is the most common signaling protocol used for deploying VoIP. Typically, the deployment of SIP VoIP services is done in an arbitrary manner, lacking a scientific and engineering approach to assess the readiness of the existing network prior to deployment. In this paper, we show how to deploy SIP VoIP calls over hospitality networks as those seen in hotels and hospitals. In particular, our approach aims to predict the total number of VoIP calls that can be sustained by a given hospitality network, while satisfying QoS requirements of all network services, and at the same time leaving adequate capacity for future growth of the data network. We utilize both analysis and simulation to gauge the capacity of the hospitality network in terms of satisfying VoIP QoS requirements of throughput and delay bounds. Our analysis is based on the principles of queuing theory, and our simulation is based on OPNET simulator. Results obtained by both analysis and simulation are in line.", "paper_title": "SIP VoIP Deployment over Hospitality Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000315976100005"}
