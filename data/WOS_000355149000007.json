Among the different approaches existing to improve industrial processes, the exergy analysis, although limited to the academic world, has been shown to be a powerful tool for improving energy efficiency of thermal and chemical systems. The purpose of this paper is then to present the use of the ProSimPlus modelling and simulation environment as an exergy analysis computer-aided tool. Expressions implemented in the simulator for computing exergies in its various forms are presented. The adopted approach for calculating exergy efficiency in a systematic way is also exposed; it combines the fuel-product concepts to the transit exergy concept. ProsimPlus exergy module's capabilities are illustrated through the example of an ammonia production plant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
