A coloring of a graph G = (V, E) is a mapping c: V -> {1, 2, ...} such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, i.e., c(u) not equal c(v) if uv is an element of E; if vertical bar c(V)vertical bar <= k then c is a k-coloring. The COLORING problem is to test whether a graph has a coloring with at most k colors for some integer k. The PRECOLORING EXTENSION problem is to decide whether a partial k-coloring of a graph can be extended to a k-coloring of the whole graph for some integer k. The LIST COLORING problem is to decide whether a graph allows a coloring, such that every vertex u receives a color from some given set L(u). By imposing an upper bound l on the size of each L(u) we obtain the l-LIST COLORING problem. We first classify the PRECOLORING EXTENSION problem and the l-LIST COLORING problem for H-free graphs. We then show that 3-LIST COLORING is NP-complete for n-vertex graphs of minimum degree n - 2, i.e., for complete graphs minus a matching, whereas LIST COLORING is fixed-parameter tractable for this graph class when parameterized by the number of vertices of degree n - 2. Finally, for a fixed integer k > 0, the LIST k-COLORING problem is to decide whether a graph allows a coloring, such that every vertex u receives a color from some given set L(u) that must be a subset of {1, ..., k}. We show that LIST 4-COLORING is NP-complete for P-6-free graphs, where P-6 is the path on six vertices. This completes the classification of LIST k-COLORING for P-6-free graphs.
