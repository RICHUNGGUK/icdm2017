These systems are known to generate exactly the class of regular languages. Upper and lower bounds are shown relating the size of these splicing systems, defined as the total length of the rules and the initial language of the system, to the size of their equivalent minimal nondeterministic finite automata (NFA). In addition, an accepting model of extended finite splicing systems is studied. Using this variant one can obtain systems which are more than polynomially more succinct than the equivalent NFA or generating extended finite splicing system.", "paper_title": "Descriptional complexity of splicing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258291000006"}
