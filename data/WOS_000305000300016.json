Our approach is built upon a hierarchical representation of the Finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) field, which is adaptively sampled and rendered to meet the need of the current visual setting. The performance of our method allows the user to explore large and complex data sets across scales and to inspect their features at arbitrary resolution. The paper discusses an efficient implementation of this strategy on graphics hardware and provides results for an analytical flow and several CFD simulation data sets.", "paper_title": "Interactive Computation and Rendering of Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000305000300016"}
