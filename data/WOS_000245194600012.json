In the capsule endoscopes, it is desirable that the control function can capacitate the sampling of digestive fluid and tissue, drug delivery, and locomotion. In this paper, the control function was embodied by bi-directional communication. A CPLD (complex programmable logic device) controller was designed and implemented for the bi-directional communication in capsule endoscope. The diameter of capsule was 12 mm and the length was 30 mm. The performance of implemented capsule was verified by in-vivo animal experiments.", "paper_title": "CPLD based bi-directional wireless capsule endoscopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000245194600012"}
