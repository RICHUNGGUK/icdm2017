While there are some research in the SN literature proposing different dynamic and intelligent coordination mechanisms, the impact of the proper definition of data structure and long-term relationship in modeling both coordination and negotiation mechanisms have not been addressed deeply. In this paper, we propose three overlapping services including intelligent matching of partners, proposal generations, and long-term contract management. The process begins with the selection of qualified partners based on the similarity of users profiles in a multidimensional space defined by network attributes. Then, a coordination mechanism for long-term agreements is proposed such that the generated proposals in e-SN encourage buyers to reveal their demand in advance. The proposed mechanism introduces the importance of strategic buyers for suppliers in modeling and decision making process. To illustrate the model efficiency, a prototype system has been modeled and is compared to the traditional tendering mechanism. The validation results confirm the model efficiency in providing long-term decisions in a dynamic environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
