In order to solve these problems, we derived a new continuous approach in the numerical manifold method (NMM). NMM is an ideal method to handle boundaries, considering its flexibility and efficiency with fixed mathematical mesh and its integration precision. With the two-cover-meshing system, we construct physical covers containing gradient jump terms defined as extended degrees of freedom to realize the refraction law across material interfaces. In the global equilibrium equations, the jump terms are naturally considered with the energy-work seepage model. In this approach, high accuracy is expected from the newly constructed jump function together with simplex integration. Moreover, high mesh efficiency is realized by fixed triangular mathematical mesh with algorithms fully considering interfaces intersecting with Dirichlet, Neumann, or other boundaries and simplex integration on elements in arbitrary shapes. The new approach was coded into our NMM fluid flow model. We calculated examples involving fluid flow through a domain including (1) a single interface, (2) an idealized fault represented by multiple material interfaces, (3) intersected interfaces, and (4) an octagonal inclusion. We compared the simulated results to analytical solutions or results with denser mesh to test precision and efficiency and thereby proved that the new approach is accurate, efficient, and flexible, especially when considering intense geometric change or intersections.
