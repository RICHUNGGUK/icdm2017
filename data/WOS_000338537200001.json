The most common example of CPS is industrial control system (ICS), which is prevalent in almost every critical infrastructure, such as electricity, oil and gas, water, chemical processing, and healthcare. So ICS security has become a top priority in the security field. Based on a general description of the wireless sensor network (WSN), which is an important element of CPS, this paper first gives a comprehensive and deep understanding of CPS. Secondly, it provides a comprehensive description of the current situation of ICS security in the U. S. and the corresponding approaches the U. S. government and some industries have taken, including management, technology, standards and regulations, and researches of national laboratories. Thirdly, the paper shows the research on ICS in Europe, focusing on the most important report issued by ENISA. Then, compared with developed countries, it presents the grim situation of ICS security and describes the efforts of ICS security management in China.", "paper_title": "Cyberphysical Security for Industrial Control Systems Based on Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000338537200001"}
