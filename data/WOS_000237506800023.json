In this paper we address this problem by extending Tropos, which is one of the most used methodologies to design agent systems. We show our proposal with the Food Collecting Agent Problem in which a team has to collect food in a grid-like world. Our solution includes autonomous behaviour, beliefs, multiple roles playing, communication and cooperation. The main contribution is the proposal to generate a Prolog implementation from a Tropos design by first extending the Tropos de-tailed design and second illustrating how to get a set of Prolog clauses for this design. In addition we show a performance evaluation of our Prolog implementation which confirms that our solution for the case study is effective and allows a simple configuration of the resulting program.", "paper_title": "Extending tropos for a prolog implementation: A case study using the food collecting agent problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000237506800023"}
