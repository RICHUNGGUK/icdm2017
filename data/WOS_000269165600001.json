We first describe an efficient method to build a Connected Dominating Set (CDS) as the backbone of multi-hop Bluctooth network, then propose new algorithms to form the dBBlue scatternets (Song et al., 2005) in each cluster. The final scattemet, M-dBBlue, guarantees the connectivity. Our experiment shows our scatternet seldom parks any node. We then propose a complete set of hierarchical routing methods for M-dBBlue which enables the self-routing inside each cluster. Moreover, our scatternet formation and routing algorithm do not necessarily require position information of the node.", "paper_title": "Multi-hop scatternet formation and routing for large scale Bluetooth networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000269165600001"}
