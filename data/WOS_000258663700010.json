As a conceivable application, a specific model of opinion formation is formulated, relying on the interactions of single individuals within the population. Then, two examples of possible persuader's influence are constructed. The resulting models are expressed by means of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which are then investigated both analytically and computationally. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
