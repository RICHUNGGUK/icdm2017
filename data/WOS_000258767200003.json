The success of such research may bring in many innovative HCI tools used for the applications of human-centered multimedia communication. Due to the temporal property of age progression, face images with aging features may display some sequential patterns with low-dimensional distributions. In this paper, we demonstrate that such aging patterns can he effectively extracted from a discriminant subspace learning algorithm and visualized as distinct manifold structures. Through the manifold method of analysis on face images, the dimensionality redundancy of the original image space can be significantly reduced with subspace learning. A multiple linear regression procedure, especially with a quadratic model function, can be facilitated by the low dimensionality to represent the manifold space embodying the discriminative property. Such a processing has been evaluated by extensive simulations and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on a large size aging database demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed framework.", "paper_title": "Human age estimation with regression on discriminative aging manifold", "paper_id": "WOS:000258767200003"}
