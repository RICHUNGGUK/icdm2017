The universality of systems like Universal Mobile Telecommunications System and wi-fi increases the need for the rapid introduction of efficient VHE schemes. In this paper, we study the adoption of Mobile Agents for handling the VHE functionality. Mobile agents are nicely harmonized with the broader idea of VHE as they allow the autonomous execution of tasks by components that roam from node to node and network to network. We present the detailed modeling of a VHE provisioning architecture and investigate its suitability for different use cases and technical options (e.g., end user devices). The adoption of mobile agents for the ubiquitous provision of telecommunication services is quite promising in terms of efficiency. Through a series of experiments we quantify the performance benefits stemming from the adoption of mobile agents in contrast to conventional service provisioning schemes.", "paper_title": "A Multiagent Platform for Ubiquitous Service Provision", "paper_id": "WOS:000272574500002"}
