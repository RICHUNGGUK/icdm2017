By theoretical deduction, a prototype is described to improve the linearity of a linear PA. With the realization on Jazz 0: 35 mu m SiGe HBT process and test verification, the novel adaptive current biased RF power amplifier shows 3 similar to 7 dB improvement of the ACPR at the output power of 19 dBm to meet the demand of CDMA IS95 spectrum mask without debasing the efficiency.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL ADAPTIVE CURRENT BIASED LINEAR RADIO-FREQUENCY POWER AMPLIFIER ON SIGE HBT PROCESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279796900011"}
