The framework includes segmentation of medical data, physical and mathematical modeling, performance optimization as well as collision detection. The physical and mathematical modeling which is the most significant phase in the approach is based on an improved elasticity theory which uses the skeleton structure of the deformable object to reflect volumetric information. We also refine the model to satisfy the real-time computation requirement and achieve a reasonable deformation effect on the global level as well as the local region by introducing the concepts of the angular spring, the return spring and the local deformation concept. A model based on real clinical data using a segmented left kidney and a collision detection demo are presented as an example in our case study.", "paper_title": "The framework for real-time simulation of deformable soft-tissue using a hybrid elastic model", "paper_id": "WOS:000239565100009"}
