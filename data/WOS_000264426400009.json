Emotions can be triggered by internal stimuli (stress) or external stimuli (aggressive scenes). In this paper we propose a system of classification of certain emotional states by analysis of EEG recordings. We present the results of two experiments. In one experiment we recorded EEG data of car drivers in a simulated environment under conditions with a varying stress level. In the other experiment we presented pictures of emotional situations to car drivers. It proves that we were able to assess the state of respondents under extreme emotions.", "paper_title": "RECOGNITION OF EMOTIONAL STATES OF CAR DRIVERS BY EEG ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264426400009"}
