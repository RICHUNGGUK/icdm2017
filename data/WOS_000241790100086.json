Then based on it, a heuristic weight-setting algorithm for least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) is proposed to obtain the robust estimations. In the proposed algorithm, the weights are set according to the changes of the observed value in the neighborhood of a sample's input space. Numerical experiments show that the heuristic weight-setting algorithm is able to set appropriate weights on noisy data and hence effectively improves the robustness of LS-SVM.", "paper_title": "A heuristic weight-setting algorithm for robust weighted least squares support vector regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100086"}
