We extend the language of the DeLP logical framework by associating temporal parameters to literals. A temporal logic program is a set of basic temporal facts and (strict or defeasible) durative rules. Facts and rules combine into durative arguments representing temporal processes. As usual, a dialectical procedure determines which arguments are undefeated, and hence which literals are warranted, or defeasibly follow from the program. t-DeLP, though, slightly differs from DeLP in order to accommodate temporal aspects, like the persistence of facts. The output of a t-DeLP program is a set of warranted literals, which is first shown to be non-contradictory and be closed under sub-arguments. This basic framework is then modified to deal with programs whose strict rules encode mutex constraints. The resulting framework is shown to satisfy stronger logical properties like indirect consistency and closure.", "paper_title": "t-DeLP: an argumentation-based Temporal Defeasible Logic Programming framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000330988200002"}
