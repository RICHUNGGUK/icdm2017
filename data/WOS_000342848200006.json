The modification of the cell is easier to implement in engineering applications. The scheme proposed in this paper, using the modification of standard uncoupled CNN cells, allows less hardware consumption in comparison to the utilisation of chaos computing system or harnessing piecewise-linear systems. The template parameters of the modified cell have been discussed, and the physical circuit implementing the reconfigurable two-input and three-input XOR function has also been presented.", "paper_title": "A new design for reconfigurable XOR function based on cellular neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342848200006"}
