Several impressive prototypes already exist that let users navigate in virtual scenes or manipulate virtual objects solely by means of their cerebral activity, recorded on the scalp via electroencephalography electrodes. Meanwhile, virtual reality technologies provide motivating, safe, and controlled conditions that enable improvement of BCI learning as well as the investigation of the brain responses and neural processes involved. Over the long term, these innovations could lead to newer applications, such as novel types of neurorehabilitation.", "paper_title": "Brain-Computer Interfaces, Virtual Reality, and Videogames", "paper_id": "WOS:000259922300019"}
