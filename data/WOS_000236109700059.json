In our proposed system architecture, a simplification module produces candidate simplified rephrasings that the author of the text can accept or edit. This article describes the syntactic simplification module which has been partly implemented. We believe the proposed approach constitutes a framework for the more general task of authoring NLP-enriched documents obtained through validations from the author.", "paper_title": "Writing for language-impaired readers", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700059"}
