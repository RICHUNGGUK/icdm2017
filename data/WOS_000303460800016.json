This framework supports process stakeholders to model business processes collaboratively, which can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of business process design. By applying this framework, each process stakeholder can create his or her own model of the business process. The different models of the same business process can be automatically compared to find the conflicts between them. Based on the conflicts, process stakeholders can collaborate to improve the models. Then the models can be integrated to form a more complete model.", "paper_title": "Business process design: Process comparison and integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000303460800016"}
