Flow fields were obtained using a particle image velocimetry system whose data acquisition was synchronized with the propeller's angular position. The chord-based Reynolds number was Re (c) = u (r) c/upsilon = 1.4 x 10(4), where u (r) is the rotational velocity of the propeller and c is the chord length of the airfoil. Flow characteristics such as mean velocity, vorticity and the RMS value of velocity fluctuation were derived from the measurements. The results demonstrated the presence of a downwash around the propeller during the generation of lift. Detailed observations around each airfoil visualized distinct vortex shedding and reattaching flow at certain phase angles of the propeller.", "paper_title": "Flow measurement around a cycloidal propeller", "paper_id": "WOS:000283592700010"}
