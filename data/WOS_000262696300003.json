We answer the question of finding, for a given integer n, a simple n-sided polygon contained in a disk of radius 1 that has the longest perimeter. When n is even, the optimal solution is arbitrarily close to a line segment of length 2n. When n is odd, the optimal solution is arbitrarily close to an isosceles triangle.", "paper_title": "Simple Polygons of Maximum Perimeter Contained in a Unit Disk", "paper_id": "WOS:000262696300003"}
