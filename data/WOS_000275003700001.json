A global stability analysis is carried out and critical parameters are identified for various aspect ratios. It is found that while there is reasonable agreement with the literature for the critical parameters leading, to loss of stability for the square cavity. there are Significant discrepancies for cavities of aspect ratios 1.5 and 2. Simulations of the linearized unsteady equations confirm the results from the global stability analysis for aspects ratios A = 1.1.5 and A = 2.
