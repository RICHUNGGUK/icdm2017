This paper covers how the need for such new notions in agent technology introduced a change in fundamental agent theories and how it can be balanced by inducing some original cognitive notions from the field of 'artificial mind'. This paper concentrates on the popular agent reasoning notion of Belief Desire Intention (BDI) and outlines the importance of the human-centric agent reasoning model as a step towards the next generation of agents to bridge the gap between human and agent. The current trend including the human-centric nature of agent mind and human-agent teaming is explained, and its needs and characteristics are also explained. This paper reports add-on implementation on BDI in order to facilitate human-centric nature of agent mind. This human-centric nature and concepts such as teaming agreements are utilised to aid human-agent teaming in a simulated environment. The issues in order to make agents more human-like or receptive are outlined.", "paper_title": "The equilibrium of agent mind: The balance between agent theories and practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600058"}
