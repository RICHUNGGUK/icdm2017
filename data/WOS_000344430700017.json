The basic structure ora VUD fuzzy controller is given in this paper. To use subconscious knowledge, the input/output data from sensors, a novel method is proposed for designing a VUD fuzzy controller. Firstly, the central points of the input fuzzy sets are distributed equidistantly and those of the output fuzzy sets are regarded as undetermined parameters. Then, an improved recursive least square algorithm is presented to identify these unknown parameters, and a cut-off condition is applied to end the recursive computation. Finally, simulation examples show that the VUD fuzzy controller constructed by the identification algorithm can satisfactorily approximate original input/output data and that it can achieve a better effect on a rotary single inverted pendulum than a general fuzzy controller.
