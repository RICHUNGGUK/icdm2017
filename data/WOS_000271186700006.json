Stress values depend on loading conditions, mechanical properties and constrains of structural components. The critical stress levels lead to tissue damage. The aim of this study is to analyse dynamic stress distribution of lower second premolar due to physiological cyclic loading, and dependency of pulsatile stress characteristics to visco-elastic property of dental components by finite element modelling. Results show that visco-elastic property markedly influences stress determinants in major anatomical sites including dentin, cementum-enamel and dentin-enamel junctions. Reduction of visco-elastic parameter leads to mechanical vulnerability through elevation of stress pulse amplitude, maximum stress value; and reduction of stress phase shift as a determinant of stress wave propagation. The results may be applied in situations in which visco-elasticity is reduced such as root canal therapy and post and core restoration in which teeth are more vulnerable to fracture.", "paper_title": "Mechanical vulnerability of lower second premolar utilising visco-elastic dynamic stress analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000271186700006"}
