This paper addresses the consistent solution of model selection issue on the basis of the fuzzy axiomatic design (FAD) methodology. Moreover, the developed FAD-based model selection interface (FAD-MSI) is performed over the critical ship management processes in order to assign suitable (multiple criteria decision-making) MCDM techniques even if commonly utilized hybrid approaches. The Outcomes of this study encourage the maritime practitioners for the further researches towards analytical modelling of ship management processes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
