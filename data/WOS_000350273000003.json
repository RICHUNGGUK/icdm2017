Although biometrics has been applied in specific areas for decades, it has gradually proliferated in customer and mobile electronic products to enhance security and privacy. This study aims to evaluate biometrics through conventional technology assessment considerations combined with viewpoints on the specifics of biometric technologies and then to provide suggestions for selection. To conduct the biometric technology assessment, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and non-fuzzy best performance approaches are used. Although the outcomes first indicate that technology assessment should be the key object in selecting biometric technologies, that object is followed by biometric competence and key elements of biometrics. The outcomes also indicate that features of the target technologies should be considered when evaluating them. Additionally, fingerprint recognition, iris recognition, and face recognition are the preferred biometrics in evaluation and selection.
