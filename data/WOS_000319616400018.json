Solutions in the Pareto front correspond with the fuzzy solution of the former fuzzy problem expressed in terms of the group of three parameters (x*, mu, alpha), i.e., optimal solution - degree of satisfaction - vagueness factor. The decision maker could choose, in a posteriori decision environment, the most convenient optimal solution according to his degree of satisfaction and vagueness factor. Additionally, an ad-hoc Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, ENORA-II, is proposed and validated in a production planning optimization environment. A real-world industrial problem for product-mix selection involving 8 decision variables and 21 constraints with fuzzy coefficients is considered as case study. ENORA-II has been evaluated with the existing methodologies in the field and results have been compared with the well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II.", "paper_title": "A multi-objective evolutionary approach for fuzzy optimization in production planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000319616400018"}
