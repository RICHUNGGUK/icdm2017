We have developed a method called optimization program for drug discovery (OPDD) that allows new enzyme targets to be identified in enzymopathies through the integration of metabolic models and biomedical data in a mathematical optimization program. The method involves four steps: (i) collection of the necessary information about the metabolic system and disease; (ii) translation of the information into mathematical terms; (iii) computation of the optimization programs prioritizing the solutions that propose the inhibition of a reduced number of enzymes and (iv) application of additional biomedical criteria to select and classify the solutions. Each solution consists of a set of predicted values for metabolites, initial substrates and enzyme activities, which describe a biologically acceptable steady state of the system that shifts the pathologic state towards a healthy state. Results: The OPDD was used to detect target enzymes in an enzymopathy, the human hyperuricemia. An existing S-system model and bibliographic information about the disease were used. The method detected six single-target enzyme solutions involving dietary modification, one of them coinciding with the conventional clinical treatment using allopurinol. The OPDD detected a large number of possible solutions involving two enzyme targets. All except one contained one of the previously detected six enzyme targets. The purpose of this work was not to obtain solutions for direct clinical implementation but to illustrate how increasing levels of biomedical information can be integrated together with mathematical models in drug discovery.
