This model is conceived as an extension of classical propositional logics in which each proposition is associated with a set of human experts who agree with it. In our model, the logical notions of tautological consequence and consistency of a set of formulae are reformulated taking into account the criteria and the knowledge of the different experts. The core of the paper is related to the discovery of a remarkable relation between these redefined logical concepts with the calculation of Groebner bases on an ideal of polynomials. (C) 2014 IMACS.
