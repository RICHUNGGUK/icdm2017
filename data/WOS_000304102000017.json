A higher value of n increases the likelihood that defects around the site of a target fault will be detected. However, an n-detection test set that consists of single-pattern tests (generated for single stuck-at faults) cannot guarantee that delay defects will be detected. For this it is necessary to use multi-pattern tests. The procedure described in this work generates a multi-pattern n-detection test set for single stuck-at faults. The procedure is applied starting from a single-pattern n-detection test set for single stuck-at faults. Experimental results demonstrate that the multi-pattern n-detection test set achieves a high transition fault coverage. It achieves a similar bridging fault coverage to the single-pattern test set. An added advantage is that the multi-pattern test set typically requires significantly fewer clock cycles for test application than the single-pattern test set.", "paper_title": "Multi-Pattern n-Detection Stuck-At Test Sets for Delay Defect Coverage", "paper_id": "WOS:000304102000017"}
