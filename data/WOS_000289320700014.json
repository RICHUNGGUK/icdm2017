The moving least-square (MLS) approximation is employed to construct the shape functions in conjunction with the framework of the point collocation method. Computations have been carried out for different applied magnetic field orientations and a wide range of values of Hartmann number from 5 to 10(6). As the adaptive upwinding local support domain is introduced in the meshless point collocation method, numerical results show that the method may compute MHD problems not only at low and moderate values but also at high values of the Hartmann number with high accuracy and good convergence.
