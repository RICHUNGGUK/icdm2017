The intermediate layer is a quadratic programming whose objective is to compute reachable targets to the MPC layer that lie at the minimum distance to the optimum set points that are produced by the RTO layer. The lower layer is an infinite horizon MPC with guaranteed stability with additional constraints that force the feasibility and convergence of the target calculation layer. It is also considered the case in which there is polytopic uncertainty in the steady state model considered in the target calculation. The dynamic part of the MPC model is also considered unknown but it is assumed to be represented by one of the models of a discrete set of models. The efficiency of the methods presented here is illustrated with the simulation of a low order system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
