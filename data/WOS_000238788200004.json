The system under consideration is subject to delayed states, delayed output, known nonlinear disturbances and unknown perturbations. The known nonlinearities are assumed to satisfy global Lipschitz conditions and, for the unknown perturbations, bounding information, dependent upon the output and controls, is assumed. Each delay system, in the class considered, contains multiple, time-varying, discrete and distributed delays. The problem addressed is the design of full-order, state observers such that, under the dynamics of the observation error system, the zero state is globally uniformly exponentially stable.", "paper_title": "Observer design for complex systems in the presence of uncertainties, nonlinearities and distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000238788200004"}
