Most of real-life QKD implementations are based on phase-coding BB84 protocol, which usually use Unbalanced Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (UMZI) as the information encoder and decoder. However, the long arm and short arm of UMZI will introduce different loss in practical experimental realizations, the state emitted by Alice's side is nolonger perfect BB84 states correspondingly. In this paper, we will give the security analysis in this situation. Counterintuitively, active compensation for this different loss will only lower the secret key bit rate.", "paper_title": "SECURITY OF PRACTICAL PHASE-CODING QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000282920800004"}
