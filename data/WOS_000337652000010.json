For this purpose, we first characterize and compensate for the asymmetric hysteresis nonlinearity of the PSA. A linear integral resonant controller is then designed as a means for damping the resonant modes of the dynamic system with the hysteresis compensation. Finally, a tracking controller and feed-forward input are developed to minimize the tracking errors and improve the closed-loop tracking bandwidth. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control scheme, a PSA-actuated positioning platform is built and comparative experiments are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves robust broadband nanopositioning of the PSA by improving the tracking bandwidth from 22 Hz (with an integral controller) to 657 Hz.
