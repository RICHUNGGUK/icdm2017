Inference methods based on polynomial programming are presented for strong independence, both for unconditional and conditional cases. We also consider graph-theoretic representations, where each node in a graph is associated with a Boolean variable and edges carry a Markov condition. The resulting model generalizes Bayesian networks, allowing probabilistic assessments and logical constraints to be mixed.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic logic with strong independence", "paper_id": "WOS:000242128100065"}
