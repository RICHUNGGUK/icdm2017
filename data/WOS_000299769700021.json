Quantum chemical calculations were performed on a model polymer, poly[methyl(phenyl)silylene], employing the B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP method. The polaron binding energy consists of two terms: the molecular deformation energy and electron-phonon term. Its value was found to be about 0.23 eV at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory.", "paper_title": "Polaron binding energy in polymers: poly[methyl(phenyl)silylene]", "paper_id": "WOS:000299769700021"}
