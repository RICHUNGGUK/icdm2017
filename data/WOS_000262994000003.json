Later, each member of a group of users can compute a common key for secure communication. In this paper we present a keying material based key pre-distribution scheme, i.e., a group of users, using secret information preloaded in their memory and pieces of public information retrieved from a keying material server, can compute a common key. We prove lower bounds on the amount of information each user has to keep secret in such scheme. Then, we present its adaptation to sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Keying Material Based Key Pre-distribution Scheme for Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262994000003"}
