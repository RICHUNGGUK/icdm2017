In order to be commercially viable, the assembly yield for 3-D-stacked ICs must be as high as possible, requiring TSVs to be reparable. Existing techniques typically assume TSV faults to be uniformly distributed and use neighboring TSVs to repair faulty ones, if any. In practice, however, clustered TSV faults are quite common due to the fact that the TSV bonding quality depends on surface roughness and cleanness of silicon dies, rendering prior TSV redundancy solutions less effective. Furthermore, existing techniques consume a lot of redundant TSVs that are still costly in the current TSV process. This inefficient TSV redundancy can limit the amount of TSVs that is allowed to use and may even become the obstacle to commercial production. To resolve this problem, we present a novel TSV repair framework, including a hardware redundancy architecture that enables faulty TSVs to be repaired by redundant TSVs that are farther apart, the corresponding repair algorithm and the redundancy architecture construction. By doing so, the manufacturing yield for 3-Dstacked ICs can be dramatically improved, as demonstrated in our experimental results.", "paper_title": "On Effective Through-Silicon Via Repair for 3-D-Stacked ICs", "paper_id": "WOS:000317001200008"}
