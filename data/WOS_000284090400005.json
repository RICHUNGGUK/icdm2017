The reputation scheme in the proposed AGP evaluates the credibility of peers based on their contributions to P2P services and subsequently clusters nodes together according to their reputation and shared content, essentially transforming the P2P overlay network into a topology with collaborative and reputed nodes as its core. By detecting malicious peers as well as free-riders and eventually pushing them to the edge of the overlay network, our AGP propagates search queries mainly within the core of the topology, accelerating the information discovery process. Furthermore, the clustering of nodes based on authentic and similar content in our AGP also improves the quality of search results. We have implemented the AGP with the PeerSim simulation engine and conducted thorough experiments on diverse network topologies and various mixtures of honest/dishonest nodes to demonstrate improvements in topology transformation, query efficiency, and search quality by our AGP.", "paper_title": "Adaptive neighborhood selection in peer-to-peer networks based on content similarity and reputation", "paper_id": "WOS:000284090400005"}
