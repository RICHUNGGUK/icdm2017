In this review, the general field of electrochromism is introduced, with coverage of the types, applications, and chemical classes of electrochromic materials and the experimental methods that are used in their study. The main classes of electrochromic organic and polymeric materials are then surveyed, with descriptions of representative examples based on the transition metal coordination complexes, viologen systems, and conducting polymers. Examples of the application of such organic and polymeric electrochromic materials in electrochromic displays are given. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
