Based on the random fuzzy theory, a delayed renewal process with random fuzzy interarrival times is proposed in this paper. Relations between the renewal number and interarrival times in such a process are investigated. Useful theorems such as the elementary renewal theorem, the Blackwell renewal theorem and the Smith key renewal theorem in a conventional delayed renewal process are extended to their counterparts for random fuzzy delayed renewal processes.", "paper_title": "Random fuzzy delayed renewal processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000263545300003"}
