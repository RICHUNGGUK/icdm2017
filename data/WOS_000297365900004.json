This paper presents a market-based approach to complex task allocation. Complex tasks are the tasks that can be decomposed into subtasks. Both centralized and hierarchical allocations are investigated as winner determination strategies for different levels of allocation and for static and dynamic search tree structures. The objective comparison results show that hierarchical dynamic tree task allocation outperforms all the other techniques especially in complex surveillance operations where large number of robots is used to scan large number of areas.", "paper_title": "Complex Task Allocation in Mobile Surveillance Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000297365900004"}
