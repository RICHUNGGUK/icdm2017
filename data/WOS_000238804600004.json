Based on the measurement of zero sequence current inside the delta winding, the technique is intrinsically less vulnerable to transformer overexcitation and second harmonic currents present in lines than conventional differential technique. Since the proposed technique has shown to be prone to generate false pick-up signals during inrush, a simple restraining criterion is proposed and analyzed. The use of projection techniques based on Self Organizing Maps (SOM) is proposed in this paper as a valuable tool for analyzing multivariable data which are generated from the huge number of possible combinations existing between switching instant and fault location. Finite element simulations and laboratory tests have been combined into SOM to validate the proposed relaying technique and the restraining criterion.", "paper_title": "A novel transformer protection technique and its performance assessment using self-organizing maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000238804600004"}
