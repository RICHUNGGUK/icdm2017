We prove that, for every epsilon > 0, the dynamics converges to a random coloring within O(nlog n) steps assuming k k(0)(epsilon) and either: (i) k/ > * + epsilon where *approximate to 1.763 and the girth g 5, or (ii) k/ > * + epsilon where *approximate to 1.489 and the girth g 7. Our work improves upon, and builds on, previous results which have similar restrictions on k/ and the minimum girth but also required = (log n). O(nlog n) mixing time when k/ > 2 and O(n(2)) mixing time when k/ > 11/6. Related results of Goldberg et al apply when k/ > * for all 3 on triangle-free neighborhood-amenable graphs.(c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "Randomly Coloring Constant Degree Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000330120600003"}
