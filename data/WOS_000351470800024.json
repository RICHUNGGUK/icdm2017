Recently, an equality relating the partition function and its Bethe approximation was obtained for graphical models with binary variables by Chertkov and Chernyak. In this equality, the multiplicative error in the Bethe approximation is represented as a weighted sum over all generalized loops in the graphical model. In this paper, the equality is generalized to graphical models with nonbinary alphabet using concepts from information geometry.", "paper_title": "Loop Calculus For Nonbinary Alphabets Using Concepts From Information Geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000351470800024"}
