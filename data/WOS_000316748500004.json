The underlying assumption is that the parameters associated with time series segments delimited by multiple changepoints are a priori independent. Under weak regularity conditions, the parameters can be integrated out in the likelihood, leading to a closed-form expression of the marginal likelihood. However, the assumption of prior independence is unrealistic in many real-world applications, where the segment-specific regulatory relationships among the interdependent quantities tend to undergo gradual evolutionary adaptations. We therefore propose a Bayesian coupling scheme to introduce systematic information sharing among the segment-specific interaction parameters. We investigate the effect this model improvement has on the network reconstruction accuracy in a reverse engineering context, where the objective is to learn the structure of a gene regulatory network from temporal gene expression profiles. The objective of the present paper is to expand and improve an earlier conference paper in six important aspects. Firstly, we offer a more comprehensive and self-contained exposition of the methodology. Secondly, we extend the model by introducing an extra layer to the model hierarchy, which allows for information-sharing among the network nodes, and we compare various coupling schemes for the noise variance hyperparameters. Thirdly, we introduce a novel collapsed Gibbs sampling step, which replaces a less efficient uncollapsed Gibbs sampling step of the original MCMC algorithm. Fourthly, we show how collapsing and blocking techniques can be used for developing a novel advanced MCMC algorithm with significantly improved convergence and mixing. Fifthly, we systematically investigate the influence of the (hyper-)hyperparameters of the proposed model. Sixthly, we empirically compare the proposed global information coupling scheme with an alternative paradigm based on sequential information sharing.", "paper_title": "Regularization of non-homogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks with global information-coupling based on hierarchical Bayesian models", "paper_id": "WOS:000316748500004"}
