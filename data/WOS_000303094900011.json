Such a uniformly fused social network provides a single point of access where all information with respect to one's social networks can be queried and reasoned about. The goal of the research is to establish a foundation of integrating and assimilating information within multiple social network systems. We designed a reference model of social networking federation system in this paper, as well as some prototype application to demonstrate its paradigm. We believe our work would provide a novel vision of future online social network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
