A lot of efforts have been made on energy-efficiency computing at various levels from individual hardware components, system software, to applications. In this paper, we describe the energy-efficiency computing problem, as well as possible strategies to tackle the problem. We survey some recently developed energy-saving data management techniques. Benchmarks and power models are described in the end for the evaluation of energy-efficiency solutions.", "paper_title": "Survey on Energy-Efficient Data Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000297688100002"}
