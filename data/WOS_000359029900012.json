In general case, the dissipativity and the desirable induced Lyapunov stability of switched systems can be established by imposing non-increasing condition on multiple storage functions at switching instants. Then, a novel dwell-time dependent storage function (DTDSF) is introduced to characterize non-increasing condition in linear case, and a corresponding LMI-based sufficient condition is proposed for the dissipativity. Since the derived conditions are all convex in system matrices, it is very convenient to be applied into controller design. As applications, the H-infinity and robust passive control problem are considered. Particularly, a solution is proposed for the open problem on the computation of l(infinity)-induced gains versus dwell time, which is covered by the control problems in this paper. Based on the DTDSF approach, the control synthesis procedures including both controller and switching law design are unified into a one-step method which explicitly facilitates the control synthesis process. Finally, several numerical examples are provided to illustrate our theoretic findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
