By using 35 stained glasses, the colour outputs of two microscopes were simulated. Each stage of the processing was performed and the microscope images captured by two different microscope camera systems were reproduced to a single LCD panel. The management system evaluated was found to be effective in terms of colour image reproduction and could be applied to situations when objective assessment is required. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
