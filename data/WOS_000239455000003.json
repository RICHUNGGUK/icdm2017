However, it has a weakness against denial of service attack caused by breaking down or being compromised. G. Vanrenen et al. proposed a distributed SEM approach to overcome the weakness. However, it does not provide the desirable properties such as instant availability and immunity against denial of service attack, due to inadequate usage of threshold cryptography and proactive secret sharing. In this paper, we point out its structural shortcomings and propose a modified version.", "paper_title": "Distributing security-mediated PKI revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000239455000003"}
