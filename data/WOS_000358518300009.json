In such an approach, mutual embedding impacts are often ignored. In this paper, we present an approach that can exploit the interactions among embedding changes in order to reduce the risk of detection by steganalysis. It employs a novel strategy, called clustering modification directions (CMDs), based on the assumption that when embedding modifications in heavily textured regions are locally heading toward the same direction, the steganographic security might be improved. To implement the strategy, a cover image is decomposed into several subimages, in which message segments are embedded with well-known schemes using additive distortion functions. The costs of pixels are updated dynamically to take mutual embedding impacts into account. Specifically, when neighboring pixels are changed toward a positive/negative direction, the cost of the considered pixel is biased toward the same direction. Experimental results show that our proposed CMD strategy, incorporated into existing steganographic schemes, can effectively overcome the challenges posed by the modern steganalyzers with high-dimensional features.", "paper_title": "A Strategy of Clustering Modification Directions in Spatial Image Steganography", "paper_id": "WOS:000358518300009"}
