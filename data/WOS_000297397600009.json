In the modified shortest path network interdiction problem, an attacker selects a path of highest non-detection probability on a network with multiple origins and multiple available targets. A defender allocates a limited number of resources within the geographic region of the network to reduce the maximum network non-detection probability between all origin-target pairs by reducing arc non-detection probabilities and where path non-detection probability is modeled as a product of all arc non-detection probabilities on that path. Traditional decomposition methods to solve the shortest path network interdiction problem are sensitive to problem size and network/regional complexity. The goal of this paper is to develop a method for approximating the regional allocation of defense resources that maintains accuracy while reducing both computational effort and the sensitivity of computation time to network/regional properties. Statistical and spatial analysis methods are utilized to verify approximation performance of the knapsack method in two real-world networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
