In contrast to existing research, this paper provides the theoretical analytic methods for the AntNet scheme. Moreover we added the link failure case for AntNet to the queueing model. At first, by adapting the AntNet queueing model to a simple two paths network, we showed the performance of AntNet routing scheme to minimize the average time and variance of the end-to-end packet delay. Then we extended it to the large network, and compared the AntNet routing scheme to the shortest path routing scheme and the optimal routing strategies. The AntNet scheme's load-balancing effect gives it a smaller delay than the shortest path routing scheme in high intensity network environments. which have heavy traffic. However, the AntNet scheme does not match the performance of the routing strategy that minimize the end-to-end delay. Moreover although the AntNet scheme provides the minimum delay variance at a simple two paths network, it does not guarantee that in the large sized network. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
