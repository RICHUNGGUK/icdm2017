We introduce the notion of a neighbour-transitive code in . This is a proper vertex subset such that the subgroup of graph automorphisms leaving invariant is transitive on both the set of 'codewords' and also the set of 'neighbours' of , which are the non-codewords joined by an edge to some codeword. We classify all examples where the group is a subgroup of the symmetric group and is intransitive or imprimitive on the underlying -set . In the remaining case where and is primitive on , we prove that, provided distinct codewords are at distance at least , then is -transitive on . We examine many of the infinite families of finite -transitive permutation groups and construct surprisingly rich families of examples of neighbour-transitive codes.
