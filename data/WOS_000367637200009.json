The proposed technique exploits modulation format, bit-rate, and SNR sensitive features of asynchronous delay-tap plots (ADTPs) for the joint estimation of these parameters. Simulation results validate successful classification of three commonly-used modulation formats at two different bit-rates with an overall accuracy of 99.12%. Similarly, in-service estimation of SNR in the range of 0-30 dB is demonstrated with mean estimation error of 0.88 dB. The proposed technique requires low-speed asynchronous sampling of signal envelope and hence, it can enable simple and cost-effective joint modulation format/bit-rate classification and NDA SNR estimation in future wireless networks.
