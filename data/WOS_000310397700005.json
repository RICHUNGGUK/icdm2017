We defined the association as node -> action -> mode where node is the robot position and action is the action of a robot (i.e.. orientation, direction). These associations are used for path planning by retrieving a sequence of path fragments (in form of (node -> action -> mode) -> (node -> action -> node) -> ...) starting from the start point to the goal. To learn such associations, we applied the associative memory using Self-Organizing Incremental Associative Memory (SOIAM). Our proposed method comprises three layers: input layer, memory layer and associative layer. The input layer is used for collecting input observations. The memory layer clusters the obtained observations into a set of topological nodes incrementally. In the associative layer, the associative memory is used as the topological map where nodes are associated with actions. The advantages of our method are that 1) it does not need prior knowledge, 2) it can process data in continuous space which is very important for real-world robot navigation and 3) it can learn in an incremental unsupervised manner. Experiments are done with a realistic robot simulator: Webots. We divided the experiments into 4 parts to show the ability of creating a map, incremental learning and symbol-based recognition. Results show that our method offers a 90% success rate for reaching the goal.", "paper_title": "Self-Organizing Incremental Associative Memory-Based Robot Navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000310397700005"}
