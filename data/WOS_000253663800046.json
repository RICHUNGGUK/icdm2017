The new proposed model constitutes a soft computing method, namely, reasoning with a fuzzy inference system (FIS) and tin optimisation by the neural-network learning algorithm. A structure, named the decomposed neuro-fuzzy ARX model is proposed. This structure is based on decomposition of the FIS. An evolution of a learning algorithm for the decomposed fuzzy model is suggested. A comparative study of dynamic system identification using conventional FIS models and the proposed neuro-fuzzy ARX model is presented for Box-Jenkins data set. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
