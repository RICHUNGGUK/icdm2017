The proposed scheme allows control of a wide class of systems including robot manipulators and underactuated systems using a digital camera. The graphical programming environment is based on MatLab/Simulink (R) which allows us to take advantage of Simulink graphic programming facilities. Experiments are presented to evaluate the proposed architecture. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
