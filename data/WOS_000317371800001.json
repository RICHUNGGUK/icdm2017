We give a characterization of existential MSO in terms of projections of tilings, and of universal sentences in terms of combinations of \"pattern counting\" subshifts. Conversely, we characterize logic fragments corresponding to various classes of subshifts (subshifts of finite type, sofic subshifts, all subshifts). Finally, we show by a separation result how the situation here is different from the case of tiling pictures studied earlier by Giammarresi et al. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
