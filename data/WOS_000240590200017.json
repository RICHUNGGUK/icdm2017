DSW is an algorithm for traversing a binary tree without the use of a stack by means of destructive pointer manipulation. Prior. approaches to the verification of the algorithm involved applications of theorem provers or handwritten proofs. TVLA`s abstract-interpretation approach made possible the automatic symbolic exploration of all memory configurations that can arise. With the introduction of a few simple core and instrumentation relations, TVLA was able to establish the partial correctness and termination of DSW.", "paper_title": "Automated verification of the Deutsch-Schorr-Waite tree-traversal algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240590200017"}
