A simulated alarm occurring in the Department of Epidemiology in the Institute of Tropical Medicine of the French Forces, managed by physicians belonging to this department, has been studied. One goal was to have a set of systematized observations on the human-system interactions in a constrained and critical situation implying a team of public health experts. The ASTER system and a first study of its usage by experts in a simulated situation are presented, and the first results obtained in the context of the insertion of a complex human-computerized system interaction in a naturalistic situation of decision making are discussed.", "paper_title": "Collaborative Activities During an Outbreak Early Warning Assisted by a Decision-Supported System (ASTER)", "paper_id": "WOS:000275222600011"}
