For care providers, clinical pathways can be compared to improve health care quality. The objective of this study was to design a convenient physician order set comparison system based on claim records from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. Methods: Data were retrieved from the NHIRD for the period of 2003-2007 for frequent physician order sets found in hospital surgical hernia repair inpatient claim records. The derived frequent physician order sets were divided into five frequency thresholds: 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and 100%. A consistency index was defined and calculated to understand each care providers' adherence to clinical pathways. In addition, the average count of physician orders, average amount of cost, Charlson comorbidity index, and recurrence rate were calculated; these variables were considered in frequent physician order sets comparison. Results: Records for 3262 patients from 257 hospitals were retrieved. The frequent physician order sets of various frequency thresholds, Charlson comorbidities, and recurrence rates were extracted and computed for comparison among hospitals. A recurrence rate threshold of 2% was established to separate low and high quality of herniorrhaphy at each hospital.", "paper_title": "A cross-hospital cost and quality assessment system by extracting frequent physician order set from a nationwide Health Insurance Research Database", "paper_id": "WOS:000355114100003"}
