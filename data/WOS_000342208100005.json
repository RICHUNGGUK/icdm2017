In the constrained optimizations, the maximization is subjected to the constraint of a predefined average density. In the numerical results, the variation patterns of the optimized structures with the order of the bandgap for both the out-plane shear and the in-plane mixed elastic wave modes are presented, and the effects of both the material contrast and the predefined average density on the obtained optimal structures are discussed.", "paper_title": "Topological optimization of two-dimensional phononic crystals based on the finite element method and genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000342208100005"}
