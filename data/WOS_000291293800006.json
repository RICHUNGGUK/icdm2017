For every computable parametrization f of Gamma and every positive integer m, there is some positive-length subcurve of Gamma that f retraces at least m times. In contrast, every computable curve of finite length that does not intersect itself has a constant-speed (hence non-retracing) parametrization that is computable relative to the halting problem.
