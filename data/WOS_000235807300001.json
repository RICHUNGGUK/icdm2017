We consider the number of membranes (cells in tissue P systems), the weight of the rules, and the number of objects. Then we establish our newest results: P systems with only one membrane, symport rules of weight three, and with only seven additional objects remaining in the skin membrane at the end of a halting computation are computationally complete; P systems with minimal cooperation, i.e., P systems with symport/antiport rules of size one and P systems with symport rules of weight two, are computationally complete with only two membranes with only three and six, respectively, superfluous objects remaining in the output membrane at the end of a halting computation.", "paper_title": "Computational power of symport/antiport: History, advances, and open problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807300001"}
