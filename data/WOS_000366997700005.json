Structural requirements for robust enrichment were assessed by an unbiased chemometric analysis of enrichments from retrospective virtual screening studies. The two main structural features affecting enrichment are the outward movement of the second extracellular loop and the formation of a hydrophobic cavity deep in the binding site. These features appear transiently in the trajectories and furthermore the stretches of uniformly high enrichment may only last 4-10 ps. The formation of the inner hydrophobic cavity was also linked to the active-like to inactive-like transition of the receptor, especially the so-called connector region. The best structural models provided significant and robust enrichment over three independent ligand sets.", "paper_title": "Dynamics and structural determinants of ligand recognition of the 5-HT6 receptor", "paper_id": "WOS:000366997700005"}
