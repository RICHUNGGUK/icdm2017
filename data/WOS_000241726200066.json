In this context, we have realized a proper execution framework to develop ReActive Web applications specified by means of the novel modeling paradigm. In this paper we discuss an e-learning case study implemented using our framework and introduce the visual design tools we have extended and developed in order to support the development of ReActive Web applications.", "paper_title": "Visual modeling of ReActive Web applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241726200066"}
