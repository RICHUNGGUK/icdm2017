A continuously increasing number of biometric techniques have risen in order to fulfill the different kinds of demands in the market. Every method presents a number of advantages compared to the others as each technique has been created to subserve different kinds of requirements. However, there is still no method able to completely satisfy the current security needs. This is the reason why researchers continuously drive their efforts to newer methods that will provide a higher security stage. In this paper, the emerging biometric modalities are presented.", "paper_title": "Emerging biometric modalities: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000208536900007"}
