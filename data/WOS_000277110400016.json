The empirical findings indicate that computer self-efficacy, performance expectations, system functionality, content feature, interaction, and learning climate are the primary determinants of student learning satisfaction with BEES The results also show that learning climate and performance expectations significantly affect learning satisfaction. Computer self-efficacy, system functionality, content feature and interaction significantly affect performance expectations. Interaction has a significant effect on learning climate The findings provide insight into those factors that are likely significant antecedents for planning and implementing a blended e-learning system to enhance student learning satisfaction (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
