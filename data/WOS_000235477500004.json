We theoretically prove that the proposed topology is planar, which meets the requirement of certain localized routing methods to guarantee packet delivery; it is power-efficient for unicast-the energy needed to connect any pair of nodes is within a small constant factor of the minimum; it is also asymptotically optimum for broadcast-the energy consumption for broadcasting data on top of it is asymptotically the best among all structures constructed using only local information; it has a constant bounded logical degree, which will potentially save the cost of updating routing tables if used. We further prove that the expected average physical degree of all nodes is a small constant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first localized topology-control strategy for all nodes to maintain a structure with all these desirable properties. Previously, only a centralized algorithm was reported in [ 3]. Moreover, by assuming that the node ID and its position can be represented in O(log n) bits for a wireless network of n nodes, the total number of messages by our methods is in the range of [5n; 13n], where each message is O(log n) bits. Our theoretical results are corroborated in the simulations.", "paper_title": "Localized topology control for unicast and broadcast in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235477500004"}
