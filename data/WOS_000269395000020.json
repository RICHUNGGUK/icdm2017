In this article, based on brain medical images, we presents an effective method, which includes cutting out background region, fitting ellipse to correct lean imaging angle, and gray level normalization. The methodology is applied in content-based CT brain image retrieval and experimental results show its effect and robustness. In addition, preprocessed results of human face indicate potential application of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "BRAIN IMAGE PREPROCESSING AND APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000020"}
