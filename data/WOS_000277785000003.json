Although in some applications, the infinite speed paradox may be ignored, there are many other applications in which a theory that predicts propagation at finite speed is mandatory. As a consequence, several alternatives to the linear parabolic diffusion theory, that aim at avoiding the infinite speed paradox, have been proposed over the years. This paper is devoted to the mathematical, physical and numerical analysis of a hyperbolic convection-diffusion theory.", "paper_title": "A Hyperbolic Theory for Advection-Diffusion Problems: Mathematical Foundations and Numerical Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000277785000003"}
