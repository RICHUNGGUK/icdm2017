To extend lifespan and reduce memory requirements, this paper proposed an efficient wear leveling without substantially increasing overhead and without modifying Flash Translation Layer FTL) for huge-capacity flash storage systems, which is based on selective replacement. Experimental results show that our design levels the wear of different physical blocks with limited system overhead compared with previous algorithms.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Endurance of Huge-Capacity Flash Storage Systems by Selectively Replacing Data Blocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900032"}
