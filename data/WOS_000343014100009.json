First, through-silicon vias (TSVs) are spread on each die to reduce the local power density and vertically aligned across dies simultaneously to increase thermal conductivity to the heatsink. Second, we move high-power logic cells to the location that has higher conductivity to the heatsink while moving TSVs in the upper dies so that high-power cells are vertically overlapping below the TSVs. These methods are employed in a force-directed 3-D placement successfully and outperform several state-of-the-art placers published in recent literature. We obtain 3-D placement results with shorter routed wirelength at similar temperature. We also obtain 3-D placement results with lower temperatures at similar routed wirelengths.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Die-to-Die Thermal Coupling in 3-D IC Placement", "paper_id": "WOS:000343014100009"}
