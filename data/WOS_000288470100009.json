Some convergence theorems for sequence of measurable functions are discussed. As a result, a theoretical basis for applications of the generalized Lebesgue integral is provided. Several types of integrals known from the literature are shown to be special cases of generalized Lebesgue integral. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
