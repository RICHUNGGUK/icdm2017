Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of such measures to select better ones for more quality alignment. Current approaches for comparing these measures, are highly dependent on alignment frameworks, which may cause unreal results. In this paper, we propose a framework independent evaluation method, and discuss results of applying it to famous existing string measures.", "paper_title": "A new evaluation method for ontology alignment measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800025"}
