During Typhoon Morakot in 2009, we experienced the deficiency of emergency call service that cannot continuously track callers in real time and walkie-talkie communications where a speaker may not be granted the permission to talk. These issues can be resolved by the emergency call and push-to-talk over cellular services in IP Multimedia Subsystem. This article conducts a preliminary study on how these two services can be effectively exercised in IMS.", "paper_title": "IMS EMERGENCY SERVICES: A PRELIMINARY STUDY", "paper_id": "WOS:000287659400001"}
