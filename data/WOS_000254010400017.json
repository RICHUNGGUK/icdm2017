These maps show the location of genes and chromosomal features as well as a position scale. The program takes as input either raw feature positions or GenBank records. In the latter case, features are automatically extracted and colored, an example of which is given. Output is in the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and can be edited by programs such as Adobe Illustrator.", "paper_title": "GenomeVx: simple web-based creation of editable circular chromosome maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000254010400017"}
