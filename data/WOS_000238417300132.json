First, we discuss scientific workflows and motivate there use in scientific applications. Then, we introduce the concept of cooperative processes and describe their interactions and uses in a flexible cooperative workflow system called Bonita. Finally, we propose an approach to integrate and synthesize the data exchanged by the mapping of data-intensive science into Bonita, using a binary approach, and illustrate the endeavors done to enhance the performance computations within a dynamic environment.", "paper_title": "Cooperative processes for scientific workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300132"}
