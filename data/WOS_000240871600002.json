Inspite of the large body of work devoted to MAC protocols and associated problems, the relative importance of these problems is still not well understood. This is because most of the previous work focuses on designing a protocol to solve a particular problem, or on identifying scenarios where a protocol will not work well. In addition, most of the work is also based on simplistic assumptions about the physical wireless medium, like fixed ranges for communication and interference, or concepts like capture threshold where the desired signal strength is compared with interference from a single node at a time, rather than cumulatively. Our paper seeks to address these issues. We believe it is extremely critical that (i) we develop an understanding of the relative significance of the problems affecting MAC protocols, and that (ii) we use a realistic model for the physical channel for design and performance evaluation. Towards this end, we evaluate the performance of three currently proposed MAC protocols, IEEE 802.11 [1], RI-BTMA [2], and DUCHA [3] under a realistic channel model with additive interference. Since these protocols solve or suffer from different sets of problems, our evaluation provides a differential diagnosis of the severity of these problems. Based on our observations, we propose a simple and robust two channel MAC protocol (entitled 2CM) that is based on IEEE 802.11 augmented with a busy-tone channel. The 2CM protocol (i) mitigates the hidden node problem considerably, (ii) does not waste bandwidth in terms of logical control channels, and (iii) provides a reliable link layer acknowledgment. Through extensive simulations, we show that 2CM offers a consistently high throughput performance while not sacrificing link layer reliability in a variety of scenarios, thereby vindicating our approach.
