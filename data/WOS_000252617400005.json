In this paper, we study the security of the five-round KASUMI type permutations, and derive a highly non-trivial security bound against adversaries with adaptive chosen plaintext and chosen ciphertext attacks. To derive our security bound, we heavily use the tools from graph theory. However the result does not show its super-pseudorandomness, this gives us a strong evidence that the design of KASUMI is sound.", "paper_title": "Security of the five-round KASUMI type permutation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617400005"}
