We used structural equation modeling to examine these relations. We tested three models, obtaining a model with good fit to the data. We found evidence that both the pretest and the in-game measure of student performance significantly predicted learning outcome, while the in-game measure of performance was predicted by pretest data, frustration, and engaged concentration. Moreover, we found evidence for two indirect paths from engaged concentration and frustration to learning, via the in-game progress measure. We discuss the importance of these findings, and consider viable next steps concerning the design of effective learning supports within game environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
