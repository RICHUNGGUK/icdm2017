Specifically, given a hypersphere that contains the uncertain disturbance signal w(Delta) and an ellipsoid containing the uncertain system state x(Delta) at time step Delta, a sub-optimal approach to computing a linear minimax filter which constructs a minimal ellipsoid to contain x(Delta + 1) is derived. A distinct feature of our approach when compared to earlier solutions is that both the filter and the performance bound can be pre-computed of-line.", "paper_title": "Linear set-membership state estimation with unknown but bounded disturbances", "paper_id": "WOS:000300413300013"}
