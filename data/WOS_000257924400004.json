In this paper we describe the development of a Web-based surveillance registry called Susy Safe for inorganic foreign body injuries in children aged 0-14. The Susy Safe system, which collected 2103 cases during 2000-2002 in 19 European countries, allows for notifying from physicians over the internet thus taking advantage of Web reporting capabilities. Functions include automated risk analysis engine and results visualization. Risk analysis engine has been implemented in a Bayesian framework and provides an update estimate of the risk profile of the products causing injuries, effectively as new data become available. The system contributes to simplify the physician reporting and improve public health information dissemination within consumers and consumers' association. Also it gives physician and researcher the access of a large amount of data otherwise scattered all around in different hospitals. Finally, supplying a quantitative risk assessment for the identification of hazardous characteristics of objects, such as dimensions or shape, it works toward an improvement of consumer products' safety design.
