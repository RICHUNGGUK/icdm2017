Designing these means of escape egress demands more than just calculating pedestrians flow rates and occupant loads. This paper describes a computer simulation model for emergency fire evacuation of an educational building with Arena. The large floor plan of the College of Architecture Building-A was divided into various subsystems in order to model within the technical limitation for the academic version of the Arena software that was used in this research. The simulation model helped in finding the congestion/queuing in corridor spaces, the maximum time taken by people to evacuate if a fire breakout, and the exit stairs' duration of use during evacuation.", "paper_title": "A computer simulation model for emergency building evacuation with arena", "paper_id": "WOS:000256254300008"}
