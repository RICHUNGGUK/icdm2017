Usually the length of correlation window is shorter than the period of the chosen frequency hopping sequence so the study of the partial Hamming correlation of frequency hopping sequence is particularly important. In this paper the maximum partial Hamming correlation lower bounds of frequency hopping sequences with low hit zone with respect to the size of the frequency slot set the length of correlation window the family size the low hit zone the maximum partial Hamming autocorrelation and the maximum partial Hamming crosscorrelation are established. It is shown that the new bounds include the known Lempel Greenberger bound Peng Fan bounds Eun Jin Hong Song bound and Peng Fan Lee bounds as special cases.", "paper_title": "Lower Bounds on the Maximum Partial Correlations of Frequency Hopping Sequence Set with Low Hit Zone", "paper_id": "WOS:000284448800047"}
