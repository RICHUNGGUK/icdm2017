Then, based on the intuitionistic linguistic weighted geometric averaging (ILWGA) operator, we propose two new intuitionistic linguistic geometric operators, such as the intuitionistic linguistic ordered weighted geometric (ILOWG) operator and intuitionistic linguistic hybrid geometric (ILHG) operator, and establish various properties of these operators. Furthermore, we apply the ILHG and ILWGA operators to solve multi-criteria group decision making problems, in which the criterion values take the form of ILNs and the criterion weight information is known completely. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed approach.", "paper_title": "Some Geometric Operators for Aggregating Intuitionistic Linguistic Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000356335400015"}
