Recently, criteria based on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces has received much attentions. They are developed in the setting of norm of Hilbert spaces. In this paper we propose tests in the setting of constraints of coefficients of functions. Some estimates of tests are constructed. In particular the error between the test of constrained covariance and the estimate is bounded.", "paper_title": "KERNEL METHODS FOR INDEPENDENCE MEASUREMENT WITH COEFFICIENT CONSTRAINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000328117000006"}
