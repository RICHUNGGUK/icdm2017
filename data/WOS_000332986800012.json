Most existing works focus on independent and identically distributed mobility model, which is always regarded as an idealized global model. In this paper, we extend the investigation to the random walk model, which characterizes practical situations more accurately. Some local movements cause a series of complicated probabilistic problem, we develop a method to calculate the meeting probability between two randomly selected nodes under random walk mobility model. Targeting at the most commonly used routing schemes which are modeled by 2HRf algorithm, we obtain the closed-form solutions for delay and capacity, where the wireless interference and medium access contention among nodes are considered. Extensive simulations demonstrate the accuracy of our theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Delay and capacity in MANETs under random walk mobility model", "paper_id": "WOS:000332986800012"}
