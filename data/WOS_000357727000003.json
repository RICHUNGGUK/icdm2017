It is known that the loss probability is given in terms of the probability density function v(x) of the virtual waiting time and that v(x) is given by a formal series solution of a Volterra integral equation. In this paper, we show that the series solution of v(x) can be interpreted as the probability density function of a random sum of dependent random variables and we reveal its dependency structure through the analysis of a last-come first-served, preemptive-resume M/G/1 queue with workload-dependent loss. Furthermore, based on this observation, we show some properties of the loss probability.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the loss probability in the M/G/1+G queue", "paper_id": "WOS:000357727000003"}
