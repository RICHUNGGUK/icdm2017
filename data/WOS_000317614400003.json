Specifically, we investigate both the optimal decisions of the risk-averse supplier with respect to the MMP contract parameters and the optimal ordering decision of the risk-neutral retailer so that the whole supply chain can be coordinated (i.e., optimized). We then conduct a numerical study with the real data from two companies to explore the performance of the optimal MMP proposed in our paper. Important insights and specific implications to the industry practitioners are discussed.", "paper_title": "The Coordination of Fashion Supply Chains With a Risk-Averse Supplier Under the Markdown Money Policy", "paper_id": "WOS:000317614400003"}
