Protein binding sites are first described using GRID molecular interaction fields (GRID-MIFs), and the FLAP (fingerprints for ligands and proteins) method is then used to encode and compare this information. The discriminating power of the algorithm and its applicability for large-scale protein analysis was validated by analyzing various scenarios: clustering of kinase protein families in a relevant manner, predicting ligand activity across related targets, and protein-protein Virtual screening. In all cases the results showed the effectiveness of the GRID-FLAP method and its potential use in applications Such as identifying selectivity targets and tools/hits for new targets via the identification of other proteins with pharmacophorically similar binding sites.", "paper_title": "High-Throughput Virtual Screening of Proteins Using GRID Molecular Interaction Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000273794500015"}
