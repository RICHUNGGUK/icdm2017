The dictionary has been enriched with morphosyntactic and semantic information. It was then used in the specific task of capitalizing anthroponyms and other proper names on a corpus automatically produced by a broadcast news speech recognition system and manually corrected. The output of this system does not offer clues, such as capitalized words or punctuation. This task expects to contribute in rendering more readable the output of such system. The paper shows that, by combining lexical, contextual (positional) and statistical information, instead of only one of these strategies, better results can be achieved in this task.", "paper_title": "Building a dictionary of anthroponyms", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800003"}
