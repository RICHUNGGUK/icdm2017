We extend the elastic-net regularization in compressive sensing to a more general setting, the matrix recovery setting, and consider the elastic-net regularization scheme for matrix recovery. To investigate on the statistical properties of this scheme and in particular on its convergence properties, we set up a suitable mathematic framework. We characterize some properties of the estimator and construct a natural iterative procedure to compute it. The convergence analysis shows that the sequence of iterates converges, which then underlies successful applications of the matrix elastic-net regularization algorithm. In addition, the error bounds of the proposed algorithm for low-rank matrix and even for full-rank matrix are presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "ELASTIC-NET REGULARIZATION FOR LOW-RANK MATRIX RECOVERY", "paper_id": "WOS:000310462400010"}
