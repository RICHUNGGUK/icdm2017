A phasor analysis based approach for determining the amplitude and phase noise of these oscillators is used. MOSFET operation in cut-off, linear and saturation regions is included. The calculated steady state output amplitude and phase noise from this analysis are in good agreement with Cadence Spectre simulations for different bias conditions. Application of this analysis to the design optimization of LC oscillators is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Analysis and design optimization of enhanced swing CMOS LC oscillators based on a phasor based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000350233900019"}
