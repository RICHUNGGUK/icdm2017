A numerical method is presented which allows to compute the spectrum with high accuracy. The method employs a fast Fourier transform to accurately represent the momentum variables and takes into account the twisted boundary conditions required by the presence of the magnetic field. An accuracy of 12 digits is attained even with coarse grids. Landau levels are reproduced in the case of a uniform magnetic field satisfying Dirac's condition. A new fine structure of levels within the single Landau level is formed when the field has a sinusoidal component with period commensurable to the integer magnetic charge. This fact is interpreted in terms of the peculiar symmetry Z(N) x Z(N) which holds in the unperturbed case.", "paper_title": "SPLITTING LANDAU LEVELS ON THE 2D TORUS BY PERIODIC PERTURBATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261382900011"}
