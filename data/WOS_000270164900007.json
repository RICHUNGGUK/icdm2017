The weights of the masks of the scheme are defined in terms of some values of trigonometric B-spline basis functions. The scheme has some interesting properties and it is compared with the 2-point and 3-point schemes generating uniform trigonometric spline curves of order 3 and 5. The comparison and the performance of the scheme are demonstrated by examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
