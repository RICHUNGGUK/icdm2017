However, the relationship between the use of IWBs and Technological Pedagogical Content and Knowledge (TPACK) by teachers is yet to be fully investigated and understood. The purpose of this study was to integrate IWB technology and peer coaching to develop the TPACK of secondary science teachers in real classrooms. An IWB-based peer coaching model was developed. Participants of this study included four in-service science teachers. The sources of data included written assignments, reflective journals and interviews. The results displayed three major findings. First, science teachers used IWBs as instructional tools to share their subject-matter knowledge and to express students' understanding. Second, the IWBs helped the science teachers who encountered teaching difficulties in the traditional classroom better implement their representational repertoires and instructional strategies. Finally, the proposed model of integrating IWBs and peer coaching can develop the TPACK of science teachers. The research implications of this study are provided along with suggestions.
