In this paper, a fuzzy cutting force modelling method based on subtractive clustering method filters the noise and estimates the instantaneous cutting forces using observations acquired by sensors during cutting experiments. In the experimental case study, four data sets of micromilling cutting force are used. Each data set is used to generate a learning system which is tested by the other three data sets. It is proven that the proposed algorithm has the capability to filter and model the cutting force in spite of uncertainties in the micromilling process.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy cutting force modelling in micro-milling", "paper_id": "WOS:000325313300017"}
