The watermark signal must not reduce the quality of host signal. Furthermore, it must be resistant to various attacks. In this paper, we will propose an intelligent audio watermarking method in terms of collaborating QR decomposition (QR factorization) method and Genetic Algorithm (GA). At the outset, the host signal is segmented into several frames. Then, every frame is decomposed by using QR decomposition method, and, subsequently, the best place for embedding the watermark bit which has a high robustness to the possible attacks is searched by using GA. In order to evaluate effectiveness of this method, we have examined the robustness of watermark against several attacks for several different audio signals. The results indicate that the proposed method has more robustness in comparison with previous robust audio watermarking methods.", "paper_title": "Audio watermarking method using QR decomposition and genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000349356400006"}
