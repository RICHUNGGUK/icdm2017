The detection and analysis of edges are key issues in image processing, computer vision and pattern recognition. Wavelet provides a powerful tool to analyze the local regularity of signals. Wavelet transform has been successfully applied to the analysis and detection of edges. A great number of wavelet-based edge detection methods have been proposed over the past years. The objective of this paper is to give a brief review of these methods, and encourage the research of this topic. In practice, an image is usually of multistructure edge, the identification of different edges, such as steps, curves and junctions play an important role in pattern recognition. In this paper, more attention is paid on the identification of different types of edges. We present the main idea and the properties of these methods.", "paper_title": "A REVIEW OF WAVELET-BASED EDGE DETECTION METHODS", "paper_id": "WOS:000314980200008"}
