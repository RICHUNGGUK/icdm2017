In this paper we proposed a intension recognition framework (i.e. classification system) for high accuracy which is based on Fuzzy-Rough Feature Selection and Multitree Genetic Programming. The enormous brain signal data measured by fNIRS are reduced by proposed feature selection and extracted the informative features. Also, proposed Multitree Genetic Programming use the remain data to construct the intension recognition model effectively. The performance of proposed classification system is demonstrated and compared with existing classifiers and unreduced dataset. Experimental results show that classification accuracy increases while number of features decreases in proposed system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
