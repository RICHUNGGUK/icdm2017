Recent studies have put the emphasis on the need for both efficient and flexible algorithms to construct the lattice. In this paper, the concept of attribute reduction of formal concept was proposed with its properties being discussed. The CL-Axiom and some equivalent conditions for an attributes subset to be a reduction of a formal concept are presented.", "paper_title": "Reduction-based approaches towards constructing Galois (concept) lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500016"}
