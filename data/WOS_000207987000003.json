While progress is being made in many of these areas, computers still lack the fluidity, adaptability, open-endedness, creativity, purposefulness, and insightfulness we associate with the supreme achievements of human cognitive ability. Reasons for this and prospects for overcoming these limitations are discussed.", "paper_title": "Is a Machine Realization of Truly Human-Like Intelligence Achievable?", "paper_id": "WOS:000207987000003"}
