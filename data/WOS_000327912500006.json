Namely, the aLoeexact solutionaLz suggested by the authors is not solution of the given fuzzy differential equation (FDE). Indeed, the authors have proposed an exact solution which is independent from the initial condition. So, we obtain the correct exact solution using the characterization theorem proposed by Bede et al. under Seikkala differentiability. Also, some details are given for the mentioned example.
