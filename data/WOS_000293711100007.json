In multivariate LPR, the multidimensional signals are modeled locally by a polynomial using least-squares (LS) criterion with a kernel controlled by a certain bandwidth matrix. Based on the traditional intersection confidence intervals (ICI) method, a new refined ICI (RICI) adaptive scale selector for symmetric kernel is developed to achieve a better bias-variance tradeoff. The method is further extended to steering kernel with local orientation to adapt better to local characteristics of multidimensional signals. The resulting multivariate LPR method called the steering-kernel-based LPR with refined ICI method (SK-LPR-RICI) is applied to the smoothing and reconstruction problems in noisy images. Simulation results show that the proposed SK-LPR-RICI method has a better PSNR and visual performance than conventional LPR-based methods in image processing.", "paper_title": "On Kernel Selection of Multivariate Local Polynomial Modelling and its Application to Image Smoothing and Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000293711100007"}
