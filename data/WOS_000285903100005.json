The objective is to minimize the total weighted completion times. First, a branch-and-bound algorithm incorporating with several dominance properties and two lower bounds are developed for the optimal solution. Then a genetic heuristic-based algorithm is proposed for a near-optimal solution. Finally, a computational experiment is conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed algorithms. The results show that the branch-and-bound algorithm can solve instances up to 15 jobs, and the average error percentage of the genetic heuristic algorithm is less than 0.105%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
