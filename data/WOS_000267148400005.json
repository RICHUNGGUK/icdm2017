To address this issue, an evolutionary game algorithm for grid resource allocation is proposed in this paper. The evolutionary game theory is introduced to study the selection process of user strategy from the dynamic viewpoint. Firstly, the problem of multiple users competing for a common resource is formulated as a symmetric game. Secondly, replicated dynamic mechanism is used to produce the evolutionary stable point that leads to a satisfied allocation scenario. Finally, the relationships among the evolutionary stable point, valuation functions, and convergence time are discussed in detail. The results of the experiments show that the proposed evolutionary game algorithm is convergent and generates better utility results compared with the classical game algorithm.
