However, the visual discomfort is still the common problem when audiences view the stereoscopic 3D video for a long time period. Most of the discomfort comes from the excessive or improper disparity. To ease this problem, the comfortable disparity modification for existing depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) system is proposed in this paper. The proposed method contains several main parts such as degree-dependent algorithm, disparity range determination, and zero-parallax region based disparity remapping. To achieve customized 3D perception, a novel 3D adjustment mechanism is also proposed. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method can adjust the disparity effectively, which will be a great help for existing DIBR systems to generate comfortable 3D videos.", "paper_title": "Comfortable Disparity Modification for Existing DIBR Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000362464100006"}
