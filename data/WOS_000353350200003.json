The key features of the MICHE-I dataset are a wide and diverse population of subjects, the use of different mobile devices for iris acquisition, realistic si mulation of the acquisition process (including noise), several data capture sessions separated in time, and image annotation using metadata. The aim of MICHE-I dataset is to make up the starting core of a wider dataset that we plan to collect, with the further aim to address interoperability, both in the sense of matching samples acquired with different devices and of assessing the robustness of algorithms to the use of devices with different characteristics. We discuss throughout the merits of MICHE-I with regard to biometric dimensions of interest including uncontrolled settings, demographics, interoperability, and real-world applications. We also consider the potential for MICHE-I to assist with developing continuous authentication aimed to counter adversarial spoofing and impersonation, when the bar for uncontrolled settings raises even higher for proper and effective defensive measures.
