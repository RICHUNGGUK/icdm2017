We also summarized the testing results of the hardened properties of a variety of waste LCD glass concretes and discussed the effect of factors such as the water-binder ratio (w/b), waste glass content (G) and age (t) on the concrete compressive strength, flexural strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity. This study also applied a hyperbolic function, an exponential function and a power function in a non-linear regression analysis of multiple variables and established the prediction model that could consider the effect of the water-binder ratio (w/b), waste glass content (G) and age (t) on the concrete compressive strength, flexural strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity. Compared with the testing results, the statistical analysis shows that the coefficient of determination R-2 and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were 0.93-0.96 and 5.4-8.4% for the compressive strength, 0.83-0.89 and 8.9-12.2% for the flexural strength and 0.87-0.89 and 1.8-2.2% for the ultrasonic pulse velocity, respectively. The proposed models are highly accurate in predicting the compressive strength, flexural strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity of waste LCD glass concrete. However, with other ranges of mixture parameters, the predicted models must be further studied.", "paper_title": "Predictive models of hardened mechanical properties of waste LCD glass concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000348593600005"}
