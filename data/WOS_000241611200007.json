We demonstrate how to construct a single-via-mask fabric to reduce the mask cost further, and we analyze the penalties which it incurs. To solve the routability problem commonly existing in fabric-based designs, an efficient white-space allocation and an incremental cell movement scheme are suggested, which help to provide a fast design convergence and early prediction of circuit's mappability to a given fabric.", "paper_title": "Via-configurable routing architectures and fast design mappability estimation for regular fabrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000241611200007"}
