Especially in the field of computer graphics, semi-regularity is an interesting property because it makes meshes highly suitable for multi-resolution analysis. In this paper, we survey the numerous remeshing algorithms that have been developed over the past two decades. We propose different classifications to give new and comprehensible insights into both existing methods and issues. We describe how considerable obstacles have already been overcome, and discuss promising perspectives.", "paper_title": "Semi-Regular Triangle Remeshing: A Comprehensive Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000350145600009"}
