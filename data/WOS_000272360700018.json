This paper focuses on autorotation, a common maneuver used to bring helicopters safely to the ground even in the case of loss of power to the main rotor. A novel nonlinear model predictive controller augmented with a recurrent neural network is presented that is capable of performing an autonomous autorotation. Main advantages of the proposed approach are on-line, real-time trajectory optimization and reduced hardware requirements.", "paper_title": "Autonomous Autorotation of Unmanned Rotorcraft using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000272360700018"}
