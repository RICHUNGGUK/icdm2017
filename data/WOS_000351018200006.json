The architecture was synthesized in 0.18 mu m technology and the clock frequency and area are 400 MHz and 16.8 Kgates, respectively. Also, it is able to filter 217 and 55 Frames per second (Fps) for Full- and Ultra-HD videos, respectively. The introduced architecture outperforms similar ones in terms of frequency (1.8 x up to 4 x), throughput, (1.5 x up to 3.8 x), and Fps. Moreover, extensions to support different sample bit-depths and chroma formats are included. Also, experimental results for different FPGA families are offered. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
