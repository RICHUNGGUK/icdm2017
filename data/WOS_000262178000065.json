Fortunately, some advanced technologies have been successfully applied to spam filtering, achieving promising results. Recently, we have introduced SPAMHUNTING, a successful spam filter able to address the concept drift problem by combining it relevant term identification technique with all evolving sliding window strategy. Several successful spam filtering techniques use continuous learning strategies to achieve better adaptation capabilities and address concept drift issues. Nevertheless, due to the presence of concept drift and hidden changes in the environment, the presence of obsolete and irrelevant knowledge becomes it serious drawback. Soon after the launch of the filter, many decisions are made based oil irrelevant and/or obsolete knowledge. Therefore, in such a situation, the use of forgetting strategies is as important as the implementation of continuous learning approaches. In this paper we introduce a novel technique designed for identifying and removing the obsolete and irrelevant knowledge that hits accumulated over to the passage of time. We have carried out several experiments to test for the suitability of our proposal showing the results obtained and its applicability. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
