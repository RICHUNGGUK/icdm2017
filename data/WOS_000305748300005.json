CFVS is the connected variant of the classical Feedback Vertex Set problem and is defined as follows: given a graph G=(V,E) and an integer k, decide whether there exists FaS dagger V, |F|a parts per thousand currency signk, such that G[Va-F] is a forest and G[F] is connected. We show that Connected Feedback Vertex Set can be solved in time O(2 (O(k)) n (O(1))) on general graphs and in time on graphs excluding a fixed graph H as a minor. Our result on general undirected graphs uses, as a subroutine, a parameterized algorithm for Group Steiner Tree, a well studied variant of Steiner Tree. We find the algorithm for Group Steiner Tree of independent interest and believe that it could be useful for obtaining parameterized algorithms for other connectivity problems.", "paper_title": "FPT algorithms for Connected Feedback Vertex Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000305748300005"}
