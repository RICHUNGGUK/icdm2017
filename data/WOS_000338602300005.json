In this general setting we obtain different properties on the factorization, gcd's and resultants of analytic polynomials, which seem to be new even in the context of Complex Analysis. Moreover, we extend the well-known Cauchy-Riemann conditions (for harmonic conjugates) to this algebraic framework, proving that the new conditions also characterize the components of generalized analytic polynomials.
