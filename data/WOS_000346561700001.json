Such systems assist users in gathering and analysing biometric data, and support the decision-making on the human behavioural pattern and/or authentication. As an example, the authors consider a facial biometric assistant that functions based on multi-spectral biometrics in visible and infrared bands; it involves facial expression recognition, face recognition in both spectra, as well as estimation of physiological parameters. The authors also investigate usage of facial biometrics for the semantic representation for advanced decision-making.", "paper_title": "Facial biometrics for situational awareness systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000346561700001"}
