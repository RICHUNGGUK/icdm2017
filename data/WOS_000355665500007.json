However, for nonlocal problems, like the fundamental class of connectivity problems, for a long time we did not know how to do this faster than tw(O(tw))|V|(O(1)). Recently, Cygan et al. (FOCS 2011) presented Monte Carlo algorithms for a wide range of connectivity problems running in time c(tw)|V|(O(1)) for a small constant c, e.g., for HAMILTONIAN CYCLE and STEINER TREE. Naturally, this raises the question whether randomization is necessary to achieve this runtime; furthermore, it is desirable to also solve counting and weighted versions (the latter without incurring a pseudo-polynomial cost in the runtime in terms of the weights). We present two new approaches rooted in linear algebra, based on matrix rank and determinants, which provide deterministic c(tw)|V|(O(1)) time algorithms, also for weighted and counting versions. For example, in this time we can solve TRAVELING SALESMAN or count the number of Hamiltonian cycles. The rank based ideas provide a rather general approach for speeding up even straightforward dynamic programming formulations by identifying \"small\" sets of representative partial solutions; we focus on the case of expressing connectivity via sets of partitions, but the essential ideas should have further applications. The determinant-based approach uses the Matrix Tree Theorem for deriving closed formulas for counting versions of connectivity problems; we show how to evaluate those formulas via dynamic programming.
