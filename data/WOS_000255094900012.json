We increase the discriminatory power of the h(1)-index by introducing three generalizations, each of which is a rational number. The first (h(1)(+)) measures the excess over the actual h-index, while the other two (h(1)*, h(1)(Delta)) measures the distance to the next h-index. At the individual level, h* and h(Delta) coincide while h(+) is undefined.", "paper_title": "Rational (successive) h-indices: An application to economics in the Republic of Ireland", "paper_id": "WOS:000255094900012"}
