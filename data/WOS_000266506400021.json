In this paper, well-posedness of the variational problem for the direct scattering is examined. An energy estimate for the scattered field is obtained on which the Born approximation is based. A regularized recursive linearization method for the inverse medium scattering, which reconstructs the scatterer of an inhomogeneous medium from the boundary measurements of the scattered field, is developed. The algorithm requires only single-frequency data. Using an initial guess from the Born approximation, each update is obtained via continuation on the spatial frequency of a two-parameter family of plane waves by solving one direct problem and one adjoint problem of the Maxwell equation.
