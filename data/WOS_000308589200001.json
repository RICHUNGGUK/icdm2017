This research focused on the individual's behavior toward self-disclosure online and his or her cognition on personal privacy that was affected by not only the personal psychological factors but also the individual's computer knowledge and associated skills. To study how technological and psychological factors can simultaneously affect one's privacy concern and restrain behavior on disclosure, this study applied both perceived privacy and privacy concern to assess such factors as personal subjective attitude, computer self-efficacy, and perceived behavioral control to investigate the technological influence. A hypothesized model was proposed to describe the relationships among these constructs. After structural equation modeling is utilized to analyze the proposed hypotheses, the research findings showed that, although the perceived behavioral control had a negative effect on self-disclosure online, all the other hypotheses indicated a positive casual effect.", "paper_title": "Exploring the Individual's Behavior on Self-Disclosure Online", "paper_id": "WOS:000308589200001"}
