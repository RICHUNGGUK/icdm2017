Decisions should be adaptive to get robust and accurate segmentation algorithms, avoid hazardous a priori and have a clear interpretation. We propose a decision process based on a contrario reasoning: two regions are meaningfully different if the probability of observing such a difference in pure noise is very low. Since the existing analytical methods are intractable in our case, we extend them to allow a mixed use of analytical computations and Monte-Carlo simulations. The resulting decision criterion is tested experimentally through a simple merging algorithm, which can be used as a post-filtering and validation step for existing segmentation methods.
