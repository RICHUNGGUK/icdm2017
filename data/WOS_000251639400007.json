We propose a method for continuous range query processing for different types of queries, characterized by mobility of objects and/or queries which all follow paths in an underlying spatial network. The method assumes an available 2D indexing scheme for indexing spatial network data. An appropriately extended R-tree, that primarily is used as an indexing scheme for network segments, provides matching of queries and objects according to their locations on the network or their network routes. The method introduces an additional pre-refinement step which generates main-memory data structures to support efficient, incremental reevaluation of continuous range queries in periodically performed refinement steps.
