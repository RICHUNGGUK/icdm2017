This logic, however, does not consider specific properties of functions or predicates at all, e.g. associative property of addition. In order to ease this problem, we introduce \"equivalence constraint\" that is a set of formulas representing the properties of functions and predicates, and check the satisfiability of formulas under the constraint. In this report, we show an algorithm for checking satisfiability with equivalence constraint and also experimental results.", "paper_title": "Satisfiability checking for logic with equality and uninterpreted functions under equivalence constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700017"}
