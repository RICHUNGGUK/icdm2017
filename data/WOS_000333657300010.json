In this paper a new cluster validity measure which adopts a non-metric distance measure based on the idea of \"line symmetry\" is presented. The proposed validity measure can be applied in finding the number of clusters of different geometrical structures. Several data sets are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed measure.", "paper_title": "A New Measure of Cluster Validity Using Line Symmetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000333657300010"}
