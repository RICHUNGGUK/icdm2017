These randomly occurring lags could act as short breaks and improve performance or as short interruptions and impair performance. The lags improved placekeeping accuracy, and to interpret this effect we developed a cognitive model of placekeeping operations, which accounts for the effect in terms of the lag making memory for recent performance more distinct. Self-report data suggest that rehearsal was the dominant strategy for maintaining placekeeping information during interruptions, and we incorporate a rehearsal mechanism in the model. To evaluate the model we developed a simple new goodness-of-fit test based on analysis of variance that offers an inferential basis for rejecting models that do not accommodate effects of experimental manipulations.
