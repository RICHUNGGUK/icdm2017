The morphology and membrane fluctuation of healthy RBCs are investigated by adapting post-image processing which automatically quantify the morphological properties of RBCs, such as perimeter, mean diameter, cell volume, cell thickness and membrane fluctuation. Moreover, morphological variation of malaria parasite-infected RBCs and hypertonic-shocked RBCs was observed. As another biological application, HUVECs cultured on collagen films and their abnormal deformations caused by collagenase are observed using DHM to understand the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) structure on atheroprotective effect and endothelial dysfunction.", "paper_title": "Cellular imaging using phase holographic microscopy: for the study of pathophysiology of red blood cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000340668800009"}
