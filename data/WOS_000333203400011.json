First, the video is represented as a complete undirected graph and a binary tree is formed using normalized cut algorithm to select key frames. Then, the pixels of each key frame are modeled as a Markov Random Field and another graph model is formed to extract foreground by graph cut. Finally, the fourth-order cumulant of foreground is computed to generate video fingerprints. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has good robustness and discrimination.", "paper_title": "Video fingerprinting based on graph model", "paper_id": "WOS:000333203400011"}
