However, this regulatory framework often yields anticonsumer outcomes. The author argues that public policy should instead permit competitive market forces to allocate airwave rights among rival users. One mechanism for accomplishing this shift is to move away from administrative allocations to a general regime of exclusive property rights.", "paper_title": "The spectrum-allocation debate: An analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000240679200010"}
