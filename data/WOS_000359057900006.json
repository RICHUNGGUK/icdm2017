Design/methodology/approach - First, for each type of attribute aspiration, the calculation formula of utility values of alternative concerning attributes is given. Then, using the calculation formulae, the attribute values are transformed into the corresponding utility values. On the basis of this, the overall ranking value of each alternative is calculated. Further, a ranking order of alternatives can be determined according to the obtained overall ranking values. Findings - Research shows that it is necessary to develop the method for MADM with attribute aspirations. The example shows that the proposed method is applicable. Practical implications - The proposed method can be applied to the selection of wastewater treatment technologies or other areas. Originality/value - This paper proposes a new MADM method with multiple types of attribute aspirations. It develops and enriches the existing MADM methods.", "paper_title": "MADM method considering attribute aspirations with an application to selection of wastewater treatment technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000359057900006"}
