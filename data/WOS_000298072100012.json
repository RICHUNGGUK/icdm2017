Increased variety and volume of attacks is inevitable given the desire of financially and criminally-motivated actors to obtain personal and confidential information, as highlighted in this paper. We describe how the Routine Activity Theory can be applied to mitigate these risks by reducing the opportunities for cyber crime to occur, making cyber crime more difficult to commit and by increasing the risks of detection and punishment associated with committing cyber crime. Potential research questions are also identified. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
