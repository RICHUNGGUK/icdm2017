Context information has several qualities that make the development of these services challenging, compared to conventional, Web services. Therefore, sound software engineering practices are needed during their development and execution. This article discusses a novel software engineering-based approach, which leverages the benefits of model-driven architecture, aspect-oriented modeling, and formal model checking, for modeling and verifying context-aware services. The approach is explored using a real-world case study in intelligent transport. An evaluation framework is established to validate the main methods and tools employed.", "paper_title": "Context-Aware Services Engineering: Models, Transformations, and Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000300401100002"}
