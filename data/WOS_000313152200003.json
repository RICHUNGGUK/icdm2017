We have then formulated four hypotheses by linking the two dimensions to software maintenance time. These hypotheses were tested using maintenance data from 352 open source software projects. This study contributes to open source software maintenance literature by demonstrating the effects of the two governance dimensions on open source software maintenance outcomes.
