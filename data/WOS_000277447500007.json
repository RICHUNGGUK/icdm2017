Despite considerable advances in the topological analysis of metabolic networks, inadequate knowledge of the enzyme kinetic rate laws and their associated parameter values still hampers large-scale kinetic modelling. Furthermore, the integration of gene expression and protein levels into kinetic models is not straightforward. Results: The focus of our research is on streamlining the construction of large-scale kinetic models. A novel software tool was developed, which enables the generation of generic rate equations for all reactions in a model. It encompasses an algorithm for estimating the concentration of proteins for a reaction to reach a particular steady state when kinetic parameters are unknown, and two robust methods for parameter estimation. It also allows for the seamless integration of gene expression or protein levels into a reaction and can generate equations for both transcription and translation. We applied this methodology to model the yeast glycolysis pathway; our results show that the behaviour of the system can be accurately described using generic kinetic equations. Availability and implementation: The software tool, together with its source code in Java, is available from our project web site at http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/schwartz/grape Contact: jean-marc.schwartz@manchester.ac.uk Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "paper_title": "Streamlining the construction of large-scale dynamic models using generic kinetic equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000277447500007"}
