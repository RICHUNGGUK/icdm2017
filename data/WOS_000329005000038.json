However counter-intuitive results can be encountered when unreliable bodies of evidence are combined by using Dempster's rule of combination in some cases. In this paper, a novel sequential evidence combination approach is proposed based on the weighted modification of bodies of evidence according to our proposed variances of evidence sequences. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is rational and effective. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
