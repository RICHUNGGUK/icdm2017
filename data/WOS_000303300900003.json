Multiple faults of different patterns are considered in a complex hybrid system and these faults can happen either in a detectable mode or in a non-detectable mode. A method for multiple fault isolation is introduced for situation of lacking information on fault pattern and mode change. The nature of faults in a monitored system can be classified as abrupt faults and incipient faults. Under abrupt fault assumption, i.e. constant values for fault parameters, fault identification is inappropriate to handle cases related to incipient fault. Without information on fault nature, it is difficult to achieve fault estimation. Situation is further complicated when mode change is unknown after fault occurrence. In this work, fault pattern is represented by a binary vector to reduce computational complexity of fault identification. Mode change is parameterized as a discontinuous function. Based on these new representations, a multiple hybrid differential evolution algorithm is developed to identify fault pattern vector, abrupt fault parameter/incipient fault dynamic coefficient, and mode change indexes. Simulation and experiment results are reported to validate the proposed method. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
