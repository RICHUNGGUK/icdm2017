The proposed method generates images of arbitrary viewpoints by view interpolation of real camera images near the chosen viewpoints. In this method, cameras do not need to be strongly calibrated since projective geometry between cameras is employed for the interpolation. For avoiding the complex and unreliable process of 3-D recovery, object scenes are segmented into several regions according to the geometric property of the scene. Dense correspondence between real views, which is necessary for intermediate view generation, is automatically obtained by applying projective geometry to each region. By superimposing intermediate images for all regions, virtual views for the entire soccer scene are generated. The efforts for camera calibration are reduced and correspondence matching requires no manual operation; hence, the proposed method can be easily applied to dynamic events in a large space. An application for fly-through observations of soccer match replays is introduced along with the algorithm of view synthesis and experimental results. This is a new approach for providing arbitrary views of an entire dynamic event.", "paper_title": "Virtual viewpoint replay for a soccer match by view interpolation from multiple cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000249842000007"}
