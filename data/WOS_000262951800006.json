After the signals are processed, they can be used as a control source of multifunction prostheses. The myoelectric signals are represented by wavelet transform model parameters. For this purpose, four different arm movements (elbow extension, elbow flexion, wrist supination and wrist pronation) are considered in studying muscle contraction. Wavelet parameters of myoelectric signals received from the muscles for these different movements were used as features to classify the electromyographic signals in a fuzzy clustering neural network classifier model. After 1000 iterations, the average recognition percentage of the test was found to be 97.67% with clustering into 10 features. The fuzzy clustering neural network programming language was developed using Pascal under Delphi.", "paper_title": "Differentiating types of muscle movements using a wavelet based fuzzy clustering neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000262951800006"}
