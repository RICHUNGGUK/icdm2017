The oscillator is stable over the entire temperature range of 100 degrees C. The monolithic distributed oscillator (DO) is designed and fabricated in an industry standard 0.18 mu m CMOS process, using an n-FET-based traveling wave amplifier (TWA), coplanar waveguides (CPW), and a new coplanar interconnect structure called a 'folded CPW'. The measured loss of the \"folded CPW\" is 1.259 dB at 10 GHz. The distributed oscillator uses a novel architecture of G(m)-varied gain cells and operates at a bias of 1.8 V. The measured oscillation frequency is 11.7 GHz with 6.1 dBm output power and the measured phase noise is -116.02 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, which represent the best reported power and one of the best phase noise results for silicon DOs with temperature stability.", "paper_title": "Temperature Characteristics and Analysis of Monolithic Microwave CMOS Distributed Oscillators With G(m)-Varied Gain Cells and Folded Coplanar Interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000305181800018"}
