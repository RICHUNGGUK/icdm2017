Different from existing fuzzy filters, the proposed ones are designed in finite-frequency domain. First, a so-called finite-frequency l(2) gain is defined that extends the standard l(2) gain. Then, a sufficient condition for the filtering-error system with a finite-frequency l(2) gain is derived. Based on the obtained condition, three fuzzy filters are designed to deal with noises in the low-, middle-, and high-frequency domain, respectively. The proposed fuzzy-filtering method can get a better noise-attenuation performance when frequency ranges of noises are known beforehand. An example about a tunnel-diode circuit is given to illustrate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Filter Design for Nonlinear Systems in Finite-Frequency Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000283370100008"}
