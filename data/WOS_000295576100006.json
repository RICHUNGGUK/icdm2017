The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem governed by a transport equation, i.e. we aim at finding a flow field which transports the first image as close as possible to the second image. This approach bears similarities with the Horn and Schunck method for optical flow calculation but in fact the model is quite different. The images are modeled in the space of functions of bounded variation and an analysis of solutions of transport equations in this space is included. Moreover, the existence of optimal controls is proven and necessary conditions are derived. Finally, two algorithms are given and numerical results are compared with existing methods. The new method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and even outperforms several existing methods.", "paper_title": "Image Sequence Interpolation Using Optimal Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000295576100006"}
