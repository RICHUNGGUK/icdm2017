This process plays pivotal role for devices like printers, plasma panels, LCD displays, etc. The bi-level images can be considered as binary images where '0' and '1' correspond to black and white, respectively. This paper investigates potential of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) to generate faithful binary halftone patterns. The cost function addresses important characteristics of original images and pleasant visual appearance of halftone images. The paper also shows the application of pattern look-up-table (p-LUT) approach to address the high processing time of BPSO optimization and simple gradient-based edge enhancement for improved edge retention. Results are evaluated subjectively by statistical measures and psychovisual test. Results are evaluated objectively using image quality evaluation metrics as well. The comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques are also drawn. The evaluation results along with the comparisons show the competitive potential of the presented technique. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
