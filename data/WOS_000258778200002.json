This metric is induced by quickest paths according to the Manhattan metric and an accelerating transportation network that consists of c non-intersecting axis-parallel line segments. We describe an algorithm that constructs the city Voronoi diagram ( including quickest path information) using O((c+n) polylog(c+n)) time and storage by means of a wavefront expansion. For c is an element of Omega (root nlog(3)n) our algorithm is faster than an algorithm by Aichholzer et al., which takes O(n log n + c(2) log c) time.", "paper_title": "Constructing the city Voronoi diagram faster", "paper_id": "WOS:000258778200002"}
