Our mechanism adaptively clusters the mobile hosts in fewer cells to minimize the bandwidth consumption. In addition, we adaptively code the data according to the data temporarily stored in each mobile host with a distributed manner. Our mechanism allows each delivered message to be coded from only a subset of data to further reduce the number of required messages. We formulate the cell selection and broadcast coding problem with integer programming and prove that the problem is NP-hard. We design a distributed algorithm based on Lagrangean relaxation. Our algorithm needs no server to record the location, queried, and stored information of receivers. Moreover, our algorithm is adaptive to the dynamic group membership, mobility, queried, and stored data of receivers.", "paper_title": "Data Broadcast with Adaptive Network Coding in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000260889600009"}
