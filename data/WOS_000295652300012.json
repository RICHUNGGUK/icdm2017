The qubit is inductively coupled to a low-frequency resonator, which in turn is connected with a classical measurement device (phase meter). The resonator drives adiabatic oscillations of the supercurrent in the qubit loop. The back reaction of the qubit loop on the resonator depends on the qubit state. Measuring the phase shift of the resonator's oscillations one can determine the state of the qubit. Numerical computations with available experimental parameters show that the phase difference between the two qubit states increases at a rate of 0.0044 rad/ns with the fidelity of about 0.9989 and the measurement time of about 100 ns. The fidelity of the measurement is estimated taking into consideration possible quantum transitions inside and outside the qubit manifold. An increase of the phase difference is possible but it is linked to a reduction of the fidelity. The requirements for the reproducibility of the qubit and resonator parameters are formulated.", "paper_title": "NON-DEMOLITION ADIABATIC MEASUREMENT OF THE PHASE QUBIT STATE", "paper_id": "WOS:000295652300012"}
