How can one communicate with architectural spaces, through one's movement or even one's appearance? One goal of the project N Files - A Space To React is it to develop a system which supports the interaction between spatial areas and its users. A space, which is changing with and through the user....which reacts to the user's input. The basis for such experiments was laid in research fields such as Ambient Intelligence (AmI), Ubiquitous Computing or Hybrid Environments. If take these new communication and interaction possibilities some steps further, then it becomes clear that our traditional sense of space will be transformed radically by them.", "paper_title": "N'Files - A space to react.
