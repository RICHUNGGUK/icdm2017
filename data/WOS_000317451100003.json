Some interesting properties are studied and several parameters are defined for use in shape description and classification. When these parameters are applied to describe convex figures, they are closely related with the measure of congruent segments of fixed length within the convex figure. Finally, an experimental study is conducted to show the goodness obtained when using the generalized support function in shape classification. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
