The primary target of statins is HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. However, statins elicit pleitropic responses including beneficial as well as adverse effects in the liver or other organs. Today, the regulatory mechanisms that cause these pleiotropic effects are not sufficiently understood. Results: In this work, genome-wide RNA expression changes in primary human hepatocytes of six individuals were measured at up to six time points upon atorvastatin treatment. A computational analysis workflow was applied to reconstruct regulatory mechanisms based on these drug-response data and available knowledge about transcription factor (TF) binding specificities and protein-drug interactions. Several previously unknown TFs were predicted to be involved in atorvastatin-responsive gene expression. The novel relationships of nuclear receptors NR2C2 and PPARA on CYP3A4 were successfully validated in wet-lab experiments.", "paper_title": "Inferring statin-induced gene regulatory relationships in primary human hepatocytes", "paper_id": "WOS:000294755400001"}
