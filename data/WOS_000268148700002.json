The method creates a Bayesian network to model the thesaurus and uses probabilistic inference to select the set of descriptors having high posterior probability of being relevant given the available evidence (the document to be classified). Our model can be used without having preclassified training documents, although it improves its performance as long as more training data become available. We have tested the classification model using a document dataset containing parliamentary resolutions from the regional Parliament of Andalucia at Spain, which were manually indexed from the Eurovoc thesaurus, also carrying out an experimental comparison with other standard text classifiers.
