Methods: Using a pre-post study design, we compared rates of preventive health delivery to HIV patients at an outpatient clinic during the use of a paper medical record (PMR) and after implementation of an EMR. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted at two time points: 12-16 months prior to and 24 months following EMR implementation. The records of 160 active patients were randomly selected for review during both time periods. Results: There was no difference between the PMR and EMR samples with regard to the proportion of patients who had hepatitis A (83% in PMR group; 77% in EMR) and hepatitis C (94% in both groups) serologies measured or the proportion of eligible patients who were given hepatitis vaccinations. Slightly fewer patients had a serology for hepatitis B measured in the EMR sample. Conclusions: As EMR implementation expands, it is important to evaluate the effects that EMRs have on patient outcomes, including preventive health provision. Our study showed that after implementation of an EMR, the provision of most preventive care measures did not improve. This finding is in agreement with many published studies. Some studies have found positive effects from EMRs that may be attributable to specific aspects of EMRs. Further study of the effect of specific EMR attributes on health care outcomes is needed.
