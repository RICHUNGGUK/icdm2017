We analyze the presence of long-range dependence in on-chip processor traffic and we study the impact of long-range dependence on networks-on-chip. long-range dependence in communication traces of processor IPS at the cycle-accurate level. We also study the impact of long-range dependence on a real network-on-chip using the SocLib simulation environment and traffic generators of our own. Our experiments show that long-range dependence is not an ubiquitous property of on-chip processor traffic and that its impact on the network-on-chip is highly correlated with the low level communication protocol used.
