Initially, four experiments have been conducted including the DWT feature selection and filter choice, features optimisation by coefficient selections and feature threshold. To examine the most suitable method of feature extraction, different wavelet quadrant and scales have been evaluated, and it is followed with an evaluation of different wavelet filter choices and their impact on recognition accuracy. In this study, an approach for face recognition based on coefficient selection for DWT is presented, and the significant of DWT coefficient threshold selection is also analysed. For the hardware implementation, two architectures for two-dimensional (2-D) Haar wavelet transform (HWT) IP core with transpose-based computation and dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) have been synthesised using VHDL and implemented on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGAs. Experimental results and comparisons between different configurations using partial and non-partial reconfiguration processes and a detailed performance analysis of the area, power consumption and maximum frequency are also discussed in this paper.", "paper_title": "FPGA-based IP cores implementation for face recognition using dynamic partial reconfiguration", "paper_id": "WOS:000323256000008"}
