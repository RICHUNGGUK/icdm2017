By using the operation, we can avoid the problem of infinite local ambiguity. This paper further proposes a restricted version of the adjoining operation, which preserves lexical dependencies of partial parse trees. Our experimental results showed that the restriction enhances the accuracy of the incremental parsing.", "paper_title": "Incremental Parsing with Adjoining Operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190800003"}
