Based upon technology acceptance model (TAM) and unique features of GPS devices, a self-administered questionnaire was designed and used to collect empirical data. The results obtained from hierarchical regressions revealed that (1) perceived ease of use has a significant positive effect on perceived usefulness: (2) all perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use have significant positive effects on attitude toward usage; (3) attitude toward usage has also a significant positive effect on behavior intention, and (4) personal innovativeness is found to moderate the relationship between attitude and behavior intention. The implications of findings were discussed. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
