Using these techniques, the proposed charge pump eliminates reversion loss and improves driving capability. A test chip is designed in a 46-nm CMOS process, whose evaluation results show that, with no loading current, the proposed CMOS charge pump achieves 9.1% improvement of voltage conversion ratio. They also show that the proposed charge pump provides up to 132% improvement on current driving capability, as compared with the conventional CMOS charge pumps.", "paper_title": "CMOS Charge Pump With No Reversion Loss and Enhanced Drivability", "paper_id": "WOS:000337167600021"}
