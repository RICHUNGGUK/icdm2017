In order to prevent transgression of the constraint, a barrier Lyapunov function is employed, which grows to infinity when its arguments approach domain boundaries. Under the simultaneous domination assumption, a continuous controller for the switched system is constructed. Furthermore, asymptotic tracking is achieved without violation of the constraint, and all closed-loop signals keep bounded, when a mild requirement on the initial condition is satisfied. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Tracking control for output-constrained nonlinear switched systems with a barrier Lyapunov function", "paper_id": "WOS:000315656100016"}
