We discuss three techniques that by exploiting information embedded in low-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are able to yield a satisfactory design at a low computational cost, usually corresponding to a few evaluations of the original, high-fidelity CEO model to be optimized. The specific techniques considered here include multi-level design optimization, space mapping, and shape-preserving response prediction. All of them use the same prediction-correction scheme, however, they differ in the way the low-fidelity model information it utilized to construct the surrogate model. The presented techniques are illustrated using three specific cases of transonic airfoil design involving lift maximization and drag minimization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
