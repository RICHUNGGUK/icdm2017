Real-time traffic, such as voice and video streaming, is very sensitive to delay, but can stand a certain level of packet loss. We therefore propose an adaptive error-recovery scheme which adjusts the size of the ECB to reflect the environment of the mobile nodes so as to meet the required service quality (target bit error-rate), while reducing the latency of real-time applications, decoding complexity, and memory requirement. Extensive simulation results show the effectiveness of our adaptive approach compared to the current static scheme. Our scheme achieves near-optimal service latency while meeting the target service quality criterion, and also reduces energy consumption during error recovery.", "paper_title": "Adaptive error recovery in cdma2000 1xEV-DO mobile broadcast networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300111"}
