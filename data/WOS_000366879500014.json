The device may communicate with other devices without any communication infrastructure whenever these devices are sufficiently close. In view of energy consumption, this approach, i.e., infra-less communication is considerably cheaper and more efficient since energy dissipation grows with at least the square of the distance. With this \"energy wise\" approach, batteryless and contact-less communication nodes are becoming increasingly attractive for future pervasive computing. In this paper, we study important design considerations and technical limitations for realizing such a device, and then we propose D(2)ART (Direct Data Accessing from Passive RFID Tag) that not only performs as a normal passive RFID tag for identification, but also provides rich information such as multimedia to a reader with extreme low power consumption. Our fabricated D(2)ART IC is operational within 7-8 cm at data transmission rate of 5 Mbps by interfacing with a conventional flash memory according to the measurement and post-layout simulation results with reasonable assumptions.
