Data were collected from 10 experiments with rumen fistulated dairy cows, resulting in a dataset of 138 observations. Feature selection was based on correlation and principal component analysis, and background physiological knowledge. Different ANN architectures and training algorithms were assessed. The evaluation of the model performance, based on the test dataset, showed a root mean square prediction error, expressed relative to the observed mean, of 2.65%, 7.67% and 7.61% of the observed mean for acetate, propionate and butyrate, respectively. Compared to a multi-linear regression model, the ANN revealed not to perform significantly better. However, the results confirm that milk fatty acids have great potential to predict molar proportions of individual volatile fatty acids in the rumen. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
