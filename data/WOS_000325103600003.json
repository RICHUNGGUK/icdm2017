We address the issue of using mobile mules to collect data from these sensor nodes. In such an environment, both data-collection latency and network lifetime are critical issues. We model this problem as a bi-objective problem, called energy-constrained mule traveling salesman problem (EM-TSP), which aims at minimizing the traversal paths of mobile mules such that at least one node in each subnetwork is visited by a mule and the maximum energy consumption among all sensor nodes does not exceed a pre-defined threshold. Interestingly, the traversal problem turns out to be a generalization of the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP), an NP-complete problem. With some geometrical properties of the network, we propose some efficient heuristics for EM-TSP. We then extend our heuristics to multiple mobile mules. Extensive simulation results have been conducted, which show that our proposed solutions usually give much better solutions than most TSP-like approximations.
