Nevertheless, programming all these devices efficiently requires too much specific knowledge about the devices, their hardware architectures and specific programming languages, details about system communication low-level protocols, and other tricky details at the system level. To address these issues, this paper describes and analyses two of the most interesting service-oriented architectures (SOA) available, which exhibit characteristics that are well adapted to industrial robotics cells. To compare, discuss and evaluate their programming features and applicability a test bed was specially designed, and the two SOA are fully implemented to program the test bed. Special focus is given to the way services are specified and to the orchestration tools used to manage system logic. The obtained results show clearly that using integrations schemes based on SOA reduces system integration time and are more adapted to industrial robotic cell system integrators.
