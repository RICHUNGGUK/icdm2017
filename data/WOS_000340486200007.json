They are systems in which heterogeneous and autonomous agents may need to coexist in a complex social and legal framework that can evolve to address the different and often conflicting objectives of the many stakeholders involved. This thesis presents ROMAS, a set of methods and tools for analyzing and designing systems of this kind. ROMAS integrates the analysis, design and verification of these systems by means of a metamodel, a methodology that includes specific development guidelines and a model-driven CASE tool.", "paper_title": "Engineering regulated open multiagent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340486200007"}
