The semisimple case (i.e., when the defining polynomials of the code have no repeated roots) is specifically addressed. These codes extend in a natural way the abelian codes, of which additive cyclic codes of odd length are a particular case. Duality of these codes is also studied.", "paper_title": "Additive semisimple multivariable codes over", "paper_id": "WOS:000321585800003"}
