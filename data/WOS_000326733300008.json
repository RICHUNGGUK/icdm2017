Yet, similarly to ultrasound, optoacoustics is a time-resolved imaging method, thus, fast 3-D imaging implies real-time acquisition and processing of high speed data from hundreds of detectors simultaneously, which presents significant technological challenges. Herein we present a highly efficient graphical processing unit (GPU) framework for real-time reconstruction and visualization of 3-D tomographic optoacoustic data. By utilizing a newly developed 3-D optoacoustic scanner, which simultaneously acquires signals with a handheld 256-element spherical ultrasonic array system, we further demonstrate tracking of deep tissue human vasculature rendered at a rate of 10 volumetric frames per second. The flexibility provided by the handheld hardware design, combined with the real-time operation, makes the developed platform highly usable for both clinical imaging practice and small animal research applications.", "paper_title": "Volumetric Real-Time Tracking of Peripheral Human Vasculature With GPU-Accelerated Three-Dimensional Optoacoustic Tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000326733300008"}
