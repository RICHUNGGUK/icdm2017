However, when applying the multipath routing to a factory where huge robots are moving around, if closer multiple routes are selected, the probability that they are blocked by the robots at the same time becomes higher, so the reliability in terms of packet loss rate cannot be enhanced. In this paper, we propose a multipath routing method which can select physically distant multiple routes without any knowledge on the locations of nodes. We introduce a single metric composed of \"the distance between routes\" and \"the route quality\" by means of scalarization in multi-objective maximization problem and apply a genetic algorithm (GA) for searching for adequate routes which maximize the metric. Computer simulation results show that the proposed method can adaptively control the topologies of selected routes between S and D, and effectively reduce the packet loss rates.", "paper_title": "A Distant Multipath Routing Method for Reliable Wireless Multi-Hop Data Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000302834500007"}
