The traditional Yager's OWA operator focuses exclusively on the aggregation of crisp numbers. However, human experts usually tend to express their opinions or preferences in a very natural way via linguistic terms. Type-2 fuzzy sets provide an efficient way of knowledge representation for modeling linguistic terms. In order to aggregate linguistic opinions via OWA mechanism, we propose a new type of OWA operator, termed type-2 OWA operator, to aggregate the linguistic opinions or preferences in human decision making modeled by type-2 fuzzy sets. A Direct Approach to aggregating interval type-2 fuzzy sets by type-2 OWA operator is suggested in this paper. Some examples are provided to delineate the proposed technique.
