Imprecise and uncertain values are usually expressed by means of linguistic terms, specially when they have been provided by or for a human being. However, in many applications it is desirable that both aspects are combined into a single value that appropriately describes the intended information. In this work, we extend our previous research on this topic and we study how to combine imprecision and uncertainty when both of them are expressed by fuzzy numbers and the final goal is to obtain a normalized fuzzy value that provides the same amount of information about the described fact.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy certainty on fuzzy values", "paper_id": "WOS:000279808100003"}
