(*) From this characterisation, we then deduce that a quasi-metric space (X, d) is Smyth-complete if and only if BX is a dcpo satisfying condition (*). We also give characterisations in terms of formal balls for sequentially Yoneda complete quasi-metric spaces and for Yoneda complete T(1) quasi-metric spaces.
