The specific objective of this investigation was to compare and contrast both approaches to increase the readers' understanding of each approach. We also identify which, if any, excels in a particular area, and to look for potential synergism between them. This comparison is presented according to 10 different criteria, with some indication of which one excels at each particular facet of performance. We focus the comparison on how each would represent human tactical behavior, either in a simulation or in the real world. Conceptually, these two context-driven approaches are not at the same representational level. This could provide an opportunity in the future to combine them synergistically.", "paper_title": "Comparing two context-driven approaches for representation of human tactical behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000260272400004"}
