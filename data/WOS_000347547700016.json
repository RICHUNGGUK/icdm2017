The uncertainty return forms of the gain lead to the complexity of the whole gain process in the problem we propose. The gain path is usually concurrent and consecutive to the timeline in practice; thus, we are unable to solve the problem and obtain the optimal path or overall gain at a certain time using the optimal path algorithm alone. Therefore, the N-gram distribution and unification gain model, which utilises a new dynamic programming algorithm in solving problems, is proposed. This procedure facilitates the solving of similar comprehensive gain problems and obtaining important information, such as the optimal gain path and the overall gain.", "paper_title": "N-gram distribution and unification gain problem and its optimal solution", "paper_id": "WOS:000347547700016"}
