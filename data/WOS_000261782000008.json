For Pauli channels, this task can be accomplished by a version of the belief propagation algorithm used for decoding sparse classical codes. Quantum codes pose two new challenges however. Firstly, their Tanner graph unavoidably Contain Small loops Which typically undermines the performance of belief propagation. Secondly, sparse quantum codes are by definition highly degenerate. The standard belief propagation algorithm does riot exploit this feature, but rather it is impaired by it. We propose heuristic methods to improve belief Propagation decoding, specifically targeted at these two problems. While our results exhibit a clear improvement due to the proposed heuristic methods, they also indicate that the main source of errors in the quantum coding scheme remains in the decoding.", "paper_title": "ON THE ITERATIVE DECODING OF SPARSE QUANTUM CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000261782000008"}
