All processes can communicate directly with others via reliable FIFO channels. We discuss two problems. The multidimensional Byzantine consensus problem, for synchronous systems, requires processes to decide on a single -dimensional vector , inside the convex hull of -dimensional vectors that were input by the non-faulty processes. Also, the multidimensional Byzantine approximate agreement (MBAA) problem, for asynchronous systems, requires processes to decide on multiple -dimensional vectors in , all within a fixed Euclidean distance of each other, and inside the convex hull of -dimensional vectors that were input by the non-faulty processes. We obtain the following results for the problems above, while tolerating up to Byzantine failures in systems with complete communication graphs: (1) In synchronous systems, is necessary and sufficient to solve the multidimensional consensus problem. (2) In asynchronous systems, is necessary and sufficient to solve the multidimensional approximate agreement problem. Our sufficiency proofs are constructive, giving explicit protocols for the problems. In particular, for the MBAA problem, we give two protocols with strictly different properties and applications.", "paper_title": "Multidimensional agreement in Byzantine systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000365311500005"}
