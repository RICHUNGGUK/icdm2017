We argue that this choice can produce sub-optimal results both in terms of the number of acquired pictures and the quality of the resulting HDR image. This paper presents a method to estimate the full irradiance histogram of a scene, and a strategy to select the set of exposures that need to be acquired. Our selection usually requires a smaller or equal set of LDRs, yet produces higher quality HDR images.", "paper_title": "Metering for Exposure Stacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000306181100011"}
