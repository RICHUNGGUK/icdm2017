For instance, while web search engines traditionally retrieve the same results for all users, they began to offer beta services to personalize the results to adapt to user-specific contexts such as prior search history or other application contexts. In a clear contrast to search engines dealing with unstructured text data, this paper studies how to enable such personalization in the context of structured data retrieval. In particular, we adopt contextual ranking model to formalize personalization as a cost-based optimization over collected contextual rankings. With this formalism, personalization can be abstracted as a cost-optimal retrieval of contextual ranking, closely matching user-specific retrieval context. With the retrieved matching context, we adopt a machine learning approach, to effectively and efficiently identify the ideal personalized ranked results for this specific user. Our empirical evaluations over synthetic and real-life data validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
