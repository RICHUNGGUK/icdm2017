Based on Lyapunov stability theory, adaptive synchronisation criterion is obtained. The analytical results show that under the designed adaptive controllers, the complex networks with derivative coupling and time-varying coupling delay can realise synchronisation. Furthermore, the coupling matrix is not assumed to be symmetric or irreducible, and the weight configuration matrices can be identified. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theory.", "paper_title": "Synchronisation of complex networks with derivative coupling via adaptive control", "paper_id": "WOS:000320191500001"}
