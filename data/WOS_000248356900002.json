Traditionally, the decision-making strategies underlying the grid management mechanisms rely on the physical view of the grid resource model. This entails the need for complex multi-dimensional search strategies and a considerable level of resource state information exchange between the grid management domains. In this paper we argue that with the adoption of service oriented grid architectures, a logical service-oriented view of the resource model provides a more appropriate level of abstraction to express the grid capacity to handle incoming service requests. In this respect, we propose a quantification model of the aggregated service capacity of the hosting environment that is updated based on the monitored state of the various environmental resources required by the hosted services. A comparative experimental validation of the model shows its performance towards enabling an adequate exploitation of provisioned services.", "paper_title": "A model of grid service capacity", "paper_id": "WOS:000248356900002"}
