This paper is first devoted to such a novel description of coloured textures by LRS (local relational string) so based oil relative relations between neighbour pixels and on their distribution. It is illumination-invariant and able to capture some semantics local to objects through selected image stripes. Second, we propose a bi-directional query/candidate matching based oil region - i.e. potential object - mutual preferences. The remaining third of the paper reports oil the experimentation over 60,000 images, providing results in the TrecEval format about the performance compared with common available techniques and about the influence of key parameters in the proposed segmentation and pairing processes.
