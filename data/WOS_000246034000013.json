An equivalent circuit model, which is called the -gamma d/n model and regularly constructed by two elementary resistance-capacitance-inductance-conductance cells, is proposed for transmission line modeling in this paper. Unlike those moment-matching techniques, the gamma d/n model is a physical model in nature, and it can be applied to generated high-accuracy, stable, passive, and reduced-order models of transmission lines. In addition, RC(L) interconnect loads are also considered in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately capture the transmission fine effect and the capacitive load effect. The waveform obtained by this method differs from that by the exact model in SPICE simulation with the average voltage difference less than 0.9%. For a wide range of interconnect parameters, it has been shown that this method can achieve less than 6% in average error of the 50% delays for both the near-end response and the far-end response.", "paper_title": "A novel gamma d/n RLCG transmission line model considering complex RC(L) loads", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034000013"}
