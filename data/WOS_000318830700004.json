The method checks the driver's physical condition just before the start of driving, calculates the driver's rating of perceived exertion, and uses that to automatically select a suitable pedal load. To ensure that the level of physical exertion is safe, the largest pedal load is determined on the basis of Borg's CR10, the Karvonen formula, a pedaling experiment, and statistical data. A driver's degree of fatigue is estimated from his heart rate, and a pedal load (between the largest and almost zero) is automatically selected. In addition, a dynamic output-feedback cart control system was designed that guarantees the stability of the cart system for any allowable pedal load. A stability condition is derived by employing the concept of dynamic parallel distributed compensation. Finally, experiments demonstrate the validity of the method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
