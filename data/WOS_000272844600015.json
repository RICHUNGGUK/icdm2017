The MIMO systems are composed of interconnected subsystems in the strict-feedback form. The main characteristics of the developed approach are that the online computation burden is alleviated and the robustness to dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances is improved. It is proven that all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly bounded and that the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood around zero. Two simulation experiments are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach developed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Robust Adaptive Tracking Control for Nonlinear Systems Based on Bounds of Fuzzy Approximation Parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000272844600015"}
