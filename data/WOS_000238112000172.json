A network composed of a set of radial basis function (RBF) networks, a set of multilayer perceptron and a linear network is used as a demixing system to separate sources in post-nonlinear mixtures. The experimental results show that our proposed method is effective. and they also show that the local character of the RBF network's units allows a significant speedup in the training of the system.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear blind source separation using hybrid neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000172"}
