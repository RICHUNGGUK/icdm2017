We present a multi-atlas label fusion strategy based on probabilistic weighting of distance maps. Relationships between image similarities and segmentation similarities are estimated in a learning phase and used to derive fusion weights that are proportional to the probability for each atlas to improve the segmentation result. The method was tested using a leave-one-out strategy on a database of 21 pre-segmented prostate patients for different image registrations combined with different image similarity scorings. The probabilistic weighting yields results that are equal or better compared to both fusion with equal weights and results using the STAPLE algorithm. Results from the experiments demonstrate that label fusion by weighted distance maps is feasible, and that probabilistic weighted fusion improves segmentation quality more the stronger the individual atlas segmentation quality depends on the corresponding registered image similarity. The regions used for evaluation of the image similarity measures were found to be more important than the choice of similarity measure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
