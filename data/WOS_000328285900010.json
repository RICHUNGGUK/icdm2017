To assess this adapted method, transport properties of hard-sphere (HS) systems have been predicted both at dense states as well as dilute, and we observed the excellent accuracy over existing DSMC-based algorithms including the Enskog theory. The present approach provides an intuitive and systematic way to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) via mesoscale approach.", "paper_title": "DIRECT SIMULATION MONTE CARLO FOR DENSE HARD SPHERES", "paper_id": "WOS:000328285900010"}
