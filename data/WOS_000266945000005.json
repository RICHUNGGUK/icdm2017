Due to multiple hops involved in query forwarding, the search may result in a long delay before it is answered. Furthermore, some incapable nodes may be overloaded when the query traffic becomes intensive or bursty. In this paper, we present a novel content-pushing. Advertisement-based Search Algorithm for unstructured Peer-to-peer systems (ASAP). An advertisement (ad) is a synopsis of contents a peer tends to share, and appropriately distributed and selectively cached by other peers in the system. In ASAP, nodes proactively advertise their contents by delivering ads, and selectively storing interesting ads received from other peers. Upon a request. a node can locate the destination nodes by looking up its local ads repository, and thus obtain a one-hop search latency with modest search cost. Comprehensive experimental results show that, compared with traditional query-based search algorithms, ASAP achieves much better search efficiency, and maintains system load at a low level with small variations. In addition, ASAP works well under node churn. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "An advertisement-based peer-to-peer search algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000266945000005"}
