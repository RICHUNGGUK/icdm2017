Some fundamental conditions for endowing the networks with retrieval properties are proposed. Moreover, a system designing procedure is developed by using matrix decomposition. Numerical simulations show that the constructed networks can act as reliable noise-reducing systems for storing and retrieving color images. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
