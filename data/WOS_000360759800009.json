The principal roadblock here is occlusion. To avoid this bottleneck, we adopt a combination of (a) a radical new approach of unique influx and outflux count (UIOC) of people within a region of interest (ROI), which is adopted from computational fluidics, (b) a nonlinear regressor to estimate the number of people within a ROI, and (c) ROI boundary tracking (as opposed to object or feature tracking) for a short period. In UIOC, we compute influx/outflux rate, i.e., number of people entering or exiting the ROI per unit time. Then, we sum the influx/outflux rate between any two time points to estimate the number of people that entered and/or left the ROI within that time interval. Our framework is validated on 19 publicly available datasets, with abundant occlusion, obtaining more than 95 % accuracy for each video. Our framework is online and real time. Our framework is comparatively inexpensive to install and operate as only one camera is used. These features make the proposed framework suitable for low-cost, small-business/residential and/or commercial applications. We also extend our framework beyond monocular videos and apply it on multiple views of a publicly available dataset with about 99 % accuracy.", "paper_title": "Unique people count from monocular videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000360759800009"}
