The system employs a hierarchical structure so that the robust recognition can be achieved gradually. At the lower level, motion fields representing local features such as speed and direction are directly calculated from video sequences and further blurred by max filters. At the higher level, a collection of so-called prototype patches are used to recognize query actions by comparing local features in the query videos with those prototypes. In addition, in order to design a system for real-time performance, we intentionally simplify all the calculations into summation operations or boolean operations so that the algorithm can be directly implemented on ultra high speed VLSI chips without much effort. Finally, We tested our system on a gesture perception database as well as widely used action recognition database, and promising recognition performance has been demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
