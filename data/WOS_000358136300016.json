To avoid the gimbal lock problem, vertical Euler angles are used and a new calculation method of them is presented. The attitude controller switches between horizon mode and vertical mode, with a specially designed switchable control architecture. Linear/constant acceleration approximation is used for attitude control, which aims to get quick response and prevent overshooting at the same time. Special proportion integral derivative (PID) controller with anti-torque counteraction is proposed to generate servo angles. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.", "paper_title": "Hover control of a thrust-vectoring aircraft", "paper_id": "WOS:000358136300016"}
