Assuming the number n unknown, two distinct models of RN without collision detection (no-CD) are addressed: the model with weak no-CD RN and the one with strong no-CD RN. We design and analyze two distributed leader election protocols, each one running in each of the above two (no-CD RN) models, respectively. Both randomized protocols are shown to elect a leader within O(log (n)) expected time, with no station being awake efficient). Therefore, a new class for more than O(log log (n)) time slots (such algorithms are said to be energy-efficient algorithms is set up that match the Omega(log (n)) time lower-bound established by Kushilevitz and Mansour [E. Kushilevitz, Y. Mansour, An Omega(D log (N/D)) lower-bound for broadcast in radio networks, SIAM J. Comp. 27 (1998) 702-712).]. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
