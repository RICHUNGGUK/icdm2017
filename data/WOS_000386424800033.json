This paper makes the first attempt to implement three basic DP architectures in the deployed telecommunication (telco) big data platform for data mining applications. We find that all DP architectures have less than 5% loss of prediction accuracy when the weak privacy guarantee is adopted (e.g., privacy budget parameter epsilon >= 3). However, when the strong privacy guarantee is assumed (e.g., privacy budget parameter epsilon >= 0.1), all DP architectures lead to 15% similar to 30% accuracy loss, which implies that real-word industrial data mining systems cannot work well under such a strong privacy guarantee recommended by previous research works. Among the three basic DP architectures, the Hybridized DM (Data Mining) and DB (Database) architecture performs the best because of its complicated privacy protection design for the specific data mining algorithm. Through extensive experiments on big data, we also observe that the accuracy loss increases by increasing the variety of features, but decreases by increasing the volume of training data. Therefore, to make DP practically usable in large-scale industrial systems, our observations suggest that we may explore three possible research directions in future: (1) Relaxing the privacy guarantee (e.g., increasing privacy budget epsilon) and studying its effectiveness on specific industrial applications; (2) Designing specific privacy scheme for specific data mining algorithms; and (3) Using large volume of data but with low variety for training the classification models.", "paper_title": "Differential Privacy in Telco Big Data Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800033"}
