It employs modules called experts, each of which is specialized to execute certain kinds of tasks such as performing physical behaviors and engaging in dialogues. Some of the experts take charge in understanding human utterances and deciding robot utterances or actions. The model enables switching and canceling tasks based on recognized human intentions, as well as parallel execution of several tasks. This model specifies the interface that an expert must have, and any kind of expert can be employed if it conforms to the interface. This feature makes the model extensible. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
