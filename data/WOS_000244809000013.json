The diagnostic system utilizes Gensym's real time G2 expert system software. Its diagnostic \"cause-effect\" rules and possible actions (suggestions) are extracted from the results of standard HAZOP analysis. The knowledge base of the system is organized in a hierarchical way following the hierarchy levels of a multi-scale model of the process system. This supports focusing used by fault detection and loss prevention and thus decomposes the otherwise computationally hard problem. Prediction by simplified dynamic models are used to reduce ambiguity in case of multiple possible causes and/or multiple possible mitigating actions. The system is illustrated on the example of a commercial fertilizer granulator circuit using a simulation test bed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
