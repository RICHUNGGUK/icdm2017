We consider numeration systems in a broad sense, that is, representation systems of numbers that also include continued fraction expansions. These numeration systems might be positional or not, provide unique expansions or be redundant. Special attention will be payed to beta-numeration (one expands a positive real number with respect to the base beta > 1), to continued fractions, and to their Lyapounov exponents. In particular, we will compare both representation systems with respect to the number of significant digits required to go from one type of expansion to the other one, through the discussion of extensions of Lochs' theorem.", "paper_title": "Numeration and discrete dynamical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000303804100021"}
