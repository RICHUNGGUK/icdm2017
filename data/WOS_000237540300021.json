This paper presents the Neighbor-Aided Multicast Protocol for Streaming transmission on MANET (NAMPS). NAMPS is an on-demand, mesh-based protocol which provides multiple paths for data transmission. The key issue in mesh-based streaming transmission is the maintenance of the mesh structure. This involves the detection of the change to the mesh and restructuring of the mesh. In this paper, we take advantage of the continuous streaming packets and broadcast signals in wireless radio to detect the changes in link states. For the restructuring problem, we propose to use mesh neighbor to maintain group information, which facilitates route recovery and optimization. The simulation results show that NAMPS has both high effectiveness and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Neighbor-aided multicast protocol for streaming transmission on NMNETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300021"}
