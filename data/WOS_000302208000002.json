The approach uses the hierarchical matrices format and the ACA algorithm for the collocation matrix setup and a preconditioned GMRES solver for the solution. The development of this approach for the anisotropic case presents peculiar aspects which deserve investigation and are studied in the paper leading to the employed computational strategy and its effective tuning. Numerical experiments are presented to assess the method accuracy, performances and numerical complexity. The method ensures adequate accuracy allowing remarkable reductions in computation time and memory storage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
