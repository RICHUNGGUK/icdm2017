Voluminous data are generated from a variety of users and devices, and are to be stored and processed in powerful data centers. As such, there is a strong demand for building an unimpeded network infrastructure to gather geologically distributed and rapidly generated data, and move them to data centers for effective knowledge discovery. The express network should also be seamlessly extended to interconnect multiple data centers as well as interconnect the server nodes within a data center. In this article, we take a close look at the unique challenges in building such a network infrastructure for big data. Our study covers each and every segment in this network highway: the access networks that connect data sources, the Internet backbone that bridges them to remote data centers, as well as the dedicated network among data centers and within a data center. We also present two case studies of real-world big data applications that are empowered by networking, highlighting interesting and promising future research directions.", "paper_title": "Building a Network Highway for Big Data: Architecture and Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000345579100003"}
