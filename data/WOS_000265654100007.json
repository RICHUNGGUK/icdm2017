The main questions relate to the evolution of a given transportation system and its response to various modifications of its socio-economic, regulatory, and technological environment. These questions are often part of cost-benefit analyses and comparative studies of policy and investment alternatives with broad and significant impact, not only oil the transportation system but also on the economy and society as a whole. Canadian researchers have contributed significantly to this field. They have not only developed models and methods to perform national planning activities, but also transferred these results to practice through decision-support software commercially distributed worldwide. This paper presents an overview of national planning issues together with the main methodological approaches proposed in the literature, reviews the contribution of Canadian researchers to the science and practice ill this field, and examines current challenges and research trends.", "paper_title": "National Planning Models and Instruments", "paper_id": "WOS:000265654100007"}
