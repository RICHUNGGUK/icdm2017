The basic idea of IDL(d)-filtering is to label every vertex with respect to its relationships with other vertices around it in the graph, and to use these labels to filter domains by removing values that have different labels. IDL(d)-filtering is parameterized by a positive integer value d which gives a limit on the distance between a vertex to be labelled and the set of vertices considered to build its label. We experimentally compare different instantiations of IDL(d)-filtering with state-of-the-art dedicated algorithms and show that IDL(d)-filtering is more efficient on regular sparse graphs and competitive on other kinds of graphs.", "paper_title": "A parametric filtering algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000259561200005"}
