This study proposes a low-cost target tracking method which can very precisely monitor targets in real time, while complying with to various restrictions of wireless sensor networks. In this study, the movement characteristics. and historical information of the target were used for selecting appropriate guard nodes, which were in charge of target positioning and tracking, so as to use energy more, efficiently and reach a balance between the tracking quality and energy saving. The simulation result showed that the proposed method has the advantages of real-time monitoring, precise positioning, and energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks with Guard Nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000285732400011"}
