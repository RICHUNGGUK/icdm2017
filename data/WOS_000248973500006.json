In this article, we propose a simulated annealing scheme applicable to an economic design for a control policy where the disturbances can follow the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) processes and obtain the optimum d and m. Numerical investigations are conducted for a system with a first-order dynamics subjected to an IMA ( 1,1), and an ARI ( 1,1) random disturbance. The performance of the proposed simulated annealing scheme is very promising and compares favorably to other methods.", "paper_title": "Simulated annealing procedure for on-line control with process dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000248973500006"}
