In the area of supervisory control of discrete event systems, Park and Cho [5] proposed the notion of delay-nonconflictingness for the existence of a supervisor achieving a given language specification under communication delays. In this paper, we present the algebraic properties of delay-nonconflicting languages which are necessary for solving supervisor synthesis problems under communication delays. Specifically, we show that the class of prefix-closed and delay-nonconflicting languages is closed under intersection, which leads to the existence of a unique infimal prefix-closed and delay-nonconflicting superlanguage of a given language specification.", "paper_title": "On algebraic properties of delay-nonconflicting languages in supervisory control under communication delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300048"}
