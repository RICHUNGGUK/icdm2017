The free fatty acids (FFAs) in the oil were converted to methyl esters in the pre-esterification step using sulfuric acid or solid acid prepared by calcining metatitanic acid as catalysts. The acid value of oil was reduced from the initial 14 mg-KOH/g-oil to below 1.0 mg-KOH/g-oil in 2 h under the conditions of 12 wt% methanol, 1 wt% H(2)SO(4) in oil at 70 degrees C. The conversion of FFAs was higher than 97% at 90 degrees C in 2 h using 4 wt% solid acid and a molar ratio of methanol to FFAs of 20:1. Phospholipid compounds were eliminated during pre-esterification and a separate degumming operation was unnecessary. The yield of biodiesel by transesterification was higher than 98% in 20 min using 1.3% KOH as catalyst and a molar ratio of methanol to oil 6:1 at 64 degrees C. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
