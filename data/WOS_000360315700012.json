With the explosive increase in global network traffic, the energy efficiency issue in ICN is a growing concern. A number of approaches have been proposed to address the energy-efficiency issue in ICN. However, several significant research challenges remain to be addressed before its widespread deployment, including shutdown, slowdown, mobility, and cloud computing. In this paper, we present a brief survey on some of the works that have been already done to achieve green ICN and discuss some research issues and challenges. We identify several important aspects of green ICN, i.e., overview, energy efficiency metrics, network planning, enabling technologies, and challenges. Finally, we explore some broader perspectives for green ICN.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Green Information-Centric Networking: Research Issues and Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000360315700012"}
