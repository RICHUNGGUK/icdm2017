The time critical nature of the data requests plays an important role in scheduling these broadcasts. Most research in on-demand broadcast scheduling has focused on the timely servicing of requests so as to minimize the number of missed deadlines. However, there exists many environments where the utility of the received data is an equally important criterion as its timeliness. Missing the deadline may reduce the utility of the data but does not necessarily make it zero. In this work, we address the problem of scheduling real time data broadcasts with such soft deadlines. We investigate search based optimization techniques to develop broadcast schedulers that make explicit attempts to maximize the utility of data requests as well as service as many requests as possible within an acceptable time limit. Our analysis shows that heuristic driven methods for such problems can be improved by hybridizing them with local search algorithms. We further investigate the option of employing a dynamic optimization technique to facilitate utility gain, thereby eliminating the requirement of a heuristic in the process. An evolution strategy based stochastic hill-climber is investigated in this context. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
