In fact, especially under fixed priority systems, each approach has advantages and disadvantages, and no one dominates the other when both predictability and efficiency have to be taken into account in the system design. Recently, limited preemption models have been proposed as a viable alternative between the two extreme cases of fully preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling. This paper presents a survey of the existing approaches for reducing preemptions and compares them under different metrics, providing both qualitative and quantitative performance evaluations.", "paper_title": "Limited Preemptive Scheduling for Real-Time Systems.
