To this purpose, multimedia communication experts have been designing cross-layer strategies to improve the quality of the perceived 3D experience. This article presents a new cross-layer strategy, called Cognitive Source Coding (CSC), that defines a new 3D video system able to identify the different elements of the 3D scene and choose the most appropriate coding strategy.", "paper_title": "A Cognitive Approach for Effective Coding and Transmission of 3D Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000297725800004"}
