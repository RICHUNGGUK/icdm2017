Organized under the National Centers for Biomedical Computing 7 years ago, the mission of NA-MIC is to implement a robust and flexible open-source infrastructure for developing and applying advanced imaging technologies across a range of important biomedical research disciplines. A measure of its success, NA-MIC is now applying this technology to diseases that have immense impact on the duration and quality of life: cancer, heart disease, trauma, and degenerative genetic diseases. The targets of this technology range from group comparisons to subject-specific analysis.", "paper_title": "The National Alliance for Medical Image Computing, a roadmap initiative to build a free and open source software infrastructure for translational research in medical image analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000300768100007"}
