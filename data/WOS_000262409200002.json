To facilitate the measurement of this metric, we propose two novel algorithms for individual sensor nodes to identify whether they are on the coverage boundary, i.e., the boundary of a coverage hole or network partition. Our algorithms are based on two novel computational geometric techniques called localized Voronoi and neighbor embracing polygons. Compared to previous work, our algorithms can be applied to WSNs of arbitrary topologies. The algorithms are fully distributed in the sense that only the minimal position information of one-hop neighbors and a limited number of simple local computations are needed, and thus are of high scalability and energy efficiency. We show the correctness and efficiency of our algorithms by theoretical proofs and extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Localized algorithms for coverage boundary detection in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262409200002"}
