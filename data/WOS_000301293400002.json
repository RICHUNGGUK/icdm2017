In this paper we develop some of the model theory for SK+ along the yet standard lines of themodel theory for classical normal modal logic. We define the notion of positive bisimulation between two models, and we study the notions of m-saturated models and replete models. We investigate the positive maximal Hennessy-Milner classes. Finally, we present a Keisler-Shelah type theorem for positive bisimulations, a characterization of the first-order formulas invariant for positive bisimulations, and two definability theorems by positive modal sequents for classes of pointed models.", "paper_title": "A Note on the Model Theory for Positive Modal Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000301293400002"}
