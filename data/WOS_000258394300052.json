These points correspond to inherent structures of the video so that they can be used as synchronization signals for watermark embedding and extraction. In the proposed scheme, local regions are generated using the space-time interest points, and the watermark is embedded into all the regions by quantization. It is a blind scheme and the watermark can be extracted from any position of the video. Experimental results show that the watermark is invisible and it can robustly survive traditional signal processing attacks and video-oriented attacks.", "paper_title": "Video watermarking by space-time interest points", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300052"}
