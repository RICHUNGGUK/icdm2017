Semi-supervised dimensionality reduction, as the name implies, makes use of both unlabeled data and such domain knowledge as pairwise constraints which are easily available in, many practical applications. Pairwise constraints specify whether a pair of instances belongs to the same class (must-link constraints) or different classes (cannot-link constraints). In, this paper, an instance-level based discriminative semi-supervised dimensionality reduction method with chunklets named IDSDRC is proposed, which aims to simultaneously use both instance-level and chunklet-level pairwise constraints together with unlabeled data for dimensionality reduction. The instance-level pairwise constraints intend to exploit discrimination information, while the chunklets manage to discover clustering information. Meanwhile, unlabeled data are utilized to preserve the inherent geometrical structure of high-dimensional sample data. The proposed IDSDRC algorithm has a closed form solution. Experimental results on two standard face databases for face recognition and face clustering show that IDSDRC is efficient and superior to several established semi-supervised dimensionality reduction methods.", "paper_title": "INSTANCE-LEVEL BASED DISCRIMINATIVE SEMI-SUPERVISED DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION WITH CHUNKLETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400035"}
