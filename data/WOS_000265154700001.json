The real-time FFT algorithm simultaneously constructs and computes the butterfly modules while the incoming data is collected. Thus, the time to complete the FFT calculation is shorter when compared to the conventional FFT. The proposed pre-calculation process that can further reduce this time is verified. Furthermore, depending on the computing capability of the processor, different number of pre-calculation stages for better performance is also suggested in the paper. For a critical mission requiring a shorter time to complete the FFT calculation, the proposed approach is a better choice. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
