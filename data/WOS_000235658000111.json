The traditional approach of data integration can not satisfy these requests at one time, such as federated database, Mediated, data warehouse and so on. Along with the development of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and relation technology, using SOA to integrate data resources has become an effective way. This paper designs and realizes a data integration platform for water resources management using SOA, it provides effective, safe and flexible services of data share.", "paper_title": "The service-oriented data integration platform for water resources management", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000111"}
