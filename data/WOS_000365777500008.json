Servers consume a large amount of energy, even when their computing power is not fully utilized. These static costs represent quite a concern, mostly because many datacenter managers are over-provisioning their infrastructures compared to the actual needs. This results in a high part of wasted power consumption. In this paper, we proposed the BML (\"Big, Medium, Little\") infrastructure, composed of heterogeneous architectures, and a scheduling framework dealing with energy proportionality. We introduce heterogeneous power processors inside datacenters as a way to reduce energy consumption when processing variable workloads. Our framework brings an intelligent utilization of the infrastructure by dynamically executing applications on the architecture that suits their needs, while minimizing energy consumption. In this paper we focus on distributed stateless web servers scenario and we analyze the energy savings achieved through energy proportionality.", "paper_title": "Big, Medium, Little: Reaching Energy Proportionality with Heterogeneous Computing Scheduler", "paper_id": "WOS:000365777500008"}
