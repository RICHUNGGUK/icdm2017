Using a general mode-matching technique, the scattering matrix of waveguide bifurcation type discontinuity and asymmetric iris are established and analyzed. Such discontinuities are used as coupling components and building blocks in the design of filters that are realized on RT/duroid 6002 with the ordinary printed circuit board process in our work. Measurement for one of the three four-pole filters gives 3.4 dB insertion loss and 17 dB return loss over the whole passband at near 24 GHz (K-band) with 440-MHz bandwidth (1.8%). The design method can be widely adopted for the development of microwave-integrated circuits, and the mass-fabrication of such SIW filters can be made easy while maintaining a very low cost.", "paper_title": "Development of Substrate-Integrated Waveguide Filters for Low-Cost High-Density RF and Microwave Circuit Integration: Direct-Coupled Cavity Bandpass Filters With Chebyshev Response", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200098"}
