MFEprimer can help the user to select more suitable primers before running either standard or multiplex PCR reactions. The cDNA and genomic DNA databases of 10 widely used species, as well as user custom databases, were used as DNA templates for analyzing primers specificity. Furthermore, we maintained a Primer3Plus server with a modified Primer3Manager for one-stop primer design and specificity checking.", "paper_title": "MFEprimer: multiple factor evaluation of the specificity of PCR primers", "paper_id": "WOS:000262518300020"}
