There are two aspects of advancement proposed in this paper. First, we construct a novel vertical data structure (Modified Body-Tree) to describe the skeletal models in animation. Second, instead of normal methods such as linear interpolation and higher-order spline interpolation to generate in-between frame, we proposes an adaptive and high-performance algorithm based on 4-Point subdivision scheme to generate in-between frame in the skeletal animation. By this advanced algorithm, a smoother skeletal animation with blander vision effect is achieved.", "paper_title": "Application of 4-point subdivision to generate in-between frames in skeletal animation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300130"}
