The conceptual element in temporal context was then extended to the phenomenon element yielding temporal granular representation. Through the introduction of partially ordered time-series, the diachronism of the knowledge system was studied. An isomorphic mapping was conducted between the sequence structure and concept lattice structure, consisting of a phenomenon element and other time-series materials, providing visualization of the movement of the phenomenon element over time. Dynamic modeling was applied to knowledge granules in the open problem domain of context and time, providing a theoretical basis for reference.
