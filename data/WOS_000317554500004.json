Those qualitative patterns are obtained at a low level sensor data processing and without using training on datasets or learning techniques. A qualitative distance integration approach is parametrized and applied to detect glass windows and mirrors. Corners and columns are detected by the laser sensor and described qualitatively as relevant landmarks. Images taken by the robot camera are described qualitatively for completing the description of the objects located in the robot environment. Experimentation carried out shows that the integration of the information provided enhances the robot perception. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
