Athough patient's well-being could be improved through early and more effective interventions, without a greater understanding of the mechanics of the hip, these developments cannot be attained. Thus, this review article summarises the current literature on this subject in order to provide a platform for future developments. To illustrate the influence computational simulations have had on the knowledge advancement in hip mechanics, we explored two methodological approaches: finite element (FE) analysis and multibody dynamics (MBD). Main outcomes and results: Notwithstanding the unique capabilities of FE and MBD, the former generally offers the micromechanics of the articulating surfaces whereas the latter the macromechanics of the skeleton, these two methodologies also provide the bulk of the literature regarding computational modelling of the musculoskeletal system. Although FE has provided significant knowledge on contact pressures and the effects of musculoskeletal geometries, in particular cartilage and bone shapes, MBD has afforded a wealth of understanding on the influence of gait patterns and muscle attachment locations on force magnitudes. Conclusions: These two computational techniques have, and will continue to, provide significant contributions towards the development of interventions. It is hoped that this article will help focus ongoing technological developments by highlighting areas of success, but also areas of under development.", "paper_title": "Computational modelling of the natural hip: a review of finite element and multibody simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000306745900008"}
