In such processors, the implementation cost and complexity of the replacement policy is as important as the cache hit rate. By exploiting the cache hit way information between two replacements, the proposed replacement schemes reduce cache misses by 1% to 18% on average depending on the cache configuration, compared with the conventional FIFO policy. The proposed schemes come at a small implementation cost of additional state bits and control logic. The reduction in cache misses directly translates into data access energy savings of 1% to 15% on average, depending on the cache configuration. Our work suggests that there is room for improving the popular FIFO policy at a small cost.", "paper_title": "AUGMENTED FIFO CACHE REPLACEMENT POLICIES FOR LOW-POWER EMBEDDED PROCESSORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000269452200006"}
