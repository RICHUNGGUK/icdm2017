By means of polarization we reduce them to elements A of the group algebra Q[S-n x S-n] and describe explicit linear equations on the coefficients of A to vanish on tensors of a given rank. Further, we reduce the study to the Schur ring over the group S-n x S-n that arises from the diagonal conjugacy action of S-n. More closely, we consider elements of Q[S-n x S-n] vanishing on tensors of rank n - 1 and describe them in terms of triples of Young diagrams, their irreducible characters, and nonvanishing of their Kronecker coefficients. Also, we construct a family of elements in Q[S-n x S-n] vanishing on tensors of rank n - 1 and illustrate our approach by a sharp lower bound on the border rank of an explicitly produced tensor. Finally, we apply this construction to prove a lower bound 5n(2)/4 on the border rank of the matrix multiplication tensor (being, of course, weaker than the best known one (2 - epsilon) . n(2), due to Landsberg, Ottaviani).", "paper_title": "Tensor Rank: Matching Polynomials and Schur Rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000335670400003"}
