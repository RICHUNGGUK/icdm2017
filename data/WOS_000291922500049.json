When the underlying process is not band-limited, sampling at any uniform rate leads to aliasing, while certain stochastic sampling schemes, including Poisson process sampling, are rendered infeasible by the constraint of minimum separation. It is shown in this paper that, subject to this constraint, no point process sampling scheme is alias-free for the class of all spectra. It turns out that point process sampling under this constraint can be alias-free for band-limited spectra. However, the usual construction of a consistent spectrum estimator does not work in such a case. Simulations indicate that a commonly used estimator, which is consistent in the absence of this constraint, performs poorly when the constraint is present. These results should help practitioners in rationalizing their expectations from point process sampling as far as spectrum estimation is concerned, and motivate researchers to look for appropriate estimators of bandlimited spectra.", "paper_title": "Effect of Inter-Sample Spacing Constraint on Spectrum Estimation with Irregular Sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500049"}
