The solution of KMSE is typically not sparse, which may be harmful for real time applications. Current proposed algorithms show hindrances when dealing with sample flow learning systems. A significant improvement utilizes incremental learning, namely IKMSE, to achieve better sparsity however it is not enough. We propose two additional adaptive incremental learning algorithms, viz. CRKMSE and PRKMSE. CRKMSE adopts a complete reduction strategy while PRKMSE uses the partial reduction. Generally, PRKMSE is superior to CRKMSE in terms of training time. And PRKMSE owns a better real time than CRKMSE in the testing phase due to fewer significant nodes. Finally, a lot of experiments are reported to confirm our viewpoints in this paper.
