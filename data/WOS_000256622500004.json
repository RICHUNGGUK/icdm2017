XFlavor can be used to convert multimedia data back and forth between binary and XML representations. Compared to bitstreams, XML documents are easier to access and manipulate, and consequently, the development of multimedia processing software is greatly facilitated, as one generic XML parser can be used to read and write different types of data in XML form.", "paper_title": "XFlavor: providing XML features in media representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000256622500004"}
