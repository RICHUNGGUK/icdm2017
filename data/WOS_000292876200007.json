Students found that the teaching objects, provided as additional resources to assist students in learning about difficult concepts, supported them in their learning. Additionally, students reported that while they appreciated the provision of the teaching objects, the objects lacked an interactive component and did not replace interaction with the teacher. Articulate Presenter, as a tool to create a recorded narration, was easy for the teacher to use and promoted teacher independence in the creation of teaching objects.", "paper_title": "Creating Teaching Objects A Case Study of Delivering Recorded Narrations in Nursing Education", "paper_id": "WOS:000292876200007"}
