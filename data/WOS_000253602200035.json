Lower and upper bounds for the intersection number are computed and, for any value between these bounds, codes which have this given intersection value are constructed. For all these Z(2)Z(4)-additive codes C-1 and C-2, the abelian group structure of the intersection codes C-1 boolean AND C-2 is characterized. The parameters of this abelian group structure corresponding to the intersection codes are computed and lower and upper bounds for these parameters are established. Finally, for all possible parameters between these bounds, constructions of codes with these parameters for their intersections are given.", "paper_title": "On the intersection of Z(2)Z(4)-additive perfect codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000253602200035"}
