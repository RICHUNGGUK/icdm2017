Under a condition for coherence time, GSM with quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) is proved to achieve a transmission rate that is equal to the capacity of the MIMO channels up to second order in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime, regardless of the number of simultaneously activated transmit antennas and of whether CSI is available at the receiver or not. This implies that QPSK GSM is second-order optimal for the MIMO channels in terms of information-theoretical energy efficiency.", "paper_title": "Second-Order Optimality of Generalized Spatial Modulation for MIMO Channels With No CSI", "paper_id": "WOS:000377706800010"}
