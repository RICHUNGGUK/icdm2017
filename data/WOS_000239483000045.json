This paper reports our research as part of an effort to realize such a system and focuses on recognition of the handwritten recipient's on fax cover pages. We propose hybrid neural networks for large scale Chinese handwritten character recognition. The network is composed of the self-organizing competitive fuzzy layer and the multi-layer neural network using BP method, connected in cascade. The characteristic features of this network structure for Chinese handwritten character recognition are discussed and performances are evaluated on 8208 real world faxes which are taken from one company in 2004, the results of experiments compared to standard neural solutions based on MLP show that the whole system is of reasonable structure and satisfactory performance.", "paper_title": "A method of Chinese fax recipient's name recognition based on hybrid neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000045"}
