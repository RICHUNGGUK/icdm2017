In this paper, we present a new 802.11-based indoor positioning method using support vector regression (SVR), which consists of offline training stage and online location stage. The model that describes the relations between the position and the received signal strength (RSS) of the mobile device is established at the offline training stage by SVR, and at the online location stage the exact position is determined by this model. Due to the complex indoor environment, RSS is vulnerable and changeable. To address this issue, data filtering rules obtained through statistical analysis are applied at offline training stage to improve the quality of training samples and thus improve the quality of prediction model. At the online location stage, k-times continuous measurement is utilized to obtain the high quality RSS input, which guarantees the consistency with the training samples and improves the position accuracy of mobile devices. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed method has a higher positioning accuracy compared with the probability and neutral network method, and the demand for the storage capacity and computing power is also low at the same time.", "paper_title": "Support Vector Regression Based Indoor Location in IEEE 802.11 Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000362358700001"}
