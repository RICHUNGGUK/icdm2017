The technique combines wavelet transform with radial basis function (RBF) neural network to restore the given image which is degraded by Gaussian blur and additive noise. In the proposed technique, the wavelet transform is adopted to decompose the degraded image into high frequency parts and low frequency part. Then the RBF neural network based technique is used to restore the underlying image from the given image. The inverse principal element method (IPEM) is applied to speed up the computation. Experimental results show that the proposed technique inherited the advantages of wavelet transform and IPEM, and the algorithm is efficient in computation and robust to the noise.", "paper_title": "Blind image restoration by combining wavelet transform and rbf neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000250844100003"}
