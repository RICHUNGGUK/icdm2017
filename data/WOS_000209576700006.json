Nowadays, energy efficiency is of major concern when using large computing systems such as cluster, grid, and cloud computing facilities. In the approach proposed in this article, a combination of higher-level (i.e., between distributed systems) and lower-level (i.e., within each data-center) schedulers are studied for finding efficient mappings of workflows into the resources in order to maximize the quality of service, while reducing the energy required to compute them. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that accurate schedules are computed by using combined list scheduling heuristics (accounting for both problem objectives) in the higher level, and ad-hoc scheduling techniques to take advantage of multicore infrastructures in the lower level. Solutions are also evaluated with two user-and administrator-oriented metrics. Significant improvements are reported on the two problem objectives when compared with traditional load-balancing and round-robin techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
