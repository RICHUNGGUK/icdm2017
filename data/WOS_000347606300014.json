Ninety-six college students participated in this study, in which a game-based experiment lasting 90 min was employed. The main findings were that (1) the employed stress stimuli influence creativity during gaming through two routes; enhancing creativity through cortisol concentration and WM and decreasing creativity by provoking promotionfocused negative emotions (frustration and anger); and (2) the subjective negative emotions and objective cortisol responses do not consistently predict WM and creativity in game-based situations. Accordingly, appropriate challenges or stressors that help increase the cortisol concentration to an attentional level without provoking a strong sense of promotion-focused negative emotions should be considered when designing games aimed at teaching creativity.
