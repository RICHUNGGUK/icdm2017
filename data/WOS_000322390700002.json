In this paper, we propose a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on a recursive grid partition and kernel density estimation (KDE) to hierarchically identify wild bird habitats with different densities. We hierarchically cluster the GPS data by taking into account the following observations: 1) the habitat variation on a variety of geospatial scales; 2) the spatial variation of the activity patterns of birds in different stages of the migration cycle. In addition, we measure the site fidelity of wild birds based on clustering. To assess effectiveness, we have evaluated our system using a large-scale GPS dataset collected from 59 birds over three years. As a result, our approach can identify the hierarchical habitats and distribution of wild birds more efficiently than several commonly used algorithms such as DBSCAN and DENCLUE.", "paper_title": "A grid-based clustering algorithm for wild bird distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000322390700002"}
