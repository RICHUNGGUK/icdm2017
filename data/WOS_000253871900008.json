Such a polynomial is called hyperbolic if it has only real roots. A finite multiplier sequence of length n + 1 (FMS(n + 1)) is a tuple (c(0),center dot center dot center dot, c(n)), c(i) is an element of R, such that if Sigma(n)(i=0) b(i)x(n-i),b(i) is an element of R, is a hyperbolic polynomial, then Sigma(n)(i=0) c(i)b(i)x(n-i) is also such a polynomial. The set of FMS(n + 1) coincides with the set of tuples such that Sigma(n)(i=0) C(n)(i)c(i)x(n-i) is a hyperbolic polynomial with all roots of the same sign. In the paper we prove several geometric properties of the set of FMS(n + 1) formulated in terms of its stratification (defined by the multiplicity vectors of the polynomials) and of the Whitney property (the curvilinear distance to be equivalent to the Euclidean one).
