With the emergence of wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs), M2M communications improve continuous monitoring and transmission and retrieval of multimedia content such as video and audio streams, images, and sensor data from the patient being monitored. This research deploys WMSN for continuous monitoring of target patients and reports tracking for preventive ubiquitous healthcare. This study performs optimization scheme movement coordination technique and data routing within the monitored area. Amovement tracking algorithm is proposed for better patient tracking techniques and aids in optimal deployment of wireless sensor networks. Results show that our optimization scheme is capable of providing scalable and reliable patient monitoring results.", "paper_title": "An Optimization Scheme for M2M-Based Patient Monitoring in Ubiquitous Healthcare Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000303766600001"}
