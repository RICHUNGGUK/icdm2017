This work presents the CARMMI approach, which aims to integrate information coming from CAx tools, mixed/augmented reality tools and embedded intelligent maintenance systems. CARMMI aims to provide support to operators/technicians during maintenance tasks through mixed reality, providing an easier access, understanding and comprehension of information from different systems. Information about where, when and which data will be presented in interface are defined by CARMMI. The paper presents three test cases that were performed using the proposed concepts and infrastructure. The main benefit of the approach is to provide an extensive and generic model for the integration and management of maintenance data through the use of CARMMI. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
