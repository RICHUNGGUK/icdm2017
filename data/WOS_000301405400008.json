However, super-market transaction datasets are generally temporal in the sense that, when a transaction happens in a supermarket, the time of the transaction is also recorded. A number of techniques have been proposed to find frequent itemsets from temporal datasets in which each itemset is associated with a list of time intervals in which it is frequent. Considering the time of transactions as calendar dates, there may exist various types of periodic patterns viz. yearly, quarterly, monthly, daily, etc. And, if the time internals associated with a periodic itemset are kept in a compact manner then it turns out to be a fuzzy time interval for which the set superimposition method can be used. In this paper, we propose an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to find clusters among the periodic itemsets. Since the fuzzy number is invariant with respect to shifting, we define similarity measure using the variance of fuzzy intervals associated with frequent itemsets. The efficacy of the proposed method is established through experimentation on real datasets.", "paper_title": "CLUSTERING PERIODIC FREQUENT PATTERNS USING FUZZY STATISTICAL PARAMETERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405400008"}
