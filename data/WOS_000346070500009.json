By using the proposed approach, suitable for problems with linear cost function, the original model predictive control formulation is disassembled into a set of smaller problems, which can be efficiently solved using multiparametric mixed-integer programming algorithms. It is also shown how the methodology is applied in the context of explicit robust model predictive control of hybrid systems, where model uncertainty is taken into account. The proposed developments are demonstrated through a numerical example where the methodology is applied to the optimal control of a piece-wise affine system with linear cost function.
