AMCMC provides the user with an R interface, which in turn calls C programs for faster computations. The user can supply the density and functionals either as R objects, or as auxiliary C files. We describe experiments which illustrate that for fast performance in high dimensions, it is best that the latter option be used. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
