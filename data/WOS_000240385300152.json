Used the math transform domain algorithm to emphasize the brightness of the sun area in the fisheye picture, the human's vision brightness sensitivity is simulated by this optic color filter impact. The small sun in the fisheye picture is segmented, and transformed to the plane picture instead of the whole picture. It is easy to get the coordinates of the sun area barycenter from the plane picture to the fisheye picture. Then the azimuth angle and the vertical angle between the vision point and the sun spot are calculated. The results of the experimentation show that the amount of computation of the algorithm is reduced a lot. It is accurate, fast and real-time.", "paper_title": "Research of an omniberaing sun locating method with fisheye picture based on transform domain algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300152"}
