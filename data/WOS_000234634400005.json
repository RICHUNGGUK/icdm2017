However, there is still considerable debate about how selection among a set of candidate models, or averaging over closely competing models, might be undertaken. This article considers simple approaches for model averaging and choice using predictive and likelihood criteria and associated model weights on the basis of output for models that run in parallel. The operation of such procedures is illustrated with real data sets and a linear regression with simulated data where the true model is known.", "paper_title": "Bayesian model comparison via parallel model output", "paper_id": "WOS:000234634400005"}
