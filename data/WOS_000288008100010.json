Performing well in these problems requires balancing the need to search for highly-rewarding alternatives, with the need to capitalize on those alternatives already known to be reasonably good. Consistent with this motivation, we develop a new psychological model that relies on switching between latent exploration and exploitation states. We test the model over a range of two-alternative bandit problems, against both human and optimal decision-making data, comparing it to benchmark models from the reinforcement learning literature. By making inferences about the latent states from optimal decision-making behavior, we characterize how people should switch between exploration and exploitation. By making inferences from human data, we begin to characterize how people actually do switch. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding and measuring the competing demands of exploration and exploitation in sequential decision-making. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
