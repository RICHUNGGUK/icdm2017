In SAN, data forwarding performance will be degraded dramatically due to the existence of users' selfish behaviors. To address the selfishness problem, barter-based incentive scheme is a fair approach in which two encounter nodes exchange the same amount of data with one another. However, it is a challenging issue for nodes to decide when two nodes contact and how many messages they will exchange for their next contacts. We consider this problem as a resource allocation problem and propose a community-based Barter incentive scheme for SAN paradigm (Com-BIS). In this method, network nodes are grouped into communities and they allocate their forwarding services for different communities optimally using 0-1 knapsack algorithm. The simulation results show that Com-BIS stimulates selfish nodes to cooperate in data delivery for other nodes effectively which improves the forwarding performance considerably.", "paper_title": "Com-BIS: A Community-Based Barter Incentive Scheme in Socially Aware Networking", "paper_id": "WOS:000361677700001"}
