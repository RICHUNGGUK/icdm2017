Chaos in classical physics may be approached by dynamical (equationally determined) systems or stochastic ones (as random processes). However, randomness has also been effectively modelled using recursion theoretic tools by P. Martin-Lof. We recall its connections to Kolmogorov complexity and show some applications to dynamical systems. This allows us to introduce results that connect well-established notions of entropy and algorithmic information.", "paper_title": "Computability and information in models of randomness and chaos", "paper_id": "WOS:000255227900002"}
