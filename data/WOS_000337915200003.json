Since the lifetime of products may possess a two-parameter exponential distribution, 14 estimators are used to estimate the lifetime performance index based on the multiply type II censored sample. These estimators are utilized to develop the new hypothesis testing algorithmic procedure in the condition of known L. Finally, two practical examples are illustrated to employ the testing algorithmic procedure to determine whether the process is capable.", "paper_title": "Computational testing algorithmic procedure of assessment for lifetime performance index of products with two-parameter exponential distribution based on the multiply type II censored sample", "paper_id": "WOS:000337915200003"}
