After the pre-processing of a standard face detector and lighting compensation, the paper proposed a hybrid AAM by combining the local skin similarity with the original local grey-level appearance model. Moreover, the feature points by the hybrid AAM and their neighbors were considered by a classification problem to further refine the results. Namely, the Gabor feature around the feature points was extracted, trained by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classified by K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to give the precise location of the feature points. Experimental results indicated that facial feature points can be located robustly and precisely by the proposed method. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
