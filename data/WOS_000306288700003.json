The features of low motion noises allows our system to work like a real human neck. Thus the level of acoustic noises from wearable equipments, such as donning respirators or chemical-resistant jackets, induced by human head motion can be simulated and investigated using such a system. Our low motion-noise humanoid head/neck system is based on the spring structure, which can generate 1 degree of freedom (DOF) jaw movement and 3DOF neck movement. To guarantee the low-noise feature, no noise-makers like gear and electro-driven parts are embedded in the head/neck structure. Instead, the motion is driven by seven polyester cables, and the actuators pulling the cables are sealed in a sound insulation box. Furthermore, statics analysis and motion control design of the system have been presented. Experimental results clearly show that the head/neck system can greatly mimic the motion of human head with an A-weighted noise level of 30 dB or below.", "paper_title": "A Humanoid Neck System Featuring Low Motion-Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000306288700003"}
