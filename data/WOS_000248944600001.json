This is illustrated by the implementation of two classical methods: the boundary variation method and the homogenization one. Even though these routines are simple enough so that their implementation can be assigned ( partially or totally) as homework to graduate students, they yield results accurate enough to be useful tools for engineers or researchers.", "paper_title": "Structural optimization with FreeFem plus", "paper_id": "WOS:000248944600001"}
