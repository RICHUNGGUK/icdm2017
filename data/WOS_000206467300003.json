Design/methodology/approach - The concentration of this article is on a discussion of the operational styles of existing repositories. Findings - The paper argues that appropriate operational styles of digital repositories will change the culture of information exchange in the social science disciplines. It finds that many successful repositories have employed the strategy of decentralization in their operations. This model can efficiently and effectively reach individual scholars in broad areas. Originality/value - Most existing repositories in the social sciences have not gained ground in attracting scholars. They could learn from successful repositories to improve their own operational plans.", "paper_title": "Disciplinary repositories in the social sciences", "paper_id": "WOS:000206467300003"}
