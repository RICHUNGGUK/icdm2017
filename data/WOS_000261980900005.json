At first, a method for calculating the movement of the X. Y, and Z axes of the machine when machining a work-piece is developed. The best location of the work-piece is set corresponding to the minimum movement of X, Y, and Z axes of the milling machine when the cutter of the machine follows the tool path generated by the commercial CAD/CAM program. The genetic algorithm (GA) technique is used to minimize movements of the X, Y, and Z axes to determine the best location of the work-piece. It is found that the proposed method can reduce the movement of the X, Y, and Z axes (this save the energy consumption and sometimes improve the machining time) significantly. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
