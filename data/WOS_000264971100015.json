Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire-oriented survey covering 200 Iranian companies as samples was conducted to collect data for the study. Findings - The findings indicate that the information systems (as the structural capital) and the content factors (as the organizational capital) of the structural-organizational intelligence (SOD are significantly related in attaining Cl. The study also provides empirical evidence that attaining Cl is positively related to organization competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications - First, the companies chosen for the study were mainly large companies. Thus, the results may not be applicable to smaller companies; second, this survey was limited to one country (Iran); third, 40 percent of the respondents were from state companies, which because of using state budget and being active at the monopolistic markets inside the country might be a negative effect on the amount of using SOI. Practical implications - Future studies might be extended to analyzing the relationship among other factors of intellectual capital and Cl and should seek to utilize multiple respondents from multinational companies to enhance the research findings. Originality/value - The paper provides some of the very first insights into development of structural capital concept and its effects on organization. Previous studies were independent of structural-organizational capital (intelligence). This study aims to fill that gap by studying downstream impact of SOI application on both the admission of Cl information and organization competitive advantage.", "paper_title": "The role of structural capital on competitive intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000264971100015"}
