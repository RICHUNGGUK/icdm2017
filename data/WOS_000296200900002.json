It is easy to convert these proofs into quadratic-time algorithms to find a 3-coloring, but it is not clear how to find such a coloring in linear time (Kowalik used a nontrivial data structure to construct an O(nlogn) algorithm). We design a linear-time algorithm to find a 3-coloring of a given triangle-free planar graph. The algorithm avoids using any complex data structures, which makes it easy to implement. As a by-product, we give a yet simpler proof of Grotzsch's theorem.", "paper_title": "Three-Coloring Triangle-Free Planar Graphs in Linear Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000296200900002"}
