This is a classification task in which we have thousands values of decision attribute and objects are described by means of sequences of symbols. We develop feature selectors which make our task tractable. Since the behaviour usually does not distinguish users, we introduce user profiles which are clusters of indiscernible users. Then, we construct classifiers which assign descriptions of user behaviour to user profiles. We also derive quality measures specific for our task.", "paper_title": "Identifying Web Users on the Base of their Browsing Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000297797300029"}
