They frequently rely on laborious user editing to refine the segmentation boundary. In this paper, we propose a robust and accurate interactive method based on the recently developed continuous-domain convex active contour model. The proposed method exhibits many desirable properties of an effective interactive image segmentation algorithm, including robustness to user inputs and different initializations, the ability to produce a smooth and accurate boundary contour, and the ability to handle topology changes. Experimental results on a benchmark data set show that the proposed tool is highly effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art interactive image segmentation algorithms.", "paper_title": "Robust Interactive Image Segmentation Using Convex Active Contours", "paper_id": "WOS:000306598100032"}
