This task is approached via Hardware-Software (HW/SW) codesign oriented at the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) digital implementation that unifies the NN-adapted image enhancement/reconstruction techniques with a novel efficient computational architecture based on a Network of Systolic Arrays (NSA). We demonstrate how such unification reduces drastically the computational load of the real-world RS image enhancement/reconstruction tasks resulting in efficient numerical algorithms suitable for quasi real-time NN-adapted implementation with the existing generation of the FPGA-based digital processors that implement the proposed NSA computational architecture.
