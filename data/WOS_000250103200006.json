In this paper classical variation theory is extended to non-additive set functions on T-tribes, after defining the inclusion variation, disjoint and chain variation on T-tribes, we investigate some properties of these three variations in detail, such as, the (null-) null-additivity, exhaustivity, order continuity, continuity from the left and so on. An alternative proof of the Jordan decomposition theorem is given. Thus, some results pertaining to variations in classical measure theory are generalized. In some case, as for T-infinity-measures on T-infinity-tribe, its different formal variations can be extended to T, -measures on T-s -tribes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
