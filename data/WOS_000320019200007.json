The data transmission among agents may fail due to limited communication capacity, and the actuators may fail to receive information owing to noisy environment. We use a Markov chain approach to characterise the occurrence of the two types missing data in a unified framework. A sufficient consensus condition is first obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Then, based on this condition, a novel controller design method is further developed such that the MAS with imperfect communication reaches mean-square consensus. It is shown that the consensus problem for MASs with switching topology can be regarded as a special case of the problem considered in this article, and the related theoretical results are presented as well. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Consensus control of multi-agent systems with missing data in actuators and Markovian communication failure", "paper_id": "WOS:000320019200007"}
