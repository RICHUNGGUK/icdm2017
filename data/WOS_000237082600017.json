The problem is formulated as a dynamic game and an appropriate notion of hybrid strategy for the control inputs is developed. The design of hybrid strategies to meet safety specifications is based on an iteration of alternating discrete and continuous safety calculations. We show that, under certain assumptions, the iteration converges to a fixed point, which turns out to be the maximal set of states for which the safety specifications can be met. The continuous part of the calculation relies on the computation of the set of winning states for one player in a two player, two target, pursuit evasion differential game. We develop a characterization of these winning states using methods from non-smooth analysis and viability theory.", "paper_title": "The reachability problem for uncertain hybrid systems revisited: A viability theory perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082600017"}
