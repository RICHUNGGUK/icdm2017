In this paper, a novel model is presented for generating the facial sketch of pen-and-ink style and reproducing facial expressions in facial sketch animation. Facial sketch rendering is implemented by combing the painting path and line template, in which personalized painting path ensures the generated facial sketch to fit the specific face, and line templates bring different styles to it. The animation of facial sketch, which is based on pseudo-muscle model, reproduces some specific expressions in 2D facial sketch. These works are significative for multimedia application in low bandwidth communication environment.", "paper_title": "Facial sketch rendering and animation for fun communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900053"}
