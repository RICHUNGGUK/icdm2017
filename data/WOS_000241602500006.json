The technique is based on a statistical resampling technique called bootstrap. Only the two input images are used, no other data are needed. The general bootstrap uncertainty estimation framework described here is in principle applicable to most of the existing pixel based registration techniques. In practice, a large computing power is required. We present experimental results for a block matching method on an ultrasound image sequence for elastography with both known and unknown deformation field.", "paper_title": "Image registration accuracy estimation without ground truth using bootstrap", "paper_id": "WOS:000241602500006"}
