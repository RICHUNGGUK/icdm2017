An accurate patient-specific finite element (FE)-based biomechanical model can be used to predict prostate deformations. In this study, an FE model of a prostate phantom is developed using magnetic resonance images, while soft-tissue elasticity is estimated in vivo using an ultrasound-based acoustic radiation force impulse imaging technique. This study confirms that three-dimensional FE-predicted prostate deformation is predominantly dependent on accurate modelling of prostate geometry and boundary conditions. Upon application of various compressive displacements, our results show that a linear elastic FE model can accurately predict prostate deformations. The maximum global error between FE-predicted simulations and experimental results is 0.76mm. Moreover, the effect of including the urethra, puboprostatic ligament and urinary bladder on prostate deformations is investigated by a sensitivity study.", "paper_title": "On the importance of modelling organ geometry and boundary conditions for predicting three-dimensional prostate deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000334049100005"}
