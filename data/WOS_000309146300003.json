It shows high accuracy and robustness for a wide range of flow regimes. But an obvious disadvantage of the BGK scheme is the low computational efficiency, in particular for multidimensional problems. Till now it has not been widely used as a practical tool for science and engineering applications. To overcome this drawback, in this paper some acceleration techniques, including local time stepping, implicit LU-SGS method, and multigrid strategy, are implemented into the original BGK approach and the new scheme is applied to study 3D steady transonic viscous flows. Numerical results show the significant speed up of the scheme to capture the steady state solution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
