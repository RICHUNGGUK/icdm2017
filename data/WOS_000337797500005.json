Decay rate in the logarithmic sense is identified under a number of conditions on the transition probabilities. The results are applied to the BMAP/G/1 queue with vacations. The relationship between vacation time and the decay rate of the queue length distribution is investigated.", "paper_title": "Logarithmic Asymptotics for the GI/G/1-type Markov Chains and their Applications to the BMAP/G/1 Queue with Vacations", "paper_id": "WOS:000337797500005"}
