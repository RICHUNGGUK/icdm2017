First, exploiting fundamental concepts, an AC equivalent circuit of a radio-frequency bipolar junction transistor mixer is derived. Second, this equivalent circuit is used to estimate the conversion gain, noise-figure, and nonlinearity characteristics of the mixer. The proposed technique has been validated using simulations on integrated and discrete transistor based mixer circuits.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT SPICE-BASED TECHNIQUE FOR PERFORMANCE CHARACTERIZATION OF BJT MIXERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283501400012"}
