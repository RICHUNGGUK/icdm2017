In this paper, we proposed a novel method for recognizing gene in genomes. The method combines three famous gene-finding programs. After calculating the accuracy parameters, the equitable weight for each parameter is calculated using genetic algorithm. Then the integrative evaluation is performed. The integrative evaluation is employed to instruct the training of an artificial neural network. The simulation results show that the proposed method integrates advantages of three programs and the accuracy has an obvious improvement, which indicate that the proposed method has a powerful capability for gene prediction.
