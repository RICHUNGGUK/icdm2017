The method consists of expanding the required approximate solutions as the basis of Chebyshev cardinal functions. The partial differential equations are reduced to nonlinear algebraic equations by using operational matrices of derivatives. The computational results are compared with those obtained in previous work and it was found that the method is accurate and efficient.", "paper_title": "Numerical Solution of Klein-Gordon-Zakharov Equations using Chebyshev Cardinal Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000300529600019"}
