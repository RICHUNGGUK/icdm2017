For the broadcast channel, the formula indicates that superposition is always superior to time-division multiple access (TDMA). On the other hand, for the interference channel, we show that TDMA is better than superposition for most realistic situations.", "paper_title": "On Outage Capacity in the Low Power Regime", "paper_id": "WOS:000300246900027"}
