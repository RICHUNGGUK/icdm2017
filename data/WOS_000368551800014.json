This package takes the generalized linear model approach to ALT planning, because this approach can easily handle censoring plans and derive information matrices for evaluating designs. Three types of optimality criteria are considered: D-optimality for model parameter estimation, U-optimality for reliability prediction at a single use condition, and I-optimality for reliability prediction over a region of use conditions. The Weibull distribution is assumed for failure time data and more than one stress factor can be specified in the package. Several graphical evaluation tools are also provided for the comparison of different ALT test plans.", "paper_title": "ALTopt: An R Package for Optimal Experimental Design of Accelerated Life Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000368551800014"}
