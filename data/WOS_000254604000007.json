This scheme utilizes a novel offline evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm called jumping genes for generating the widespread control solutions and be readily stored into a knowledge data base. A separate online multiple criteria decision-making scheme is established for selecting the appropriate control solution. This concept of power voltage control has been demonstrated by the New England 39-bus power system. The system output performance was speedy and accurate.", "paper_title": "A multiple criteria decision-making knowledge-based scheme for real-time power voltage control", "paper_id": "WOS:000254604000007"}
