This paper introduces a mixed integer quadratic model with the objective of generating trailer-to-door assignments that equally distribute idle times at doors to accommodate operational level uncertainty encountered in truck arrival times. A door assignment heuristic is presented. The performance of the heuristic is compared with optimal solutions to small problems. The effectiveness of the proposed heuristic is studied under a variety of circumstances and terminal sizes. The simulation results show that the proposed heuristic is applicable to realistic-size terminals, and it is effective when variability in truck arrival and service times is considered.
