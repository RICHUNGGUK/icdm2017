First, we present a method to deal with the interpolation of fuzzy rules based on interval type-2 Gaussian fuzzy sets. We also prove that the proposed method guarantees to produce normal interval type-2 Gaussian fuzzy sets. Then, we present a method to learn optimal interval type-2 Gaussian fuzzy sets for sparse fuzzy rule-based systems based on genetic algorithms. We also apply the proposed fuzzy rules interpolation method and the proposed learning method to deal with multivariate regression problems and time series prediction problems. The experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy rules interpolation method using the optimally learned interval type-2 Gaussian fuzzy sets gets higher average accuracy rates than the existing methods.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Rules Interpolation for Sparse Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems Based on Interval Type-2 Gaussian Fuzzy Sets and Genetic Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000319930000003"}
