Our approach focuses on energy efficient clustering scheme and inter-cluster routing protocol. On the one hand, considering each node's local information such as energy level, distance to base station and local density, we use fuzzy logic system to determine each node's chance of becoming cluster head and estimate the cluster head competence radius. On the other hand, we use Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method to construct the energy-aware routing between cluster heads and base station. It reduces and balances the energy consumption of cluster heads and solves the hot spots problem that occurs in multi-hop WSN routing protocol to a large extent. The validation experiment results have indicated that the proposed clustering scheme performs much better than many other methods such as LEACH, CHEF and EEUC.", "paper_title": "An Improved Fuzzy Unequal Clustering Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000316762900005"}
