Currently, usual design tools consider the application power consumption after RTL synthesis. We propose in this article a FPGA design flow which integrates the power consideration at the early stages. Thus, the designer determines quickly the algorithm and architecture adequacy which respects the design specifications and the power budget.", "paper_title": "An FPGA power aware design flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000241464600040"}
