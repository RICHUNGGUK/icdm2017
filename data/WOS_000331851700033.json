It is shown that the proposed scheme can conduct the non-linear and non Gaussian tracking process by multiple historical cues and current predictions - the state vector motion, the color distribution and the appearance recognition, all of which can be extracted from the single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) at diverse levels with ELM. The strategy of the hierarchical hybrid ELM ensemble then combines the individual SLFN of the tracking cues for the performance improvements. The simulation results have shown the excellent performance in both robustness and accuracy of the developed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
