MOODS implements state-of-the-art online matching algorithms, achieving considerably faster scanning speed than with a simple brute-force search. MOODS is written in C++, with bindings for the popular BioPerl and Biopython toolkits. It can easily be adapted for different purposes and integrated into existing workflows. It can also be used as a C++ library.", "paper_title": "MOODS: fast search for position weight matrix matches in DNA sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000272080800020"}
