This paper aims to analyze the Chinese outputs in the context of conference papers in computer science through an exploration of the conference proceedings series book - Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) in the period of 1997-2005. Results indicate that: 1. The number of Chinese papers in LNCS keeps growing in the studied period; the share of Chinese papers in LNCS in recent years is much higher than that of Chinese SCI papers in the world; In sharp contrast with remarkable growth of the share of Chinese papers in LNCS, the share of SCI articles in top journals of computer science published by the scientists of mainland China is negligible during the same period. 2. Chinese researchers are more likely to collaborate with domestic fellows; 3. In spite of the increasing amounts of Chinese papers in LNCS, they receive only a few citations; 4. The articles are strikingly more cited by authors themselves and international authors' citations are more than Chinese authors' non-self-citations in the first three years after publication; 5. Based on the new indicator Impact Index (II) the authors proposed, the relative impact of Chinese articles in LNCS is increasing although the average impact of Chinese papers in LNCS is obviously less than that of the publications in LNCS in each year during the studied period.", "paper_title": "Contribution of Chinese publications in computer science: A case study on LNCS", "paper_id": "WOS:000256839600007"}
