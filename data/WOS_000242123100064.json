The ability of agents to generate goals and determine whether to accept the goals of others provides a powerful approach to autonomous computing, particularly in Web-based systems. This invited session of the 10th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems focuses on innovations in intelligent agents and Web-based agent systems.", "paper_title": "Innovations in intelligent agents and web", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100064"}
