Surprisingly, MCTS makes very little use of learning. In this paper, we present four techniques (Ontologies, Bernstein races, Contextual Monte-Carlo and poolRave) for learning agents in Monte-Carlo Tree Search, and experiment them in difficult games and in particular, the Game of Go.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Agents for the Game of Go", "paper_id": "WOS:000283450900004"}
