However, when people need to transfer knowledge from one place to another, geographical distance is a critical barrier to overcome because tacit and invisible characteristics are embedded in certain knowledge and locations. This study explores how social and scientific resources embedded within persons can motivate personal knowledge-diffusion behaviors; that is, bridging resources between locations. To explain cross-border diffusion, this work analyzes knowledge dissemination of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method. By collecting theoretical and application papers in DEA methodology from the Web of Science data set, this study analyzes the academic network consisting of 610 researchers and identifies author locations, research disciplines, and their mutual linkages to explain the importance of personal specific characteristics in cross-border diffusion. Regression models and network analysis show the advantages of personal research seniority and cross-disciplinary coordinating capabilities for researchers to diffuse knowledge from one region to another. The corresponding brokering capabilities accumulated within domestic area or adjacent nations are also helpful for specifically brokering resources of other farther places.", "paper_title": "The motivations for knowledge transfer across borders: the diffusion of data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000313016300023"}
