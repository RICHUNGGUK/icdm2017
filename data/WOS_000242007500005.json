This paper proposes to judiciously utilize the storage redundancy in the form of mirroring existed in a RAID-10 style file system to alleviate this performance degradation. More specifically, a heuristic scheduling algorithm is developed, motivated from the observations of a simple cluster configuration, to spatially schedule write operations on the nodes with less load among each mirroring pair. The duplication of modified data to the mirroring nodes is performed asynchronously in the background. The read performance is improved by two techniques: doubling the degree of parallelism and hot-spot skipping. A synthetic benchmark is used to evaluate these algorithms in a real cluster environment and the proposed algorithms are shown to be very effective in performance enhancement.", "paper_title": "Exploiting redundancy to boost performance in a RAID-10 style cluster-based file system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242007500005"}
