The underlying group action is not reductive, but we provide a complete algorithm to generate all invariants, in arbitrary dimension n and for jets of arbitrary order k. Two main new situations are studied in great detail. For jets of order 4 in dimension 4, we establish that the algebra of Demailly-Semple invariants is generated by 2835 polynomials, while the algebra of bi-invariants is generated by 16 mutually independent polynomials sharing 41 Grobnerized syzygies. Nonconstant entire holomorphic curves valued in an algebraic 3-fold (resp. 4-fold) X(3) subset of P(4)(C) (resp. X(4) subset of P(5)(C)) of degree d satisfy global differential equations as soon as d >= 72 (resp. d >= 259). A useful asymptotic formula for the Euler-Poincare characteristic of Schur bundles in terms of Giambelli's determinants is derived. For jets of order 5 in dimension 2, we establish that the algebra of Demailly-Semple invariants is generated by 56 polynomials, while the algebra of bi-invariants is generated by 17 mutually independent polynomials sharing 105 Grobnerized syzygies.
