Earlier papers describe and argue for the use of the non-classical \"Logic of Partial Functions\" (LPF) to facilitate sound and convenient reasoning about such terms. This paper reviews the fundamental theorem proving algorithms - such as resolution - and identifies where they need revision to cope with LPF. Particular care is needed with \"refutation\" procedures. The modified algorithms are justified with respect to a semantic model. Indications are provided of further work which could lead to efficient support for LPF. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
