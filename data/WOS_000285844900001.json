Appearance, shape and geometry measurements are necessary for abnormality detection locally at each disc and vertebrae (such as herniation) as well as globally for the whole spine (such as spinal scoliosis). We propose a two-level probabilistic model for the localization of discs from clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data that captures both pixel- and object-level features. Using a Gibbs distribution, we model appearance and spatial information at the pixel level, and at the object level, we model the spatial distribution of the discs and the relative distances between them. We use generalized expectation-maximization for optimization, which achieves efficient convergence of disc labels. Our two-level model allows the assumption of conditional independence at the pixel-level to enhance efficiency while maintaining robustness. We use a dataset that contains 105 MRI clinical normal and abnormal cases for the lumbar area. We thoroughly test our model and achieve encouraging results on normal and abnormal cases.", "paper_title": "Labeling of Lumbar Discs Using Both Pixel- and Object-Level Features With a Two-Level Probabilistic Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000285844900001"}
