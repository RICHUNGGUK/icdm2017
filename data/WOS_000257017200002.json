Whereas some research has been done concerning channel flows with a spanwise rotation axis, only few investigations have been performed on channel flows with a rotation about the streamwise axis. In the present study an LES of a turbulent streamwise-rotating channel flow at Re-tau = 180 is performed using a moving grid method. The three-dimensional structures and the details of the secondary flow distribution are analyzed and compared with experimental data. The numerical-experimental comparison shows a convincing agreement as to the overall flow features. The results confirm the development of a secondary flow in the spanwise direction, which has been found to be correlated to the rotational speed. Furthermore, the findings show the distortion of the main flow velocity profile, the slight decrease of the streamwise Reynolds stresses in the vicinity of the walls, and the pronounced increase of the spanwise Reynolds stresses at higher rotation rates near the walls and particularly in the symmetry region. As to the numerical set-up it is shown that periodic boundary conditions in the spanwise direction suffice if the spanwise extent of the computational domain is larger than 10 times the channel half width.
