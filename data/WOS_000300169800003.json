Such broken links denote interrupted navigational paths between resources and may lead to unavailability of data. As a possible solution, we developed DSNotify, an event-detection framework that informs actors about various types of changes and allows them to maintain links to resources in distributed linked data sets. For representing changes we developed the DSNotify Eventset Vocabulary. Different from other vocabularies it applies a resource-centric perspective and preserves the timely order of changes. We further describe our reusable evaluation infrastructure, which can be extended for extracting change sets from arbitrary linked datasets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
