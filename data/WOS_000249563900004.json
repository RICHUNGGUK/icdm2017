However, in many practical applications, unlabeled training examples are readily available, but labeled ones are fairly expensive to obtain. Therefore, semisupervised learning has attracted much attention. Previous research on semisupervised learning mainly focuses on semisupervised classification. Although regression is almost as important as classification, semisupervised regression is largely understudied. In particular, although cotraining is a main paradigm in semisupervised learning, few works has been devoted to cotraining-style semisupervised regression algorithms. In this paper, a cotraining-style semisupervised regression algorithm, that is, COREG, is proposed. This algorithm uses two regressors, each labels the unlabeled data for the other regressor, where the confidence in labeling an unlabeled example is estimated through the amount of reduction in mean squared error over the labeled neighborhood of that example. Analysis and experiments show that COREG can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve regression estimates.", "paper_title": "Semisupervised regression with cotraining-style algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000249563900004"}
