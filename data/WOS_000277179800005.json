Accordingly, this study presents what we believe to be a novel wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) Ethernet passive optical network (EPON) system based on an arrayed-waveguide-grating (AWG) module to meet the rapidly increasing bandwidth demand anticipated in the future. The use of the AWG enables the proposed WDM EPON architecture to achieve wavelength spatial reuse and to provide an intercommunication capability between optical network units (ONUs). As a result, the architecture not only allows upstream access to the central office, but also facilitates a truly shared LAN capability among the end users. Furthermore, the proposed WDM EPON scheme takes account of the requirement for backward compatibility with the IEEE 802.3ah multipoint control protocol and incorporates a dynamic bandwidth allocation scheme and a quality-of-service provisioning mechanism to arbitrate the access of the individual ONUs over the WDM layer. An analytical framework is developed for evaluating the mean packet delay and mean queue length of the proposed WDM EPON system. The analytical results derived using this framework are found to be in good agreement with those obtained from computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Design and Analysis of a WDM EPON for Supporting Private Networking and Differentiated Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000277179800005"}
