These are formulated through a Bi-Level Programming (BLP) approach, which is used to characterize the highly interrelated relationships between the two processes and simultaneously, identify an integrated solution for both. The upper-level problem (BAP) is termed 'NP-hard' as its computational complexity increases exponentially with the number of incoming ships for mooring, while the lower-level problem (QCSP) is a mixed-integer linear program. A revised genetic algorithm and a branch-and-bound method (B&B) are then applied for the solutions of upper and lower level problems, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
