We employ Fisher's discriminant analysis to improve the DCT-based feature and to achieve higher accuracy. An unsupervised thresholding method for discriminating text and non-text regions is introduced and tested as well. Experimental results show that a wide high frequency band, covering some lower-middle frequency components, is generally more suitable for scene text detection despite the original definition of the DCT-based feature.", "paper_title": "Redefining the DCT-based feature for scene text detection Analysis and comparison of spatial frequency-based features", "paper_id": "WOS:000259999600001"}
