Heterogeneous data partitioning algorithms are based on computation performance models of the executing platforms. Their implementation is not trivial as it requires: accurate and efficient benchmarking of computing devices, which may share resources and/or execute different codes; appropriate interpolation methods to predict performance; and advanced mathematical methods to solve the data partitioning problem. In this paper, we present FuPerMod, a software tool that addresses these implementation issues and automates the development of data partitioning code in data-parallel applications for heterogeneous HPC platforms.", "paper_title": "FuPerMod: a software tool for the optimization of data-parallel applications on heterogeneous platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000338843200008"}
