Existing studies on the Vk NN query have focused on static data objects. In this paper we investigate how to process the query on moving objects continuously. We propose an effective filtering-and-refinement framework for evaluating this type of queries. We exploit spatial proximity and visibility properties between the query object and data objects to prune search space under this framework. A detailed cost analysis and a comprehensive experimental study are conducted on the proposed framework. The results validate the effectiveness of the pruning techniques and verify the efficiency of the proposed framework. The proposed framework outperforms a straightforward solution by an order of magnitude in terms of both communication and computation costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
