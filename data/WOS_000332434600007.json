This procedure usually causes a high number of ties (different subsequences with the same best partial makespan) that must be broken via a tie-breaking mechanism. The particular tie-breaking mechanism employed is known to have a great influence in the performance of the NEH, therefore different procedures have been proposed in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, no tie-breaking mechanism has been proposed for the iterated greedy. In our paper, we present a new tie-breaking mechanism based on an estimation of the idle times of the different subsequences in order to pick the one with the lowest value of the estimation. The computational experiments carried out show that this mechanism outperforms the existing ones both for the NEH and the iterated greedy for different CPU times. Furthermore, embedding the proposed tie-breaking mechanism into the iterated greedy provides the most efficient heuristic for the problem so far. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
