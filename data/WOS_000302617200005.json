Operation principle of the antenna is analyzed and design equations are drawn first. Then, the return loss, surface current distribution, radiation patterns, and gain are numerically and experimentally studied in detail. The impedance bandwidth of the antenna is from 2.36 to 2.56 and 5.13 to 12 GHz for return loss larger than 10 dB. The antenna has omnidirectional pattern at the lower band and quasi-directional pattern at the higher band, and it has good immunity to a neighboring, large ground plane. The proposed antenna should be useful for dual-band communication or identification systems. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
