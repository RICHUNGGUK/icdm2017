The main reason comes from how we approximate belief points. We use weighted graphs to model the state space and the belief space, in order for a detailed analysis of the MDP heuristic algorithm. As a result, we provide the prerequisite conditions to build up a robust belief graph. We further introduce a dynamic mechanism to manage belief space in the belief graph, so as to improve the efficiency and decrease the space complexity. Experimental results indicate our approach is fast and has high quality for POMDPs.", "paper_title": "Approximate Planning in POMDPs with Weighted Graph Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000360380900009"}
