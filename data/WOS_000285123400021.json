Solid-state phase transformation during welding was incorporated into the FE model by allowing for volumetric changes and the associated changes in yield stress induced by austenitic and martensitic transformations. In the FE model, temperature-dependent thermo-physical and mechanical properties were considered, and phase transformation plasticity was also taken into account. The results showed the importance of incorporating solid-state phase transformation in the simulation of the pipe welding. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
