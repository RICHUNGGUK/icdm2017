This paper investigates the impact of sensor management on data fusion in a resource-limited network. A localized multi-sensor multi-target tracking framework is presented, consisting of four intertwined modules: data acquisition, data fusion, information propagation, and sensor management. The sensor management module, which boils down to a constrained binary optimization problem, is emphasized for efficient sensing resource allocation. Given limited bandwidth and power in the network, a localized greedy-selection sensor management (GSSM) algorithm is proposed to dynamically select a subset of sensors that contributes most effectively to the tracking accuracy. Using only localized information propagation among one-hop neighbors, the proposed framework obviates the need for a fusion center or multi-hop relays, and thus improves network robustness and scalability.
