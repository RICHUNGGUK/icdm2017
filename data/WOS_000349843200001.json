This paper describes an efficient scalable parallel algorithm for parameter and structural learning in the case of complete data using the MapReduce framework. Two popular instances of classifiers are analyzed, namely the continuous time naive Bayes and the continuous time tree augmented naive Bayes. Details of the proposed algorithm are presented using Hadoop, an open-source implementation of a distributed file system and the MapReduce framework for distributed data processing. Performance evaluation of the designed algorithm shows a robust parallel scaling.", "paper_title": "Learning Continuous Time Bayesian Network Classifiers Using MapReduce", "paper_id": "WOS:000349843200001"}
