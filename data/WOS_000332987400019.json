Research has made it possible to differentiate homogeneous subtypes of the disease phenotype. Currently, the most sophisticated subtyping methods perform unsupervised cluster analysis using only clinical features of a disorder, resulting in subtypes for which genetic association may be limited. In this study, we seek to derive a novel multiview data analytic method that integrates two views of the data: the clinical features and the genetic markers of the same set of patients. Our method is based on multiobjective programming that is capable of clinically categorizing a disease phenotype so as to discover genetically different subtypes. We optimize two objectives jointly: 1) in cluster analysis, the derived clusters should differ significantly in clinical features; 2) these clusters can be well separated using genetic markers by constructed classifiers. Extensive computational experiments with two substance-use disorders using two populations show that the proposed algorithm is superior to existing subtyping methods.", "paper_title": "Multiview Comodeling to Improve Subtyping and Genetic Association of Complex Diseases", "paper_id": "WOS:000332987400019"}
