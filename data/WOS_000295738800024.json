To improve its performance, this paper presents randomized lattice decoding based on Klein's sampling technique, which is a randomized version of Babai's nearest plane algorithm [i.e., successive interference cancelation (SIC)] and samples lattice points from a Gaussian-like distribution over the lattice. To find the closest lattice point, Klein's algorithm is used to sample some lattice points and the closest among those samples is chosen. Lattice reduction increases the probability of finding the closest lattice point, and only needs to be run once during preprocessing. Further, the sampling can operate very efficiently in parallel. The technical contribution of this paper is twofold: we analyze and optimize the decoding radius of sampling decoding resulting in better error performance than Klein's original algorithm, and propose a very efficient implementation of random rounding. Of particular interest is that a fixed gain in the decoding radius compared to Babai's decoding can be achieved at polynomial complexity. The proposed decoder is useful for moderate dimensions where sphere decoding becomes computationally intensive, while lattice reduction-aided decoding starts to suffer considerable loss. Simulation results demonstrate near-ML performance is achieved by a moderate number of samples, even if the dimension is as high as 32.", "paper_title": "Decoding by Sampling: A Randomized Lattice Algorithm for Bounded Distance Decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738800024"}
