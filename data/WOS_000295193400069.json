No assumptions about the form and size of expressions were made in advance, but they were left to the self organization and intelligence of evolutionary process. Genetic programming does this by genetically breeding a population of computer programs using the principles of Darwinian's natural selection and biologically inspired operations. In our research, copper alloy was cold formed by drawing using different process parameters and then tensile strengths and electrical conductivity (dependent variables) of the specimens were determined. The values of independent variables (effective strain, coefficient of friction) influence the value of the dependent variables. Many different genetic models for both dependent variables were developed by genetic programming. The accuracies of the best models were proved by a testing data set. Also, comparison between the genetic and regression models is presented in the paper. The research showed that very accurate genetic models can be obtained by the proposed method.
