There is currently no software tool available to render the large number of structures available in molfile or SMILES format to LATEX source code. We here present mol2chemfig, a Python program that provides this capability. Its output is written in the syntax defined by the chemfig TEX package, which allows for the flexible and concise description of chemical structures and reaction mechanisms. The program is freely available both through a web interface and for local installation on the user's computer. The code and accompanying documentation can be found at http://chimpsky.uwaterloo.ca/mol2chemfig.", "paper_title": "mol2chemfig, a tool for rendering chemical structures from molfile or SMILES format to LATEX code", "paper_id": "WOS:000314022800001"}
