This settles the conjecture of Drton and Klivans that this held for all finite real reflection arrangements. The methods used are geometric and combinatorial. As a consequence, we determine that the angle sums of a zonotope are given by the characteristic polynomial of the order dual of the intersection lattice of the arrangement.", "paper_title": "Projection Volumes of Hyperplane Arrangements", "paper_id": "WOS:000294011700002"}
