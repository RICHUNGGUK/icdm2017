Although there are more than one assembly machine in many manufacturing systems, to the best of our knowledge, the two-stage assembly flow-shop scheduling problem (TSAFSP) has never been addressed with more than one assembly machine at stage two. Moreover, setup time is an inevitable factor in many cases and so in this paper, for more reality, sequence dependent setup times are considered for both stages. After extending mathematical modeling, to solve the addressed problem, four hybrid meta-heuristics are developed. A simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and an imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) in order to find a sequence of jobs at the first stage and a heuristic (HEU) and again SA for assigning addressed jobs to assembly machines in stage two; therefore, these hybrid meta-heuristics are SA+HEU, ICA+HEU, SA+SA and ICA+SA. Computational results reveal that ICA+HEU outperforms all other algorithms; however, the run time of SA+HEU is the smallest among the algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
