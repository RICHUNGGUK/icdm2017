The analytical derivates from the ANN model obtained from the first subproblem are used for obtaining the differential terms in the formulation of the second subproblem. This greatly simplifies the parameter estimation problem. The key advantage of the proposed approach is that solution of a large optimization problem requiring high computational resources is avoided and instead two smaller problems are solved. This approach is particularly useful for large and noisy data sets and nonlinear models where ANN models are known to perform quite well and therefore plays an important role in the solution of the overall parameter estimation problem.
