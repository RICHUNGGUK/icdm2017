For multi-agent systems with fixed undirected topology, a distributed protocol is proposed based on the information of second-order neighbors. Then, new LMI-based sufficient conditions for robust consensus of fractional-order multi-agent systems are obtained and the feedback matrix is also determined accordingly. Finally, numerical simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
