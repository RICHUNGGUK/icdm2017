As contention-based or reservation-based (i.e., contention-free) medium access control (MAC) protocols in existing wireless link-layer standards cannot efficiently support multimedia applications such as video streaming, a hybrid approach has been proposed, which uses both contention and reservation-based channel access mechanisms to transmit packets for each video source. Using this content-aware resource management approach, each video source reserves well below its peak data rate, and uses contention-based media access to transmit the remainder of the packets. In this paper, we first propose two conflict avoidance strategies and two buffering architectures for video streaming over ad hoc networks. Considering the interactions of reservation and contention, we develop the analytical model for the saturated traffic case and then extend it to derive tight performance bounds for the unsaturated case. Using the MAC protocols specified in the WiMedia ECMA-368 standard as an example, extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the analysis. Real video traces have been used to examine the video streaming performance. The analytical and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the hybrid resource management approach, and also reveal the impact of the conflict avoidance strategy and buffering design on the video performance.
