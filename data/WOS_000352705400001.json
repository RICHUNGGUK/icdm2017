The presented framework is based on a standardized, and freely available library and in the published form it solves the minimum compliance problem on structured grids, using standard FEM and filtering techniques. For completeness a parallel implementation of the Method of Moving Asymptotes is included as well. The capabilities are exemplified by minimum compliance and homogenization problems. In both cases the unprecedented fine discretization reveals new design features, providing novel insight.
