Previous proposed priority and duplication based task scheduling algorithms, which can be applied in pervasive computing environment, usually have following limitations: critical path cannot be calculated accurately while neglecting the effect of resource availability in scheduling; in duplication based resource allocation stage, duplications without restriction would lead to some negative effects on final schedule length (SL). For the purpose of solving these problems, a novel task scheduling algorithm based on dynamic critical path (DCP) and effective duplication, called DCPED, is presented in this paper. In DCPED, a more accurate DCP calculation method which takes resource availability into account is introduced. Meanwhile an effective task duplication strategy is proposed to eliminate ineffective duplications and make an optimized schedule result by using space compression technique and dynamic critical path length (DCPL) based evaluation technique respectively. Finally, simulation results show that DCPED can outperform previous algorithms significantly in NSL and speedup rate metrics. Especially, it is very effective for utilizing computing resources and scheduling the fine-grain and large-scale workflow applications in pervasive computing system.
