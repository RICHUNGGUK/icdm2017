We consider an indoor environment where RFID tags are implanted along the wall or in objects in the room. If the absolute position and orientation of a tag are read by an RF reader, a mobile system can estimate its location using the information saved in the tags. A reader-tag model is obtained through experiments in order to derive relative positions and orientations between an antenna and an RFID tag. To estimate the location, we propose two estimation methods. One uses a single RFID tag and the other uses multi-RFID tags. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can provide good performance for mobile system localization in an indoor environment.", "paper_title": "LOCATION ESTIMATION OF MOBILE SYSTEMS USING PASSIVE RFID TAGS IN AN INDOOR ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000266126300010"}
