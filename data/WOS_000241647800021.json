Towards ubiquitous intelligence this area of research addresses the intersection between mobile agents, heterogeneous networks, and ubiquitous intelligence. This paper presents a development of hardware and software systems to address the combination of these interests as Location-Aware Service. Our architecture performs the intelligent services to meet the respective requirements. By adding autonomous mobility to the agents, the system becomes more able to dynamically localize around areas of interest and adapt to changes in the ubiquitous intelligence landscape. We also analyze some lessons learned based on our experience in using location-aware multi-agent techniques and methods.", "paper_title": "Location-aware multi-agent based intelligent services in home networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800021"}
