In this paper, we propose a new strategy to use adaptive kernel parameters in the recursive feature elimination algorithm implemented with Gaussian kernel SVMs as a better alternatives to the aforementioned algorithm for pragmatic reasons. The proposed method performs well in selecting genes and achieves high classification accuracies with these genes on two cancer datasets.", "paper_title": "Gene selection using Gaussian kernel support vector machine based recursive feature elimination with adaptive kernel width strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500116"}
