Though MPWG proposes an architecture of trusted mobile platform (TMP), it does not indicate specific technology for TMP. A general method to build a TMP is adopting virtualization method in a system, but it is very resource consuming. In this paper, we propose a new trusted mobile model using Domain Type Enforcement (DTE) to construct a secure surrounding with complete isolation and controlled communication between different entities of the system. The proposed DTE model is composed of two parts: the basic rules of configuring DTE and the system status transition. The former sets up corresponding domains and types of the DTE model, and the latter describes how to maintain security invariants of the systems' status. Comparing with the conventional virtualization methods, the DTE model-based trusted mobile platform is more efficient and flexible in resource using and also easily realized in a SELinux operating system.", "paper_title": "Trusted mobile model based on DTE technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000363266100005"}
