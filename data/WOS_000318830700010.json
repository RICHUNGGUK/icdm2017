Holistic concurrent design is a systematic design methodology for mechatronic systems that formalizes subjective notions of design, resulting in the simplification of the multi-objective constrained optimization process. Its premise is to enhance the communication between designers with various backgrounds and customers, and to consider numerous design variables with different natures concurrently. The methodology redefines the ultimate goal of design based on the qualitative notion of satisfaction, and formalizes the effect of designer's subjective attitude in the process. The hardware-in-the-loop platform involves physical joint modules and the control unit of a manipulator in addition to the software simulation to reduce modeling complexities and to take into account physical phenomena that are hard to be captured mathematically. This platform is implemented in the HCD design architecture to reliably evaluate the design attributes and performance supercriterion during the design process. The resulting architecture is applied to redesigning kinematic, dynamic and control parameters of an industrial manipulator. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
