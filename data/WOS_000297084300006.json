We discuss several recently proposed p-cycle based optical multicast protection approaches, including the link-protecting p-cycle based optical multicast protection approach, the tree-protecting p-cycle based optical multicast protection approach, node-and-link protecting p-cycle based optical multicast protection approach, and flow p-cycle based optical multicast protection approach. They outperform other existing optical multicast protection approaches in both capacity efficiency and recovery speed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
