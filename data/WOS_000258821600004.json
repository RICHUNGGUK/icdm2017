Using a 2 x 2 between-subjects laboratory design, 391 participants were randomly assigned to work with a computer that utilized either a traditional interface or an interface designed to include higher social cues. The results of this study indicated that those who interacted with the interface with greater social cues made greater attributions of responsibility to the computer. In addition, women were more likely to ascribe responsibility to the computer. Results did not support an interaction between gender and interface design. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.", "paper_title": "Attributions of responsibility toward computing technology: The role of interface social cues and user gender", "paper_id": "WOS:000258821600004"}
