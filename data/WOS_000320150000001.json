It extracts largest contour features from the topologically simplified contour trees of each field, then measures similarities between features using information theory. These similarities are stored in a weighted graph on which we apply clustering. The clustering identifies coherent features across fields. Finally, the clusters are ranked and presented in a thumbnail gallery providing a quick overview of the whole dataset We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a number of complex fluid flow datasets.
