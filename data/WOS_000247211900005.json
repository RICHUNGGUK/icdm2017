An artifact reduction algorithm (ARA) was developed to reduce metal artifacts in CT-based AC-PET. The algorithm employed a Bayes classifier to identify beam-hardening artifacts, followed by a partial correction of the attenuation map. ARA was implemented on phantom and patient F-18-FDG studies using a clinical PET/CT scanner. In phantom studies ARA successfully removed two artifacts of erroneously elevated uptake near a stainless steel hip prosthesis which were depicted in the standard CT-AC PET. ARA has also identified two targets absent on the scanner PET images. Target-to-background ratios were 1.5-3 times higher for ARA-PET than scanner images. In a patient study, metal artifacts were of lower intensity in ARA-PET as compared to standard images. Potentially, ARA may improve detectability of small lesions located near metal hip implants.", "paper_title": "The reduction of artifacts due to metal hip implants in CT-attenuation corrected PET images from hybrid PET/CT scanners", "paper_id": "WOS:000247211900005"}
