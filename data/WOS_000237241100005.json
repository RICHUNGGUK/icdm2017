Insofar as these proteins are strategically positioned to play a role in resistance to environmental stress, biologists are interested in proteomic tools in analyzing extracellular proteins. In this paper, we present three methods using frequent subsequences of amino acids: one based on support vector machines (SVM), one based on boosting and FSP, a new frequent subsequence pattern method. We test our methods on a plant dataset and the experimental results show that our methods perform better than the existing approaches based on amino acid composition.", "paper_title": "Frequent subsequence-based protein localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000237241100005"}
