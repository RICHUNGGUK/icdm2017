The proposed design provides the vehicle with more flexibility in terms of increased degrees of freedom which enable the vehicle to enlarge its working space. The additional translational degree of freedom (DOF), offered by the linear actuator, assists an attached payload to reach different levels of height as and when required. The model of the system mimics the scenario of the double inverted pendulum on a moving base, with the added DOF. Lagrangian dynamic formulation is used to derive the system dynamics. Joints frictions based on the Coulomb friction model are considered so as to retain nonlinear characteristics of the system. A PD-PID robust control approach is derived for the stabilization of the system. An investigation of the impact of damping associated with joints on the stability of the system is carried out. Simulation results validating the model and the control approach are presented and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
