The model assumes quasi-neutrality and is fully electromagnetic. The implicit field solver improves numerical accuracy by separating the equilibrium terms in the presence of small perturbations. The equilibrium part of the generalized Ohm's law is solved by direct matrix inversion along the direction of gradients for every Fourier mode in the other two directions, while the nonlinear part is solved iteratively. The simulation has been benchmarked on Alfven waves, ion sound waves and whistler waves against analytical dispersion relation in a slab. In particular, the first-order and second-order schemes are compared by studying the numerical damping of whistler waves. The full evolution of the resistive tearing mode using the Harris sheet equilibrium is also investigated. The linear growth rate and mode structure are compared with the resistive MHD theory. Important tearing mode nonlinear phenomena such as the Rutherford regime and saturation are demonstrated. We also presented systematic study of Rutherford growth rates and saturation island width, which is consistent with previous MHD studies.
