In this paper, we present a new model on neuronal intrinsic plasticity. We first show that the probability distribution of the neuronal firing rates is more suitable to be represented as a Weibull distribution than an exponential distribution. Then, we derive the intrinsic plasticity model based on information theory. This study provides a more realistic model for further research on the effects of intrinsic plasticity on various brain functions and dynamics.", "paper_title": "A Model of Neuronal Intrinsic Plasticity", "paper_id": "WOS:000298053700003"}
