The word shape is represented by the weighted topological signature vector (W-TSV), which encodes graph data into a low-dimensional vector space. Three directed acyclic graph (DAG) representations are proposed for Arabic word shapes, based on topological and geometrical features. Lexicon reduction is achieved by a nearest neighbors search in the W-TSV space. The proposed framework has been tested on the IFN/ENIT and the Ibn Sina databases, achieving respectively a degree of reduction of 83.5% and 92.9% for an accuracy of reduction of 90%.
