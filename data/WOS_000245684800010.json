We present an FIS, including both fuzzification and defuzzification, as a device for implementing a function f : R-N -> R-M. The family of FIS functions has cardinality N-2 = 2(N)1, where N-1 is the cardinality of the set R of real numbers. Hence the FIS family is much larger than polynomials, neural networks, etc.; furthermore a FIS has a capacity for local generalization. A formulation in the context of lattice theory allows us to define the set F* of fuzzy interval numbers (FINs), which includes both (fuzzy) numbers and intervals. We present a metric d(K) on F*, which can introduce tunable nonlinearities. FIS design based on d(K) has advantages such as: an alleviation of the curse of dimensionality problem and a potential for improved computer memory utilization. We present a new FIS classifier, namely granular self-organizing map (grSOM), which we apply to an industrial fertilizer modeling application.", "paper_title": "Novel fuzzy inference system (FIS) analysis and design based on lattice theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000245684800010"}
