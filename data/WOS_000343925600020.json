Because of supporting multi-band devices, WMN is suitable for different application in the Internet of Things. In order to meet the performance requirements of multimedia traffic transmission, the routing approach designed for WMN must be taken into account the combination of load balance and anti-interference. We propose an extended Ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV, which is a peer-to-peer the reactive routing approach) routing approach which is based on distributed adaptive random early detection and integrated metric for WMN. We firstly introduce several typical WMN routing approaches, and then based on the optimization theorem and cross-layer design proposes an integrated metrics to improve AODV routing approach. The steps and example using convex programming method are presented to solve routing optimization problem. Finally the feasibility of the proposed algorithm is verified with Method simulation. Simulation and analysis results show that the proposed EAODV routing approach improves the performance of WMN significantly.", "paper_title": "An EAODV routing approach based on DARED and integrated metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000343925600020"}
