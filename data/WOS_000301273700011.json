We present algorithms for parallel construction and traversing of sparse octrees. These algorithms are implemented in CUDA and tested on NVIDIA GPUs, but they are portable to OpenCL and can easily be used on many-core devices from other manufacturers. This portability is achieved by using general parallel-scan and sort methods. The gravitational tree-code outperforms tuned CPU code during the tree-construction and shows a performance improvement of more than a factor 20 overall, resulting in a processing rate of more than 2.8 million particles per second.
