It combines a multistage hypothesis testing procedure with the original sequential bifurcation procedure to control both the power for detecting important effects at each bifurcation step and the Type I error for each unimportant factor under heterogeneous variance conditions when a main-effects model applies. This paper improves the CSB procedure in two aspects. First, a new fully sequential hypothesis-testing procedure is introduced that greatly improves the efficiency of CSB. Moreover, this paper proposes CSB-X, a more general CSB procedure that has the same error control for screening main effects that CSB does, even when two-factor interactions are present. The performance of the new method is proven and compared with the original CSB procedure.", "paper_title": "Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy of Controlled Sequential Bifurcation for Simulation Factor Screening", "paper_id": "WOS:000280476300011"}
