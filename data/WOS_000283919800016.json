It allows users to investigate the genomic intervals together with the aligned reads and to work with, visualise and export these intervals. Moreover, the package operates within and extends the ever-growing Bioconductor framework and thus enables users to leverage a multitude of methods for their data in order to answer specific research questions.", "paper_title": "girafe - an R/Bioconductor package for functional exploration of aligned next-generation sequencing reads", "paper_id": "WOS:000283919800016"}
