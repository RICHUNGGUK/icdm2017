In particular, we study the generative capacity of a system in which annotations on a set of strings control which substrings are ultimately produced by the system and in which only the annotations, and not the strings themselves, maybe rewritten. On a biological level this represents a first attempt to better understand the computational limits of this form of epigenetic regulation. We introduce two different derivation modes for our formal system and show that these systems are actually quite weak. The weaker of the derivation modes is directly capable only of generating a subset of the regular languages modulo a begin- and an end-marker.", "paper_title": "COMPUTATION BY ANNOTATION: MODELLING EPIGENETIC REGULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000260806500002"}
