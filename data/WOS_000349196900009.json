A new concept named the adjacency function is defined on hypergraphs. This definition leads to distinct adjacency and Laplacian matrices for a hypergraph and makes it possible to express it in an algebraic form. Variable adjacency functions on hypergraphs result in generation of dynamic graph products which are applied to dynamic systems. For further clarity, some examples from structural mechanics are provided. The generality of the approach is shown through some examples, indicating this fact that the hypergraph products can encompass most of the available developments on the graph products in the literature.
