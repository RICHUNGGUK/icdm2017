The first model deals with a single server that continuously adapts its service rate based on the waiting time of the first customer in line. In the second model, one queue is served by a primary server which is supplemented by a secondary server when the waiting of the first customer in line exceeds a threshold. Using level crossings for the waiting-time process of the first customer in line, we derive steady-state waiting-time distributions for both models. The results are illustrated with numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Queues with waiting time dependent service", "paper_id": "WOS:000292931100003"}
