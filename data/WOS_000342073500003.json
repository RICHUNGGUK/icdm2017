We employ a multiphysics concept that adapts the numerical complexity locally according to the underlying processes to increase efficiency. The framework is supplemented by a local refinement of the simulation grid. To calculate the fluxes on such grids, we employ a combination of the standard two-point flux approximation and a multipoint flux approximation where the grid is refined. This is then used to simulate a large-scale example related to underground CO2 storage.", "paper_title": "Efficient multiphysics modelling with adaptive grid refinement using a MPFA method", "paper_id": "WOS:000342073500003"}
