The sensitivity information is derived using the recently developed passive method of characteristics. An important feature of the proposed method is that the sensitivities are obtained from the solution of the original network, leading to significant computational advantages. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity Analysis of Lossy Multiconductor Transmission Lines Based on the Passive Method of Characteristics Macromodel", "paper_id": "WOS:000282543700012"}
