Schemes for point clouds operate only on the geometric data and, hence, are generic and applicable to mesh-based representations of 3-D models. For building generic copyright schemes for 3-D models, this paper presents a robust blind watermarking mechanism for 3-D point-sampled geometry. The basic idea is to find a cluster tree from clusters of 3-D points. Using the cluster tree, watermarks can be embedded and extracted by deriving an order among points at global (intracluster) and local levels (intercluster). The multiple bit watermarks are encoded/decoded inside each cluster based on an extension of the cluster structure-based 3-D quantization index modulation. The encoding mechanism makes the technique robust against uniform affine transformations (rotation, scaling, and transformation), reordering, cropping, simplification, and noise addition attacks. The technique when applied to 3-D meshes also achieves robustness against retriangulation and progressive compression techniques. Customization of the bit-encoding scheme achieves high hiding capacity with embedding rates that are equal to 4 b/point, while maintaining the imperceptibility of the watermark with low distortions. The estimated time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the number of 3-D points.", "paper_title": "Robust Blind Watermarking of Point-Sampled Geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000263640700003"}
