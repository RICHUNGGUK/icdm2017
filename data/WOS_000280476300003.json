We define adjacency of these points based on weight space decomposition. Thus, our algorithms generalise the well-known dichotomic scheme to compute the set of nondominated extreme points in the outcome set of a biobjective programme. Both algorithms are illustrated with and numerically tested on instances of the assignment and knapsack problems with three objectives.", "paper_title": "A Recursive Algorithm for Finding All Nondominated Extreme Points in the Outcome Set of a Multiobjective Integer Programme", "paper_id": "WOS:000280476300003"}
