Numerical experiments show that this class of Hopfield neural networks can have chaotic attractors and limit cycles for different parameter configurations. By virtue of horseshoes theory in dynamic systems, rigorous computer-assisted verifications are done for their chaotic behavior. In terms of topological entropy, quantitative interpretations of these neural networks' complexity are given. A brief analysis is also presented about their robustness.", "paper_title": "Chaos and rigorous verification of horseshoes in a class of Hopfield neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273797700016"}
