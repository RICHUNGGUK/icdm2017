The first is a two-step estimation algorithm that improves estimation accuracy by excluding certain assumptions needed for the pattern matching algorithm reported by Banks and Hodge. The second is incorporating a 3D geometric articulation model into the algorithm to improve estimation accuracy substantially for the depth translation, and to introduce contact points' trajectories between the articular surfaces. The third is an algorithm to process estimation even when the silhouettes of two components overlap. To assess our algorithm's potential for clinical application, we carried out two experiments. First, we used a robot to position the prosthesis. Estimation accuracy was checked by comparing input data to the robot with the estimates from X-ray photographs. Incorporating our articulation model remarkably reduced the error in the depth translation. Next, we performed a clinical assessment by applying the algorithm and articulation model to fluoroscopy images of a patient who had recently had TKA.", "paper_title": "A 3D kinematic estimation of knee prosthesis using X-ray projection images: clinical assessment of the improved algorithm for fluoroscopy images", "paper_id": "WOS:000261181100009"}
