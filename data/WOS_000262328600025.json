The deterministic channel example is then translated into the Gaussian setting, creating the first known example of a fully connected Gaussian K-user interference network with single antenna nodes, real, nonzero and constant channel coefficients, and no propagation delays where the degrees of freedom outerbound is achieved. An analogy is drawn between the propagation delay based interference alignment examples and the deterministic channel model which also allows similar constructions for the two-user X channel as well.", "paper_title": "Interference Alignment on the Deterministic Channel and Application to Fully Connected Gaussian Interference Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262328600025"}
