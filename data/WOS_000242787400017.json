The results obtained show that the radiation exchange produces a rise in the heat transfer. The average Nusselt number and the through-flow strength increase when the gap width (w), maximal difference temperature (AT) and cavity width (L) get larger. Effects of different parameters on streamlines, temperature fields, average Nusselt number and throughflow strength are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
