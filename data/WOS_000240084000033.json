MMPR protocol focuses on interaction between a MAC and upper layers, whereby the MAC layer indirectly influences selection of the most reliable next forwarding node set by considering link channel states. The MMPR protocol reduces the number of contention phases and control frames using transmission power control techniques, considerably reducing the time required for broadcasting. In addition, our protocol increases throughput under channel fading and interference using a modified CSMA/CA scheme. Our simulation shows that MMPR is substantially more reliable and it provides high throughput in ad hoc network models compared to 802.11 broadcast and BMMM*.", "paper_title": "A medium access control scheme for providing reliability in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000033"}
