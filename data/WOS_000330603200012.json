Using Kim's idea in [4], Rim, Jeong and Park studied Euler polynomials arising from non-linear differential equations, in [8]. From these non-linear differential equations, we derive some new identities among the sums of products of Genocchi polynomials and Genocchi polynomials of higher order.", "paper_title": "NEW IDENTITIES ON GENOCCHI NUMBERS AND POLYNOMIALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000330603200012"}
