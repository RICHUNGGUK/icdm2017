All countries are classified into main knowledge creators (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) group) and main knowledge users (non-OECD group) in order to distinguish specific characteristics of knowledge interactions within groups and between groups. The analyses are carried out from four aspects, i.e., the overall distribution of knowledge interactions among countries, the countries' ability to inhabit and facilitate the knowledge flows among others with the help of flow betweenness measures, the countries' bridgeness between two groups with the recently developed Q-measures, and the most important bilateral knowledge interactions. Results show that although most of the international knowledge interactions still take place within the OECD group, the non-OECD countries have improved their performance significantly. They participate much more in international patenting and collaborations and play much more important roles in facilitating knowledge interactions among others. Among them, China and Taiwan are two most dazzling new stars according to their performance in international knowledge interactions. Considering together with their rapidly improved world competitiveness, the findings indicate that the wide and deep participation in international knowledge interactions may have great contribution to the economic competitiveness.
