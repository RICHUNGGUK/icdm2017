The modification simplifies routing further and guarantee orderly reception of packets without any loss of performance. Several traffic models have been used in these simulations; Bursty and non-bursty traffic with uniformly-distributed destination addresses and non-uniformly-distributed destination addresses. A simple new traffic model has been developed for generating non-uniformly-distributed destination addresses. This model is general enough to be used in developing new NoC architectures and captures universally accepted place-and-route methodologies. Simulation results are used to illustrate how the hardware resources of a modified Fat Tree NoC can be minimized without affecting the network performance. The performance of a NoC with regular Mesh topology was also evaluated for comparison with the modified Fat Tree topology.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED MODIFIED FAT-TREE TOPOLOGY NETWORK-ON-CHIP", "paper_id": "WOS:000293032100013"}
