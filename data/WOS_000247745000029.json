Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, by virtue of stochastic analysis, Halanay inequality for stochastic differential equations, drive-response concept and time-delay feedback control techniques, several sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the exponential synchronization of two identical chaotic delayed neural networks with stochastic perturbation. These conditions, which are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities, rely on the connection matrix in the drive networks as well as the suitable designed feedback gains in the response networks. Finally, a numerical example with its simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented synchronization scheme. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
