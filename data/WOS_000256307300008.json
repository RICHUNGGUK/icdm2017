Existing researches on supply chain network design problem are either restricted on deterministic environment or only address stochastic parameters. In this paper, we consider this problem in fuzzy environment. Under different criteria, we format three types of models for the decision makers: expected cost optimization model, chance-constrained model and chance maximization model. A genetic algorithm based on fuzzy simulation is developed to solve the proposed fuzzy models. Moreover, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of models and solution algorithm.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy programming approach for supply chain network design", "paper_id": "WOS:000256307300008"}
