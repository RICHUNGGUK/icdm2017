Based on Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality technique, some new delay independent conditions are derived to guarantee the global robust exponential stability of the equilibrium point. Furthermore, the obtained results are generalized to the interval neural networks and bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks. Two examples are used to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
