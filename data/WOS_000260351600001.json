The Method is to achieve two aims: (1) provide a generic 'wrap-around' optimization tool that is independent of both flow solver and grid generation package and (2) provide a method that allows high-fidelity aerodynamic optimization of two- and three-dimensional bodies with a low number of design variables. the parameterization technique uses radial basis functions to transfer domain element movements into deformations of the design surface and corresponding aerodynamic mesh, thus allowing total independence from the grid generation package (structured or unstructured). Independence from the flow solver (either inviseid, viscous, aeroelastic) is achieved by obtaining sensitivity information for an advanced gradient-based optimizer (feasible sequential quadratic programming) by finite-differences. Results are presented for two-dimensional aerofoil inverse design and drag optimization problems. Inverse design results demonstrate that a large proportion of the design space is feasible with a relatively low number of design variables using the domain element parameterization. Heavily constrained (in lift, volume, and moment) two-dimensional aerofoil drag optimiation has shown that significant improvements over existing designs can be achieved using this method, through the use of various objective functions.", "paper_title": "CFD-based optimization of aerofoils using radial basis functions for domain element parameterization and mesh deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000260351600001"}
