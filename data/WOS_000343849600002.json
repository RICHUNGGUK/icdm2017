Doing so allows each of these components to exist in an environment optimized for purpose. We make use of a poorly-known feature of the handle system for assigning persistent identifiers that allows an individual data file from a larger file set to be retrieved according to its file name or its MIME type. The data objects allow facile visualization and retrieval for reuse of the data and facilitates other operations such as data mining. Examples from five recently published articles illustrate these concepts.", "paper_title": "Digital Data Repositories in Chemistry and Their Integration with Journals and Electronic Notebooks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343849600002"}
