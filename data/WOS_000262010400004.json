De-interlacing is an algorithm to solve it. In previous papers. using motion compensation (MC) method for de-interlacing needs lots of computation complexity and it is not easy to implement in hardware. In this paper, a content adaptive de-interlacing algorithm is proposed. Our algorithm is based on the motion adaptive (MA) method which combines the advantages of intra-field and inter-field method. We propose a block type decision mechanism to predict the video content instead of a blind processing with MC method throughout the entire frame. Additionally, in intra-field method, we propose the edge-base adaptive weight average (EAWA) method to achieve a better performance and smooth the edge and stripe. In order to demonstrate out, algorithm, we implement the de-interlacing system oil the DSP platform with thorough complexity analysis. Compared to MC method, we not only achieve higher video quality in objective and subjective view, but also consume lower computation power. From the profiling on CPU run-time analysis, the proposed algorithm is only one-fifth of MC method. At the DSP demonstration board, the saving ratio is about 54% to 96%.", "paper_title": "Platform-Based Design for the Low Complexity and High Performance De-Interlacing System", "paper_id": "WOS:000262010400004"}
