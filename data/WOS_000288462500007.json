In the future, we can expect wireless mesh infrastructures (WMIs) to proliferate in this context. Due to the relatively low energy efficiency of wireless transmission, as compared to wired transmission, energy consumption of WMIs can represent a significant part of the energy consumption of the Internet as a whole. We explore different approaches to reduce energy consumption in WMIs, taking into account the heterogeneity of the technologies and the interaction with wired networks. Finally, we present an example scenario where the application of these methods is discussed.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Wireless Mesh Infrastructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000288462500007"}
