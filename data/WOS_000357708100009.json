Assume that the non-target vertices of G fail independently with given probabilities. The K-terminal reliability of G is defined as the probability that all target vertices in K are connected. Computing K-terminal reliability is #P-complete for chordal graphs, yet solvable in polynomial time for its subclass of interval graphs. While improving both of these results, this work demonstrates that although the problem remains #P-complete when restricted to directed path graphs, a further restriction to rooted directed path graphs yields a polynomial time solution.
