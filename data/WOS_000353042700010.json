We propose a new educational framework to optimize the continuous evaluation process for large groups. In our system, a computer provides tests to the mobile devices of the students; they then return the answers to be corrected. The framework provides real-time knowledge about the progress of the class to the teacher and real-time feedback to the students, increasing the rate of student success. Our low-cost implementation makes it unnecessary to incorporate additional resources or to modify the infrastructure. We have tested it in several courses and conferences. We conclude with an evaluation and a discussion from different stakeholders perspectives. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
