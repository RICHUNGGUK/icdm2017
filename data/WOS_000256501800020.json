In the DGBGK method, the construction of the flux in the DG method is based on the particle transport and collisional mechanism which not only couples the convective and dissipative terms together, but also includes both discontinuous and continuous terms in the flux formulation. Due to the connection between the gas-kinetic BGK model and the Euler as well as the Navier-Stokes equations, both viscous and inviscid flow equations can be simulated by a unified formulation. WENO limiters are used to obtain uniform high-order accuracy and sharp non-oscillatory shock transition. In the current method, the time accuracy is achieved by the direct integration of both time-dependent flux function at a cell interface and the flow variables inside each element. Numerical examples in one and two space dimensions are presented to illustrate the robustness and accuracy of the present scheme. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
