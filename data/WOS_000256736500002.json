Some members of BI1 family have been proved to play important roles in cell death. Here we discuss the similarities and differences among the members of BI1 family by comparative genomics and proteomics, and report here the discovery of a novel member, tmbim 1b, in Bos taurus. BI1 family is evolutionarily conserved as integral membrane proteins containing multiple membrane-spanning segments and predominantly localized to intracellular membranes, similar to Bcl-2 family proteins. They share multiple motifs and transcriptional factors within the promoter and the coding regions. They may represent regulators of cell death pathways, which are concluded from structure conservation of BI I family. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
