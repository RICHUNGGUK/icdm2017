This paper presents FCLOS, a complete client-server architecture explicitly designed for mOLAP. FCLOS founds on intelligent scheduling and compressed transmissions in order to become a query efficient, self-adaptive and scalable mOLAP information system. Scheduling exploits derivability between data cubes in order to group related queries and eventually reduce the necessary transmissions (broadcasts). Compression is achieved by the m-Dwarf, a novel, compressed data cube physical structure, which has no loss of semantic information and is explicitly designed for mobile applications. The superiority of FCLOS against state of the art systems is shown both experimentally and analytically. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
