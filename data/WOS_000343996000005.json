The captured velocity profiles of temperature-driven flow in a parallel microchannel and in a micro-chamber are compared with available kinetic data or direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results. The advantages of the high-order moment method are shown as a combination of more accuracy than the Navier Stokes Fourier (NSF) equations and less computation cost than the DSMC method. In addition, the high-order moment method is also employed to simulate the thermal transpiration flow in complex geometries in two types of Knudsen pumps. One is based on micro-mechanized channels, where the effect of different wall temperature distributions on thermal transpiration flow is studied. The other relies on porous structures, where the variation of flow rate with a changing porosity or pore surface area ratio is investigated. These simulations can help to optimize the design of a real Knudsen pump.", "paper_title": "Simulation of thermal transpiration flow using a high-order moment method", "paper_id": "WOS:000343996000005"}
