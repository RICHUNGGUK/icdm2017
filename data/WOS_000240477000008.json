As expected, the h-index of productive consumer scholars correlated strongly with their total citation counts. Furthermore, the h-indices as obtained via ISI/Thompson and GoogleScholar were highly correlated albeit the latter yielded higher values. Finally, using a database of business-relevant journals, a significant correlation was found between the journals' h-indices and their citation impact scores.", "paper_title": "Exploring the h-index at the author and journal levels using bibliometric data of productive consumer scholars and business-related journals respectively", "paper_id": "WOS:000240477000008"}
