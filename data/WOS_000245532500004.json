The solution in the transformed domain is obtained using the method of Laplace transforms. Thereafter a numerical inverting procedure is applied to study the behaviors in the time domain. The variation of soil compressibility during compression and rebound is paid special attention, and a computer program has been written that enables this facet of soil behavior to be accounted for. The technique used is numerically stable and has proved accurate in predicting consolidation settlements and the distribution of void ratios within soil layers. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
