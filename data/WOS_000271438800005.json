The synaptic matrix can be flexibly configured and provides both recurrent and external connectivity with address-event representation compliant devices. We demonstrate a marked improvement in the efficiency of the network in classifying correlated patterns, owing to the self-regulating mechanism.", "paper_title": "Classification of Correlated Patterns with a Configurable Analog VLSI Neural Network of Spiking Neurons and Self-Regulating Plastic Synapses", "paper_id": "WOS:000271438800005"}
