The importance and major difficulty lies in satisfying the conflicting objectives of satisfying contracted service level agreement while lowering used resource costs. In this paper, the authors propose a mathematical multitier framework for adaptive virtual resource allocation problem. The framework captures the performance of the virtualized cloud platform gracefully. The authors first use simulations to derive virtual resource allocation policies, and later use real benchmarking applications, to verify the effectiveness of this framework. Experimental results show that the model can be simply and effectively used to satisfy the response time requirement as well as lowering the cost of using the virtual machine resources.", "paper_title": "Provisioning Virtual Resources Adaptively in Elastic Compute Cloud Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000295797600003"}
