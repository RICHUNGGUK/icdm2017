Among them, clique separator decomposition (a decomposition tree of the graph whose leaves have no clique separator (so-called atoms)) used by Tarjan for solving various optimization problems recently received much attention. In this note, we first derive the atomic structure of two subclasses of P-5-free graphs, where P-5 is a chordless path on five vertices. These results enable us to provide efficient solutions for the MAXIMUM WEIGHT INDEPENDENT SET problem in these classes of graphs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
