These security infrastructures can be organized in the following main areas: Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and user management, communications security, and new cryptographic algorithms. This paper presents the new ideas, architectures and deployed testbeds for these areas. In particular, it explains the inner structure of the INDECT PKI employed for federated identity management, the different technologies employed in the VPN testbed, the INDECT Block Cipher (IBC) - a novel cryptographic algorithm that has being integrated into OpenSSL library, and how IBC-enabled TLS/SSL sessions and X.509 certificates are employed to protect INDECT applications. All proposed mechanisms have been designed to work in an integrated fashion as the security foundation of all systems being developed by the INDECT project for LEAs.", "paper_title": "Integrated security infrastructures for law enforcement agencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000356168600016"}
