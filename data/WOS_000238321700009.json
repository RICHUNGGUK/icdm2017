Although disassembly in practice is manual and labor intensive, little attention has been paid to the human intervention in the disassembly process. This paper addresses this deficiency by developing a fuzzy attributed Petri net (FAPN) model to mathematically represent uncertainty in disassembly due to a large amount of human intervention. An algorithm based upon this model is further proposed for optimal disassembly planning with a view to making the technique more applicable to real industry settings. The benefit of the proposed model and algorithm is illustrated through the disassembly of a personal computer (PC) in a prototypical disassembly system.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy-Petri-net-based disassembly planning considering-human factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000238321700009"}
