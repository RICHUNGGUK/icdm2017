Among other results, Conlon, Fox and Sudakov recently proved that this holds for the random graph G(n, p) with probability approaching 1 as n -> infinity. In this paper we show that for most edge probabilities G(n, p) can be decomposed into a union of n/4 + np/2 + o(n) cycles and edges w.h.p. This result is asymptotically tight.", "paper_title": "Decomposing Random Graphs into Few Cycles and Edges", "paper_id": "WOS:000362717800003"}
