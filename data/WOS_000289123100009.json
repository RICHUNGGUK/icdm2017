Incorrect results can appear in incompressible Navier-Stokes or Stokes problems when the numerical approach couples into spurious modes. In Maxwell or magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations the so-called spectrum pollution effect can occur, and the numerical solution does not stably converge to the physical one. Problems coming from a mesh that is not adapted to the underlying physical problem, or from an inadequate choice of the dependent and independent variables can lead to low precision. Efficiency of a code implementation can be improved by well adapting the parallel computer to the application. A new monitoring system enables to detect poor implementations, to find best suited resources to execute the job, and to adapt the processor frequency during. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
