General methods exist to show that all semicomputable and computable algebras can be characterised up to isomorphism by such specifications. Here we consider these specification methods for specific computable rational number arithmetics. In particular, we give an elementary equational specification of the 0-totalised rational function field Q(0)(X) with its degree operator as an auxiliary function.", "paper_title": "Elementary algebraic specifications of the rational function field", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424100005"}
