The data is used as a gold-standard to evaluate four SPECT/MRI similarity-based registration methods. Simulation realism was accounted for using accurate physical models of data generation and acquisition. MRI and SPECT simulations were generated from three subjects to take into account inter-subject anatomical variability. Functional SPECT data were computed from six functional models of brain perfusion. Previous models of normal perfusion and ictal perfusion observed in Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE) were considered to generate functional variability. We studied the impact noise and intensity non-uniformity in MRI simulations and SPECT scatter correction may have on registration accuracy. We quantified the amount of registration error caused by anatomical and functional variability. Registration involving ictal data was less accurate than registration involving normal data. MR intensity non-uniformity was the main factor decreasing registration accuracy. The proposed simulated database is promising to evaluate many functional neuroimaging methods, involving MRI and SPECT data.", "paper_title": "Realistic simulated MRI and SPECT databases - Application to SPECT/MRI registration evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300041"}
