Here we present a simple model of cascading failures for weighted packet networks, such as the Internet. In the model, links between nodes are chosen as the main research object, and local load redistribution is taken into account. Moreover, the influence factor, which is represented by betweenness centrality of neighboring links, is introduced to characterize the affection induced by jamming links. We study the model in both ER and BA networks using numerical simulation methods. We show that, in addition to the location of congestion, cascades of a packet network perturbed by a single jamming link also depend on the intrinsic topology characteristics and the current traffic load states of the network, which are of crucial factors. This is particularly important for real networks like the Internet to avoid the spread of traffic jam in the whole network.", "paper_title": "Modeling Cascading Failures for Weighted Packet Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289038500003"}
