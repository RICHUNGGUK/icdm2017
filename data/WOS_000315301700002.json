Unlike previous work, which has only been demonstrated on data sets of a few hundred megabytes maximum, our method scales to very large scenes: We map the detection problem to a nearest-neighbour problem in a low-dimensional feature space, and follow this with a cascade of tests for geometric clustering of potential matches. Our algorithm robustly handles noisy real-world scanner data, obtaining a recognition performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods. In practice, it scales linearly with scene size and achieves a high absolute throughput, processing half a terabyte of scanner data overnight on a dual socket commodity PC.", "paper_title": "Scalable Symmetry Detection for Urban Scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000315301700002"}
