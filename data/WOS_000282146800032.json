The existing edge-preserving smoothing methods may inevitably take fine details as noise or vice versa. In this paper, we propose a new edge-preserving smoothing technique based on a modified anisotropic diffusion. The proposed method can simultaneously preserve edges and fine details while filtering out noise in the diffusion process. The classical anisotropic diffusion models consider only the gradient information of a diffused pixel, and cannot preserve detailed features with low gradient. Since the fine details in the neighborhood of the image generally have larger gray-level variance than the noisy background, the proposed diffusion model incorporates both local gradient and gray-level variance to preserve edges and fine details while effectively removing noise. Experimental results from a variety of test samples including shoulder patch images, medical images and artwork images have shown that the proposed anisotropic diffusion scheme can effectively smooth noisy background, yet well preserve edge and fine details in the restored image.
