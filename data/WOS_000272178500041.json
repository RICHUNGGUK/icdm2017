For steel plate structures joined with fasteners, fatigue is governed by local friction and slip near the fasteners. As a working hypothesis for this study, a \"weakest link\" approach has been adopted. An optimum fastener pattern is attained by reducing the shear load in the most severely loaded fastener in the group. In this study, a typical eccentric multi-fastener bracket-to-beam joint was studied using constrained geometric optimization. Alternate assumptions concerning the distribution of the direct shear force between fasteners in a group were assessed. An analytical expression for non-uniform direct shear force resulted in an optimized fastener pattern with approximately 20% lower von Mises equivalent strain. The comparative finite element method based topology optimization analysis resulted in a contour, which was in close agreement with the fastener pattern attained analytically by exploiting geometry optimization.", "paper_title": "Pattern optimization of eccentrically loaded multi-fastener joints", "paper_id": "WOS:000272178500041"}
