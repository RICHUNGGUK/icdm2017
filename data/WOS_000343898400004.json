In such diagrams we are also able to represent absolute and relative timing constraints. In this paper we present a formal semantics for C-O diagrams based on timed automata extended with information regarding the satisfaction and violation of clauses in order to represent different deontic modalities. As a proof of concept, we apply our approach to two different case studies, where the method presented here has successfully identified problems in the specification.", "paper_title": "Specification and Verification of Normative Texts Using C-O Diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000343898400004"}
