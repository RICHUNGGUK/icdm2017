At present, the method of measurement and assessment of software trustworthiness cannot guarantee safe and reliable operations of software systems completely and effectively. Based on the dynamical system study, this paper interprets the characteristics of behaviors of software systems and the basic scientific problems of software trustworthiness complexity, analyzes the characteristics of complexity of software trustworthiness, and proposes to study the software trustworthiness measurement in terms of the complexity of software trustworthiness. Using the dynamical statistical analysis methods, the paper advances an invariant-measure based assessment method of software trustworthiness by statistical indices, and hereby provides a dynamical criterion for the untrustworthiness of software systems. By an example, the feasibility of the proposed dynamical statistical analysis method in software trustworthiness measurement is demonstrated using numerical simulations and theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Complexity of software trustworthiness and its dynamical statistical analysis methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000269899800011"}
