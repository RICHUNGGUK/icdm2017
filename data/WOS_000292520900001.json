To accomplish these management tasks, both network discovery and connectivity information are essential. This paper examines various problems with the existing topology discovery mechanisms and proposes an SNMP-based approach to discover physical as well as logical topology. We present algorithms for identifying network device types and discovering connectivity among them. The connectivity of end host and management information base (MIB)-enabled devices with switches and routers is discussed and evaluated. We also present an algorithm for discovering logical topology, such as VLAN and subnet connectivity. Finally, we present a combination of graph and tree layouts, to visualize connectivity information.
