The computational model is a network of processors exchanging O(log n)-bit messages (the CONGEST model). For unweighted graphs, we give an algorithm providing (1 - epsilon)-approximation in O(log n) time for any constant epsilon > 0, improving on the classical 1/2-approximation in Olog n) time of Israeli and Itai [1986]. The time complexity of the algorithm depends on 1/epsilon exponentially in the general case, and polynomially in bipartite graphs. For weighted graphs, we present another algorithm which provides (1/2 - epsilon) approximation in general graphs in O(log epsilon(-1) log n) time, improving on the previously known algorithms which attain (1/4 - epsilon)-approximation in O(log n) time or 1/2-approximation in O(n) time. All our algorithms are randomized: the complexity bounds hold both with high probability and for the expected running time.", "paper_title": "Improved Distributed Approximate Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000364039500007"}
