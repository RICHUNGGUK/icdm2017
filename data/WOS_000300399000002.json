Although it has been recognized that systematic human brain data analysis is an important issue of BI methodology, the existing expert-driven multi-aspect data analysis excessively depends on individual capabilities and cannot be widely adopted in BI community. In this paper, we propose a Data-Brain driven approach for systematic brain data analysis, which is implemented by using the Data-Brain, Data-Brain based BI provenances and Global Learning Scheme for BI. Furthermore, a human numerical inductive reasoning centric investigation is described to demonstrate significance and usefulness of the proposed approach. Such a Data-Brain driven approach reduces the dependency on individual capabilities and provides a practical way for realizing the systematic human brain data analysis of BI methodology.
