In this paper, we develop achievability protocols and outer bounds for the secure network coding setting, where the edges are subject to packet erasures, and public feedback of the channel state is available to both Eve and the legitimate network nodes. We show that by leveraging erasures and feedback, we can achieve secrecy rates that are in some cases multiple times higher than the alternative of separate channel-error-correction followed by secure network coding; moreover, we develop outer bounds and prove optimality of our proposed schemes in some special cases.", "paper_title": "Secure Network Coding With Erasures and Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000351470800011"}
