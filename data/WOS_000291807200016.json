The ability to predict the performance of a recognition system based on its outputs for each match instance is desirable for a number of important reasons, including automatic threshold selection for determining matches and nonmatches, and automatic algorithm selection or weighting for multi-algorithm fusion. The emerging body of literature on postrecognition score analysis has been largely constrained to biometrics, where the analysis has been shown to successfully complement or replace image quality metrics as a predictor. We develop a new statistical predictor based upon the Weibull distribution, which produces accurate results on a per instance recognition basis across different recognition problems. Experimental results are provided for two different face recognition algorithms, a fingerprint recognition algorithm, a SIFT-based object recognition system, and a content-based image retrieval system.", "paper_title": "Meta-Recognition: The Theory and Practice of Recognition Score Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000291807200016"}
