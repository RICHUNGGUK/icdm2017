The method is based on the technique of the Hadamard transform combined with a companding transform. We experimentally demonstrate that, in an optical intensity-modulation direct-detection OFDM transmission system, the hybrid method has better performance in reducing the PAPR compared with the case of applying only the Hadamard transform or only a companding transform.", "paper_title": "Hadamard Transform Combined With Companding Transform Technique for PAPR Reduction in an Optical Direct-Detection OFDM System", "paper_id": "WOS:000310369200001"}
