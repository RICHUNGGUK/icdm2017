The face detection system architecture use cascade method by illuminant face model. Also, we detect eye region after face detection. We construct nine classes to eye detector. It is enhanced eye detection ratio for varying illuminant face images. We define context to illumination class and distinguish class back propagation. Also, we made in context model using face illuminant. The multiple classifiers consist of face illuminant information. Context based Bayesian classifiers are employed for selection of face and eye detection windows. Face detection system is enhanced for face detection form multiple face class and non-face class. Proposed method is high performance more than single classifier.", "paper_title": "Robust eye detection method for varying environment using illuminant context-awareness", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000045"}
