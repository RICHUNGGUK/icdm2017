To realize a single member can sign a message independently, the scheme utilizes a special way to distribute signature key. The analysis shows that security problems such as external attack, collusion attack can be solved with the scheme. Comparing with the present schemes, our scheme is more convenient in key distribution, dynamical in adding and deleting group members.", "paper_title": "A NEW FORWARD-SECURE THRESHOLD SIGNATURE SCHEME FOR NETWORK AGRICULTURAL TRADE", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468800039"}
