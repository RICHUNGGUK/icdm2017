Two transmission strategies, i.e., complex field network coding (CFNC) and amplify-and-forward network coding (AFNC), are applied in the system, and the approximate expressions of outage probability are derived at high SNR and the conclusion is reached that the system diversity gains of two transmission strategies are both 2m, as is verified by numerical simulations. Simulation results also show that CFNC can outperform both AFNC and direct transmission without relay in the performances of system outage probability, sum rate and symbol error ratio.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of network coding for multicast relay system over Nakagami-m fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000297709100010"}
