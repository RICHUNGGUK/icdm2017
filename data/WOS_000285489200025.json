Aided by the new training sequence (TS) with perfect autocorrelation in the time domain and flat frequency response in the frequency domain, the proposed TDS-MC-CDMA system outperform the traditional MC-CDMA system in terms of spectrum efficiency by about 10%. Simulations are carried out to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Training Sequence Aided MC-CDMA Scheme with High Spectrum Efficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000285489200025"}
