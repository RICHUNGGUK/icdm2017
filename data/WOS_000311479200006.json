Based on Horowitz's original three degree of freedom design and extensions developed afterwards, this approach concentrates on neutrally stable, higher type, uncertain plants. A three degree of freedom non-interfering loop structure is used for the synthesis, along with the structure of the additional, independent loop transmission around the saturating element proposed for designing the third degree of freedom H(s). Robust stability and performance are established. The circle criterion, the describing function and non-overshooting conditions are utilised to obtain design constraints. Finally, all these design constraints are expressed in frequency domain bounds and synthesis follows from loop shaping methods such as quantitative feedback theory.", "paper_title": "A robust synthesis methodology for neutrally stable uncertain SISO plants under input amplitude saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000311479200006"}
