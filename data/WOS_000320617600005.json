The time delays comprise discrete and distributed interval time-varying delays and the uncertain parameters are norm-bounded. Delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the passivity problem are obtained by using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. The important feature of the results lies in that it does not make use of upper bounds to introduce some degree of conservativeness. Two illustrative examples are exploited in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedures.", "paper_title": "A DELAY-DEPENDENT APPROACH TO ROBUST PASSIVITY ANALYSIS FOR TAKAGI-SUGENO FUZZY UNCERTAIN RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS WITH MIXED INTERVAL TIME-VARYING DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000320617600005"}
