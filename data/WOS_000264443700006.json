Existing works on protein structural class prediction are computationally intensive. The method employs SOFM for extraction of representative feature vectors, for the four different structural classes and then uses Principal Component Analysis for finding optimum feature vector dimension. Nearest neighborhood classification technique is finally utilised; to classify these protein datapoints to their respective classes. The proposed work presented in this paper, maintains the same level of classification accuracy in minimum computation time, as it employs most prominent and reduced number of feature set for classification.", "paper_title": "A neural network based approach for protein structural class prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000264443700006"}
