Some new sufficient conditions are presented for the global stability of BAM neural networks with time-varying delays by constructing Lyapunov functional and using linear matrix inequality (LMI), Halanay's inequality. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V..
