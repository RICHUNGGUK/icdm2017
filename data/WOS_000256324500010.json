Available methods for the determination of settlement are not reliable. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM), a novel type of learning algorithm based on statistical theory, has been used to predict the settlement of shallow foundations on cohesionless soil. SVM uses a regression technique by introducing an epsilon - insensitive loss function. A thorough sensitive analysis has been made to ascertain which parameters are having maximum influence on settlement. The study shows that SVM has the potential to be a useful and practical tool for prediction of settlement of shallow foundation on cohesionless soil. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
