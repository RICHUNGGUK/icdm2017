Consumer health information, which has become more available on the Internet, plays an extremely important role in addressing these concerns. A subject directory as an information organization and browsing mechanism is widely used in consumer health-related Websites. In this study we employed the information visualization technique Self-Organizing Map (SOM) in combination with a new U-matrix algorithm to analyze health subject clusters through a Web transaction log. An experimental study was conducted to test the proposed methods. The findings show that the clusters identified from the same cells based on path-length-1 outperformed both the clusters from the adjacent cells based on path-length-1 and the clusters from the same cells based on path-length-2 in the visual SOM display. The U-matrix method successfully distinguished the irrelevant subjects situated in the adjacent cells with different colors in the SOM display. The findings of this study lead to a better understanding of the health-related subject relationship from the users' traversal perspective.", "paper_title": "Visual Health Subject Directory Analysis Based on Users' Traversal Activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000270250900004"}
