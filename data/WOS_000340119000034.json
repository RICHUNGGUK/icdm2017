In this paper, we propose to use the complex Gaussian scale mixture (CGSM) model in complex wavelet domain for noise reduction in complementary DNA microarray images. Based on the joint information in the red and green channel microarray images, we model the complex wavelet coefficients of the channel images jointly using the CGSM, and subsequently perform image denoising using Bayes least square estimator in complex wavelet domain. The experimental results show that using the CGSM of complex wavelet coefficients provides better noise reduction of microarray images compared to other complex wavelet-based models.", "paper_title": "Microarray Image Denoising Using Complex Gaussian Scale Mixtures of Complex Wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000340119000034"}
