In this paper, a whole methodology is proposed to estimate these forces. The new approach is based oil a sensor fusion technique that integrates the information of a wrist force sensor. of a 3D accelerometer placed at the robot tool and the joint position sensors measurements. The proposed methodology not only offers a Suitable estimator in terms of response and filtering, but also presents a self-calibrating feature that allows an easy integration into any industrial setup. To experimentally validate the performance of the proposed methodology, two different industrial manipulators were used: an ABB robot and a Staubli robot, both with open control system architectures. An impedance control scheme Was used as force/position control law to demonstrate the need and results of the proposed calibration result. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
