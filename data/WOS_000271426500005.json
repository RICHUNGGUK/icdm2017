In this paper, we propose an approach to improve the estimation of the execution cost of a query (or part of a query) in a grid environment by using Mobile Agents (MAs) and runtime monitoring information. First, Mas allow dynamic optimisation in a decentralised and autonomous way. Second, the retrieval of the monitoring information causes some issues addressed by a dedicated service called the Network Distance Service (NDS). The performance evaluation shows that our approach allows a better estimation of the execution cost of a query in a grid and a large benefit to monitor the CPU for a mobile join when the subestimation errors increase while the benefit to monitor the bandwidth is poor.", "paper_title": "A monitoring service for large-scale dynamic query optimisation in a grid environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000271426500005"}
