Our technique can automatically transfer brushstroke textures and color changes to 3D models from samples of a painted image. Therefore, the generation of stylized images or animation in the style of a given artwork can be achieved. This new approach works particularly well for a rich variety of brushstrokes ranging from simple 1D and 2D line-art strokes to very complicated ones with significant variations in stroke characteristics. During the rendering or animation process, the coherence of brushstroke textures and color changes over 3D surfaces can be well maintained. With PAM, we can also easily generate the illusion of flow animation over a 3D surface to convey the shape of a model.", "paper_title": "Stylized rendering using samples of a painted image", "paper_id": "WOS:000252254200018"}
