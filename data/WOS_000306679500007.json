However, illegal attackers or hackers can easily grab, duplicate, or revise the medical images on the Internet. Generally, a medical image should be kept intact for accurately diagnosing the patient's condition. A reversible image hiding method can restore the original medical image losslessly only from the stego-image. The reversible image hiding method can be used to conceal secret data in a medical image; however, it can only carry a few secret data. On the contrary, an irreversible image hiding method can generally hold much more secret data. In a medical image, \"region of interest\" (ROI) is a region which contains important information and must be stored without any distortion. This paper hence proposes an ROI-based image hiding method which embeds secret data in non-ROI by an irreversible image hiding method and in ROIs by a reversible image hiding method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can not only provide a good performance in data embedding capacity and stego-image quality but can also restore the ROIs without any distortion.", "paper_title": "AN ROI-BASED MEDICAL IMAGE HIDING METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000306679500007"}
