In the MRA process, the smoothness of a flow pattern is assessed by the difference between original flow property values, and the values approximated by high-order interpolating polynomial in decomposition. Insignificant data in smooth region are discarded, and flux computation is performed only where crucial features of a solution exist. The reduction of expensive flow computation improves the overall computational efficiency. In order to maintain the high-order accuracy, modified thresholding procedure restricts the additional error introduced by the thresholding below the order of accuracy of a conventional solver. The practical applicability of the MRA method is validated in various continuous and discontinuous flow problems. The MRA stably computes the Euler equations for continuous and discontinuous flow problems and maintains the accuracy of a conventional solver. Overall, it substantially enhances the computational efficiency of the conventional third-order accurate solver.
