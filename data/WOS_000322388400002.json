To support CCDP, data must be shared. Such shared data must be privatized, but that privatization could severely damage the utility of the data. Aim: To enable effective defect prediction from shared data while preserving privacy. Method: We explore privatization algorithms that maintain class boundaries in a dataset. CLIFF is an instance pruner that deletes irrelevant examples. MORPH is a data mutator that moves the data a random distance, taking care not to cross class boundaries. CLIFF+MORPH are tested in a CCDP study among 10 defect datasets from the PROMISE data repository. Results: We find: 1) The CLIFFed+MORPHed algorithms provide more privacy than the state-of-the-art privacy algorithms; 2) in terms of utility measured by defect prediction, we find that CLIFF+MORPH performs significantly better. Conclusions: For the OO defect data studied here, data can be privatized and shared without a significant degradation in utility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published result where privatization does not compromise defect prediction.", "paper_title": "Balancing Privacy and Utility in Cross-Company Defect Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000322388400002"}
