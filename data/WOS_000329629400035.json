Therefore, the safety of helicopter platforms have attracted the attention of many researchers in the past two decades. In order to deal with these problems, this paper presents an overview of the recent development and current researches in the field of fault diagnosis, including analytical/model-based, signal processing-based and knowledge-based techniques, and also passive/active fault- tolerant control approaches. Among various helicopters, single-rotor aerial vehicles, i.e. manned helicopters, unmanned helicopters, two and three degree-of-freedom unmanned helicopter experimental platforms, are considered for providing an overall picture of the fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control approaches based on the review of journal articles in last two decades, conference articles in last several years and some books.", "paper_title": "A Review on Fault Diagnosis and Fault Tolerant Control Methods for Single-rotor Aerial Vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400035"}
