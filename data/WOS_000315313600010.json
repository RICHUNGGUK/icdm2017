However, the identification of the writer in graphical documents is still challenging. In this work, we adapt the Bag of Visual Words framework to the task of writer identification in handwritten musical scores. A vanilla implementation of this method already performs comparably to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of two improvements of the representation: a Bhattacharyya embedding, which improves the results at virtually no extra cost, and a Fisher Vector representation that very significantly improves the results at the cost of a more complex and costly representation. Experimental evaluation shows results more than 20 points above the state-of-the-art in a new, challenging dataset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
