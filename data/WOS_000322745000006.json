We show that, contrary to shifts of infinite sequences, there is no unique reduced deterministic irreducible tree automaton accepting an irreducible sofic tree-shift, but that there is a unique synchronized one, called the Fischer automaton of the tree-shift. We define the notion of almost of finite type tree-shift which are sofic tree-shifts accepted by a tree automaton which is both deterministic and co-deterministic with a finite delay. It is a meaningful intermediate dynamical class in between irreducible finite type tree-shifts and irreducible sofic tree-shifts. We characterize the Fischer automaton of an almost of finite type tree-shift and we design an algorithm to check whether a sofic tree-shift is almost of finite type. We prove that the Fischer automaton is a topological conjugacy invariant of the underlying irreducible sofic tree-shift.", "paper_title": "Sofic Tree-Shifts", "paper_id": "WOS:000322745000006"}
