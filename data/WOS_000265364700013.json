Inverse kinematics analysis is carried out by the simulation. In the prototype building, the novel redundant actuation is adopted. The contribution of the novel redundantly actuated interface is that it makes possible for the motors to drive a much large load and expand the age of the lead screw. The spherical joint is also replaced by the combination of Hooke joint and rotation joint. In these ways, it is feasible for the 6-dof parallel seismic simulator with novel redundant actuation to be used for the application of large load requirement. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
