To mitigate this problem the usage of mobile sinks is proposed. Mobile sinks implicitly provide load-balancing and help achieving uniform energy-consumption across the network. However, the mechanisms to support the sink mobility (e.g., advertising the location of the mobile sink to the network) introduce an overhead in terms of energy consumption and packet delays. With these properties mobile sink routing constitutes an interesting research field with unique requirements. In this paper, we present a survey of the existing distributed mobile sink routing protocols. In order to provide an insight to the rationale and the concerns of a mobile sink routing protocol, design requirements and challenges associated with the problem of mobile sink routing are determined and explained. A definitive and detailed categorization is made and the protocols' advantages and drawbacks are determined with respect to their target applications.", "paper_title": "Distributed Mobile Sink Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000339727700015"}
