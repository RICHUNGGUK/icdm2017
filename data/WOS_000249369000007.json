For this pilot study, we recorded the MEGs with a 148-channel wholehead magnetometer in 20 patients with probable AD and 21 age-matched control subjects. Artefact-free epochs of 3392 samples were analysed with auto-mutual information (AMI). Average AMI decline rates were lower for the AD patients' recordings than for control subjects' ones. Statistically significant differences were found using a Student's t-test (p < 0.01) in 144 channels. Mean AMI values were analysed with a receiver operating characteristic curve. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values of 75%, 90.5% and 82.9% were obtained. Our results show that AMI estimations of the magnetic brain activity are different in both groups, hence indicating an abnormal type of dynamics associated with AD. This study suggests that AMI might help medical doctors in the diagnosis of the disease. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
