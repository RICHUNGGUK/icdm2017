It investigates the integration of discriminant power in the learning of generative models, which are usually used for such data. Based on a procedure that transforms a sample data into a generative model, learning is viewed as the selection of efficient component models in a mixture of generative models. This may be done through the learning of a support vector machine. We propose a few kernels for this and report experimental results for classification and segmentation tasks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
