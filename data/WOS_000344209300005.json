From the human perception, the imperceptible watermark of marked media can preserve the fidelity and readability of the image's content. With the designed, window-based histogram operation, the embedded pattern of the marked media can be exhibited and recognized visually. That is, the designed mechanism can satisfy the essentials of both visible and invisible watermarking techniques to promote significant pattern sharing and identification for mobile applications. Simulations demonstrate that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the marked image is superior (around 50-70 dB) to many of the existing watermarking algorithms. The process is of low computational complexity, efficient and can be applied in the real world via mobile devices via inner histogram operation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
