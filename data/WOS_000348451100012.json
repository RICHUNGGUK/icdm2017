In this paper, we propose a supervised manifold learning approach called SubManifold Individuality LEarning (SMILE). In SMILE, the linear subspace derived from the principal component analysis based on data with the same label is named as \"the individual subspace\", while the linear subspace learned from all data is defined as \"the global subspace\". For each data sample, the aim of SMILE is to enlarge the diversity between its reconstructed data from individual subspace and global subspace, respectively, so that the intrinsic character of each class can be stimulated in the feature space. SMILE also utilizes the Laplacian matrix to restrict the local structure of data in the low-dimensional feature space in order to preserve the locality of the high-dimensional data. The proposed method is validated in appearance-based face recognition problem on some typical facial image databases via extracting discriminative features. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can obtain the discriminative structure of facial manifold and extract better features for face recognition than other counterparts approaches.", "paper_title": "Discriminative structure discovery via dimensionality reduction for facial image manifold", "paper_id": "WOS:000348451100012"}
