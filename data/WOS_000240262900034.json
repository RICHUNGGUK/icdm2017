They interact with connected image regions rather than individual pixels, which can either be removed or retained unmodified. This prevents edge distortion and noise amplification, a property particularly appreciated in filtering and segmentation. In this paper we investigate their performance using a generalized notion of connectivity that is referred to as \"clustering-based connectivity\". We show that we can capture thin fragmented structures which are filtered out with existing techniques.", "paper_title": "Filament enhancement by non-linear volumetric filtering using clustering-based connectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000240262900034"}
