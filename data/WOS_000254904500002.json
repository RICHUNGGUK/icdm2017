A detailed comparison of the main niching approaches are presented first. The niching paradigm and difference of the selection-recombination genetic algorithms (GAs) and the recombination-replacement SSGAs are discussed. Then the q-NNR is developed by adopting special replacement policies based on the SSGAs; a Boltzmann scheme for dynamically sizing the nearest neighbors set is designed to achieve a speed-up and control the proportion of individuals adapted to different niches. Finally, experiments are carried out on a set of test functions characterized by deception, epistasis, symmetry and multimodality. The results are satisfactory and illustrate the effectivity and efficiency of the proposed niching method.", "paper_title": "Crowding with nearest neighbors replacement for multiple species niching and building blocks preservation in binary multimodal functions optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000254904500002"}
