It is required to find a minmax regret assignment. The problem is known to be strongly NP-hard. We present and compare computationally several exact and heuristic methods, including Benders decomposition, using CPLEX, a variable depth neighborhood local search, and two hybrid population-based heuristics. We report results of extensive computational experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
