The algorithm uses O(log n) applications of the matrix on structured random test vectors and O(n log n) extra computational cost, where n is the dimension of the unknown matrix. Numerical examples on constructing Green's functions for elliptic operators in two dimensions show efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
