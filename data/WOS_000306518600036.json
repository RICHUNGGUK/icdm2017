First, let p, q be distinct primes with gcd ((p - 1)p, (q - 1)q) = gcd(p - 1, q - 1) = e; we give a method to compute the linear complexity of Whiteman's generalized cyclotomic sequences of period p(m+1)q(n+1). Second, if e = 4, we compute the exact linear complexity of Whiteman's generalized cyclotomic sequences. Third, if p equivalent to q equivalent to 5 (mod 8), gcd(p - 1, q - 1) = 4 ,and we fix a common primitive root g of both p and q, then 2 is an element of H-0 = (g), which is a subgroup of the multiplicative group Z*(pq), if and only if Whiteman's generalized cyclotomic numbers of order 4 depend on the decomposition pq = a(2) + 4b(2) with 4 vertical bar b.", "paper_title": "The Linear Complexity of Whiteman's Generalized Cyclotomic Sequences of Period pmqn", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518600036"}
