We prove an analogue of the result of Klee and Walkup. Namely, we show that if the order of the curvature is less than the dimension d for all polytopes defined by 2d inequalities and for all d, then the order of the curvature is less that the number of inequalities for all polytopes.", "paper_title": "A Continuous d-Step Conjecture for Polytopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000262696300010"}
