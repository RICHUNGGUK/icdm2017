In particular, by reanalyzing the double k-means, that identifies a unique partition for each mode of the data, a relevant extension is discussed which allows to specify more partitions of one mode, conditionally to the partition of the other one. The performance of such generalized double k-means has been tested by both a simulation study and an application to gene microarray data. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
