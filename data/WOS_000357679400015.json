Specialized algorithms are needed to obtain efficient and accurate classifiers for uncertain data streams. In this paper, we first introduce Distributed Extreme Learning Machine (DELM), an optimization of ELM for large matrix operations over large datasets. We then present Weighted Ensemble Classifier Based on Distributed ELM (WE-DELM), an online and one-pass algorithm for efficiently classifying uncertain streaming data with concept drift. A probability world model is built to transform uncertain streaming data into certain streaming data. Base classifiers are learned using DELM. The weights of the base classifiers are updated dynamically according to classification results. WE-DELM improves both the efficiency in learning the model and the accuracy in performing classification. Experimental results show that WE-DELM achieves better performance on different evaluation criteria, including efficiency, accuracy, and speedup.", "paper_title": "Classifying Uncertain and Evolving Data Streams with Distributed Extreme Learning Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000357679400015"}
