In this paper, we propose one queueing model for the evaluation of the denial of service (DoS) attacks in computer networks. The network under DoS attacks is characterized by a two-dimensional embedded Markov chain model. With this model, we can develop a memory-efficient algorithm for finding the stationary probability distribution which can be used to find other interesting performance metrics such as the connection loss probability and buffer occupancy percentages of half-open connections for regular traffic and attack traffic. Different from previous works in the literature, this paper gives a more general analytical approach to the study of security measures of a computer network under DoS attacks. We hope that our approach opens a new avenue to the quantitative evaluation of more complicated security schemes in computer networks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
