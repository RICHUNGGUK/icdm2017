The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) and the Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) were used to identify the chemical structure and functional group of synthesized polymers, respectively. The efficient Forster energy transfer from P30T to MEH-PPV and the dilution of MEH-PPV with P30T leaded to an enhanced red emission. When the concentration of P30T was 30 wt%, the optimal photoluminescence (PL) intensity of MEH-PPV:P30T was obtained, with wavelength at 580 nm. A PL quenching phenomenon was observed owing to the higher blending concentration of P30T. The current density was 0.204 A/cm(2) at 1.3 V for the red polymer light-emitting diode with the structure of Al/MEH-PPV:P3OT/ITO, and the CIE chromaticity coordinates were at x = 0.66 and y 0.34.
