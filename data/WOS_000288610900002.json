The general form of the sub-cell force is obtained by requiring the scheme to satisfy a semi-discrete entropy inequality. Sub-cell force and nodal velocity are computed consistently with cell volume variation by means of a node-centered solver, which results from total energy conservation. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of this scheme.
