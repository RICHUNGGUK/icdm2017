Introduction of new routing algorithms requires a deep and reliable evaluation process. In this paper, we describe an interactive flexible ad hoc simulator (IFAS) that presents a modern and novel approach to the family of ad hoc simulators. This simulator supports unique viewing, debugging, tuning and interactive capabilities that shorten significantly the design and debug process of new algorithms. The development of the WAS is ongoing; however, we consider this new simulator as an innovative toot that will supplement traditional simulators. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
