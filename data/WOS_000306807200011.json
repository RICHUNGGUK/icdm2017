Previous works mainly focus on each single and specific sensor network, thus failing to address issues in the newly emerging scenario. In this paper, we propose COSE, a query-centric framework of collaborative heterogeneous sensor networks, where sensor networks collaborate with each other for effective and efficient processing of queries. Finding an optimal strategy of query processing with respect to energy efficiency is a crucial issue in COSE, which we formulate into an optimization problem, called EE-QPS. We prove the NP-hardness of EE-QPS, and then design a heuristic approach named IAP by utilizing the correlation (called implication in this paper) among different sensor networks. The experimental results demonstrate that in the context of COSE, IAP achieves optimized energy efficiency under various settings.", "paper_title": "COSE: A Query-Centric Framework of Collaborative Heterogeneous Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000306807200011"}
