It is the first algorithm that can build the index while implicitly sorting the sequences in the reverse (complement) lexicographical order without a separate sorting step. The implementation is among the fastest for indexing short reads and the only one that practically works for reads of averaged kilobases in length.", "paper_title": "Fast construction of FM-index for long sequence reads", "paper_id": "WOS:000344774600021"}
