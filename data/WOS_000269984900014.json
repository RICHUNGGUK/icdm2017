The smallest number of colours required for such a colouring is called the conflict-free chromatic number of H, and is denoted by chi(CF)(H). This parameter wits first introduced by Even, Lotker, Ron and Smorodinsky (FOCS 2002) in a geometric setting, in connection with frequency assignment problems for cellular networks. Here we analyse this notion for general hypergraphs. It is shown that chi(CF)(H) <= 1/2 + root 2m + 1/4, for every hypergraph with tit edges, and that this bound is tight. Better bounds of the order of tit 1 It log tit are proved under the assumption that the size of every edge of H is at least 2t - 1, for some t >= 3. Using Lovasz's Local Lemma, the same result holds for hypergraphs in which the size of every edge is at least 2t - 1 and every edge intersects at most tit others. We give efficient polynomial-time algorithms to obtain such colourings. Our machinery can also be applied to the hypergraphs induced by the neighbourhoods of the vertices of a graph. It turns out that in this case we need far fewer colours. For example, it is shown that the vertices of any graph G with maximum degree Delta can be coloured with log(2+is an element of)Delta colours, so that the neighbourhood of every vertex contains a point of 'unique' colour. We give an efficient deterministic algorithm to find such a colouring, based oil a randomized algorithmic version of the Lovasz Local Lemma, suggested by Beck, Molloy and Reed. To achieve this, we need to (1) correct a small error in the Molloy-Reed approach, (2) restate and re-prove their result in a deterministic form.", "paper_title": "Conflict-Free Colourings of Graphs and Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000269984900014"}
