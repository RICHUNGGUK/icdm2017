Reliable broadcasting is essential to ad hoc wireless networks for administrative reasons. However, the task is far from trivial due to the high bit error rate inherent in Wireless environment. Aimed at higher reliability in broadcasting for ad hoc wireless networks, an innovative broadcasting scheme is developed and presented in this article. Featuring mini-slots at the MAC layer and directional antennas for NACK signal forwarding and transmission, the proposed scheme outperforms previous approaches in terms of packet loss recovery time, overhead, and throughput. A series of simulations was conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme, and optimistic results Were obtained as expected.", "paper_title": "Reliable broadcasting in ad hoc wireless networks with mac mini-slots and directional antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000252211200016"}
