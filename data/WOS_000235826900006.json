Two subsequent shelves must be separated by a shelf divisor of size d. The size of a shelf is the total size of its iterns plus the size of the shelf divisor. The SHELF-KNAPSACK Problem (SK) is to find a subset S' subset of S partitioned into shelves with total shelves size at most K and maximum value. The CLASS CONSTRAINED SHELF KNAPSACK (CCSK) is a generalization of the problem SK, where each item in S has a class and each shelf in the solution must have only items of the same class. We present approximation schemes for the SK and the CCSK problems. To our knowledge, these are the first approximation results where shelves of non-null size are used in knapsack problems.
