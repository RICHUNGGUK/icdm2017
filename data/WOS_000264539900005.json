The core of the proposed method consists of two main components: (1) a feature-weighted similarity measurement to search for the best match and (2) a dynamically prioritized-based pixel re-synthesis to reduce discontinuity at the boundary of adjacent patches. Examples and experimental comparisons with other previous methods are demonstrated to verify the usefulness of our proposed method. In addition, we enhance the proposed method with a view warping technique to better synthesize non-frontal-parallel textures (NFPTs) that can not be synthesized well by traditional texture synthesis methods.", "paper_title": "Texture Synthesis with Prioritized Pixel Re-synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000264539900005"}
