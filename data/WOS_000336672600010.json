For such kind of multipliers, alternatively, we use double basis multiplication which combines the polynomial basis and the modified polynomial basis to develop a new efficient digit-serial systolic multiplier. The proposed multiplier depends on trinomials and almost equally space pentanomials (AESPs), and utilizes the subquadratic Toeplitz matrix-vector product scheme to derive a low-latency digit-serial systolic architecture. If the selected digit-size is d bits, the proposed digit-serial multiplier for both polynomials, i.e., trinomials and AESPs, requires the latency of 2[root m/d], while traditional ones take at least O([m/d])clock cycles. Analytical and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) synthesis results indicate that both the area and the time area complexities of our proposed architecture are significantly lower than the existing digit-serial systolic multipliers.", "paper_title": "Low-Latency Digit-Serial Systolic Double Basis Multiplier over GF(2(m)) Using Subquadratic Toeplitz Matrix-Vector Product Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000336672600010"}
