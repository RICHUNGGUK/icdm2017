In this paper a new measure of connectivity is incorporated in the definitions of seven cluster validity indices namely, DB-index, Dunn-index, Generalized Dunn-index, PS-index, I-index, XB-index and SV-index, thereby yielding seven new cluster validity indices which are able to automatically detect clusters of any shape, size or convexity as long as they are well-separated. Here connectivity is measured using a novel approach following the concept of relative neighborhood graph. It is empirically established that incorporation of the property of connectivity significantly improves the capabilities of these indices in identifying the appropriate number of clusters. The well-known clustering techniques, single linkage clustering technique and K-means clustering technique are used as the underlying partitioning algorithms. Results on eight artificially generated and three real-life data sets show that connectivity based Dunn-index performs the best as compared to all the other six indices. Comparisons are made with the original versions of these seven cluster validity indices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
