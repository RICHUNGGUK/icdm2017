The local reduction can present more optimal description for single decision class than the existing relative reductions. It is proven that the core of reduction or relative reduction can be expressed as the union of the cores of local reductions. The discernibility matrix of reduction and relative reduction can be obtained by composing discernibility matrixes of local reduction.", "paper_title": "On the local reduction of information system", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100061"}
