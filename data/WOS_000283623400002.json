Design/methodology/approach - In order to generate data for the parameter estimation, the numerical pulse test was utilized. This test was implemented within the two-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA). From the test data, the parameters of the equivalent circuit model were estimated. The differential evolution algorithm was used to minimize the cost function. Findings - The equivalent circuit model with the estimated values of the parameters matches well with the data generated by the FEA. Thus, the equivalent circuit model with the parameters estimated represents the behavior of the machine accurately. Originality/value - Previously, the numerical pulse test for synchronous machines has not been introduced. The numerical pulse test takes the real operation point of the machine into account. In the test, phenomena like the changing permeability distribution and the eddy-currents in the damper bars (windings) are considered unlike in the standardized standstill frequency response test.", "paper_title": "Numerical pulse test for synchronous machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000283623400002"}
