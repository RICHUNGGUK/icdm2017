Recently, thanks to technological advances, non-intrusive methods based on image processing employed in broader applications, are addressed more than before. One of the promising approaches to gaze estimation is based on projective geometry. In projective geometry-based approaches, an ellipse is fitted to the image of iris boundary and from its parameters, two solutions are obtained, only one of which is valid for the gaze direction. Since the ellipse parameters are not adequate for disambiguation, in a previous work, the accurate coordinates of eye corners in three-dimensional, as complementary information, is obtained through another system increasing the cost and complexity of the overall system. In this article, a new technique to select the valid solution, based on eye geometry and iris image, is developed. In the proposed technique, relative position of the pupil centre with respect to the iris centre is used as the complementary information and a novel algorithm is proposed for its extraction. The performance of the proposed technique was evaluated on 600 real images and with only one failure on selecting the valid solution demonstrated an accuracy of 99.8% for disambiguation.", "paper_title": "Selection of unique gaze direction based on pupil position", "paper_id": "WOS:000321710700003"}
