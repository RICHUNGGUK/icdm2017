The technique relies on getting the Reynolds number from the length scale while keeping the velocity small, this provides a characteristic time scale that is sufficiently large to permit full 3D scanning through the measurement volume in a relatively short time. As the vertical velocity component of these late time stratified flows is effectively zero, all components of the deformation tensor are resolved. 3D, time resolved measurements of the vorticity and enstrophy fields associated with stratified rotating flows such as vortex dipoles, monopoles and wakes are presented.", "paper_title": "Continuous scanning, laser imaging velocimetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000238663100009"}
