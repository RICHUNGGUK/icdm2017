We describe several algorithms for sequential point sampling including a new adaptive algorithm that is specifically designed for mechanical devices and produces grid-like sampling patterns. Experimental results verify that relying on the stochastic model indeed leads to efficient sampling associated with accurate surface reconstruction.", "paper_title": "Adaptive range sampling using a Stochastic model", "paper_id": "WOS:000245061200004"}
