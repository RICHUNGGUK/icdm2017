It introduces RFID tags as certificates for the rights to claim carbon credits in carbon offsetting and trading. It enables buyers, including end-consumers, that buy products with carbon credits to hold and claim these credits unlike existing carbon offsetting schemes. It also supports the simple intuitive trading of carbon credits by trading RFID tags coupled to the credits. The approach was constructed and evaluated with real customers and real carbon credits in a real supply chain. It can also be used to encourage industries and homes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
