The informative vortex features were extracted by using a content-based feature extractor. Shot detection was implemented on the basis of a Maximum-Block-Difference method and global clustering was implemented with semi-Hausdorff distance measure. On the other hand, the frequent patterns in data sequences and the hidden relations among visual features were also discovered by the application of mining techniques. The implementation of this system is believed to benefit both the information scientist in the context of knowledge discovery and at the same time help develop a good data management system for fluid dynamists to better deal with flow data.", "paper_title": "A design of a vortex flow data management and analysis system", "paper_id": "WOS:000246776000008"}
