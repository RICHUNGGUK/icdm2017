Model coefficients are made a function of strain and vorticity invariants through calibration by reference to homogeneous shear flow data. The anisotropic production in near-wall regions is accounted for substantially by modifying the model constants G(1,2) and adding a secondary source term in the e equation. Hence, it reduces the kinetic energy and length scale magnitudes to improve prediction of adverse pressure gradient flows, involving flow separation and reattachment. To facilitate the evaluation of the turbulence model, some extensively used benchmark cases in the turbulence modelling are convoked. The comparisons demonstrate that the new model maintains qualitatively good agreement with the direct numerical simulation (DNS) and experimental data.
