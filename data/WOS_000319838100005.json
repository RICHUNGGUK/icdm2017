Hybrid Automata are a powerful formalism for the modeling and verification of such systems. A common problem in hybrid system verification is the good parameters problem, which consists in identifying a set of parameter valuations which guarantee a certain behavior of a system. Recently, a method has been presented for attacking this problem for Timed Automata. In this paper, we show the extension of this methodology for hybrid automata with linear and affine dynamics. The method is demonstrated with a hybrid system benchmark from the literature.", "paper_title": "PARAMETRIC VERIFICATION AND TEST COVERAGE FOR HYBRID AUTOMATA USING THE INVERSE METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000319838100005"}
