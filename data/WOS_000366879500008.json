Due to their large share of the transistor budget and die area, cache memories suffer from an increasing vulnerability against soft errors. Previous work based on the vulnerability factor (VF) analysis proposed analytical models to evaluate the reliability of on-chip data and instruction caches. However, we have no possession of a system-level study on the vulnerability of instruction caches. In this paper, we propose a new analytical model to estimate the system-level vulnerability factor for on-chip instruction caches in embedded processors. In our model, the error masking/detection effects in instructions based on the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) are studied. Our experimental results show that the self-error-masking/detection in instructions will reduce the VF of the instruction caches compared to the previous study. We also exemplify our design methodology by proposing several optimizing schemes to improve the reliability. Benchmarking is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our vulnerability model and optimization approach, which can provide an insightful guidance for the future reliable instruction cache and ISA design.
