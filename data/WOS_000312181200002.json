It is defined by way of a game similar in spirit to the cops and robber games used to describe treewidth, directed treewidth, and hypertree width. Nevertheless, on many classes of graphs, there are significant differences between entanglement and the various incarnations of treewidth. Entanglement is intimately related with the computational and descriptive complexity of the modal mu-calculus. The number of fixed-point variables needed to describe a finite graph up to bisimulation is captured by its entanglement. This plays a crucial role in the proof that the variable hierarchy of the mu-calculus is strict. We study complexity issues for entanglement and compare it to other structural parameters of directed graphs. One of our main results is that parity games of bounded entanglement can be solved in polynomial time. Specifically, we establish that the complexity of solving a parity game can be parametrised in terms of the minimal entanglement of subgames induced by a winning strategy. Furthermore, we discuss the case of graphs of entanglement two. While graphs of entanglement zero and one are very simple, graphs of entanglement two allow arbitrary nesting of cycles, and they form a sufficiently rich class for modelling relevant classes of structured systems. We provide characterisations of this class, and propose decomposition notions similar to the ones for treewidth, DAG-width, and Kelly-width. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
