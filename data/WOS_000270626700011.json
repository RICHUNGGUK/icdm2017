Energy has become a critical resource in such devices. So. battery energy limitation is the main challenge towards enabling persistent mobile grid computing. In this paper, we address the problem of energy constrained scheduling scheme for the grid environment. There is a limited energy budget for grid applications. The paper investigates both energy minimization for mobile devices and grid utility optimization problem. We formalize energy aware scheduling using nonlinear optimization theory under constraints of energy budget and deadline. The paper also proposes distributed pricing based algorithm that is used to tradeoff energy and deadline to achieve a system wide optimization based on the preference of the grid user. The simulations reveal that the proposed energy constrained scheduling algorithms can obtain better performance than the previous approach that considers both energy consumption and deadline.
