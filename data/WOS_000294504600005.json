We start by presenting events and their classifications, and continue with discussing the problem of capturing events in terms of photographs, videos, etc, as well as the methodologies for event storing and retrieving. Later, we review an extensive set of papers taken from well-known conferences and journals in multiple disciplines. We analyze events, and summarize the procedure of visual event actions. We introduce each component of a visual event computing system, and its computational aspects, we discuss the progress of each component and review its overall status. Finally, we suggest future research trends in event computing and hope to introduce a comprehensive profile of visual event computing to readers.", "paper_title": "A comprehensive study of visual event computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000294504600005"}
