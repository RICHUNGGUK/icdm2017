In order to find the approximate location of the object, AdaBoost learning method is used to automatically find the object by the trained classifier. Some details on AdaBoost are described. Then the nodes aggregation method and the iterative Graph-Cuts method are used to model the automatic segmentation problem. Compared to previous methods based on Graph-Cuts, our method is automatic. This is a main feature of the proposed algorithm. Experiments and comparisons show the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Automatic segmentation based on AdaBoost learning and graph-cuts", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700021"}
