The Octree and grid-based spatial structures have been used to decompose the whole domain into cells and to store information of local conductors. In this letter, the techniques with the distance limit of cell and only searching in cell's neighbor region are proposed to accelerate the construction of the spatial structures. A fast inquiry technique is proposed to fasten the nearest conductor query. We also propose a grid-Octree hybrid structure, which has advantages over existing structures. Experiments on large very large scale integration structures with up to 484 441 conductors have validated the efficiency of the proposed techniques. The improved FRW algorithm is faster than RWCap for thousands times while extracting a single net, and several to tens times while extracting 100 nets.", "paper_title": "Efficient Space Management Techniques for Large-Scale Interconnect Capacitance Extraction With Floating Random Walks", "paper_id": "WOS:000324876500016"}
