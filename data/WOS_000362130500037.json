PCA and its associated quadratic statistics such as T-2 and SPE are integrated under a sole CGN. The proposed framework projects a new observation into an orthogonal space and gives probabilities on the state of the system. It could do so even when some data in the sample test are missing. This paper also gives the probabilities thresholds to use in order to match quadratic statistics decisions. The proposed network is validated and compared to the standard PCA scheme for fault detection on the Tennessee Eastman Process and the Hot Forming Process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
