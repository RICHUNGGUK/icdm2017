In this paper, we derive an upper bound for recognition error arising from the proposed weighted feature fusion to justify theoretically its effectiveness for recognition from videos. In addition, in order to compute the optimal weights of face features to be fused, we develop a novel weight determination solution based on fuzzy membership function and quality measurement for face images. Using four public video databases, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been successfully evaluated under the conditions that are similar to those in real-world video FR applications. Furthermore, our method is simple and straightforward to implement.", "paper_title": "Face Feature Weighted Fusion Based on Fuzzy Membership Degree for Video Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000308995000025"}
