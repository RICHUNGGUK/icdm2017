Generally, the choice of a color space is different for different visual tasks. How can a color space be sought for the specific face recognition problem? To address this problem, we propose a sparse tensor discriminant color space (STDCS) model that represents a color image as a third-order tensor in this paper. The model cannot only keep the underlying spatial structure of color images but also enhance robustness and give intuitionistic or semantic interpretation. STDCS transforms the eigenvalue problem to a series of regression problems. Then one spare color space transformation matrix and two sparse discriminant projection matrices are obtained by applying lasso or elastic net on the regression problems. The experiments on three color face databases, AR, Georgia Tech, and Labeled Faces in the Wild face databases, show that both the performance and the robustness of the proposed method outperform those of the state-of-the-art TDCS model.", "paper_title": "Sparse Tensor Discriminant Color Space for Face Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000306522200003"}
