However, methods that protect their copyright are not very seamless. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of the FVV and propose a novel watermarking scheme for the FVV generated by depth-image-based rendering (DIBR), which is referred to as FVV watermarking (FVW). To preserve the watermark when generating the free viewpoint video frame, we design a new strategy for selecting the optimal blocks to embed the watermark. Two criteria are considered: 1) the blocks that were selected are almost uncovered during the FVV generation and 2) the farther foreground objects are selected because pixels in these kinds of objects are more probably preserved in the FVV. To implement blind detection, we utilize the correlation coefficient method to extract the watermark. The experimental results prove that the proposed watermarking scheme can solve the watermarking problem of the free-viewpoint frame generated by DIBR without affecting the visual quality of the video.", "paper_title": "FREE-VIEWPOINT VIDEO WATERMARKING BASED ON DEPTH MAP", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400029"}
