We classify events into primitive events (PEs) and compound events (CEs), where PEs are the units of CEs, and CEs serve as smooth priors and rules for PEs. We first propose a tensor-based video representation and Joint Matrix Factorization (JMF) for unsupervised primitive event categorization. Then we apply frequent pattern mining techniques to discover compound event pattern structures. After that, we utilize the two kinds of event patterns to address the applications of event recognition and anomaly detection. First we extend the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method to recognition of live, sequential visual events. To accomplish this task we present a scheme that alternatively recognizes primitive and compound events in one framework. Then, we categorize the anomalies into abnormal events (never seen events) and abnormal contexts (rule breakers), and the two kinds of anomalies are detected simultaneously by embedding a deviation criterion into the SMC framework. Extensive experiments have been conducted which demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective as compared to other major approaches.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical visual event pattern mining and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000288556900006"}
