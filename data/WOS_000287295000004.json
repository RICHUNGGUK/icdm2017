Unfortunately, an error was later discovered in their security proof and so far the provable security of the scheme remains unknown. Recently, Fiore, Gennaro and Smart showed a generic way (referred to as the FGS transformation) to transform identity-based key agreement protocols to certificateless key encapsulation mechanisms (CL-KEMs). As a typical example, they showed that the pairing-free CL-KEM underlying Baek et al.'s CLE can be \"generated\" by applying their transformation to the Fiore-Gennaro (FG) identity-based key agreement (IB-KA) protocol. In this paper, we show that directly applying the Fiore-Gennaro-Smart (FGS) transformation to the original FG IB-KA protocol in fact results in an insecure CL-KEM scheme against strong adversaries, we also give a way to fix the problem without adding any computational cost. The reason behind our attack is that the FGS transformation requires the underlying IB-KA protocol to be secure in a model that is stronger than the conventional security models where existing IB-KA protocols are proved secure, and the FG IB-KA protocol is in fact insecure in the new model. This motivates us to construct a new generic transformation from IB-KA protocols to CLE schemes. In the paper we present such a transformation which only requires the underlying IB-KA protocol to be secure in a security model that is weaker than the existing security models for IB-KA protocols. We illustrate our transformation by generating a new pairing-free CLE scheme that is obtained by directly applying our transformation to the original FG IB-KA protocol. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
