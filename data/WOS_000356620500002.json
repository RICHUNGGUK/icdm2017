The objective of the article is to discuss the evaluation of seismic risk of gas networks in compliance with the performance-based earthquake engineering framework adapted to spatially distributed systems. In particular, three issues are addressed: (1) spatial seismic hazard characterization in terms of ground shaking and permanent ground deformation; (2) analysis of system's vulnerability via fragility curves; (3) seismic performance evaluation via computer-aided simulation. As an application, the seismic risk analysis of L'Aquila (central Italy) gas distribution network, a 621-km mid- and low-pressure pipeline system was considered. The analyses were performed with reference to the mid-pressure part of the network, through an object-oriented software, specific for risk assessment of lifelines, developed by the authors. Results in terms of connectivity-based performance indicators are presented and discussed, along with a performance disaggregation analysis carried out to evaluate the contribution of the components of the system to the risk.", "paper_title": "Simulation-Based Seismic Risk Assessment of Gas Distribution Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356620500002"}
