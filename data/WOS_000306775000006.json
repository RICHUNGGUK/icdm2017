First, a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model based on gap values is established to approximate the behavior of the boiler-turbine system, then a specially designed genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the resulting constrained MPC problem. A terminal cost is added into the standard performance index so that a short prediction horizon can be adopted to effectively decrease the on-line computational burden. Moreover, the GA is accelerated by improving the initial population based on the optimal control sequence obtained at the previous sampling period and a local fuzzy linear quadratic (LQ) controller. Simulation results on a boiler-turbine system illustrate that a satisfactory closed-loop performance with offset-free property can be achieved by using the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
