In this paper, we will focus on investigating the effectiveness of this technique for the related speaker verification application. By investigating the speaker verification ability of each stage of the cascade we will demonstrate that the same steps taken to reduce static speaker and environmental information for the visual speech recognition application also provide similar improvements for visual speaker recognition. A further study is conducted comparing synchronous HMM (SHMM) based fusion of CAB visual features and traditional perceptual linear predictive (PLP) acoustic features to show that higher complexity inherit in the SHMM approach does not appear to provide any improvement in the final audio-visual speaker verification system over simpler utterance level score fusion.
