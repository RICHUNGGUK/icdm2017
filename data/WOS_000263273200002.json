Wrapper development for Web sources, however, is a convolution of code with extraction and query planning knowledge and becomes a daunting task. We use IBM DB2 federation engine to demonstrate the challenges of incorporating Web sources into a data federation. Hie, then, present a practical and general strategy for the inclusion and querying of Web sources without requiring any changes in the underlying data federation technology. This strategy separates the code and knowledge in wrapper development by introducing a general-purpose capabilities-aware mini query-planner and a data extraction engine. As a result, Web sources can be included in a data federation system faster and maintained easier [Article copies are available for purchase from InfoSci-on-Demand.com]", "paper_title": "General Strategy for Querying Web Sources in a Data Federation Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000263273200002"}
