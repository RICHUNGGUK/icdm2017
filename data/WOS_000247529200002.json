Support for these applications requires that the network is able to offer quality of service (QoS) appropriate for the latency and jitter bounds of the real-time application constraints. In this paper, we analyze the primary challenges of realizing QoS in mobile wireless networks with heterogeneous devices and propose a QoS framework for real-time traffic support. We address the problem in three ways: estimate the path quality for real-time flows, mitigate the impact of node heterogeneity on service performance, and reduce the impact of interfering non-real-time traffic. Specifically, our proposed QoS framework first utilizes a call setup protocol at the IP layer to discover paths for real-time flows, as well as to perform admission control by accurate service quality prediction. The underlying routing protocol also enables transparent path selection among heterogeneous nodes to provide stable paths for real-time traffic delivery. We then use a prioritized MAC protocol to provide priority access for flows with real-time constraints to reduce interference from unregulated non-real-time traffic. We foresee the utility of our proposed solution in heterogeneous mobile networks, such as campus or community-wide wireless networks. In these environments, resource-rich or fixed wireless routers may be leveraged to achieve better service quality when heterogeneity of node capability and movement is significant. Through experimental results, we demonstrate the utility and efficiency of our approach.", "paper_title": "Real-time traffic support in heterogeneous mobile networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247529200002"}
