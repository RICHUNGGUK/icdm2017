The design of routing protocols in VANETs is important and necessary issue for support the smart ITS. The key difference of VANET and MANET is the special mobility pattern and rapidly changeable topology. It is not effectively applied the existing routing protocols of MANETs into VANETs. In this investigation, we mainly survey new routing results in VANET. We introduce unicast protocol, multicast protocol, geocast protocol, mobicast protocol, and broadcast protocol. It is observed that carry-and-forward is the new and key consideration for designing all routing protocols in VANETs. With the consideration of multi-hop forwarding and carry-and-forward techniques, min-delay and delay-bounded routing protocols for VANETs are discussed in VANETs. Besides, the temporary network fragmentation problem and the broadcast storm problem are further considered for designing routing protocols in VANETs. The temporary network fragmentation problem caused by rapidly changeable topology influence on the performance of data transmissions. The broadcast storm problem seriously affects the successful rate of message delivery in VANETs. The key challenge is to overcome these problems to provide routing protocols with the low communication delay, the low communication overhead, and the low time complexity. The challenges and perspectives of routing protocols for VANETs are finally discussed.", "paper_title": "Routing Protocols in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks: A Survey and Future Perspectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000278399600013"}
