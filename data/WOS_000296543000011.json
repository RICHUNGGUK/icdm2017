Exponentially distributed jobs arrive to a dispatcher, which assigns each task to one of the servers. In the so-called size-aware system, the dispatcher is assumed to know the remaining service requirements of some or all of the existing jobs in each server. The aim is to minimize the mean sojourn time, i.e., the mean response time. To this end, we first analyze an M/M/1-PS queue in the framework of Markov decision processes, and derive the so-called size-aware relative value of state, which sums up the deviation from the average rate at which sojourn times are accumulated in the infinite time horizon. This task turns out to be non-trivial. The exact analysis yields an infinite system of first order differential equations, for which an explicit solution is derived. The relative values are then utilized to develop efficient dispatching policies by means of the first policy iteration (FPI). Numerically, we show that for the exponentially distributed job sizes the myopic approach, ignoring the future arrivals, yields an efficient and robust policy when compared to other heuristics. However, in the case of highly asymmetric service rates, an FPI based policy outperforms it. Additionally, the size-aware relative value of an M/G/1-PS queue is shown to be sensitive with respect to the form of job size distribution, and indeed, the numerical experiments with constant job sizes confirm that the optimal decision depends on the job size distribution.
