The technical contribution of our paper is to introduce \"l(2)(2) spreading metrics\" (that can be computed by semidefinite programming) as relaxations for both undirected and directed \" permutation metrics,\" which are induced by permutations of {1, 2, ... , n}. The techniques introduced in the recent work of Arora, Rao and Vazirani (Proc. of 36th STOC, pp. 222-231, 2004) can be adapted to exploit the geometry of such l(2)(2) spreading metrics, giving a powerful tool for the design of divide-and-conquer algorithms. In addition to their applications to approximation algorithms, the study of such l(2)(2) spreading metrics as relaxations of permutation metrics is interesting in its own right. We show how our results imply that, in a certain sense we make precise, l(2)(2) spreading metrics approximate permutation metrics on n points to a factor of O(root log n log log n).", "paper_title": "l(2)(2) Spreading Metrics for Vertex Ordering Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273587100010"}
