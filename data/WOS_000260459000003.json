However, organizations still cannot assure that collaboration is properly conducted in daily work. This paper presents an approach to stimulating collaboration between professionals in an organization. The approach, combining a BPM methodology with the CollabMM collaboration maturity model and its corresponding method, is a result of an exploratory study in a real setting in an oil company in Brazil. The project is a move towards improving decision-making during one of the company's business processes and establishing collaboration among professionals through information sharing.", "paper_title": "Towards Collaboration Maturity in Business Processes: An Exploratory Study in Oil Production Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000260459000003"}
