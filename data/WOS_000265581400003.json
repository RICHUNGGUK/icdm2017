Based on the T-B cells feedback principle in biological immune responses, the nonlinear immune controller is designed. Concerning the superheated-steam temperature (SHST) control in power plants, we extend numerical solutions to the bounded-input-bounded-output (BIBO) stability based on the small-gain theorem, and Popov theorem, respectively. Also, an analytical numerical solution to the Popov theorem for the SHST immune system is developed avoiding the inconvenience of conventional graphical solutions. Furthermore, simulations for the system performances and the comparison of the stabilization region gained by the small-gain theorem and Popov criteria are extended. The system simulation results are satisfying and prove the conclusion that Popov criterion behaves better than small-gain theorem for this system.", "paper_title": "THE DESIGN OF THE SUPERHEATED-STEAM TEMPERATURE IMMUNE CONTROL SYSTEM AND ITS BIBO STABILITY ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000265581400003"}
