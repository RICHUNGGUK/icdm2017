Prior work. has primarily used linear stability as the criterion for such a design. Global stability has been studied only for single node, single source problems. Here, we obtain conditions for a general topology network accessed by sources with heterogeneous delays. We obtain a sufficient condition for global stability in terms of the increase/decrease parameters of the congestion control algorithm and the price functions used at the links.", "paper_title": "Global stability of Internet congestion controllers with heterogeneous delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000238370100011"}
