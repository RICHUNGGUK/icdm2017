Lossless compression methods have the drawback of a low compression ratio. In contrast, lossy methods have a higher compression ratio and suffer from lower quality of the reconstructed images in the receiver. Recently, some selective compression methods have been proposed in which the main image is divided into two separate regions: Region of Interest (ROI), which should be compressed in a lossless manner, and Region of Background (ROB), which is compressed in a lossy manner with a lower quality. In this research, we introduce a new selective compression method to compress 3D brain MR images. To this aim, we design an adaptive mesh on the first slice and estimate the gray levels of the next slices by computing the mesh element's deformations. After computing the residual image, which is the difference between the main image and the estimated one, we transform it to the wavelet domain using a region-based discrete wavelet transform (RBDWT). Finally, the wavelet coefficients are coded by an object-based SPIHT coder.", "paper_title": "ROI-BASED 3D HUMAN BRAIN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGES COMPRESSION USING ADAPTIVE MESH DESIGN AND REGION-BASED DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194100005"}
