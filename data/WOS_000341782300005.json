First, we calculate the values of exponential sums of cyclotomic classes of orders 3 and 6 over an extension field of GF(3). Then, we give a formula to compute the linear complexity of all p(n+1)-periodic generalized cyclotomic sequences of order 6 over GF(3). After that, we compute the linear complexity and the minimal polynomial of a p(n+1)-periodic, balanced and generalized cyclotomic sequence of order 6 over GF(3), which is analogous to a generalized Sidelnikov's sequence. At last, we give some BCH codes with prime length p from cyclotomic sequences of orders three and six.", "paper_title": "LINEAR COMPLEXITY OF CYCLOTOMIC SEQUENCES OF ORDER SIX AND BCH CODES OVER GF(3)", "paper_id": "WOS:000341782300005"}
