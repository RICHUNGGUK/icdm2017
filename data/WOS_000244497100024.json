It is shown that a BCH code of length n can contain its dual code only if its designed distance delta = O(root n), and the converse is proved in the case of narrow-sense codes. Furthermore, the dimension of narrow-sense BCH codes with small design distance is completely determined, and - consequently - the bounds on their minimum distance are improved. These results make it possible to determine the parameters of quantum BCH codes in terms of their design parameters.", "paper_title": "On quantum and classical BCH codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000244497100024"}
