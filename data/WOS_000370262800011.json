However, optimal micro grid planning is a kind of multi-dimensional and non-linear optimization problem. In this study, a multi-objective model is established by adopting the objective function which minimizes network loss, electricity price and operation cost; an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm with better optimizing performance is proposed by improving the initializing method and parameter control as well as average minimum and mutation factor are introduced. The proposed IPSO algorithm is then applied to a 29-node micro grid network structure. The comparison between different optimization schemes demonstrates the significance of optimal placement of DGs in micro grids. And it is also clear that the IPSO algorithm proposed in this study can effectively solve such problems.", "paper_title": "Optimization of Distributed Generation Integrated into Micro Grids Considering the Correlation of DGs", "paper_id": "WOS:000370262800011"}
