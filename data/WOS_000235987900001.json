In fact, the current model of the classification problem simply concentrates on methods for one-pass classification modeling of very large data sets. Our model for data stream classification views the data stream classification problem from the point of view of a dynamic approach in which simultaneous training and test streams are used for dynamic classification of data sets. This model reflects real-life situations effectively, since it is desirable to classify test streams in real time over an evolving training and test stream. The aim here is to create a classification system in which the training model can adapt quickly to the changes of the underlying data stream. In order to achieve this goal, we propose an on-demand classification process which can dynamically select the appropriate window of past training data to build the classifier. The empirical results indicate that the system maintains a high classification accuracy in an evolving data stream, while providing an efficient solution to the classification task.", "paper_title": "A framework for on-demand classification of evolving data streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000235987900001"}
