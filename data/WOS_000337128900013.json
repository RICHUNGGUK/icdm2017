A new finite-time synchronization control method is proposed with the help of adaptive fuzzy approximation. We develop a new nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) to provide faster convergence and higher precision than the linear hyperplane-sliding mode and the classic terminal-sliding mode (TSM). Then, the adaptive fuzzy-logic system is employed to approximate the system uncertainties, and the corresponding adaptive fuzzy NFTSM controller is designed. By constructing Lyapunov function, the stability and finite-time synchronization performance are proved with the new controller in the presence of system uncertainties and external disturbances. Compared with the traditional teleoperation design method, the new control scheme achieves better transient-state performance and steadystate performance. Finally, the simulations are performed and the comparisons are shown among the proposed method, the P+d method, the PD+d method, the DFF method, and the classic TSM FTSM. The simulation results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Fuzzy Finite-Time Coordination Control for Networked Nonlinear Bilateral Teleoperation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000337128900013"}
