By applying them to all known almost perfect nonlinear (APN) power functions and the inverse function, we can estimate the resistance against algebraic attacks. As a result, we can show that APN functions have different resistance against algebraic attacks, and especially S-boxes with Gold or Kasami exponents have very weak resistance.", "paper_title": "Quadratic equations from APN power functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000234948500004"}
