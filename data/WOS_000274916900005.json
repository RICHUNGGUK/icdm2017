The filters used by JPEG2000 for transformation are the 9/7 Daubechies filter and the 5/3 Le Gall filter. In this paper, we present a method for image mirroring and rotation in the wavelet domain, by manipulating the transformation coefficients. Our technique requires no additional complexity and the perfect reconstruction property is preserved.", "paper_title": "IMAGE MIRRORING AND ROTATION IN THE WAVELET DOMAIN", "paper_id": "WOS:000274916900005"}
