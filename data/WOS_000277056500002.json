In contrast to previous system modeling approaches this approach tries to model the whole system and especially the memory hierarchy in a structural and semantically accessible way. Previous approaches primarily support generation of simulators or retargetable code selectors and thus concentrate on pure behavioral models or describe only the processor instruction set in a semantically accessible way, A simple, database-like, interface is offered to the optimization developer, which in conjunction with the MACCv2 framework enables rapid development of source-level architecture independent optimizations.", "paper_title": "Versatile System-level Memory-aware Platform Description Approach for embedded MPSoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000277056500002"}
