In this paper, we introduce a uniform parallel machine scheduling problem where the objective is to minimize resource consumption given that the maximum completion time does not exceed a certain level. We show that the problem is strongly NP-hard. A tight lower bound and a particle swarm optimization algorithm are then developed. Finally, some computational results are provided.
