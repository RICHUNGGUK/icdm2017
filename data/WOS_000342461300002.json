These questions and their resolution are today part of the mainstream: control structures for chemical plants; design of processes with desired operability, resiliency, and flexibility; design of robust controllers; inferential control. Manfred's impact is, by now, part of an exceptional personal record: groundbreaking papers and books, patented industrial devices and systems, and an influential family of academic off-springs. Here, the author will describe the control theory and practice milieu during Manfred's formative years, and underline certain factors (which unfortunately have weakened considerably in the last 30 years) that defined his successful professional trajectory.
