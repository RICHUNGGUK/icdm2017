This framework allows one to progressively perform different analysis operations to analyze UML statechart diagrams at different levels of model complexity. The analysis operations supported by the framework are based on analyzing Petri net models converted from UML statechart diagrams using a previously proposed transformation approach. After introducing the general framework, the paper emphasizes two simulation-based analysis operations from the framework: direct MSC inspection, which provides a visual representation of system behavior described by statechart diagrams; and a pattern-based trace query technique, which can be used to define and query system properties. Two case-study examples are presented with different emphasis. The gas station example is a simple multi-object system used to demonstrate both the visual and query-based analysis operations. The early warning system example uses only one object, but features composite states and includes analysis specifically aimed at one composite state feature, history states.", "paper_title": "Simulation-based analysis of UML statechart diagrams: methods and case studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000252169800004"}
