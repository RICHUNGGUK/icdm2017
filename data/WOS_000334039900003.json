The path to achieve greater user acceptance and adherence lies in the provision of solutions in their real-life context. Such acceptance is gained through flexibility provided in terms of location, client device, interaction means, and content. This article presents a universal remote rehabilitation delivery approach supporting the introduced flexibility needs. Furthermore, an implementation of the approach in joint rehabilitation for the elderly is described. The approach has been evaluated in a real scenario within Donostia Hospital. The usability evaluation results show the validity of the approach and the acceptance of the developed human -computer interaction paradigm.", "paper_title": "Universal Remote Delivery of Rehabilitation: Validation with Seniors' Joint Rehabilitation Therapy", "paper_id": "WOS:000334039900003"}
