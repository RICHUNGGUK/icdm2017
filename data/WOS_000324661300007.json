Efficient techniques for watching, navigating and sharing videos on mobile devices collaboratively are appealing in mobile environment. In this paper, we propose a novel approach supporting efficiently collaborative operations on videos with sketch gestures. Furthermore, effective collaborative annotation and navigation operations are given to interact with videos on mobile devices for facilitating users' communication based on mobile devices' characteristics. Gesture operation and collaborative interaction architecture are given and improved during the interactive process. Finally, a user study is conducted showing that the effectivity and collaborative accessibility of video exploration is improved.", "paper_title": "Collaborative Interaction for Videos on Mobile Devices Based on Sketch Gestures", "paper_id": "WOS:000324661300007"}
