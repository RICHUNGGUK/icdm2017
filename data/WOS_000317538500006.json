In this paper, we introduce a content-based video matching system that finds the most relevant video segments from video database for a given query video clip. Finding relevant video clips is not a trivial task, because objects in a video clip can constantly move over time. To perform this task efficiently, we propose a novel video matching called Spatio-Temporal Pyramid Matching (STPM). Considering features of objects in 2D space and time, STPM recursively divides a video clip into a 3D spatio-temporal pyramidal space and compares the features in different resolutions. In order to improve the retrieval performance, we consider both static and dynamic features of objects. We also provide a sufficient condition in which the matching can get the additional benefit from temporal information. The experimental results show that our STPM performs better than the other video matching methods. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
