We argue that genuine language understanding in machines will similarly require an imagistic modeling capacity enabling fast construction of instances of prototypical physical situations and events, whose participants are drawn from a wide variety of entity types, including animate agents. By allowing fast evaluation of predicates such as 'can-see', 'under', and 'inside', these model instances support coherent text interpretation. Imagistic modeling is thus a crucial - and not very broadly appreciated - aspect of the long-standing knowledge acquisition bottleneck in Al. We will illustrate how the need for imagistic modeling arises even in the simplest first-reader stories for children, and provide an initial feasibility study to indicate what the architecture of a system combining symbolic with imagistic understanding might look like.
