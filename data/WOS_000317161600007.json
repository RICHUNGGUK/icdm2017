The nature of the control problem with multiple objectives that have to be optimized as well as the uncertain parameters of the plant call for an H-infinity-controller. By changing weighting filters different controllers can be designed, emphasizing either comfort or handling. Using the high bandwidth of the actuator comfort can be improved by 40% over the passive BMW whilst keeping suspension travel within the same limits. Using a different controller, handling can be improved up to 30%, limited by RMS actuator force. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
