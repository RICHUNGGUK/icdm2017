Some techniques, such as calculus of variations, commutating operators and prior estimates, are adopted. It is proved that the UFVE scheme is unconditionally stable and satisfies maximum principle. Optimal-order estimates in H-1-norm are derived to determine the error in the approximate solution. Numerical results are presented to observe the performance of the scheme.
