We show how a priority structure implicit in a trust relation can be made fully explicit by means of a lattice and how a system of default expectations arises from a systematic interpretation. The default structure lends itself to formal interpretation, but is independent of a particular logical language. The theory is designed to directly extend the analysis of the concept of trust given by Andrew Jones.", "paper_title": "Relative trustworthiness", "paper_id": "WOS:000236940300012"}
