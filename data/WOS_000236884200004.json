To illustrate how the architecture implements communication, examples of client-server and point-to-point communication are given. An interconnection architecture of a Mobile Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (MCSCL) environment is analyzed in detail. Its communication protocols are showed with sequence diagrams, The paper concludes with an evaluation of the architecture's performance.", "paper_title": "An ad-hoc wireless network architecture for face-to-face mobile collaborative applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884200004"}
