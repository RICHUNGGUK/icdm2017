An innovative easy-implemented cross-coupled full differential multiple gated transistor topology is proposed to improve the linearity while maintaining the high conversion gain. In addition, a topology, which artfully combines the current-bleeding technology and the noise-cancelling technology, is introduced to reduce the noise figure. The prototype of the proposed circuit was fabricated in SMIC 0.18 mu m CMOS process with a chip area of 0.32 x 0.24 mm(2). The measurement results have exhibited an IIP3 of 10.2 dBm and a conversion gain of 17.8 dB with a power dissipation of 3.6 mW from 1.8 V supply. Compared to recently published studies, the proposed work has achieved a higher FoM.", "paper_title": "Design of a novel CMOS Gilbert mixer with high performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000350233900018"}
