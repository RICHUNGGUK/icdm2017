A calculation scheme has been presented dealing with Additive White Gaussian Noise and different fading effects influencing the analyzed M-ary QAM or PSK signals. Furthermore, the authors have considered the effects of multiple interference signals embedded into a stochastic model having numerous parameters, which can be assumed as random variables with adjustable distributions. The resulted M-QAM and M-PSK SER expressions have been extended for multi-carrier transmission based on the analytical calculation of the stochastic interference model.", "paper_title": "General interference analysis of M-QAM and M-PSK wireless communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000316011000005"}
