To demonstrate large deformation and fracture, we used the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method for fluid analysis. We performed ALE-based finite element analysis for 3% agar gel and three types of copper needle with bevel tips. Methods: To evaluate simulation results, we compared the needle deflection and insertion force with corresponding experimental results acquired with a uniaxial manipulator. We studied the shear stress distribution of agar gel on various time scales. Results: For 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees, differences in deflections of each needle between both sets of results were 2.424, 2.981, and 3.737 mm, respectively. For the insertion force, there was no significant difference for mismatching area error (p < 0.05) between simulation and experimental results. Conclusions: Our results have the potential to be a stepping stone to develop pre-operative surgical planning to estimate an optimal needle insertion path for MR image-guided microwave coagulation therapy and for analyzing large deformation and fracture in biological tissues.
