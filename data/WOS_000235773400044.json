A study has been carried out in the case of cut images, where tree cases of specialization are considered. Classifiers based on neighbourhood criteria are used, the zoning global feature and the Euclidean distance too. Furthermore, the paper explains a modification of the Euclidean distance for classifying cut digits. The experiments have been carried out with images of typewritten digits, taken from real forms, Trying to obtain a strong database to support the experiments, we have cut images deliberately. The recognition rate improves from 84.6% to 97.70%, but whether the system provides information about the disturbance of the image, it can achieve a 98.45%.", "paper_title": "Cut digits classification with k-NN multi-specialist", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773400044"}
