Theoretical considerations will not be avoided. Similarities and differences with tools from the field of Model Driven Architecture, such as UML, will be demonstrated. How to deal with Mokum in a situation with many sites, as in real Cyberspace is demonstrated as a second theme. Special attention is given to a protocol: MAP, which guarantees that a certain access constraint is being maintained. The constraint being that for an object in one site to obtain access to an attribute of an object in another, a third site must give permission. The technique is based on a new notion: the Triple,(2) to be used in a Knowledge based Engineering environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
