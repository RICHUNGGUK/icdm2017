Its main thrust is the introduction of the \"Chicago\" law in a continuum approach to account for the ratcheting effects. It also emphasizes rate-dependency as a dissipative mechanism that acts independently or jointly with the ratcheting effect as well as the non-associated plasticity. The numerical procedure is based on the return mapping algorithm, where Newton's method is used to calculate the nonlinear consistency parameter of the flow rule and to obtain a consistent tangent modulus. The model was applied to specific numerical examples including multi-axial and cyclic loading conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
