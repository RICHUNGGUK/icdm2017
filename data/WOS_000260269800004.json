The intelligent agent was first introduced into a micro-traffic flow system. Individual differences in driver behavior were considered, and the theory of probability was applied to reflect the distribution of drivers' stochastic characteristic dispositions. Each vehicle expressed its intelligence through its own character by perceiving the leading vehicle. From an operational perspective, differences in drivers' dispositions were reflected by a weighted coefficient. Finally,a hybrid microcosmic mobile emissions model was proposed. Its coefficients were determined using traffic data and experiments. Because it addresses more aspects of the car-following process, this model is theoretically superior to previous models, as verified by a numerical simulation. The proposed model was applied to a case study of the emissions from ten vehicles in an urban setting. The model effectively estimated mobile emissions rates. The results indicate that the model can reflect individual differences among drivers and demonstrate that reckless drivers generate more emissions.", "paper_title": "AN INTELLIGENT AGENT MOBILE EMISSIONS MODEL FOR URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000260269800004"}
