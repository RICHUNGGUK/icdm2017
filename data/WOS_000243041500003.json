RSE watermarks an electronic document by modulating the display sequences of words or characters. It features large information-carrying capacity and robustness over document format transcoding. The RSE authentication method is based on the NP-complete Exact Traveling Salesman Problem, which provides a rigorous foundation for security. The RSE authentication method is secure in the sense it is extremely difficult to forge the authentication process. RSE authentication process is also easy to operate, especially in comparison to digital signatures which requires Public Key Infrastructure for its operation.", "paper_title": "Render sequence encoding for document protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000243041500003"}
