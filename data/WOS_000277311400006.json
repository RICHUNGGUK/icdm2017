It is also proposed that proper governance mechanisms are necessary for firms to really benefit from their inter-firm coordination. However, the roles of governance mechanisms in inter-firm relationships have not been fully integrated into the studies about the impacts of interdependence on IOS use for better inter-firm coordination. To fill this gap, this study developed a conceptual model and using survey data, it empirically tested the roles of governance mechanisms in mediating the impacts of interdependence on IOS use. The model test shows that various governance mechanisms indeed play important roles. Limitations of this study and future research are also discussed at the end.", "paper_title": "EXPLORING THE IMPACTS OF INTERDEPENDENT RELATIONSHIPS ON IOS USE: THE ROLES OF GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277311400006"}
