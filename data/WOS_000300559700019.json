Lattice vector quantization provides lower computation for efficient data compression. In this paper, a new MD coinciding lattice vector quantizer (MDCLVQ) is presented. The design of the quantizer is based on coinciding 2-D hexagonal sublattices. The coinciding sublattices are geometrically similar sublattices, with the same index but generated by different generator matrices. A novel labeling algorithm based on the hexagonal coinciding sublattices is also developed. Performance results of the MDCLVQ scheme, together with the new labeling algorithm applied to standard test images, show improvements of the central and side decoders, as compared with the renowned techniques for several test images.", "paper_title": "Multiple Descriptions Coinciding Lattice Vector Quantizer for Wavelet Image Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000300559700019"}
