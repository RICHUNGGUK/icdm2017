Therefore, design optimization of these products becomes essential in order to meet safety criteria. In this research, a hybrid design optimization method is proposed where attention is focused on structures having repeating patterns in their geometries. In the proposed method, the analysis is decomposed but the optimization problem itself is treated as a whole. The model of an entire structure is obtained without modeling all the repetitive components using the merits of the Component Mode Synthesis method. Backpropagation Neural Networks are used for surrogate modeling. The optimization is performed using two techniques: Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). GAs are utilized to increase the chance of finding the location of the global optimum and since this optimum may not be exact, SQP is employed afterwards to improve the solution. A theoretical test problem is used to demonstrate the method.", "paper_title": "An optimization method for dynamics of structures with repetitive component patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000271308300003"}
