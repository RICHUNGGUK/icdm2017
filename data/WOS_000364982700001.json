The main contribution of the proposed method lies in the detection and adjustment of incorrect disparities. In the detection process, we detect certain regions in initial disparity maps to distinguish errors in disparity caused by the disparity discontinuity. In the adjustment process, we adjust the disparity map to reduce the adverse effect of errors in disparity using the certain region detection results. Based on the color similarity, spatial distance, and the reliability of the certain and uncertain regions, we set an adaptive support-weight to each pixel for adjusting the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces high-quality disparity maps by successfully preserving disparity discontinuities along the object boundaries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
