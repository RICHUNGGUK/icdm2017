The balance of the flux and the source terms makes the shallow water equations fit to non-flat bottom questions. The simulation of a tidal bore oil an estuary with trumpet shape and Qiantang river is performed; the results show that the schemes can be used to simulate the current flow accurately and catch the stronger discontinuous in water wave, Such as darn break and tidal bore effectively.
