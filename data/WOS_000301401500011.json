Route optimization is one of the most important topics in the field of NEMO. The current NEMO basic support protocol defines only the basic working mode for NEMO, and the route optimization problem is not mentioned. Some optimization schemes have been proposed in recent years, but they have limitations. A new NEMO route optimization scheme-involving a combination of the optimized route cache protocol (ORC) and reverse routing header (RRH) and the use of a quota mechanism for optimized sessions (OwR-)is proposed. This scheme focuses on balanced performance in different aspects. It combines the ORC and RRH schemes, and some improvements are made in the session selection mechanism to avoid blindness during route optimization. Simulation results for OwR show great similarity with those for ORC and RRH. Generally speaking, the OwR's performance is at least as good as that of the RRH, and besides, the OwR scheme is capable of setting up optimal routing for a certain number of sessions, so the performance can be improved and the cost of optimal routing in nested NEMO can be decreased.", "paper_title": "A New Route Optimization Scheme for Network Mobility: Combining ORC Protocol with RRH and Using Quota Mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000301401500011"}
