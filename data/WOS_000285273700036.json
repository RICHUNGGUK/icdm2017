In general, data-hiding schemes embed secret data into the cover medium and generate a single embedded medium. Once the single embedded medium has been captured, the hidden secret data may no longer be secure. Therefore, we use the proposed method to embed secret data into multi-embedded media to address this drawback. The experimental results show that our method outperforms other reversible data-hiding methods in terms of payload versus distortion.", "paper_title": "A DIGITAL IMAGE AND SECRET MESSAGES SHARING SCHEME USING TWO STEGO IMAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000285273700036"}
