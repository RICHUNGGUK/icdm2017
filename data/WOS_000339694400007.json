Two texture features of adaptive motifs co-occurrence matrix (AMCOM) and gradient histogram for adaptive motifs (GHAM) and color feature of an adaptive color histogram for K-means (ACH) were used in this paper. In this paper, the feature selections have adopted sequential forward selection (SFS), sequential backward selection (SBS), and genetic algorithms feature selection (GAFS). Image retrieval and classification performance mainly build from three features: ACH, AMCOM and GHAM, where the classification system is used for two-class SVM classification. In the experimental results, we can find that all the methods regarding feature extraction mentioned in this study can contribute to better results with regard to image retrieval and image classification. The GAFS can provide a more robust solution at the expense of increased computational effort. By applying GAFS to image retrieval systems, not only could the number of features be effectively reduced, but higher image retrieval accuracy is elicited. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
