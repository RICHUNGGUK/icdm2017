This class of compounds has recently been reported as androgen receptor (AR)-coactivator disruptors for potential application in prostate cancer therapy. Definition of the E/Z isomerism around the imine linker group (hydrazide) is significant from a mechanistic point of view. A detailed study using theoretical calculations coupled with experimental techniques has allowed us determine an initial preference for the E isomer. The biological activity of newly synthesized compounds at the androgen receptor, along with a series of structural analogs, was determined and provides the basis for preliminary qualitative structure-activity relationship analysis.", "paper_title": "Study of E/Z Isomerization in a Series of Novel Non-ligand Binding Pocket Androgen Receptor Antagonists", "paper_id": "WOS:000308958400007"}
