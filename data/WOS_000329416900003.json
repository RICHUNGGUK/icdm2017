Specifically, three novel non-minimal NoC routing algorithms are proposed based on the Odd-Even, West-First, and Negative-First turn models, respectively. These algorithms are not only deadlock free and livelock free, but can also leverage non-minimal routing paths to avoid traffic congestion and improve fault tolerance. Moreover, these algorithms are backward compatible with existing minimal routing schemes. As a result, they represent an ideal routing solution to NoC-based interconnections designed for both existing and emerging embedded multicore systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
