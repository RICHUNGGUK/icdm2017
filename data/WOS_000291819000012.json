This paper provides a semantic definition of the knowledge used by environmental management information systems. We describe an ontological model in UML class diagrams and present a formalization of the ontology in first-oder logic and encoded in description logic. A model transformation approach is also used to map the UML class diagram elements into web ontology language. A running example is presented to explain the ontological knowledge modeling of EMIS SOLERES cartography and satellite information.", "paper_title": "Open-Environmental Ontology Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000291819000012"}
