However, an adversary may expose confidential information by tracking an individual across disparate data publications using quasi-identifying attributes (e.g., age, geocode and sex) associated with the records. Various studies have shown that well-established privacy protection models (e.g., k-anonymity and its extensions) fail to protect an individual's privacy against this \"composition attack\". This type of attack can be thwarted when organizations coordinate prior to data publication, but such a practice is not always feasible. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model called (d, alpha)-linkable, which mitigates composition attack without coordination. The model ensures that d confidential values are associated with a quasi-identifying group with a likelihood of alpha. We realize this model through an efficient extension to k-anonymization and use extensive experiments to show our strategy significantly reduces the likelihood of a successful composition attack and can preserve more utility than alternative privacy models, such as differential privacy.
