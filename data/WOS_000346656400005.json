This paper focuses on the class of inherently stationary, dual non-interpolatory Hermite subdivision schemes that can be obtained from known Hermite interpolatory ones, by applying a generalization of the de Rham corner cutting strategy. Exploiting specific tools for the analysis of inherently stationary Hermite subdivision schemes we show that, giving up the interpolation condition, the smoothness of the associated basic limit function can be increased by one, while its support width is only enlarged by one. To accomplish the analysis of de Rham-type Hermite subdivision schemes two new theoretical results are derived and the new notion of -convergence is introduced. It allows the construction of Hermite-type subdivision schemes of order with the first element of the vector valued limit function having regularity .", "paper_title": "Dual Hermite subdivision schemes of de Rham-type", "paper_id": "WOS:000346656400005"}
