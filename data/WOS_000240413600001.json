From this point of view we will present an effective, three-dimensional constitutive model for SFRC, that is also easy to implement in commercial finite element programs. Additionally, the finite element analysis should only require standard material parameters which can be gained easily from conventional experiments or which are specified in appropriate building codes. Another important point is attaining the material parameters from experimental data. The procedures to determine the material parameters proposed in appropriate codes seem to be only approximations and are unsuitable for precise structural analysis. Therefore a finite element analysis of the test itself is used to get the material parameters. This process is also denoted as inverse analysis. The efficiency of the proposed constitutive model is demonstrated on the basis of numerical examples and their comparison to experimental results. In the framework of material parameter identification the idea of a new, indirect tension testing procedure, the \"Modified Tension Test\", is adopted and extended to an easy-to-carry-out tension test for steel fiber reinforced concrete specimens.", "paper_title": "Material modeling of steel fiber reinforced concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000240413600001"}
