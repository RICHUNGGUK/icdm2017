First, during expert knowledge acquisition processes, the domain expert panel often demonstrates different experience and knowledge from one another and produces different types of knowledge information such as complete and incomplete, precise and imprecise, and known and unknown because of its cross-functional and multidisciplinary nature. Second, as a promising tool for knowledge representation and reasoning, fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) still suffer a couple of deficiencies. The parameters in current FPN models could not accurately represent the increasingly complex knowledge-based systems, and the rules in most existing knowledge inference frameworks could not be dynamically adjustable according to propositions' variation as human cognition and thinking. In this paper, we present a knowledge acquisition and representation approach using the fuzzy evidential reasoning approach and dynamic adaptive FPNs to solve the problems mentioned above. As is illustrated by the numerical example, the proposed approach can well capture experts' diversity experience, enhance the knowledge representation power, and reason the rule-based knowledge more intelligently.", "paper_title": "Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Using Fuzzy Evidential Reasoning and Dynamic Adaptive Fuzzy Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000319010000021"}
