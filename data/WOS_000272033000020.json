By employing the internal model approach, we show that this problem boils down to a global robust stabilization problem of a time-varying nonlinear system in lower triangular form, the solution of which will lead to the solution of the global robust output regulation problem. An example shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Output regulation for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with nonlinear exosystems and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000272033000020"}
