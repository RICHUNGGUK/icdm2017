In this work, a Bond Graph model is utilised as boundary condition for a detailed model of an idealized mitral valve. Applications of this type fit within the framework described by the \"Virtual Physiological Human\" initiative. This supports the integration of physical, mechanical and biochemical models encompassing a range of different length and time scales to obtain predictive models of the human body. Because 3D detailed modelling and simulation is computationally intensive, a 3D computational model of a whole biological system is, by today's standards, impossible to achieve. Due to their unique multi-physics nature of internal coherence, Bond Graphs are particularly suited to biological applications and can be coupled to 3D models and lumped parameter models. A specific application in cardiovascular modelling is demonstrated by focusing on a specific example; a 3D model of the mitral valve coupled to a lumped parameter model of the left ventricle.
