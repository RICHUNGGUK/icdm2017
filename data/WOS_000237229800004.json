The model is based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (BANS) equations with variable fluid density. The equations are solved in a transformed a-coordinate system with the use of operator-splitting method (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids 2002; 38:1045-1068). The numerical model is validated against the one-dimensional diffusion problem and the two-dimensional density-gradient flow. Excellent agreements are obtained between numerical results and analytical solutions. The model is then used to study transport phenomena of dumped sediments into a water body, which has been modelled as a strongly stratified flow. For the two-dimensional problem, the numerical results compare well with experimental data in terms of mean particle falling velocity and spreading rate of the sediment cloud for both coarse and medium-size sediments. The model is also employed to study the dumping of sediments in a three-dimensional environment with the presence of free surface. It is found that during the descending process an annulus-like cloud is formed for fine sediments whereas a plate-like cloud for medium-size sediments. The model is proven to be a good tool to simulate strongly stratified free surface flows.
