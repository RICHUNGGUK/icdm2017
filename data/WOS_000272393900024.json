Many scheduling algorithms are based on the assumption of error-free connections, which is not suitable for wireless networks. Therefore, a scheduling algorithm based on the modification of Static Priority (SP) algorithm and Earliest-Due-Date (EDD) algorithm is proposed for wireless multimedia networks with link adaptation in this paper. In the proposed algorithm, various quality of service requirements, such as delay, throughput, and packet loss ratio, are considered. Particularly, the influence of error tolerance of voice communications, which is usually ignored in most scheduling algorithms, is taken into account. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm, compared with SP, EDD, and other scheduling algorithms, succeeds in meeting the delay and packet loss ratio (PLR) requirements at much heavier traffic load.", "paper_title": "A Modified Priority Scheduling Algorithm with Link Adaptation for Wireless Multimedia Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000272393900024"}
