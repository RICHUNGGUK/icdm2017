This system provides a resource management layer, built on the top of Java/RMI, that supports the execution of the data mining tool called Weka. We evaluate the performance of Inhambu by means of several experiments in homogeneous, heterogeneous and non-dedicated clusters. The obtained results are compared with those achieved by a similar system named Weka-Parallel. Inhambu outperforms its counterpart for coarse grain applications, mainly for heterogeneous and non-dedicated clusters. Also, our system provides additional advantages such as application checkpointing, support for dynamic aggregation of hosts to the cluster, automatic restarting of failed tasks, and a more effective usage of the cluster. Therefore, Inhambu is a promising tool for efficiently executing real-world data mining applications.
