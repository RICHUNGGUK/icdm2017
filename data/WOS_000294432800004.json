In the sparse regime, i.e., when np(n) -> lambda > 1, we find refined asymptotics both for the minimal weight of the path between uniformly chosen vertices in the giant component, as well as for the hopcount (i.e., the number of edges) on this minimal weight path. More precisely, we prove a central limit theorem for the hopcount, with asymptotic mean and variance both equal to (lambda log n)/(lambda - 1). Furthermore, we prove that the minimal weight centred by (log n)/(lambda - 1) converges in distribution. We also investigate the dense regime, where np(n) -> infinity. We find that although the base graph is ultra-small (meaning that graph distances between uniformly chosen vertices are o(log n)), attaching random edge weights changes the geometry of the network completely. Indeed, the hopcount H(n) satisfies the universality property that whatever the value of p(n), H(n)/log n -> 1 in probability and, more precisely, (H(n) -beta(n) log n)/root log n, where beta(n) = lambda(n)/(lambda(n) -1), has a limiting standard normal distribution. The constant beta(n) can be replaced by 1 precisely when lambda(n) >> root log n, a case that has appeared in the literature (under stronger conditions on lambda(n)) in [4, 13]. We also find lower bounds for the maximum, over all pairs of vertices, of the optimal weight and hopcount. This paper continues the investigation of FPP initiated in [4] and [5]. Compared to the setting on the configuration model studied in [5], the proofs presented here are much simpler due to a direct relation between FPP on the Erdos-Renyi random graph and thinned continuous-time branching processes.", "paper_title": "First Passage Percolation on the Erdos-Renyi Random Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000294432800004"}
