The goal of actuator task assignment is to select the best actuator for responding to a reported event so that communication cost for selecting, and response time for performing the task are minimized. Existing solutions, except those proposed in [3] for robot networks, are usually either centralized, neglecting communication cost, assuming complete graph, or based on flooding with individual responses to actuator decision maker (simple auction protocol - SAP), ignoring communication cost and response time bound. This article proposes greedy improvement to previously proposed (in [3]) k-hop simple auction protocol (k-SAP) and k-hop simple auction aggregation protocol (k-SAAP) for task assignment in multi-hop wireless actuator networks. After decision about the best actuator is made by k-SAP or k-SAAP, new 1-SAP greedy auction is initiated by that actuator in order to search for possibly better actuator in 1-hop neighborhood. Such greedy approach proceeds until no better actuator is found. Improvement of new k-SAPG and k-SAAPG over k-SAP and k-SAAP by applying greedy approach is shown by simulation results.", "paper_title": "Greedy Extension of Localized Auction Based Protocols for Wireless Actuator Task Assignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000312286000004"}
