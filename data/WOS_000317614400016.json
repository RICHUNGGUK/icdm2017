A common premise of previous research is that the QoS values of services to target users are supposed to be all known. However, many of QoS values are unknown in reality. This paper presents a neighborhood-based collaborative filtering approach to predict such unknown values for QoS-based selection. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has three new features: 1) the adjusted-cosine-based similarity calculation to remove the impact of different QoS scale; 2) a data smoothing process to improve prediction accuracy; and 3) a similarity fusion approach to handle the data sparsity problem. In addition, a two-phase neighbor selection strategy is proposed to improve its scalability. An extensive performance study based on a public data set demonstrates its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Predicting Quality of Service for Selection by Neighborhood-Based Collaborative Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000317614400016"}
