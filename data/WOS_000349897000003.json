Classical volume-of-fluid PLIC technique uses one line segment and one given normal to separate two materials. Unfortunately, these paradigms are not sufficient when filaments occur, leading to the creation of flotsam and jetsam. We propose to detect such situations and to split the computational mixed cell into reconstruction subzones. Within these subzones, one computes a so-called subgradient using an incomplete stencil of neighbors, and the material is distributed in these subzones. Given subzone volume fraction and the subgradient, one computes one line segment using classical PLIC method, leading to a modified PLIC method for subscale material entity. The subdivision procedure relies on a splitting point, which is chosen as a specific information about the relative location of the filament in the cell, leading to an adaptive subdivision for PLIC reconstructions. Numerical tests are carried out in a 2D Lagrange + Remap multimaterial hydrodynamics Eulerian code. Static and dynamic filaments and fragments are simulated in advection or stretched in vortex-like motion. The full hydrodynamics equations are solved on a more realistic test (shock-bubble impact). Results show that our approach supplements classical PLIC method for situations when filaments and fragments occur.
