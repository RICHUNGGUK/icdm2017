These examples illustrate non-trivial interactions, e.g. sliding, that can not be easily addressed by previous methods. All constraint formulations we propose are compatible with linear and displacement-based integration schemes. For an optimal integration numerical process, we discuss efficient reordering of the constraint and motion equations. This provides linear-time and robust simulation of complex structures.
