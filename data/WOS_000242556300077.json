It is used to forecast and control an environmental process. This inclusion of the first principles knowledge in this hybrid model is shown to improve substantially the stability of the model predictions in spite of the unmeasurability of some of the key parameters. Proposed hybrid model is compared with both a hybrid neural network(HNN) as well as hybrid neural network with extended kalman filter (HNN-EKF). From experimental results, proposed hybrid model shown to be far superior when used for extrapolation compared to HNN and HNN-EKF.", "paper_title": "A novel hybrid system for dynamic control", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300077"}
