We speculate that, given a denoising method, we may obtain better results by applying it to the curvature image and then reconstructing from it a clean image, rather than denoising the original image directly. Numerical experiments confirm this for several PDE-based and patch-based denoising algorithms.", "paper_title": "Denoising an Image by Denoising Its Curvature Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000333762900007"}
