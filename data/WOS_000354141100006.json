The method has already been used successfully at previous and current collider experiments. However, the computational complexity of this method for final states with many particles and degrees of freedom sets it at a disadvantage compared to supervised classification methods such as decision trees, k nearest-neighbor, or neural networks. This note presents a concrete implementation of the matrix element technique using graphics processing units. Due to the intrinsic parallelizability of multidimensional integration, dramatic speedups can be readily achieved, which makes the matrix element technique viable for general usage at collider experiments.
