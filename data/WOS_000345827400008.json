While this is true for random sampling, it is not true with separate sampling, where the populations are independently sampled, which is a common situation in bioinformatics. Results: We demonstrate, via analytical and numerical methods, that classical cross-validation can have strong bias under separate sampling, depending on the difference between the sampling ratios and the true population probabilities. We propose a new separate-sampling cross-validation error estimator, and prove that it satisfies an 'almost unbiased' theorem similar to that of random-sampling cross-validation. We present two case studies with previously published data, which show that the results can change drastically if the correct form of cross-validation is used.", "paper_title": "Cross-validation under separate sampling: strong bias and how to correct it", "paper_id": "WOS:000345827400008"}
