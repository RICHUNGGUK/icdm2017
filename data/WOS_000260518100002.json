Hybrid variable is a tool to describe this phenomena. Fuzzy random variable and random fuzzy variable are instances of hybrid variable. In order to measure hybrid event, a concept of chance measure is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, several useful properties about this measure are proved such as self-duality, subadditivity and semicontinuity. Some concepts are also presented such as chance distribution, expected value, variance, moments, critical values, entropy, distance and sequence convergences.", "paper_title": "Chance measure for hybrid events with fuzziness and randomness", "paper_id": "WOS:000260518100002"}
