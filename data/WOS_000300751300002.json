The conventional approaches to decreasing WMSDs in assembly workers usually focus on individual assembly work at the station level. These approaches, however, do not pay enough attention to work allocation at the whole assembly line level such as balancing ergonomic burdens among workers by proper work assignment. This paper presents a methodology that can be used to integrate ergonomic measures of upper extremities into assembly line design problems. Linear models are developed to link work-worker assignment to the upper extremity ergonomic measures based on a guideline from American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. These linear models allow ergonomic and productivity measures to be integrated as a mixed-integer programming model. The case studies of this paper show the new model can effectively balance and control exposure levels in the upper extremity while not significantly decreasing line efficiency. This research shows the potential to reduce the need of numerous task adjustments for ergonomic improvement after initial assembly line design in conventional trial-and-error based assembly task adjustment. Furthermore, these linearization methods can be generalized in order to incorporate other ergonomic measures in tabulated forms into assembly line design problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
