In this paper, boundary model and local feature structure are used to realize tissue segmentation, and a new efficient algorithm is presented to solve path planning. As to real-time processing, a frame in virtual endoscopy is divided into near viewpoint part and far viewpoint part based on volume data characteristics in our method. In the aspect of scene rendering, a ray casting algorithm based on the boundary voxel is proposed. Thus the voyage images can be rendered in real time with high quality in virtual endoscopy system by using these techniques. The experiments show that application results of our algorithm in tissue segmentation, path planning, scene rendering are better than other algorithms.
