The results show that: (1) the addition of olefin into HMX can reduce greatly the shear sliding barriers relative to the pure HMX in the two cases, suggesting that the desensitizing mechanism of olefin is controlled dominantly by its good lubricating property; (2) the change of interaction energy in both systoles of shear slide is strongly dominated by van der Waals interaction; and (3) the thickness of olefin layers in the mixed explosives can influence its desensitizing efficiency. That is, the excessive thinness of olefin layers in the mixed explosive systems, for example, several angstroms, can lead to very high sliding barriers.", "paper_title": "Understanding the desensitizing mechanism of olefin in explosives: shear slide of mixed HMX-olefin systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000303540700024"}
