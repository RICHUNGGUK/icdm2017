The JH hash function is one of the five SHA-3 candidates accepted for the final round of evaluation. The JH hash function uses a mode of operation based on a permutation, while its security has been elusive even in the random permutation model. One can find a collision for the JH compression function only with two backward queries to the basing primitive. However, the security is significantly enhanced in iteration. For c <= n/2, we prove that the JH hash function using an ideal n-bit permutation and producing c-bit outputs by truncation is collision resistant up to O(2(c/2)) queries. This bound implies the optimal collision resistance of the JH hash function in the random permutation model.", "paper_title": "Collision Resistance of the JH Hash Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000300845900046"}
