The technique is based on mutual information maximization, a widely known criterion for multimodal image registration, and employs an efficient multiresolution strategy in order to achieve robustness while keeping fast computational time, thus achieving near real-time performance for visual tracking of complex textured surfaces.", "paper_title": "Mutual information-based 3D object tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000253755300007"}
