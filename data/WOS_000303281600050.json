A huge amount of new information is transferred to the Web on a daily basis. However, not all data are reliable and valuable, which implies that it may become more and more difficult to obtain satisfactory results from Web searches. We often iterate searches several times to find what we are looking for. To solve this problem, researchers have suggested the use of recommendation systems. Instead of searching for the same information several times, a recommendation system proposes relevant information. In the Web 2.0 era, recommendation systems often rely on collaborative filtering by users. In general, a collaborative filtering approach based on user information such as gender, location, or preference is effective. However, the traditional approach can fail due to the cold-start problem or the sparsity problem, because initial user information is required for this approach to be effective. Recently, several attempts have been made to tackle these collaborative filtering problems. One such attempt used category correlations of contents. For instance, a movie has genre information provided by movie experts and directors. This category information is more reliable than user ratings. Moreover, newly created content always has category information, allowing avoidance of the cold-start problem. In this study, we consider a movie recommendation system and improve the previous algorithms based on genre correlations to correct its shortcomings. We also test the modified algorithm and analyze the results with respect to two characteristics of genre correlations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
