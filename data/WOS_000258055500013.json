The approaches differ in the way spatial discretization is carried out to compute a reduced-order model suitable for controller design. In the first approach, the partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the process is first discretized in space and time using the finite difference method to derive a large number of recursive algebraic equations, which are written in the form of a discrete-time state-space model with sparse state, input and output matrices. Snapshots based on this high-dimensional state-space model are generated to calculate empirical eigenfunctions using proper orthogonal decomposition. The Galerkin projection with the computed empirical eigenfunctions as basis functions is then directly applied to the high-dimensional state-space model to derive a reduced-order model. In the second approach, a continuous-time finite-dimensional state-space model is constructed directly from the PDE through application of orthogonal collocation on finite elements in the spatial domain. The dimension of the derived state-space model can be further reduced using standard model reduction techniques. In both cases, optimal controllers are designed based on the low-order state-space models using discrete-time and continuous-time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are illustrated through applications to a diffusion-convection process and a diffusion-convection-reaction process. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
