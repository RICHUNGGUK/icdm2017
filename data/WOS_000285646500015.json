We implemented the PES (Personal Event Service) system that proactively executes appropriate tasks across multiple devices without explicit user requests by sharing the data used by the user and recognizing user intention based on the observed actions of the user for specific devices. The client module of PES installed on each device monitors the user actions and recognizes the intention of the user. The server provides data sharing and maintenance for clients. The connection between client and server is established by Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation). A series of experiments were performed to evaluate user satisfaction and system accuracy, and the results showed that the PES system can proactively provide appropriate, personalized services with a high degree of satisfaction to the user in an effective and efficient manner.", "paper_title": "Proactive Task Execution Using Data Sharing and Event Transition among Personal Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000285646500015"}
