To further remedy the deficiency of the 2D directional sensing model that cannot accurately characterise the actual DSNs, a 3D directional sensing model is established in this paper, and the key parameters are calculated precisely that may be utilised in any algorithms. Moreover, motivated by the existing coverage-enhancing algorithm of WSNs, hybrid optimisation algorithm for area coverage enhancement (HOA-ACE) is also proposed that is an improvement of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and conjugate gradient algorithm (CGA). In the proposed hybrid optimisation algorithm (HOA), we not only focus on the global searching, but also trying to reduce possibility of falling into the local optimum. Finally, simulation results are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Besides, another simulation experiment results show the effect of some aspects based on our proposed model.", "paper_title": "A hybrid optimisation algorithm for coverage enhancement in 3D directional sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000326932600006"}
