Existing approaches are reviewed, examined and critically analysed. They either ignore the normalization or separate it from the combination process, leading to irrational or suboptimal interval-valued belief structures. A new logically correct optimality approach is developed, where the combination and the normalization are optimised together rather than separately. Numerical examples are provided throughout the paper. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
