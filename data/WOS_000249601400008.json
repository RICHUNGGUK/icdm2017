The purpose of this paper is to present a new method for nodal ordering for profile optimization of finite element models. Design/methodology/approach - In the present method, a combination of graph theory and differential equations is employed. The proposed method transforms the eigenvalue problem involved in optimal ordering of algebraic graph method into a specific initial value problem of an ordinary differential equation. Findings - The transformation of this paper enables many advanced numerical methods for ordinary differential equations to be used in the computation of the eigenproblems. Originality/value - Combining two different tools, namely graph theory and differential equations, results in a more efficient and accurate method for nodal ordering problem, which is a combinatorial optimization problem. Examples are included to illustrate the efficiency of the present method.", "paper_title": "A novel nodal ordering algorithm for profile optimization by efficient solution of a differential equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000249601400008"}
