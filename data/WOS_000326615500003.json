Previous studies have shown that vehicle flow is more strongly correlated with morphological properties of streets than those of axial lines. In addition, street-based topological representations are more suitable for vehicle flow prediction, as well as more memory-oriented and global in nature. In this study, we construct a dual graph to represent the street-street relationship and propose a routing strategy for networks on the basis of gravitational field theory. We aim to diminish traffic congestion and enhance the transmission performance of networks. We borrow from gravitational field theory in establishing a gravitational field stimulated by a node in packet transmission and in defining the corresponding gravitational field equation. On the basis of this study, we present a mathematical model and a routing strategy. Experimental results indicate that compared with the shortest path routing strategy, the proposed method considerably enhances network capacity and effectively balances network traffic flow, especially for congested networks. We achieve critical gravitation that can always maximize network capacity, regardless of the values of other parameters.", "paper_title": "Gravitational field routing strategy considering the distribution of traffic flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000326615500003"}
