We show that this behavior is strongly influenced by the strong or the weak enforcement of the impermeability boundary conditions. A numerical analysis of the Stommel model is performed for both P-1-P-1 and P-1(NC)-P-1 mixed formulations. Steady and transient test cases are considered. We observe that the P-1-P-1 element exhibits stable discrete solutions with weak boundary conditions or with fully unstructured meshes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
