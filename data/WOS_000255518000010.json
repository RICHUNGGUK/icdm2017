Those two boosting algorithms are closely related to models of mislabeling in which the label is erroneously exchanged for others. For the two boosting algorithms, theoretical aspects supporting the robustness for mislabeling are explored. We apply the proposed two boosting methods for synthetic and real data sets to investigate the performance of these methods, focusing on robustness, and confirm the validity of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Robust boosting algorithm against mislabeling in multiclass problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000255518000010"}
