A set of 20 automatically annotated one-night polysomnographic recordings was considered, and artificial neural networks were selected for classification. For each inter-heartbeat (RR) series, beside features previously presented in literature, we introduced a set of four parameters related to signal regularity. RR series of three different lengths were considered (corresponding to 2, 6, and 10 successive epochs, 30 s each, in the same sleep stage). Two sets of only four features captured 99 % of the data variance in each classification problem, and both of them contained one of the new regularity features proposed. The accuracy of classification for REM versus NREM (68.4 %, 2 epochs; 83.8 %, 10 epochs) was higher than when distinguishing WAKE versus SLEEP (67.6 %, 2 epochs; 71.3 %, 10 epochs). Also, the reliability parameter (Cohens's Kappa) was higher (0.68 and 0.45, respectively). Sleep staging classification based on HRV was still less precise than other staging methods, employing a larger variety of signals collected during polysomnographic studies. However, cheap and unobtrusive HRV-only sleep classification proved sufficiently precise for a wide range of applications.", "paper_title": "The addition of entropy-based regularity parameters improves sleep stage classification based on heart rate variability", "paper_id": "WOS:000351519200004"}
