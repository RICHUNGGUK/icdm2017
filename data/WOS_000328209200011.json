Using the neighboring nodes as relays to establish a communication between a source and a destination achieves an increase of the diversity order. The relay nodes can be seen as a distributed multi-antenna system, which can be exploited for transmit diversity by using distributed space-time block coding (STBC). In this paper, we investigate the bit error rate (BER) of multi-hop WRNs employing distributed STBC at the relay nodes. We develop the general model of WRNs using distributed STBC, and we derive the pairwise error probability and an approximation of the BER. We examine the impact of several parameters, such as distributed STBC at the relays, the number of relays, the distances between the nodes, and the channel state information available at the receivers, on the BER performance of the multi-hop WRN. The obtained results provide guidelines about the expected error performance and the design of channel estimation for these networks.
