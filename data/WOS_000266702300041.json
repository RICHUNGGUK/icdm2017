However, in general, we have only a single set of attributes (termed as single-view data) available. The goal of this paper is to employ the multi-view viewpoint to develop a multi-view kernel machine for such a single-view data. The key of doing so is to associate each learning machine with one kernel, take it as one view and thus form a set of learning machines from their corresponding kernels, as a result, a multi-view kernel machine can be developed by synthesizing them into a single learning framework. Further, in the two-view (two-kernel) case, we explore the relationship between the generalization ability of the proposed kernel machine and its associated kernels, in which with the kernel alignment (KA) as a correlation measure between kernels, it is found that superior performance of the proposed machine results from a weaker correlation between the constitutive kernels. To the best of our knowledge, both the multi-view learning on single-view data and the KA measure used here have not appeared in any literature. In practice, we take the kernel modified Ho-Kashyap with squared (KMHKS) approximation of the misclassification errors as a learning machine to develop a multi-view KMHKS (MultiV-KMHKS) on single-view data.
