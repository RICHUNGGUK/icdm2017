One is based on a decomposition through first passage times to lower levels, and the other is based on a recursive expression for the deviation matrix. We revisit the link between a solution of Poisson's equation and perturbation analysis and we show that it applies to QBDs. We conclude with the PH/M/1 queue as an illustrative example, and we measure the sensitivity of the expected queue size to the initial value. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
