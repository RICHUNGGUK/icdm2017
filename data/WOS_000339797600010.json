By using both of the 2-bit/step and time-interleaved techniques, a high sampling frequency is obtained. To simplify the SAR ADC in low-bit applications, the analog switches are eliminated and replaced with inherent digital switches of SAR logics. The power supply, resolution, sampling frequency, SNDR, and power consumption of the proposed SAR ADC are 1.8 V, 4-bit, 720 MHz, 22.1 dB, and 10 mW.", "paper_title": "Combination of DAC switches and SAR logics in a 720 MS/s low-bit successive approximation ADC", "paper_id": "WOS:000339797600010"}
