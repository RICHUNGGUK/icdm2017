Its diagnosis through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become popular due to current inaccuracies of clinical examination. The diagnosis of POP on MRI consists of identifying reference points on pelvic bone structures for measurement and evaluation. However, it is currently performed manually, making it a time-consuming and subjective procedure. We present a new segmentation approach for automating pelvic bone point identification on MRI. It consists of a multistage mechanism based on texture-based block classification, leak detection, and prior shape information. Texture-based block classification and clustering analysis using K-means algorithm are integrated to generate the initial bone segmentation and to identify leak areas. Prior shape information is incorporated to obtain the final bone segmentation. Then, the reference points are identified using morphological skeleton operation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher bone segmentation accuracy compared to other segmentation methods. The proposed method can also automatically identify reference points faster and with more consistency compared with the manually identified point process by experts. This research aims to enable faster and consistent pelvic measurements on MRI to facilitate and improve the diagnosis of female POP.", "paper_title": "MRI-Based Segmentation of Pubic Bone for Evaluation of Pelvic Organ Prolapse", "paper_id": "WOS:000340119000028"}
