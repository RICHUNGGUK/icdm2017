The proof uses universal hashing, approximate counting and witness sampling. As a consequence, a collapse first noticed by Samik Sengupta that the assumption NP has small circuits collapses PH to S(2)(p) becomes the strongest version to date of the Karp-Lipton Theorem. We also discuss the problem of finding irrefutable proofs for S(2)(p) in ZPP(NP). (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
