The battery-free and low cost UHF passive tags can be attached on almost any objects, which are recognized as the best medium to achieve high precision ranging and positioning for large-scale objects. This paper proposes an indoor range measurement based on multifrequency phase difference of arrival (MF-PDoA) using UHF RFID passive tags and discusses the measurement principle, experiment implementation, and results evaluation in detail. After a theoretical overview of MF-PDoA range measurement principle, it introduces an experimental prototype under EPC C1G2 standard for range measurements. Both our prototype and a commercial off-the-shelf RFID reader have been used to verify the measurement method. We propose a Kalman filter and weighting method to process the measuring data. Experiment results indicate that, in a real environment, this method can effectively improve the ranging accuracy, which lays a foundation to extend the proposed measurement into two to three dimensions indoor object positioning.", "paper_title": "Multifrequency Phase Difference of Arrival Range Measurement: Principle, Implementation, and Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000364942600001"}
