However, the previous works on designing security protocols for RFID either do not conform to the EPC Class I Generation 2 standards or suffer from security flaws. This paper will point out the weaknesses of two EPC Class 1 GEN-2-conformed security protocols, and then proposes our new protocol, which raises the security level and conforms to the EPC Class 1 GEN-2 standards.
