We introduce a novel shape context descriptor and integrate it into the deformation framework, facilitating shape-preserving deformation for 2D anatomical illustrations. Our new scheme utilizes an analogy based shape transfer technique in order to learn shape styles from reference images. Experimental results show that visually plausible deformation can be quickly generated from an existing example at interactive frame rates. An experienced artist has evaluated our approach and his feedback is quite encouraging.", "paper_title": "Shape Context Preserving Deformation of 2D Anatomical Illustrations", "paper_id": "WOS:000263678700010"}
