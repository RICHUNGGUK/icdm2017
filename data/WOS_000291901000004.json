In the present work, we describe the lattice Boltzmann methodology and implementation techniques for the phonon transport modeling in crystalline materials. We show that some phonon physical properties, e.g., mean free path and group velocity, should be corrected to their effective values for one- and two-dimensional simulations, if one uses the isotropic approximation. We find that use of the D2Q9 lattice for phonon transport leads to erroneous results in transient ballistic simulations, and the D2Q7 lattice should be employed for two-dimensional simulations. Furthermore, we show that at the ballistic regime, the effect of direction discretization becomes apparent in two dimensions, regardless of the lattice used. Numerical methodology, lattice structure, and implementation of initial and different boundary conditions for the D2Q7 lattice are discussed in detail. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
