So far this interesting fact has not been widely acknowledged by the graphics community In this paper we demonstrate how to calculate the correct refractive index for a material based on its absorption spectrum with the Krainers-Kronig relation, and we discuss for which types of objects this effect is relevant in practice.", "paper_title": "Anomalous Dispersion in Predictive Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000268218400005"}
