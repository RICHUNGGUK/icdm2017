The global convergence without the nondegeneracy assumption and the quadratic convergence are obtained under suitable conditions. Numerical results show that this method is more effective than the norm method.", "paper_title": "A BFGS trust-region method for nonlinear equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000293642400003"}
