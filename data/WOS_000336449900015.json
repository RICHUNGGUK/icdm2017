The MAV, which is subject to a bounded turn rate, is required to eventually converge to a straight line starting from a known initial position and orientation. Earlier work in the literature uses Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) to solve this problem only for the no-wind case. In contrast, the present work uses a geometric approach to solve the problem completely in the presence of wind. In addition, it also shows how PMP can be used to partially solve the problem. Using a 6-DOF model of a MAV the generated optimal path is tracked by an autopilot consisting of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. The simulation results show the path generation and tracking for cases with steady and time-varying wind. Some issues on real-time path planning are also addressed.", "paper_title": "Time-Optimal Convergence to a Rectilinear Path in the Presence of Wind", "paper_id": "WOS:000336449900015"}
