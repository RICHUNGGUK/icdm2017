The results show that the most time consuming stage is the marker detection stage, followed by the image acquisition stage. Moreover, the rendering stage is decoupled on some devices, depending on the operative system used. This decoupling process allows avoiding low refresh rates, facilitating the collaborative work. However, the use of multicore devices does not significantly improve the performance provided by CAR applications. Finally, the results show that unless a poor network bandwidth makes the network to become the system bottleneck, the performance of CAR applications based on mobile phones will be limited by the detection stage. These results can be used as the basis for an efficient design of CAR systems and applications based on mobile phones.", "paper_title": "How mobile phones perform in collaborative augmented reality (CAR) applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000322326800016"}
