If two rooms are adjacent, there is a door connecting them and a guard positioned at this door will see both rooms. In Czyzowicz et al. [(1994) Guarding rectangular art galleries. Discrete Appl. Math., 50, 149-157], it is shown that any rectangular gallery can be guarded with aOEn/2aOE parts per thousand guards. We prove that the same bound holds for L-shape polygons. We extend it to staircases and prove that an orthogonal staircase with n rooms and r reflex vertices can be guarded with aOE(n+aOES r/2aOE <)/2aOE parts per thousand guards. Then we prove an upper bound on the number of guards for arbitrary orthogonal polygon with orthogonal holes. This result improves the previous bound by Czyzowicz et al. [(1994) Guarding rectangular art galleries. Discrete Appl. Math., 50, 149-157] (even in the case of polygon without holes).", "paper_title": "Guarding Orthogonal Galleries with Rectangular Rooms", "paper_id": "WOS:000344649500006"}
