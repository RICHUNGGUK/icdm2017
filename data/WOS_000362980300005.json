Three outputs of the MOIT2FLS correspond to three structure classes including helix, strand (sheet) and coil. Quantitative properties of amino acids are employed to characterize twenty amino acids rather than the widely used computationally expensive binary encoding scheme. Three clustering tasks are performed using the adaptive vector quantization method to construct an equal number of initial rules for each type of secondary structure. Genetic algorithm is applied to optimally adjust parameters of the MOIT2FLS. The genetic fitness function is designed based on the Q3 measure. Experimental results demonstrate the dominance of the proposed approach against the traditional methods that are Chou-Fasman method, Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson method, and artificial neural network models.", "paper_title": "Multi-Output Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System for Protein Secondary Structure Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000362980300005"}
