As a consequence of this we obtain the existence of computable points which follow the typical statistical behavior of a dynamical system (they satisfy the Birkhoff theorem) for a large class of systems, having computable invariant measure and a certain \"logarithmic\" speed of convergence of Birkhoff averages over Lipschitz observables. This is applied to uniformly hyperbolic systems, piecewise expanding maps, systems oil the interval with an indifferent fixed point and it directly implies the existence of computable numbers which are normal with respect to any base.
