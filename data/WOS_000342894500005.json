This method imposes a multitude of shading- and shadow-based constraints on the projected location of a distant point light source. The consistency of a collection of such constraints is posed as a linear programming problem. A feasible solution indicates that the combination of shading and shadows is physically consistent, while a failure to find a solution provides evidence of photo tampering.", "paper_title": "Exposing Photo Manipulation from Shading and Shadows", "paper_id": "WOS:000342894500005"}
