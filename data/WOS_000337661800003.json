When applied to image processing, ordinary NMF merely views a p(1) x p(2) image as a vector in p(1) x p(2)-dimensional space and the pixels of the image are considered as independent. It fails to consider the fact that an image displayed in the plane is intrinsically a matrix, and pixels spatially close to each other may probably be correlated. Even though we have p(1) x p(2) pixels per image, this spatial correlation suggests that the real number of freedom is far less. In this paper, we introduce a Spatially Correlated Nonnegative Matrix Factorization algorithm, which explicitly models the spatial correlation between neighboring pixels in the parts-based image representation. A multiplicative updating algorithm is also proposed to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Experimental results on benchmark image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
