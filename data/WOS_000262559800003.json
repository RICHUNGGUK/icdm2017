We prove that the problem is NP-hard and give its integer linear programming formulation. The problem is solved by a genetic algorithm (GA) that uses binary encoding and standard genetic operators adapted to the problem. Experimental results include three sets of ORLIB test instances: crew scheduling, pseudo-boolean and graph coloring. CA is also tested on theoretically challenging large-scale instances of hypercubes and Hamming graphs. Optimality of CA solutions on smaller size instances has been verified by total enumeration. For several larger instances optimality follows from the existing theoretical results. The CA results for MDRSP of hypercubes are used by a dynamic programming approach to obtain upper bounds for the metric dimension of large hypercubes up to 21 nodes, that cannot be directly handled by the computer.
