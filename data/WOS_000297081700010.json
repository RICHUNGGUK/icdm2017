We have demonstrated how to implement the CESE algorithm to solve 1D shock tube problems using an older generation GPU (the NVIDIA 9800 GT) with relatively limited memory. To optimize the code performance, we used Shared Memory and solved the inter-Block boundary problem in two ways, namely the branch scheme and the overlapping scheme. The implementations of these schemes are discussed in detail and their performances are compared for the Sod shock tube problems. For the Sod problem without condensation, the speedup over an Intel CPU E7300 is 23 for the branch scheme and 41 for the overlapping scheme, respectively. While for problems with condensation, both schemes achieve higher acceleration ratios, 53 and 71, respectively. The higher speedup of the condensation case can be ascribed to the source term calculation which has a local dependence on the mesh point and the SOURCE kernel has a higher acceleration ratio.
