Focusing on the co-existence of multiple access networks and the complex service combinations, the wireless service operators should guarantee good quality of services for every user. Thus, the service operators build a new operation framework which combines the existing networks and newly adopted ones. Our objective is finding the optimal heterogeneous network operation framework. We suggest the market-based marginal cost function for evaluating the relative value of resources for each network and develop a whole new heterogeneous network operation framework. To prove the applicability of the proposed operation framework, we build a large-scale JAVA simulator. We can easily test the various service scenarios in heterogeneous network environment by the simulator.", "paper_title": "Design of Common Resource Management and Network Simulator in Heterogeneous Radio Access Network Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000266664300007"}
