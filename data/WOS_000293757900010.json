However, the relation between these two notions is not well understood. The main contribution of this paper is to clarify the relation between universal and characteristic kernels by presenting a unifying study relating them to RKHS embedding of measures, in addition to clarifying their relation to other common notions of strictly pd, conditionally strictly pd and integrally strictly pd kernels. For radial kernels on R-d, all these notions are shown to be equivalent.", "paper_title": "Universality, Characteristic Kernels and RKHS Embedding of Measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000293757900010"}
