MIFs can be imported from different sources (GRID, CoMFA/CoMSIA, quantum-mechanical electrostatic potential or electron density grids) or generated by Open3DQSAR itself. Much focus has been put on automation through the implementation of a scriptable interface, as well as on high computational performance achieved by algorithm parallelization. Flexibility and interoperability with existing molecular modeling software make Open3DQSAR a powerful tool in pharmacophore assessment and ligand-based drug design.", "paper_title": "Open3DQSAR: a new open-source software aimed at high-throughput chemometric analysis of molecular interaction fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000286482700019"}
