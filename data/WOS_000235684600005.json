In addition, we give some conditions for ascertaining periodic orbits to be locally or globally exponentially attractive and allow them to locate in any designated region. As a special case of exponential periodicity, exponential stability of delayed cellular neural networks is also characterized. These conditions improve and extend the existing results in the literature. To illustrate and compare the results, simulation results are discussed in three numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Multiperiodicity and exponential attractivity evoked by periodic external inputs in delayed cellular neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235684600005"}
