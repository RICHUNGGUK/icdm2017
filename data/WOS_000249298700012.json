Let Omega and (B) over bar be, respectively, an ( n - 2)- dimensional subspace of an element of S and a minimal blocking set of an ((r - 1) n + 1)- dimensional subspace of PG( rn, q) skew to Omega.

Generalizing the constructions of Mazzocca and Polverino ( J Algebraic Combin, 24( 1): 61 - 81, 2006), under suitable assumptions on (B) over bar, we prove that B is a minimal blocking set in PG( r, q(n)). In this way, we achieve new classes of minimal blocking sets and we find new sizes of minimal blocking sets in finite projective spaces of non- prime order. In particular, for q a power of 3, we exhibit examples of r- dimensional minimal blocking sets of size q(n+2) + 1 in PG( r, q(n)), 3 <= r <= 6 and n >= 3, and of size q(4) + 1 in PG( r, q(2)), 4 <= r <= 6; actually, in the second case, these blocking sets turn out to be the union of q(3) Baer sublines through a point. Moreover, for q an even power of 3, we construct examples of minimal blocking sets of PG( 4, q) of size at least q(2) + 2. From these constructions, we also get maximal partial ovoids of the hermitian variety H( 4, q(2)) of size q(4) + 1, for any q a power of 3.", "paper_title": "Blocking sets in PG(r, q(n))", "paper_id": "WOS:000249298700012"}
