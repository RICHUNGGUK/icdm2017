An error representation formula is found in an abstract setting based on the semigroup formulation of stochastic evolution equations. This is then applied to the stochastic heat, linearized Cahn-Hilliard, and wave equations. In all cases it is found that the rate of weak convergence is twice the rate of strong convergence, sometimes up to a logarithmic factor, under the same or, essentially the same, regularity requirements.", "paper_title": "Weak convergence of finite element approximations of linear stochastic evolution equations with additive noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000300850800006"}
