The proposed control scheme has low computational complexity. Moreover, the exact mathematical model of the plant to be controlled is not required. The fuzzy controller under consideration is based on the proportional-derivative fuzzy control scheme and triangular membership functions. In the design procedure, the domain intervals of the input and output variables are selected with a heuristic approach to minimize a cost function under the constraint of tolerable overshoots in the response curve. A learning scheme is then proposed to automatically adjust the parameters in the fuzzy controller to reduce the error of the system. It can also be used adaptively to improve the system performance of a time-varying system. Simulations and comparisons are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A two-stage design of adaptive fuzzy controllers for time-delay systems with unknown models", "paper_id": "WOS:000246750500007"}
