For large principle quantum number n, the theoretical models become computationally intractable and any results are often rendered irrelevant by small deviations from ideal experimental conditions, for example, external electromagnetic fields. Several different proposals for quantum information processing rely heavily upon the quality of these detectors. In this paper, we show a proof of principle that it is possible to optimize experimental field profiles in situ by running a genetic algorithm to control aspects of the experiment itself. A simple experiment produced novel results that are consistent with analyses of existing results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
