Design/methodology/approach - The tower is modeled as an electric network and a set of formulas are given for calculating the related electrical parameters. The parameters of grounding rods are also proposed. Based on the numerical representation of the transient characteristics, of inductive elements, the electric network is converted into an equivalent circuit. The transient responses are obtained from the equivalent circuit by using circuit analysis method. Findings - The calculated results are in good agreement with results computed by a hybrid method in frequency and time domain, which demonstrating the validity of the proposed method. Originality/value - The transient responses on WT towers struck by lightning are computed using the numerical calculation method directly in time domain and electric field, electromagnetic field and induced potentials will be computed from the responses directly, which can provide guidelines for lightning protection design.", "paper_title": "An efficient algorithm of transient responses on wind turbine towers struck by lightning", "paper_id": "WOS:000265713800008"}
