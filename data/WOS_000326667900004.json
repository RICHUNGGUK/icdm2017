These advantages of NSCT can, when used in fusion algorithm, help to attain more visual information in fused image and improve the fusion quality. At the same time, in order to improve the robustness of fusion algorithm and to improve the quality of the fused image, two selection rules should be considered. Firstly, a new bilateral sharpness criterion is proposed to select the lowpass coefficient, which exploits both strength and phase coherence. Secondly, a modified SML (sum modified Laplacian) is introduced into the local contrast measurements, which is suitable for human vision system and can extract more useful detailed information from source images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the conventional fusion algorithm in terms of both visual quality and objective evaluation criteria.", "paper_title": "Multi-Modality Image Fusion Using the Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000326667900004"}
