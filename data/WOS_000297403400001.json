Hybrid recommender systems represent a promising solution for multiple applications. In this paper we propose a hybrid fuzzy linguistic recommender system to help the Technology Transfer Office staff in the dissemination of research resources interesting for the users. The system recommends users both specialized and complementary research resources and additionally, it discovers potential collaboration possibilities in order to form multidisciplinary working groups. Thus, this system becomes an application that can be used to help the Technology Transfer Office staff to selectively disseminate the research knowledge and to increase its information discovering properties and personalization capacities in an academic environment.
