Specifically, we analyze the belief propagation (BP) approach and its fractional belief propagation (FBP) generalization for computing the permanent of a non-negative matrix. Known bounds and Conjectures are verified in experiments, and some new theoretical relations, bounds and Conjectures are proposed. The fractional free energy (FFE) function is parameterized by a scalar parameter gamma is an element of [-1;1], where gamma = -1 corresponds to the BP limit and gamma = 1 corresponds to the exclusion principle (but ignoring perfect matching constraints) mean-field (MF) limit. FFE shows monotonicity and continuity with respect to g. For every non-negative matrix, we define its special value gamma(*) is an element of [-1;0] to be the gamma for which the minimum of the gamma-parameterized FFE function is equal to the permanent of the matrix, where the lower and upper bounds of the g-interval corresponds to respective bounds for the permanent. Our experimental analysis suggests that the distribution of gamma(*) varies for different ensembles but gamma(*) always lies within the [-1;-1/2] interval. Moreover, for all ensembles considered, the behavior of gamma(*) is highly distinctive, offering an empirical practical guidance for estimating permanents of non-negative matrices via the FFE approach.", "paper_title": "Approximating the Permanent with Fractional Belief Propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000323367000011"}
