However, this approach has some limitations because of the difficulty in selecting an appropriate weight for each objective and the need of some knowledge about the problems. The weight selection is a subjective decision which is usually based on trial and error, and is impractical for complex engineering problems. In order to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a new self organizing genetic algorithm (SOGA) for multi-objective optimization problems. The SOGA involves GA within GA evaluation process which optimally tunes the weight of each objective function and applies weighted-sum approach for fitness evaluation process. This algorithm has been tested for optimization of components placement on printed circuit boards. The results show that SOGA is able to obtain a better minimum value as compared to other methods such as fix weight GA, random weight GA and formulated weight based GA methods.", "paper_title": "SELF ORGANIZING MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500024"}
