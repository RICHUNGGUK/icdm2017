Secondly, a dedicated graphical user interface is introduced bringing the benefits of the multi-dimensional model to different stakeholders. Finally, the advantages of multi-dimensional performance data management is demonstrated in a real life case study for on-site and e-service performance management (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Multi-dimensional building performance data management for continuous commissioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000283403900009"}
