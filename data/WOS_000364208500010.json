Design insight into thermal coupling in 3-D integrated circuits (ICs) through both experiment and simulation is provided, and suggestions to mitigate thermal effects in 3-D ICs are offered. Two wafers are vertically bonded to form a 3-D stack. Intraplane and interplane thermal coupling is investigated through single-point heat generation using resistive thermal heaters and temperature monitoring through four-point resistive measurements. Thermal paths are identified and analyzed based on the metric of thermal resistance per unit length. The peak steady-state temperature due to die location within a 3-D stack is described. The reduction in peak temperature through fan-based active cooling is also reported. Thermal propagation from a heat source located on the backside of the silicon is examined with both back metal and on-chip thermal sensors. A comparison of thermal coupling between two different heat sources on the same device plane is also provided.", "paper_title": "Experimental Analysis of Thermal Coupling in 3-D Integrated Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208500010"}
