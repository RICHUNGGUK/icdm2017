In this study, we examine the very elderly (mean age 87) who have experienced a loss in functional capacities and are dependent on managed care such as residential home care units. Using qualitative methods amongst a group of 17 residents (semi-structured interviews and longitudinal observations), we examine whether new social practices form and whether subjects feel more socially recognised. Our study shows that information and communications technologies may, to some extent, play an instrumental role in interconnectedness and social stimulation, and can also be seen as a 'boundary object' that communicates between the residents' world (who are rather isolated) and their families' world (including grandchildren).", "paper_title": "Can ICT improve the quality of life of elderly adults living in residential home care units?
