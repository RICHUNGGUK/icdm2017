Reissner-Mindlin plate theory is employed to build governing equation and stiffness matrix. We use this theory to solve the elasticity problems of various classical plate models, and compare the obtained results to those from single-patch models and the exact solutions in Kirchhoff theory. The solutions of problem involving the use of complex model are as well obtained using the same Reissner-Mindlin theory and compared to the results from finite element method. All models are built with NURBS (non-uniform rational B-spline) patches with non-conforming mesh along the common boundaries. The algorithms of knot insertion and order elevation are applied to enrich the basis functions of NURBS patches. The results of numerical examples show the accuracy, robustness and high convergence rate of this method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
