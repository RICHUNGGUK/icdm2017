Besides, these methods need some hints about the target clustering. However, issues related to the current use of Internet resources (distribution of data, privacy, etc.) require new ways of dealing with data clustering. In multiagent systems this is also becoming an issue as one wishes to group agents according to some features of the environment in order to have agents accomplishing the available tasks in an efficient way. In this paper we discuss the application of a clustering algorithm that is inspired by swarm intelligence techniques such as organization of bee colonies and task allocation among social insects. This application involves a complex task allocation scenario, the RoboCup Rescue, where tasks with different characteristics must be allocated to agents with different capabilities. Our results have shown that clustering agents is effective in this scenario as agents act in a more coordinated way. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
