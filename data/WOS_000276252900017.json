Performance comparisons made by computer simulation indicate that this advantageous feature together with the enhanced performance stability is due to the combination of both \"memory\" and \"look-ahead\" estimation of the employed step-size adaptation algorithm.", "paper_title": "Elimination of idle tones by a second order 2-bit adaptive sigma delta modulation system", "paper_id": "WOS:000276252900017"}
