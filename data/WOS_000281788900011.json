The fuzzy constraint-directed approach involves the fuzzy probability constraint and the fuzzy instance reasoning. The proposed approach via fuzzy probability constraint can not only cluster the opponent's information in negotiation process as proximate regularities to improve the convergence of behavior patterns, but also eliminate the noisy hypotheses or beliefs to enhance the effectiveness on beliefs learning. By using fuzzy instance method, our approach can reuse the prior opponent knowledge to speed up the problem-solving, and reason the proximate regularities to acquire desirable results on predicting opponent behavior. In addition, the proposed interaction method enables the agent to make a concession dynamically based on expected objectives. Moreover, experimental results suggest that the proposed framework allows an agent to achieve a higher reward, a fairer deal, or a smaller cost of negotiation.", "paper_title": "Learning opponent's beliefs via fuzzy constraint-directed approach to make effective agent negotiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000281788900011"}
