We derive a simple matrix formula for second-order covariances of maximum-likelihood estimators in this class of models. The formula is quite suitable for computer implementation, since it involves only simple operations on matrices and vectors. Some simulation results show that the second-order covariances can be quite pronounced in small to moderate sample sizes. We also present empirical applications.", "paper_title": "Covariance matrix formula for Birnbaum-Saunders regression models", "paper_id": "WOS:000295682900008"}
