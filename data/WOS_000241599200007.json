The design choices are measured using the widely accepted metrics suite proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer for object oriented languages [S.R. Chidamber, C.F. Kemerer, A metrics suite for object oriented design, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 20 (6) (1994) 476-493]. This paper reports the results of an extensive case study, which strongly reinforces earlier, mainly anecdotal, evidence that design aspects related to communication between classes can be used as indicators of the most defect-prone classes. Statistical models applicable for the non-normally distributed count data are used, such as Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression. The performances of the models are assessed using correlations, dispersion coefficients and Alberg diagrams. The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model based on response for a class shows the best overall ability to describe the variability of the number of defects in classes.
