In this paper, we explore techniques to improve the reticle inspection flow by increasing its design awareness. We develop an algorithm to locate nonfunctional features in a postoptical proximity correction layout without using any design information. Using this, and the timing information of the design (if available), the smallest defect size that could cause the design to fail is assigned to each reticle feature. The criticality of various reticle features is then used to partition the reticle such that each partition is inspected at a different pixel size and sensitivity so that the false and nuisance defect count is reduced without missing any critical defect. We also develop an analytical model to estimate the false and nuisance defect count. Using those models, our simulation results show that this design-aware mask inspection can reduce the false and nuisance defect count for a critical polysilicon layer from 80 defects down to 49 defects, leading to substantial reduction in defect review load. We also develop a model to estimate first pass yield (FPY) and show that our method can improve the FPY for a polysilicon layer from 11% to 30%. Apart from the polysilicon layer, the potential benefit of this approach is analyzed for active, contact and all the metal/via layers.", "paper_title": "Design-Aware Mask Inspection", "paper_id": "WOS:000303205900004"}
