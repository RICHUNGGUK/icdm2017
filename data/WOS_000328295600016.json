However, due to the requirement of backward compatibility, EPS-AKA inevitably inherits some defects of its predecessor UMTS-AKA protocol that cannot resist several frequent attacks, i.e., redirection attack, man-in-the-middle attack, and DoS attack. Meanwhile, there are additional security issues associated with the EPS-AKA protocol, i.e., the lack of privacy-preservation and key forward/backward secrecy (KFS/KBS). In addition, there are new challenges with the emergence of group-based communication scenarios in authentication. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient AKA protocol, called SE-AKA, which can fit in with all of the group authentication scenarios in the LTE networks. Specifically, SE-AKA uses Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) to realize KFS/KBS, and it also adopts an asymmetric key cryptosystem to protect users' privacy. For group authentication, it simplifies the whole authentication procedure by computing a group temporary key (GTK). Compared with other authentication protocols, SE-AKA cannot only provide strong security including privacy-preservation and KFS/KBS, but also provide a group authentication mechanism which can effectively authenticate group devices. Extensive security analysis and formal verification by using proverif have shown that the proposed SE-AKA is secure against various malicious attacks. In addition, elaborate performance evaluations in terms of communication, computational and storage overhead also demonstrates that SE-AKA is more efficient than those existing protocols.
