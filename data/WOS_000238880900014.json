And the data paths of broadband networks, which are critical for traffic engineering, are always necessary to be well protected. The procedure of protection or restoration for a path is initiated when failure is detected within the working path. In order to minimize the influence on transmission quality caused by the failure of links and to provide a definite time for the recovery from the failure, the protection switching time (PST) should be carefully considered in the path arrangement. Several researches have been devoted to construct the protection and restoration schemes of data paths over dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) networks, however, there was rare research on the design of data paths with guaranteed protection switching time. In this paper, the PST-guaranteed scheme, which is based on the concept of short leap shared protection (SLSP), for the arrangement of data paths in DWDM networks is proposed. The proposed scheme provides an efficient procedure to determine a just-enough PST-guaranteed backup paths for a working path. In addition to selecting the PST-guaranteed path, the network cost is also considered in a heuristic manner. The experimental results demonstrate that the paths arranged by the proposed scheme can fully meet the desired PST and the required cost of the selected path is competitive with which of the shared path scheme.", "paper_title": "Shared protection of lightpath with guaranteed switching time over DWDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238880900014"}
