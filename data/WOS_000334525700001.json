For effective saliency measurement, the original image is first simplified using adaptive color quantization and region segmentation to partition the image into a set of primitive regions. Then, three measures, i.e., global contrast, spatial sparsity, and object prior are integrated with regional similarities to generate the initial regional saliency for each primitive region. Next, a saliency-directed region merging approach with dynamic scale control scheme is proposed to generate the saliency tree, in which each leaf node represents a primitive region and each non-leaf node represents a non-primitive region generated during the region merging process. Finally, by exploiting a regional center-surround scheme based node selection criterion, a systematic saliency tree analysis including salient node selection, regional saliency adjustment and selection is performed to obtain final regional saliency measures and to derive the high-quality pixel-wise saliency map. Extensive experimental results on five datasets with pixel-wise ground truths demonstrate that the proposed saliency tree model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art saliency models.", "paper_title": "Saliency Tree: A Novel Saliency Detection Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000334525700001"}
