On the one hand, we show numerically that all two-dimensional (qubit) states, whose entanglement of formation (EOF) is larger than 2 + root 2/4, violate the CHSH inequality. On the other hand, any state with purity smaller than 0.5562 may not violate it.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT, PURITY AND VIOLATION OF BELL INEQUALITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000271353300002"}
