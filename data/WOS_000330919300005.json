This problem considers the influence of uncertainty factors and different objectives to achieve completion rate on time of the whole projects. This paper introduces a multi-objective optimization model for multi-project scheduling on critical chain, which takes into consideration multi-objective, such as overall duration, financing costs and whole robustness. The proposed model can be used to generate alternative schedules based on the relative magnitude and importance of different objectives. To respond to this need, a cloud genetic algorithm is proposed. This algorithm using randomness and stability of Normal Cloud Model, cloud genetic algorithm was designed to generate priority of multi-project scheduling activities and obtain plan of multi-project scheduling on critical chain. The performance comparison shows that the cloud genetic algorithm significantly outperforms the previous multi-objective algorithm. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
