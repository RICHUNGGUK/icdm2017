It will get us one step closer to the goal of ubiquitous Internet which is accessible anytime and anywhere. Among others, Internet gateway discovery and selection schemes pose more fundamental challenge to the problem. In this paper, we propose a load-adaptive access gateway discovery protocol and a QoS-enabled access gateway selection scheme that can exploit relevant network conditions. The gateway discovery protocol dynamically adjusts its proactive area according to network traffic. Among a set of the discovered candidate gateways, one is selected based on the number of hops to and the capability of them. Our performance evaluation study shows that the load-adaptive access gateway discovery and QoS-enabled selection schemes outperform existing mechanisms over various simulation scenarios.
