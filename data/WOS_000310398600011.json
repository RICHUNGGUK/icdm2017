The graphical representation of DNA sequences provide a simple way of viewing, storing, and comparing various sequences. In this paper, we first present for each kind of codon, a numerically representation as a 2D coordinate (x,y) and give a 2D graphical representation for DNA sequences. Then we transform the graphical representation into a Matrix to facilitate quantitative comparisons of DNA sequences and compute \"ALE-index\" for this matrix. It is an invariant of DNA sequences and using this index, we construct similarity/dissimilarity table based on this invariant for sequences of DNA of the first exon of beta-globin gene from nine species for illustrating the utility of this representation.", "paper_title": "A Novel Graphical and Numerical Representation for Analyzing DNA Sequences Based on Codons", "paper_id": "WOS:000310398600011"}
