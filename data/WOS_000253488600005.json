We are concerned with the positive solutions of the model, and obtain some results for the existence and non-existence of positive solutions. Moreover, the multiplicity, stability and asymptotical behaviors of positive solutions with respect to the parameters are also studied. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
