In this paper we propose nine new hardware designs for the two classes of WG(29,11) and WG-16. For each class, we design and implement three versions of standard, pipelined and serial. For the first time, we use the polynomial basis (PB) representation to design and implement the WG(29,11) and WG-16. We consider traditional PB multiplier for the WG(29,11), and, the traditional and Karatsuba multipliers for the WG-16. For efficient field operations, we propose an irreducible trinomial for the WG(29,11). For the WG-16, a new formulation of its permutation which requires only 8 multipliers is introduced. In these designs, the multipliers in the transforms are further reduced by utilizing a novel computation for the trace of the multiplication of two field elements. We have implemented the proposed designs in ASIC using CMOS 65 nm technology. The results show that the proposed standard WG(29,11) consumes less area and slightly enhances the normalized throughput, compared to the existing counterparts. For the WG-16, throughput of the proposed pipelined instance outperforms the previous designs. Moreover, the speed of the proposed WG-16 designs meet the peak bit rates for the 4 G specifications.", "paper_title": "New Hardware Implementations of WG(29,11) and WG-16 Stream Ciphers Using Polynomial Basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000355989900017"}
