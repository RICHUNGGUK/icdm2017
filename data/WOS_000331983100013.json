The performance of wireless ranging depends on both the transmission technique and the propagation channel. Understanding such dependence is crucial to the design of high-accuracy ranging algorithms. In this paper, we derive the performance bounds for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) ranging in multipath channels based on Fisher information analysis. In particular, we determine the equivalent Fisher information for ranging and quantify the effects of signal and channel parameters on the OFDM ranging accuracy. We also illustrate the ranging accuracy for different signal and channel parameters through numerical examples.", "paper_title": "On OFDM Ranging Accuracy in Multipath Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000331983100013"}
