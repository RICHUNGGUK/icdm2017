For unweighted undirected graphs, our distance oracle has size O(n(5/3)) and, when queried about vertices at distance d, returns a path of length at most 2d + 1. For weighted undirected graphs with m = n(2)/alpha edges, our distance oracle has size O(n(2)/(3)root alpha) and returns a factor 2 approximation. Based on a plausible conjecture about the hardness of set intersection queries, we show that a 2- approximate distance oracle requires space (Omega) over tilde (n(2)/root alpha). For unweighted graphs, this implies a (Omega) over tilde (n(1.5)) space lower bound to achieve approximation 2d + 1.", "paper_title": "DISTANCE ORACLES BEYOND THE THORUP-ZWICK BOUND", "paper_id": "WOS:000333538300016"}
