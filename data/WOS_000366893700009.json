We focus on a desktop scenario, where a user operates a personal computer, and use the mouse-clicked positions to infer, where on the screen the user is looking at. Our method continuously captures the user's head pose and eye images with a monocular camera, and each mouse click triggers learning sample acquisition. In order to handle head pose variations, the samples are adaptively clustered according to the estimated head pose. Then, local reconstruction-based gaze estimation models are incrementally updated in each cluster. We conducted a prototype evaluation in real-world environments, and our method achieved an estimation accuracy of 2.9 degrees.", "paper_title": "Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation With Online Calibration From Mouse Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000366893700009"}
