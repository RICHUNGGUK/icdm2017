Because many people use high-performance mobile devices, the use of real-time multimedia services is increasing rapidly. However, the preoccupation of resources by real-time traffic users is causing harm to other services-for example, frequent call interference, lowered service quality, and poor network performance. This paper suggests a resource allocation algorithm for effective traffic service support in a hybrid network. The main objective is to obtain an optimum value of data rates by comparing user requirements with the amount of resources that can be allocated. A new mechanism based on Adaptive-Quality of Service (QoS) and a monitoring system based on Queue-Aware are proposed. Adaptive-QoS supports effective resource control according to the type of traffic service, and the monitoring system based on Queue-Aware measures the amount of resources in order to calculate the maximum that can be allocated. We apply our algorithm to a test system and use Qualnet 4.5.1 to evaluate its performance.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Resource Allocation for Traffic Flow Control in Hybrid Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000315022000003"}
