This method overcomes the problem of dissatisfying governing equations on boundaries when the conventional RBF collocation method is used in solving partial differential equations. The Poisson and the Laplace equations are chosen to test the proposed method. Based on the method, a three-dimensional numerical model is established to simulate the fully nonlinear free-surface waves of sloshing water in a rectangular tank. Simulations of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases are performed. Simulation results from the present model are validated with experimental measurements and other numerical results.
