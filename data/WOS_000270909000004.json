This method is used to represent and simulate fluid flows following a mesoscopic approach. Most traditional parallel implementations use simple data distribution strategies to parallelize the operations on the regular fluid data set. However, it is well known that block partitioning is usually better. Such a parallel implementation is discussed and its communication cost is established. Fluid flows simulations crossing a cavity have also been used as a real-world case study to evaluate our implementation. The presented results with our blocked implementation achieve a performance up to 31% better than non-blocked versions, for some data distributions. Thus, this work shows that blocked, parallel implementations can be efficiently used to reduce the parallel execution time of the method.", "paper_title": "Parallel Lattice Boltzmann Method with Blocked Partitioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000270909000004"}
