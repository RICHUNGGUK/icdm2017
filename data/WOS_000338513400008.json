To mitigate this problem, the authors transparently integrate BitTorrent into the cloud provider infrastructure and leverage users' upstream capacity to reduce bandwidth costs. They also allocate seeder bandwidth optimally among swarms to maximize throughput. Their system delivers higher performance when dealing with large volumes of data compared to the traditional client-server paradigm.", "paper_title": "Smart Cloud Seeding for BitTorrent in Datacenters", "paper_id": "WOS:000338513400008"}
