An advancing-front method is used close to solid surfaces and in the wake region(s). The boundary layer and wake grids possibly contain both highly stretched quadrilateral and triangular elements. The latter are inserted locally to improve the quality of the grid, thus circumventing some drawbacks of standard structured grid advancing-front methods. An advancing-front/Delaunay algorithm triangulates the remaining portion of the computational domain. An overview of both algorithms is given and results for viscous laminar and turbulent compressible flows around single and multi-element airfoils are shown to support the present approach.
