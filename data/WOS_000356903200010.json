This workflow couples a rule-based molecular fragmentation scheme (SynDiR) with a pharmacophore fingerprint-based fragment replacement algorithm (RATS) to broaden the scope of reconnection options considered in the generation of potential solution structures. Solutions are ranked by a multiobjective scoring algorithm comprising ligand-based (shape similarity) biochemical activity predictions as well as physicochemical property calculations. Application of this iterative workflow to optimization of the CDK2 inhibitor Seliciclib (CYC202, R-roscovitine) generated solution molecules in desired physicochemical property space. Synthesis and experimental evaluation of optimal solution molecules demonstrates CDK2 biochemical activity and improved human metabolic stability.", "paper_title": "MOARF, an Integrated Workflow for Multiobjective Optimization: Implementation, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000356903200010"}
