They are important in CAD/CAM applications, the design of highway and railway routes, trajectories of mobile robots and other similar applications. The quintic Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve discussed in this article is polynomial; it has the attractive properties that its arc-length is a polynomial of its parameter, and the formula for its offset is a rational algebraic expression. This paper generalises earlier results on planar PH quintic spiral segments and examines techniques for designing fair curves using the new results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
