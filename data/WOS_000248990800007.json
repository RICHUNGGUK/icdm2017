In our approach, by working on a functional space we are able to provide an efficient procedure without assuming any specific family of distributions. We then describe an implementable algorithm that incorporates the ideas described in the paper. Some convergence properties of the proposed method are established, and numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "A study on the cross-entropy method for rare-event probability estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000248990800007"}
