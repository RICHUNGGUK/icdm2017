To guarantee robust security and computational efficiency for service retrieval, a variety of authentication schemes have been proposed. However, most of these schemes have been found to be lacking when subject to a formal security analysis. Recently, Chang et al. (2014) introduced a formally provable secure authentication protocol with the property of user-untraceability. Unfortunately, based on our analysis, the proposed scheme fails to provide the property of user-untraceability as claimed, and is insecure against user impersonation attack, server counterfeit attack, and man-in-the-middle attack. In this paper, we demonstrate the details of these malicious attacks. A security enhanced authentication scheme is proposed to eliminate all identified weaknesses.", "paper_title": "A lightweight authentication scheme with user untraceability", "paper_id": "WOS:000352821000001"}
