The coupled networks involve both the mode-dependent discrete-time delays and the mode-dependent unbounded distributed time delays. All the network parameters including the coupling matrix are also dependent on the Markovian jumping mode. By introducing novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and using some analytical techniques, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the coupled networks are asymptotically synchronized in mean square. The derived sufficient conditions are closely related with the discrete-time delays, the distributed time delays, the mode transition probability, and the coupling structure of the networks. The obtained criteria are given in terms of matrix inequalities that can be efficiently solved by employing the semidefinite program method. Numerical simulations are presented to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Synchronization of Coupled Neutral-Type Neural Networks With Jumping-Mode-Dependent Discrete and Unbounded Distributed Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000317643500009"}
