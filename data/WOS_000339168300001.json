We partially answer to a conjecture of Eric Lilin who conjectured in 1991 that a one-rule length-preserving rewrite system is a rational transduction if and only if the left-hand side u and the right-hand side v of the rule of the system are not quasi-conjugate or are equal, that means if u and v are distinct, there do not exist words x, y and z such that u = xyz and v = zyx. We prove the only if part of this conjecture and identify two non trivial cases where the if part is satisfied.", "paper_title": "ONE-RULE LENGTH-PRESERVING REWRITE SYSTEMS AND RATIONAL TRANSDUCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000339168300001"}
