Our work focuses on designing state-feedback and output-feedback sampled-data controllers to guarantee the resulting closed-loop dynamical systems to be asymptotically stable and satisfy H-infinity disturbance attenuation level and suspension performance constraints. Using Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model control method, T-S fuzzy models are established for uncertain vehicle active suspension systems considering the desired suspension performances. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the existence conditions of state-feedback and output-feedback sampled-data controllers are obtained by solving an optimization problem. Simulation results for active vehicle suspension systems with uncertainty are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Sampled-Data Control for Uncertain Vehicle Suspension Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342225800010"}
