We show that if a rational relation is both alpha- and alpha '-synchronous for two different numbers alpha- and alpha ', then it is recognizable. We give a synchronization algorithm for alpha-synchronous transducers. We also prove the closure under boolean operations and composition of alpha-synchronous relations.
