In the BFM energy markets, the buyers (or loads) and the sellers (or generators) submit their bids and offers on a daily basis. The loads and generators could employ intelligent software agents to trade energy in BC markets on their behalves. Since each agent attempts to choose the best bid/offer in the market, conflict of interests might happen. In this work, the trading of energy in BC markets is modeled and solved using Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. The Stackelberg equation concept is used for the match making among load and generator agents. Then to overcome the negotiation limited time problems (it is assumed that a limited time is given to each generator-load pairs to negotiate and make an agreement), a Fuzzy SARSA Learning (FSL) method is used. The fuzzy feature of FSL helps the agent cope with continuous characteristics of the environment and also prevents it from the curse of dimensionality. The performance of the FSL (compared to other well-known traditional negotiation techniques, such as time-dependent and imitative techniques) is illustrated through simulation studies. The case study simulation results show that the FSL based agent could achieve more profits compared to the agents using other reviewed techniques in the BC energy market. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
