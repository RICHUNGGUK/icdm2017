Recently, there are attempts to extent the use of rough set theory to ordinal decision making in which decisions are made on ordering of objects through assigning them to ordinal categories. Attribute reduction is one of the problems that is studied under such ordinal decision situations. In this paper we examine some of the proposed approaches to find ordinal reducts and present a new perspective and approach to the problem based on ordinal consistency.", "paper_title": "Reduction of attributes in ordinal decision systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100060"}
