In this paper, we integrate texture and haze features by applying Laws masks to the image represented in YCbCr color space, and use these features of a patch with its neighborhood information to determine hand and non-hand regions by support vector machine (SVM). Compared with other methods, our algorithm demonstrated robustness to changing illumination and a complex environment and we obtain a relatively clear hand shape with an average accuracy of 94.96%. The images in our experiments are taken with popular mobile phones in our laboratory.", "paper_title": "Complex Background Palm Segmentation using SVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000369374300033"}
