The notion of a cluster is introduced as a basic architectural element; each cluster can select four operation modes with different levels of spatial redundancy and area efficiency. We evaluate the aging effect due to negative bias temperature instability and illustrate that periodically alternating active cells with resting ones will greatly mitigate the effects of the aging process with a negligible power overhead. The area of circuits that are added for immunity to soft errors and for mitigating aging effects is 29.3% of the proposed reconfigurable device. A fault-tolerance evaluation of a Viterbi decoder mapped on the architecture suggests that there is a considerable tradeoff between reliability and area overhead. Finally, we design and fabricate a test chip that contains a 4x8 cluster array in a 65-nm process and demonstrate its immunity to soft errors. Accelerated tests using an alpha particle foil showed that the mean time to failure and failure in time are well characterized with the number of sensitive bits and that our architecture can trade off soft error immunity with the area of implementation.", "paper_title": "Implementing Flexible Reliability in a Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000326107500001"}
