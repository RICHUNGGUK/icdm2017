In this paper, we show that for general constraint-satisfaction problems, SP may not be reducible from BP. We also establish the conditions under which such a reduction is possible. Along our development, we present a unification of the existing SP algorithms in terms of a probabilistically interpretable iterative procedure - weighted probabilistic token passing.", "paper_title": "Is SP BP?", "paper_id": "WOS:000277880200040"}
