We present a deterministic algorithm that computes the zeta function and hence the number of points of such a curve E in time quasi-quadratic in n. An older algorithm having the same time complexity uses the canonical lift of E, whereas our algorithm uses rigid cohomology combined with a deformation approach. An implementation in small odd characteristic turns Out to give very good results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
