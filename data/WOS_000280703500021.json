It provides several advanced and unique features within the framework of a semi-automated modeling process that can be performed by homology and ab initio with or without electron density maps. Those include the interactive editing of a secondary structure and a searchable, embedded library of annotated tertiary structures. Assemble helps users with performing recurrent and otherwise tedious tasks in structural RNA research.", "paper_title": "Assemble: an interactive graphical tool to analyze and build RNA architectures at the 2D and 3D levels", "paper_id": "WOS:000280703500021"}
