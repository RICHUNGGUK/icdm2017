In this study, to reduce the complexity of hardware, the coil voltage signal was not filtered but measured in the form of a duty cycle by the eCAP port of DSP (TMS320F28335). A mathematical model was established to provide the relationship between rotor position, current ripple, and duty cycle. Theoretical analysis of the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the coil current at the switching frequency was presented using Fourier series, Jacobi-Anger identity, and Bessel function. Experimental results showed that the time-varying duty cycle causes infinite side frequencies around the switching frequency. The side frequency interval depends on the varying frequency of the duty cycle. Rotor position can be calculated by measuring the duty cycle and demodulating the coil current ripple. With this self-sensing strategy, the rotor system supported by AMBs can steadily rotate at a speed of 3000 r/min.", "paper_title": "Self-sensing active magnetic bearing using real-time duty cycle", "paper_id": "WOS:000323204200002"}
