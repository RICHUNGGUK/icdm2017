To divided into two subsystems to achieve asymptotic stability by decoupled method for a class of fourth-order nonlinear system. The fuzzy-neural network (FNN) is the main regulator controller, which is used to approximate an ideal computational controller. The compensation controller is designed to compensate for the difference between the ideal computational controller and the FNN controller. A tuning methodology is derived to update weight parts of the FNN. Using Lyapunov law, we derive the decoupled sliding-mode control law and the related parameters adaptive law of FNN. Finally, the decoupled sliding-mode with fuzzy-neural network control (DSMFNNC) is used to control three highly nonlinear systems and confirms the validity of the proposed approach. The method can control one-input and multi-output nonlinear systems efficiently. Using this approach, the response of system will converge faster than that of previous reports. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
