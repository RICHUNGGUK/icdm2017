These include scalability, flexibility and robustness to failures. This paper considers pattern formation and reconfigurability in a multi-robot system using a new control algorithm developed through bifurcating potential fields. It is shown how various patterns can be achieved autonomously through a simple free parameter change, with the stability of the system proven to ensure that desired behaviours always occur.
