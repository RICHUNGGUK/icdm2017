The face completion algorithm proposed in this paper includes three main procedures: 1) sparse representation for partially occluded face classification; 2) image-based data mining; and 3) graph Laplace (GL) for face image completion. The novel part of the proposed framework is GL, as named from graphical models and the Laplace equation, and can achieve a high-quality repairing of damaged or occluded faces. The relationship between the GL and the traditional Poisson equation is proven. We apply our face repairing algorithm to produce completed faces, and use face recognition to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the GL method for occluded face completion.", "paper_title": "Graph Laplace for Occluded Face Completion and Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000293692300022"}
