Meanwhile, wireless virtualization enables abstraction and sharing of infrastructure and radio spectrum resources in wireless networks. Both in-band FDR and wireless virtualization are promising technologies for 5G cellular networks. In this article, we first give a brief survey of them to present their basic ideas, enabling technologies, characteristics, and so on. Then we propose a virtual resource management architecture for in-band FDR networks, where multiple service providers and multiple mobile network operators coexist. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "In-Band Full-Duplex Relaying for 5G Cellular Networks with Wireless Virtualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000366138800010"}
