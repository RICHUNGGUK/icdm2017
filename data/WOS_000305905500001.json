The paper presents some key parameters such as the influence area of the mainstream media, the average influence of the mainstream media, the average self-persisting ability of agents and etc. Simulation results on a small-world networks show that the less the average self-persisting capability of the agents is, the easier the guidance of the media will be. The stronger the average influence of the main stream media is, the easier the mainstream media guides the consensus. These results reflect the formation law of the network consensus and are consistent approximately with the real circumstance.", "paper_title": "STUDY ON THE MODEL OF CONSENSUS FORMATION IN INTERNET BASED ON THE DIRECTED GRAPH", "paper_id": "WOS:000305905500001"}
