The tissue temperature evolution over time is classically described by Pennes' bioheat transfer equation which is generally solved by a finite difference method. In this paper we will present a method where the bioheat transfer equation can be algebraically solved after a Fourier transformation over the space coordinates. As an example, we implemented this method for the simulation of a percutaneous high intensity ultrasound hepatocellular carcinoma curative treatment and compared it with the finite difference method and experimental data.
