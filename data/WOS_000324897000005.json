However, the bond performance between the rebar and concrete and the range of stress transfer between the two are still not well understood. The purpose of this study is to study the bond performance and failure mechanisms between reinforcement and concrete around an anchorage zone in a structural element. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, simulations were carried out by 3D RBSM (Rigid Body Spring Model). This approach divided a problem of interest into elements, namely concrete and steel elements. And to simulate the failure of anchorage of RC, the steel element size is set according to the geometry complexity of the reinforcing bar. By using this method, two simulation cases of anchorage failure were carried out. Findings - This paper shows that simulations demonstrated good agreement with experimental data in terms of anchorage capacity, crack pattern, and failure mode. This indicates that RBSM analysis can simulate the failure behavior governed by complex cracks. Originality/value - This paper indicates the analytical approach to investigate the anchorage performance of RC.", "paper_title": "Investigating the anchorage performance of RC by using three-dimensional discrete analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000324897000005"}
