In our approach, the multiple time-delay analogue transfer function matrix with multiple input-output time delays is minimally realised using a continuous-time state-space model. For deriving an explicit form of the optimal digital controller, the realised continuous-time multiple input-output time-delay system is discretised, and an extended high-order discrete-time state-space model is constructed for discrete-time LQR design. To derive a low-order optimal digital observer for the multiple input-output time-delay system, the multiple time-delay state obtained from the multiple time-delay outputs is discretised. Then, the well-known duality concept is employed to design an optimal digital observer using the low-order discretised multiple input time-delay system together with the newly discretised multiple time-delay state. The proposed approach is restricted to multiple time-delay systems where multiple time delays arise only in the input and output, and not in the state.", "paper_title": "Optimal digital controller and observer design for multiple time-delay transfer function matrices with multiple input-output time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000254070200002"}
