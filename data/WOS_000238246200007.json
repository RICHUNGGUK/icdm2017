It incorporates a highly specialized crossover operator, a fast MinLA heuristic used to create the initial population and a local search operator based on a fine tuned Simulated Annealing algorithm. Its performance is investigated through extensive experimentation over well known benchmarks and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Memetic algorithms for the MinLA problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000238246200007"}
