A case study reported in the literature, which compared pavement structures with virgin materials as well as industrial by-products such as coal ash, crushed concrete waste, and granulated blast-furnace slag, was examined in the context of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) using the proposed approach. The environmental loadings assessed during the life cycle of the pavement structures included natural raw materials and secondary products, energy and fuel consumption, emissions of carbon dioxide (), nitrogen oxides (), sulphur dioxide (), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO) and particles, dust emissions, compounds leaching into the soil, and noise. The proposed qualitative decision approach to life cycle-based environmental impact assessment, similar to lexicographic methods in MCDA, relies purely on the qualitative relative importance preferences specified by the decision maker and logical inference. The decision procedure employs dominance testing using the aggregated relative importance preferences to identify which pavement design alternatives dominate the others.
