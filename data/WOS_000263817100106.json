In the first step, the original satellite controllers, two classical linearized controllers, are Superseded by two fuzzy controllers. The objective is to obtain faster convergent time and lower steady-state error. The two fuzzy controllers will be consolidated to form one fuzzy controller in the next step, to obtain the same effectiveness of control. To demonstrate a fuzzy controller's performance, interference to disturb the attitude stabilization is added during the simulation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
