The system, based on \"one-to-one\" coordination, minimizes the probability that any event happens in the area without being detected and ensures periodic communication between UAVs. A set of simulations are presented to validate the applicability of the approach and its most relevant features: convergence, robustness with dynamic teams, fault-tolerance and finite information sharing time. It is also shown that \"one-to-one\" coordination for all the pairs of neighbors allows to obtain an efficient coordination scheme for the whole team to accomplish the area surveillance mission without any central unit.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Large Area Surveillance with a Team of Aerial Mobile Robots for Long Endurance Missions", "paper_id": "WOS:000312642600023"}
