In this study, network-induced transmission delays and packet dropouts are taken into simultaneous consideration. By the improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, a less-conservative delay-dependent condition is proposed for the stability analysis of the resulting closed-loop system. Furthermore, the sufficient condition under which the guaranteed cost controller exists is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities, and the suboptimum solution is obtained by a cone complementarity linearization algorithm. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy-Model-Based Quantized Guaranteed Cost Control of Nonlinear Networked Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000355764700007"}
