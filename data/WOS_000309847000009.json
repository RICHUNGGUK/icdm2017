With an efficient wavelength converter allocation, more converters could be placed at nodes with higher degrees of contentions among bursts for wavelengths on the output links, so that the converters can be fully utilized to reduce the burst loss probability, an important quality of service (QoS) metric in OBS networks. In this paper, we propose a converter allocation algorithm and prove the algorithm's optimality in minimizing the burst loss probability. For the burst loss estimation in the algorithm, we develop a link model which takes into consideration a phenomenon unique to OBS called the streamline effect. The streamline effect has a significant impact on the burst loss performance in OBS networks. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm considering the streamline effect is verified through simulation results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
