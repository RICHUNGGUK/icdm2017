In most cases, the model exhibits free flow, jam, and phase separation phenomenon. Nevertheless, when the slow-to-start parameter p = 0, and traffic light parameter tau = 3 or 5, it is found that phase separation phenomenon does not occur. We have explained this via the evolution process from a designed regular initial configuration. Moreover, it is also found that the free flow self-organizes into grid-like structure when tau is large and the slow-to-start parameter 0 < p < 1. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
