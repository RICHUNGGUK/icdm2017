The design methodology defines the robust stability and robust performance regions in the k(p)-k(i) (PI controller coefficients) plane using the Kharitonov theorem. In the control system design procedure, a nonlinear induction motor is modeled as an uncertain linear model. The procedure of modeling the uncertainties is presented. The required scientific foundations for designing a robust PI controller are also introduced in the general case while the necessary equations are derived. In the final step, the design procedure for a special motor is presented thoroughly. The simulation results indicate the efficiency of the method.", "paper_title": "Robust speed controller design for induction motors based on IFOC and Kharitonov theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000356355100018"}
