Optimization parameters have been determined by Lagrange's multipliers method-inequality constraint functions. Total mass of the construction has been selected as the objective function. Criterions of buckling (general buckling of the bracing column, local buckling of the chord and local buckling of the bracing diagonal) and criterion of deformation are used as the constraint functions. Numerical examples are performed by usage of the obtained theoretical solutions.", "paper_title": "Optimum design of lattice-columns for buckling", "paper_id": "WOS:000283362500007"}
