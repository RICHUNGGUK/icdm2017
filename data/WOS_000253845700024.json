The method has four steps. Firstly, multidimensional scaling (MDS) is used to flatten each submesh consisting of one vertex and its direct neighbours on the 3D triangular mesh. Secondly, an optimal method is used to compute the linear reconstructing weights of each vertex with respect to its neighbours. Thirdly, a spectral decomposition method is used to obtain initial 2D parameterization coordinates. Fourthly, the initial coordinates are rotated and scaled to minimize the distance errors. It is demonstrated that this method can be used for texture mapping. Analyses and examples show the effectiveness of this parameterization method compared with alternatives. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
