Assuming the availability of three vanishing points in general position in the given views, we set up an affine coordinate system in which the static and moving points are reconstructed and the translations of the dynamic objects are recovered. We then describe how to synthesize new views corresponding to a completely new camera specified in the affine space with new translations for the dynamic objects. As the extent of the synthesized scene is restricted by the availability of corresponding points, we use a voxel-based volumetric scene reconstruction scheme to obtain a scene model and synthesize views of the entire scene. We present experimental results to validate our technique.", "paper_title": "View synthesis of scenes with multiple independently translating objects from uncalibrated views", "paper_id": "WOS:000235772300047"}
