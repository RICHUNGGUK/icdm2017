The two-dimensional graphical representation avoids loss of information accompanying alternative 2D and 3D representation in which the curve standing for RNA structure overlaps and intersects itself. And we use the 2DR-Curve of RNA secondary structure with the examination of similarities/dissimilarities among nine species based on invariant inv and eigenvalue of the quotient matrices of the 2DR-Curve.", "paper_title": "On 2D graphical representation of RNA secondary structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000248087300015"}
