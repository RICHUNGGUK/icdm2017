Parallel reading of multiple detectors arranged around a tissue cross section enables capturing data for generating images of this plane within micro-seconds. Dedicated small animals scanners and handheld systems using 1-D cylindrically focused ultrasound transducer arrays have demonstrated real-time cross-sectional imaging and high in-plane resolution. Yet, the resolution achieved along the axis perpendicular to the focal plane, i.e., the elevation resolution, is determined by the focusing capacities of the detector and is typically lower than the in-plane resolution. Herein, we investigated whether deconvolution of the sensitivity field of the transducer could lead to tangible image improvements. We showcase the findings on experimental measurements from phantoms and animals and discuss the features and the limitations of the approach in improving resolution along the elevation dimension.", "paper_title": "Volumetric Optoacoustic Imaging With Multi-Bandwidth Deconvolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000334667000002"}
