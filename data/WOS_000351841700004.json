Our empirical research shows that the convergence very quick. It usually takes less than 10 reductions to bring the inconsistency of the pairwise comparisons matrix below the assumed threshold of 1/3 (sufficient for most applications). We believe that this is the first Monte Carlo study demonstrating such results for the convergence speed of inconsistency reduction in pairwise comparisons.", "paper_title": "Fast Convergence of Distance-based Inconsistency in Pairwise Comparisons", "paper_id": "WOS:000351841700004"}
