The ciphers proposed by Biham and Anderson are based on one stream cipher and one hash function. Good properties of the primitives may ensure good properties of the block cipher. In particular, Biham and Anderson are able to prove that their ciphers are immune to any efficient known-plaintext key-recovery attack that can use as input only one plaintext-ciphertext pair. Our contribution is showing that these ciphers are actually immune to any efficient known-plaintext key-recovery attack that can use as input any number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs. We are able to get this improvement by using slightly different hypotheses on the primitives. We also discuss the attack by Morin (1996).", "paper_title": "On the provable security of BEAR and LION schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000297864100007"}
