Several new sufficient conditions are presented to ascertain the uniqueness of the equilibrium point and the global asymptotic stability of the neural network. It is noted that the results herein require neither the smoothness of the behaved function, or the activation function nor the boundedness of the activation function. In addition. from theoretical analysis, it is found that the condition for ensuring the global asymptotic stability of the neural network also implies the uniqueness of equilibrium. The obtained results improve many earlier ones and are easy to apply. Some simulation results are shown to substantiate the theoretical results. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
