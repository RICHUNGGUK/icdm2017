However, it is not known that performance of any protocol is superior. Hence, this paper evaluates performance of LnCP (Living network Control Protocol) by LG Electronics and LonWorks by Echelon. For this purpose, we have developed simulation model using state diagram of LonWorks and LnCP, and simulation conditions through analysis of message to be generated in the smart home. Also, we evaluate performance, Such as maximum transmission delay and mean transmission delay, of both protocols. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
