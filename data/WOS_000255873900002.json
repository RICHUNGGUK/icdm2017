We show how structurally complex concurrent behaviours can be modelled by relational structures (X subset of), where X is a set (of event occurrences), and (interpreted as commutativity) and (interpreted as weak causality) are binary relations on X. The paper is a continuation of the approach initiated in Gaifman and Pratt (Proceedings of LICS'87, pp 72-85, 1987), Lamport (J ACM33:313-326, 1986), Abraham et al. ( Semantics for concurrency, workshops in computing. Springer, Heidelberg, pp 311-323, 1990) and Janicki and Koutny (Lect Notes Comput Sci 506: 59-74, 1991), substantially developed in Janicki and Koutny (Theoretical Computer Science 112:5-52, 1993) and Janicki and Koutny (Acta Informatica 34:367-388, 1997), and recently generalized in Guo and Janicki (Lect Notes Comput Sci 2422:178-191, 2002) and Janicki (Lect Notes Comput Sci 3407:84-98, 2005). For the first time the full model for the most general case is given.", "paper_title": "Relational structures model of concurrency", "paper_id": "WOS:000255873900002"}
