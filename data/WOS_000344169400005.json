However, accurately predicting the effect of frequency scaling on system performance is a challenging problem in real environments. In this paper, we propose a realistic DVFS performance prediction method, and a practical DVFS control policy (eDVFS) that aims to minimize total energy consumption in multi-core platforms. We also present power consumption estimation models for CPU and DRAM by exploiting a hardware energy monitoring unit. We implemented eDVFS in Linux, and our evaluation results show that eDVFS can save a substantial amount of energy compared with Linux \"on-demand\" CPU governor in diverse environments.", "paper_title": "Energy-centric DVFS controlling method for multi-core platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000344169400005"}
