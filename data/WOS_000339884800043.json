Spectroscopic constants, potential energy curves, wavefunctions, and Mulliken population analysis are given. The ground state of ReB is of X-5 Sigma(+) symmetry (R-e= 1.817 angstrom,omega(e)=.909 cm(-1), and mu = 2.87 D), giving rise to a Omega= 0(+) ground state after including spin-orbit coupling.", "paper_title": "The low-lying electronic states of ReB", "paper_id": "WOS:000339884800043"}
