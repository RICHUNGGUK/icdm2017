We obtain the following results: (i) for m > 51 identical machines, we give a 1.5-competitive online algorithm with a buffer of size inverted right perpendicular1.5minverted left perpendicular; (ii) for three identical machines, we give an optimal online algorithm with a buffer size six, better than the previous nine; (iii) for rn uniform machines, using a buffer of size m, we improve the competitive ratio from 2 + epsilon to 2 - 1/m + epsilon, where epsilon > 0 is sufficiently small and en is a constant.", "paper_title": "ONLINE MINIMUM MAKESPAN SCHEDULING WITH A BUFFER", "paper_id": "WOS:000341493500001"}
