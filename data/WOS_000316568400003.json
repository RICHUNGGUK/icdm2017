We use a concept that it is known in the literature as the index of maximum and minimum level (IMAM). This index uses distance measures and other techniques that are very useful for decision making. In this paper, it is suggested a generalization by using generalized and quasi-arithmetic means. As a result, it is obtained the generalized and quasi-arithmetic weighted IMAM (GWIMAM and quasi-WIMAM) and the generalized ordered weighted averaging IMAM (GOWAIMAM) and the quasi-OWAIMAM operator. The main advantage is that it provides a parameterized family of aggregation operators that includes a wide range of special cases such as the generalized IMAM and the OWAIMAM. Thus, the decision maker may take decisions according to his degree of optimism and considering ideals in the decision process. We also develop an application of the new approach in a decision-making problem regarding product selection.", "paper_title": "A Method for Decision Making Based on Generalized Aggregation Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000316568400003"}
