Firstly, the PCTS is transformed into a series of synthesized images by compression and conversion, so the isotherm extraction can be transformed into the segmentation of a series of synthesized images. Secondly, a virtual illumination model is constructed to eliminate the glisten of the aerocraft model. In order to get the parameters of virtual illumination model, a coordination-optimization method is employed and all parameters are obtained according to the similarity constraint. Finally, the proving isotherms are gained after the threshold coefficients are compensated. The eventual results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed segmentation method.
