This phenomenon has major consequences on the way the biochemical particles behave. Chaotic advection leads to a peculiar filamentary particle distribution, which in turn creates a favorable environment for particle reactions. Furthermore, we argue that the enhanced stretching dynamics induced by chaos can lead to the activation of platelets, particles involved in the thrombus formation. In particular, we vary the size of both stenoses and aneurysms, and model them under resting and exercising conditions. We show that the filamentary particle distribution, governed by the fractal skeleton, depends on the size of the vessel wall irregularity, and investigate how it varies under resting or exercising conditions.
