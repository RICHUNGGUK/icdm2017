In this paper, the bit representation of granular computing and inclusion measures are used to analyze three soft rules of association rules, decision rules and extensional functional dependencies, and their measures relationships are studied as well. Concretely, some basic concepts were given. The support and the confidence of association rules, the degree of functional dependencies on the decision rules and the degree of extensional functional dependencies are discussed respectively. The measures relationships among the three soft rules are investigated by inclusion measures and granular computing. As a consequence, the united model of these measures is established.", "paper_title": "The measures relationships study of three soft rules based on granular computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500053"}
