As the wireless channel conditions vary over time, dynamic selection of bitrate and corresponding video quality will reduce the risk of harmful packet loss. The paper investigates choice of stream-switching with Secondary SP-frames or SI-frames relative to the selection of quantization parameter (QP) values. To control the switching points at the WiMAX server, the proposed scheme applies a feedback mechanism that monitors packet loss. As an additional suggestion, the paper considers an adaptive ARQ scheme to protect switching frames against packet loss. In summary, the broadband wireless streaming system gives more protection to higher quality video, reduces delay and packet loss, and improves received video quality. In particular, for the QP values selected, results show that increased quality primary-switching frames together with SI frames bring a significant gain in video quality compared with other switching schemes with secondary SP-frames. The other schemes in turn show an improvement to using 'no switching' when streaming takes place over a typical WiMAX channel with burst errors. Link delay is also reduced.", "paper_title": "Channel adaptive video stream switching for broadband wireless links", "paper_id": "WOS:000295040000008"}
