In the example of a multi-elevator dispatching problem, fixed-length DNA strands are used in representing the nodes and costs, where the costs are varied by the melting temperature of DNA strands. The optimal solution to a 6-story 2-elevator dispatching problem is searched by biochemical techniques based on the thermodynamic properties of designed DNA strands. This research has shown the potential of bio-soft computing solving the engineering applications, and could be implemented in the future bio-systems.", "paper_title": "Bio-soft computing with fixed-length DNA to a group control optimization problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000249921500002"}
