The use of component based geometry is a key idea of the concept. Multiple level-set functions that are solved separately represent different moving interfaces. A fast assembly procedure provides a combined level-set function which contains all relevant information for the reconstruction of the interfaces on the flow grid. This allows a consistent and accurate treatment of overlapping interfaces and topological changes. A high flexibility and robustness are thus introduced to the method and the preprocessing effort for complex setups is minimized. The accuracy of the intersection information that is reconstructed from the level set representation is shown to be comparable or even superior to a triangulation based reconstruction, depending on the interpolation scheme that is used for the computation of the level-set function on the corner vertices. Regarding the total computing time that is required for the-respective interface representation, i.e., including level set transport and reconstruction of the intersection information, the level-set based approach is found to be faster than the triangulation based approach with an appropriately resolved surface triangulation.
