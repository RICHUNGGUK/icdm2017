It is found that for some parameters the BTT missile can be controlled by a decoupled way, especially for stabilizability and LQR control. However, for some others, the BTT missile cannot be decoupled and a coupled control method is needed. Therefore, for a practical flight control system, the decouplability should be studied before giving a decoupled control method. In addition, in order to avoid the disadvantages of LQR control method, an improved H-infinity controller design method is given. Combined with tracking control problem, a new H-infinity control method is established for trajectory tracking.", "paper_title": "On decoupled or coupled control of bank-to-turn missiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000353818200007"}
