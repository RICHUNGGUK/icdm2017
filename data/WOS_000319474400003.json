First, for an arbitrary closed subset V of [0,1] containing both 0 and 1, the compactness theorem for the Godel logic G(V) is investigated. Next, following Cintula and Navara (2004, Fuzzy sets and systems, 143, 59-73) and Tavana et al. (2012, Logic J. IGPL, 20, 254-265), for any subset K of [0,1], the notions of K-satisfiability and K-compactness are introduced for the standard first-order Godel logic G(R). It is shown that whenever K is closed, the K-compactness fails for G(R) if and only if K is infinitely countable and 1 is not an element of K.", "paper_title": "Compactness in first-order Godel logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000319474400003"}
