Based on this theorem, we might develop efficient heuristic algorithms for solving the integral rectangle packing problem. In fact, as a vague conjecture, this theorem has been implicitly mentioned with different appearances by many people for a long time.", "paper_title": "Corner occupying theorem for the two-dimensional integral rectangle packing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000310226800005"}
