It is shown that the method is conditionally stable and it has inherent algorithmic damping, algorithmic period error and algorithmic amplitude decay. However for discretized structural models, it is relatively easy for this time integration scheme to satisfy the stability conditions and required accuracy. Based on the above results, the optimum values of the truncation order L and bisection order N are presented. The Gauss quadrature method is used to improve the accuracy of the Precise Time Step Integration Method. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to show the feasibility of this improvement method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
