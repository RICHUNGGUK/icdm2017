To achieve suitable reliability, the fault-tolerance of distributed systems must be studied. One of the most important issues surrounding fault-tolerance is the Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem. The goal of BA is to achieve a common agreement among fault-free processors even where faults persist. Likewise, fault diagnosis agreement (FDA) the purpose of which is to cause each fault-free processor to detect/locate a common set of faulty processors should be considered. In general, the FDA protocols need [(n - 1)/3] + 2 rounds of message exchange to detect/locate the faulty components even if the small of number of faulty processors exists. The number of messages results in a large protocol overhead. In this study, the FDA problem is solved early by an evidence-based fault diagnosis protocol that uses the minimum number of rounds characterized by dual failure of processors. In addition, the proposed protocol can detect/locate the maximum number of faulty processors in a network. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
