In order to maximize the expected long-run average profit, a random fuzzy EOQ model is constructed. Since it is almost impossible to find an analytic method to solve the proposed model, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on the random fuzzy simulation is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed algorithm is illustrated by a numerical example.", "paper_title": "Random fuzzy EOQ model with imperfect quality items", "paper_id": "WOS:000259099800005"}
