The new scheme is based on the use of a continuous bounce-back boundary condition, as combined with a dynamic constitutive relation between the flow pressure at the wall and the resulting wall deformation. The method is demonstrated for the case of two-dimensional (axisymmetric) pulsatile flows, showing clear evidence of elastic wave propagation of the wall perturbation in response to the fluid pressure. The extension of the present two-dimensional axisymmetric formulation to more general three-dimensional geometries is currently under investigation.", "paper_title": "MODELING FLUID FLOWS IN DISTENSIBLE TUBES FOR APPLICATIONS IN HEMODYNAMICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000318526000006"}
