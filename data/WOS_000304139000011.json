The method locates concave creases and seams using a set of concavity-sensitive scalar fields. These fields are computed by solving a Laplacian system with a novel concavity-sensitive weighting scheme. Isolines sampled from the concavity-aware fields naturally gather at concave seams, serving as good cutting boundary candidates. In addition, the fields provide sufficient information allowing efficient evaluation of the candidate cuts. We perform a summarization of all field gradient magnitudes to define a score for each isoline and employ a score-based greedy algorithm to select the best cuts. Extensive experiments and quantitative analysis have shown that the quality of our segmentations are better than or comparable with existing state-of-the-art more complex approaches.", "paper_title": "Mesh Segmentation with Concavity-Aware Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000304139000011"}
