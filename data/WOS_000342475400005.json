Let dilation(f) = max{dist(H)(f(x), f(y)) : xy is an element of E(G)} where dist(H)(v, w) is the distance between vertices v and w of H. Now let B(G, H) = min(f){dilation(f)}, over all such maps f. The parameter B(G, H) is a generalization of the classic and well studied \"bandwidth\" of G, defined as B(G, P(n)), where P(n) is the path on n points and n = vertical bar V(G)vertical bar. Let [a(1) x a(2) x ... x a(k)] be the k-dimensional grid graph with integer values 1 through a(i) in the i'th coordinate. In this paper, we study B(G, H) in the case when G = [a(1) x a(2) x ... x a(k)] and H is the hypercube Q(n) of dimension n = [log(2)(vertical bar V(G)vertical bar)], the hypercube of smallest dimension having at least as many points as G. Our main result is that B([a(1) x a(2) x ... x a(k)], Q(n)) <= 3k, provided a(i) >= 2(22) for each 1 <= i <= k. For such G, the bound 3k improves on the previous best upper bound 4k + O(1). Our methods include an application of Knuth's result on two-way rounding and of the existence of spanning regular cyclic caterpillars in the hypercube. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
