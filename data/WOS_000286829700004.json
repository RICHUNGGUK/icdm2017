Despite the inherent difficulties of non-convexity and non-separability of variables in the original optimization problem, we are still able to obtain a decoupled and dual-decomposable convex formulation by applying an appropriate transformation and introducing some new variables. The objective is accomplished by the interaction and coordination among three sub-algorithms of the algorithm through the congestion prices. The convergence properties of the three sub-algorithms are also proved. Simulation results illustrate several other desirable properties of the proposed algorithm, including the impacts of node mobility and path and packet losses on convergence and robustness. This work is a preliminary attempt towards a systematic approach to jointly designing a congestion control sub-algorithm and a power control sub-algorithm coupled with a spectrum allocation sub-algorithm.", "paper_title": "Distributed algorithms for resource allocation of physical and transport layers in wireless cognitive ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286829700004"}
