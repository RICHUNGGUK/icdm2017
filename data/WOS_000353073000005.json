It was recently shown that this problem is fixed parameter tractable, where k is the parameter. In this paper, we further generalize this problem to one with the parity constraints, and show the fixed parameter tractability: 1. For a parameter k, there exists a fixed-parameter algorithm that either finds a vertex set X of size k such that G - X has no S-cycle of even length, or concludes that such a vertex set does not exist. 2. For a parameter k, there exists a fixed-parameter algorithm that either finds a vertex set X of size k such that G - X has no S-cycle of odd length, or concludes that such a vertex set does not exist.
