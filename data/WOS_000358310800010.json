We explore how this can be applied to three garbage collection scenarios in Jikes RVM: parallel copying, concurrent copying and bitmap marking. We demonstrate gains in concurrent copying speed over traditional synchronisation mechanisms of 48-101%. We also show how similar but portable performance gains can be achieved through software transactional memory techniques. We identify the architectural overhead of capturing sufficient work for transactional execution as a major stumbling block to the effective use of transactions in the other scenarios.", "paper_title": "Exploring Garbage Collection with Haswell Hardware Transactional Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000358310800010"}
