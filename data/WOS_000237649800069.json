In this paper, we introduce a history length adjustable gshare predictor for the high-performance embedded processors and show its low-level implementation. Compared to the previous gshare predictor, history length adjustable gshare predictor selectively utilizes the branch history, resulting in substantial improvement in branch prediction accuracy.", "paper_title": "History length adjustable gshare predictor for high-performance embedded processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800069"}
