For the last few years, biometric techniques, especially the ones related to iris recognition, have proven their reliability in providing secure access to shared resources in different domains. Many algorithms have been proposed for implementing the iris recognition biometric techniques. In this paper, we study and compare these proposals and propose an efficient new algorithm for iris recognition.
