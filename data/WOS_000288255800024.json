Current heuristics are not guaranteed to find the exact energy barrier, raising the question whether the energy barrier can be calculated efficiently. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of a simple formulation of the energy barrier problem, in which each base pair contributes an energy of -1 and only base pairs in the initial and final structures may be used on a folding pathway from initial to final structure. We show that this problem is NP-complete.", "paper_title": "NP-completeness of the energy barrier problem without pseudoknots and temporary arcs", "paper_id": "WOS:000288255800024"}
