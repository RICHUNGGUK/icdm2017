The method is based on the Bump-Surfaces concept and is able to deal with robots represented by a translating and rotating rigid body. The proposed approach is applied to car-like robots.", "paper_title": "Two-dimensional motion-planning for nonholonomic robots using the bump-surfaces concept", "paper_id": "WOS:000245521200003"}
