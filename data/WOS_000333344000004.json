We present a promising technique, a smoothed rate truncation method, to overcome the limitations of standard techniques and allow for the derivation of structural properties. We introduce this technique by application to a processor sharing queue with impatient customers that can retry if they renege. We are interested in structural properties of the value function of the system as a function of the arrival rate.", "paper_title": "On structural properties of the value function for an unbounded jump Markov process with an application to a processor sharing retrial queue", "paper_id": "WOS:000333344000004"}
