In this paper we will consider the question of convergence to steady state of the time splitting method applied to k-epsilon turbulence models. This analysis is derived from a properly defined scalar study and is carried out with success for the coupled k-epsilon equations. It is found that the time splitting method does not allow convergence to steady state for any choice of finite values of the time step. Numerical experiments for some typical turbulent compressible flow problems support the fact that the time splitting method is always nonconvergent, while its nonsplitting counterpart is convergent.
