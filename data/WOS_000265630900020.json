As an illumination level and chromaticity change. the eye's subjective white point changes between the display's white point and the ambient light's white point. In this paper. we propose a model that could predict the white point under a mixed adaptation condition including display and illuminant. Finally we verify this model by experimental results.", "paper_title": "A Chromatic Adaptation Model for Mixed Adaptation Conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000265630900020"}
