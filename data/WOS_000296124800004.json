When trying to extend this concept to the fuzzy setting, we observe that the (generalized) definitions fail to be equivalent. In this contribution, we discuss which is the most natural definition of a fuzzy semi-order, and study the hierarchy among the alternative definitions, in particular when using a t-norm without zero divisors.
