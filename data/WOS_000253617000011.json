We define a new family called graded sparse graphs, arising from generically pinned bar-and-joint frameworks, and prove that they also form matroids. We also address several algorithmic problems on graded sparse graphs: Decision, Spanning, Extraction, Components, Optimization, and Extension. We sketch variations on pebble game algorithms to solve them.", "paper_title": "Graded sparse graphs and matroids", "paper_id": "WOS:000253617000011"}
