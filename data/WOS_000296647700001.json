An approach based on Service Oriented Architecture-compliant DEVS (SOAD) and Dynamic Structure DEVS (DSDEVS) modeling approaches is developed to support structural changes in service model composition. To achieve this goal, a broker-executive model is devised based on the broker model defined for SOAD and the executive model defined for DSDEVS. The capability to simulate dynamic services is incorporated to the DEVS-Suite simulator. To demonstrate modeling of dynamic service-based software systems, a real voice communication system and a model of this system have been developed. The importance of enabling simulation-based design for adaptable systems is briefly discussed.", "paper_title": "Simulating adaptive service-oriented software systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000296647700001"}
