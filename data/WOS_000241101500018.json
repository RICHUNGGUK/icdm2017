Such a multi-theoretical perspective, considering user community participation throughout the DL development cycle, supports understanding of the social aspects of DLs and the changing needs of users interacting with DLs. It also helps in determining when and how quality issues can be measured and how potential problems with quality can be prevented.", "paper_title": "What is a successful digital library?", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500018"}
