But ordinary range search queries focus only on a specific type of point objects. For queries which require to retrieve objects of interest locating in a particular region, ordinary range search could not get the expected results. In addition, most existing range search methods need to perform a searching on each road segments within the pre-defined range, which decreases the performance of range search. In this paper, we design a weighted network Voronoi diagram and propose a high-performance multilevel range search query processing that retrieves a set of objects locating in some specified region within the searching range. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm runs very efficiently and outperforms its main competitor.", "paper_title": "Voronoi-based multi-level range search in mobile navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000289739800006"}
