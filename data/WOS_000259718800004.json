It is verified for each of the three basic t-norms T-M, T-P and T-L whether a monotone input-output behaviour is obtained for any monotone rule base, or at least for any monotone smooth rule base. For models applying T-L a monotone input-output behaviour can only be guaranteed if the model has a single input variable. The monotonicity of models with two or more input variables applying T-M cannot be guaranteed for any monotone rule base, whereas when applying T-P monotonicity is only guaranteed for any monotone rule base when using a fuzzy output partition belonging to a restricted class of nine types of fuzzy partitions which contain at most five linguistic values. Finally, it is proved that a monotone input-output behaviour is always obtained for models with a monotone smooth rule base applying T-M when the linguistic output values in the consequents of the rules are defined by trapezoidal or triangular membership functions with intervals of changing membership degree of equal length-a restriction that can easily be bypassed by an auxiliary interpolation procedure-and for models with a monotone smooth rule base applying T-P for any fuzzy output partition.
