For that, one must apply control techniques that closely correlate with our ability to characterize a process. Optical sensors associated with chemometric modeling are considered a natural choice for non-intrusive and high sensitivity measurements. This study focus on wheat flour characterization (usual and mandatory action, widely present on the food industry) using near-infrared, comparing two approaches for spectral region selection: modified CSMWPLS and PSCM/ACO. Spectroscopic data is assayed using a combination of CSMWPLS and variable selection algorithm based on ant colony optimization. Protein prediction results are compared with standards PLS, CSMWPLS and PSCM/ACO models. Prediction capability improved 46% using modified CSMWPLS and PSCM/ACO modeling, confirming the efficiency of the proposed characterization methods and chemometric modeling strategy.
