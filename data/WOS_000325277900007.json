The bi-feature was fused and verified using a support vector machine (SVM) at the feature level. The approach has the advantages of capturing palm images in pegless scenarios with a low cost and low-resolution (100 dpi) digital scanner, and one sensor can capture palmprint bi-feature information. The low-resolution images result in a smaller database. Nine thousand palmprint images were collected from 300 people to verify the validity of the proposed approach. The results showed an accurate classification rate of 99.04%. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach is feasible and effective in palmprint verification. Our findings will help extend palmprint verification technology to security access control systems.", "paper_title": "BI-FEATURE VERIFICATION FOR PALMPRINT IMAGES CAPTURED IN PEGLESS SCENARIOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000325277900007"}
