Similar to the present internet, next generation internet also starts from testbed. There are two kinds of testbeds, testbed networks like CNGI-CERNET2, Internet2, Geant; testbed systems like PlanetLab, NS2. DRAGON-Lab can be viewed as both testbed network and testbed system. DRAGON-Lab is an independent AS (autonomous system) and connected to multiple real networks. On the other hand, DRAGON-Lab integrates many resources of its own, partners' and internet's, so as to provide open service. DRAGON-Lab has a large scale, provides open service, supports remote visualized experiments and programmable experiments. More details will be introduced in this paper.", "paper_title": "DRAGON-Lab - Next generation internet technology experiment platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000260122000019"}
