It is shown that under certain conditions the iterative sequence generated by a PCA converges, at least along a subsequence, to either a local minimizer or a saddle point of the objective function of the algorithm. The convergence performance of more general PCAs is also discussed.", "paper_title": "On the convergence of some possibilistic clustering algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000326691900004"}
