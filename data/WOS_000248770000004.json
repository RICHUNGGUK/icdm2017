The focus is databases for bibliographic utilities, but other related database concerns will be discussed. Problems of satisfying a \"match\" with sufficient flexibility and rigor in an environment of imperfect data are presented, and sources of unintentional variance are discussed.", "paper_title": "Misinformation and bias in metadata processing: Matching in large databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000248770000004"}
