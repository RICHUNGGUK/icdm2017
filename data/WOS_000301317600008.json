For these production processes, it is important to detect collision in advance between assembly blocks or the block and the other facilities like the wire rope and the barge which are carrying the block. The tension of the wire rope also needs to be calculated to check that the maximum value is less than the safety criteria. In this paper, a mathematical model is constructed based on multibody system dynamics considering the external forces such as the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic, wind force, etc. To observe the dynamic motions of the floating crane and the block, and to calculate the tension of the wire rope, the time and event simulations are performed by solving the mathematical model in the computer. For applying the simulations to the various production processes in shipyards, a simulation framework is developed. The simulation framework consists of a simulation kernel, application-specific modules, a simulation coordinator, development tools, and post-processing tools. The simulation kernel manages both DEVS (discrete event system specification) and DTSS (discrete time system specification) to deal with various simulation requests. The application-specific modules provide the functions used in application systems, such as dynamic analysis, collision detection, visualization, wire rope force calculation, hydrostatic force calculation and hydrodynamic force calculation. The simulation coordinator manages the data of the simulation kernel and the application-specific modules. The development tools provide a development process, a scenario manager, and a simulation model generator. The post-processing tools are used to report the simulation results. The examples of block lifting, transportation, turn-over, and assembly simulations are developed based on the framework to show that the framework is useful for the simulations of the production processes using one or more floating cranes.
