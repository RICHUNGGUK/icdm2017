Comparing to previous Shared-risk link groups (SRLG)Disjoint Path Provisioning (SDPP) approach, NSDPP is able to obtain better performance, because in NSDPP some primary path and backup paths of other primary paths can share the common resources if the corresponding rules can be satisfied. Simulation results are shown to be promising. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
