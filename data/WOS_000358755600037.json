Although many studies have investigated this problem, no systematic and valid method for specifying the requirements criteria has been presented in criteria selection stage. The main objective of this paper is to develop a systematic method in order to identify the best candidate for construction project manager selection by using Delphi method and fuzzy linguistic evaluation. The models were validated using a case study of construction project manager selection in a project based company. The results show that the proposed model performs very well in selecting construction project manager and can improve efficiency in decision making process.", "paper_title": "Selection of construction project manager by using Delphi and fuzzy linguistic decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000358755600037"}
