We assess the performance of the various methods by studying the convergence and statistical accuracy obtained for observables that require a large number of stochastic noise vectors, such as the isoscalar nucleon axial charge. The various methods are also examined for the evaluation of sigma-terms where noise reduction techniques specific to the twisted mass formulation can be utilized thus reducing the required number of stochastic noise vectors.
