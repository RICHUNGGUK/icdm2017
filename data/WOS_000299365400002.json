When fast illumination change occurs, background pixels as well as moving object pixels are detected as foreground pixels. To separate detected foreground pixels into moving object pixels and false foreground pixels, we develop a chromaticity difference model and a brightness ratio model that estimates the intensity difference and intensity ratio of false foreground pixels, respectively. These models are based on the proposed illumination change model. Based on experimental results, the. proposed method shows excellent performance under various illumination change conditions while operating in real-time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
