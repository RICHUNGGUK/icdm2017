This paper focuses on debugging digital controllers to be implemented in Field Programmable Gate Arrays or Application Specific Integrated Circuits, which are designed in hardware description languages. Four methods are proposed and described. All of them allow simulation, and two methods also allow emulation-synthesizing the model of the converter to run the complete closed-loop system in actual hardware. The first method consists in using a mixed analog and digital simulator. This is the easiest alternative for the designer, but simulation time can be a problem, specially for long simulations like those necessary in power factor correction or when the controller is very complex, for example, with embedded processors. The alternative is to use pure digital models, generating a digital model of the power converter. Three methods are proposed: real type, float type and fixed point models (in the latter case including hand-coded and automatic-coded descriptions). Float and fixed point models are synthesizable, so emulation is possible, achieving speedups over 20 000. The results obtained with each method are presented, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each one. Apart from that, an analysis of the necessary resolution in the variables is presented, being the main conclusion that 32-bit floating point is not enough for medium and high switching frequencies.", "paper_title": "A Comparison of Simulation and Hardware-in-the-Loop Alternatives for Digital Control of Power Converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000307002700007"}
