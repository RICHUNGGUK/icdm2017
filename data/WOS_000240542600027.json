To facilitate analysis on cost, a new metric-WCOF (Wireless Channel Occupation Frequency), is introduced to measure the average cost per node incurred by a round of broadcast. For simplicity delay is measured by the least number of broadcasts to achieve required RE. Performance of Counter based and distance based schemes are investigated in detail using the new model. Analytical results show the relation between the cost efficiency and delay of broadcast schemes and configuration of network and broadcast parameters. It is proved that the new model can be used to choose proper broadcast scheme and parameters for optimal performance.", "paper_title": "A new model to optimize the cost efficiency of broadcast in mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600027"}
