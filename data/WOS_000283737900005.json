Standard data envelopment analysis models can evaluate the relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) and distinguish efficient ones from inefficient ones. However, when there are more than one efficient DMU, it is impossible to rank all of them solely according to standard efficiency scores. In this paper, a new method for fully ranking all DMUs is proposed, which is based on the combination of each efficient DMU's influence on all the other DMUs and the standard efficiency scores. This method is effective in helping decision makers differentiate all units' performance thoroughly and select the best performer.", "paper_title": "A new DEA-based method for fully ranking all decision-making units", "paper_id": "WOS:000283737900005"}
