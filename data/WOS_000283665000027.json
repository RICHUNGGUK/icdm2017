Rendering of this stored graphical information in a portable and well supported system such as TEX would be useful for researchers preparing documentation and presentations. In addition, since the Render Extension is not yet supported by many applications, it is helpful for such rendering functionality be extended to the more popular CellDesigner annotation as well. Results: SBML2TikZ supports automatic generation of graphics for biochemical models in the popular TEX typesetting system. The library generates a script of TEX macro commands for the vector graphics languages PGF/TikZ that can be compiled into scalable vector graphics described in a model.", "paper_title": "SBML2TikZ: supporting the SBML render extension in LaTeX", "paper_id": "WOS:000283665000027"}
