The main idea of the proposed approach is in process-output prediction based on a coprime-factorized process model. The proposed approach provides a framework to design the control for a wide range of processes such as: higher order, phase non-minimal, unstable and also multivariable. In the paper the coprime-factorized predictive design methodology was studied and implemented on unstable processes with a time-delay which are very difficult to control. The proposed methodology leads to a simple analytical control law, which results in much better performance than previously known control methods.", "paper_title": "Coprime-factorized model predictive control for unstable processes with delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000246756200003"}
