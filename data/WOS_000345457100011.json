Recently, the degree of parallelism and other descriptive complexity details have been found to be relevant when designing parallel simulators running on GPUs. We present here a new way to use the information provided by Sevilla carpets in this context, and a script that allows to generate them automatically from P-Lingua files.", "paper_title": "Sevilla Carpets Revisited: Enriching the Membrane Computing Toolbox", "paper_id": "WOS:000345457100011"}
