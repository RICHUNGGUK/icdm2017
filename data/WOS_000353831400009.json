Reconstruction from color images will keep the colorful appearance, as is beneficial for visually realistic flame modeling. Most of existing color-image-based methods rebuild three density fields from RGB intensities; however, these methods suffer from the color distortion problem due to the high correlation of RGB intensities. A novel method for 3D flame reconstruction using color temperature is presented in this paper. Color-temperature mapping is calculated to avoid color distortion; this method maps the RGB intensities into the color temperature and its joint intensity. We improve the multiplication reconstruction with visual hull restriction so that the energy distribution is more reasonable, which allows avoidance of the impossible zones. Experimental results indicate that our approach is efficient in the visually plausible 3D flame generation and produces better color restorations.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction of three-dimensional flame with color temperature", "paper_id": "WOS:000353831400009"}
