A computer program in Fortran is available to assist in the design of the control chart and the algorithm of the Fortran program is also given. Some useful guidelines are also provided to aid users in choosing parameters for a particular application. Simulation results on the detection performance of the proposed control chart, compared with some other competing methods show that it provides quite robust and satisfactory performance in various cases, including intercept shifts, slope shifts and standard deviation shifts. A real data example from an optical imaging system is employed to illustrate the implementation and the use of the proposed control scheme. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
