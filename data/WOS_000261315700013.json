Design/methodology/approach - The complex adaptive system (CAS) theory has provided one kind analysis method on modeling and simulation for question of the social economic system, which based on the adaptive agent and mutual interaction. In view of this, the authors' expect to use this kind of new research paradigm for reference, and construct the evaluation index systems on national energy security using the integration of CAS theory and pressure-state-response (PSR) conceptual model. Findings - Constructs a set of compound index system of \"six parallel layers, gradually converge, six layers three dimensions three degrees.\" Research limitations/implications - The evaluation index system on national energy security is in the discussion stage at present, and the comparatively systematic or accepted index system has not been established. So the further study on influencing factors and measurement indicator system based on multi-dimension of national energy security, is the emphasis of the continued further research. Practical implications - Constructing the evaluation index system on national energy security integrating PSR conceptual model from the perspective CAS. Originality/value - Divides the carrier of energy security problem's happening into three energy domains (non-renewable energy), and introduces the theory and method of CAS to construct the agent layer to carry on the multi-agent gambling analysis. Simultaneously separately analyses the coal security, the petroleum security as well as the natural gas security using the concept framework of PSR.", "paper_title": "Construction of evaluation index system of national energy security based on CAS theory and PSR model", "paper_id": "WOS:000261315700013"}
