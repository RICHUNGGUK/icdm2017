Due to their simplicity, range-based sensor networks have been widely used. To track a maneuvering target in range-based sensor networks, first, we derive the relationship between the multiple model posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) and the distance from the sensor to the target, which forms the basis of choosing the subset of candidate sensors that may attend the incoming tracking event. Second, we design two optimization strategies under the communication constraint, namely the optimal sensor selection and cluster head selection. Third, we can estimate the state of the maneuvering target by making use of the interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm and predict the model index one time step ahead. Last, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
