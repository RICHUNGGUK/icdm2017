Software products with larger installed bases, and therefore more potential computers to attack, present more appealing targets for malicious agents. One finding is that software firms may profit from increased malicious activity. Software products in a more competitive market are less likely to invest in security, while monopolistic or niche products are likely to be more secure from malicious attack. The results provide insights for IS managers considering enterprise software adoption.", "paper_title": "THE IMPACT OF MALICIOUS AGENTS ON THE ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY", "paper_id": "WOS:000281129800009"}
