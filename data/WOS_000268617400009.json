In particular, Christoffel words, or equivalently pairs of relatively prime nonnegative integers, parametrize the Markoff numbers. It was asked by Frobenius if this parametrization is injective. We answer this conjecture for a particular subclass of these numbers, and show that a special Sturmian sequence of irrational slope determines the order of the Markoff numbers in this subclass.
