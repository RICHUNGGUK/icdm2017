They can be used to satisfy both provisioning delay and low blocking for delay-tolerant applications. Therefore, it seems reasonable that future optical network provisioning systems will provide both mechanisms in hybrid IR/AR scenarios. Nonetheless, such scenarios can increase the blocking of IR if no quality-of-service (QoS) policies are implemented. A solution could be to quantify such blocking performance based on the current network load and implement mechanisms that would act accordingly. However, current blocking analytical models are not able to deal with both IR and AR. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to compute the network-wide blocking performance of different IR/AR classes within the scope of a multiservice framework for optical wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) networks. Specifically, we calculate the blocking on two common optical network scenarios using the fixed-point approximation analysis: on wavelength conversion capable and wavelength-continuity constrained networks. Performance results show that our model provides good accuracy compared to simulation results, even in a scenario with multiple reservation classes defined by different book-ahead times.", "paper_title": "Analytical Blocking Probability Model for Hybrid Immediate and Advance Reservations in Optical WDM Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329995700017"}
