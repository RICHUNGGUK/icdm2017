In this paper, an efficient error concealment algorithm for video transmission is proposed which based on the inter-frame information. The missing blocks are classified into low activity ones and high activity ones by using the motion vector information of the surrounding correctly received blocks. The low activity blocks are concealed by the simple average motion vector (AVMV) method. For the high activity blocks, several closed convex sets are defined, and the method of projections onto convex sets (POCS) is used to recover the missing blocks by combining frequency and spatial domain information. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves improved visual quality of the reconstructed frames with respect to other classical algorithms, as well as better PSNR results.", "paper_title": "An error concealment based on inter-frame information for video transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300078"}
