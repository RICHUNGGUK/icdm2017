The method is based on a new formulation of a point-wise tensor similarity measure, which weights directional and magnitude information differently depending on the type of diffusion. The method is compared to a reference method, which uses normalized mutual information (NMI), calculated either from a fractional anisotropy (FA) map or a T-2-weighted MR image. The registration methods are applied to real and simulated DT-MR images. Visual assessment is done for real data and for simulated data, registration accuracy is defined. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the reference method.", "paper_title": "Affine registration of diffusion tensor MR images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700077"}
