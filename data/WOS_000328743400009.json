S. National Science Board. We compare (a) normalization by counting citations in proportion to the length of the reference list (1/N of references) with (b) rescaling by dividing citation scores by the arithmetic mean of the citation rate of the cluster. Rescaling is analytical and therefore independent of the quality of the attribution to the sets, whereas fractional counting provides an empirical strategy for normalization among sets (by evaluating the between-group variance). By the fairness test of Radicchi and Castellano (2012a), rescaling outperforms fractional counting of citations for reasons that we consider.", "paper_title": "Field-Normalized Impact Factors (IFs): A Comparison of Rescaling and Fractionally Counted IFs", "paper_id": "WOS:000328743400009"}
