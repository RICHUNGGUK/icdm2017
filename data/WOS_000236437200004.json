Jini introduces in a leasing concept that handles partial failure of distributed applications, and also supports service resource allocation. However, current leasing model does not lay a stress on fairness and priority issues on the resource allocation. On the other hand, current lookup service lacks the capability to handle sophisticated service assignment, such as load balance issue, non-functional requirement matching, urgent service request and so on. In this paper, we aim to solve the deficiency described above by providing an architecture, which uses the information contained in resource leases to achieve better resource management.
