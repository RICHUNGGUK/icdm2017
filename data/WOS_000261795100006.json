The restoration is here approached as an optimisation problem, and is solved using an ad-hoc Genetic Algorithm. The distributed algorithm is designed following a pipeline logical structure. The front end is a network of standard workstations with heterogeneous operating systems. The quality of image is appreciable and the computational time is quite low with respect the sequential version.
