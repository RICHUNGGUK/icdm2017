Sites of the lattice, chosen at random, interchange their spin values, provided they are different. The canonical ensemble is generated by performing exchanges according to the Metropolis prescription whereas in the microcanonical ensemble, exchanges are performed as long as the total energy remains constant. A systematic finite size analysis of intensive quantities and a comparison with results obtained from distinct ensembles are performed and the quality of results reveal that the present approach may be an useful tool for the study of phase transitions, specially first-order transitions.
