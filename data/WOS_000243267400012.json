The proposed algorithm uses the displacements of static response and natural frequencies of modal analysis, which are obtained by finite element software ANSYS. There are three different kinds of beam structures to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. These three cases have different boundary conditions and different damage scenarios. From the results, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is efficient in flexural stiffness damage identification for beam-type structures under free of noise condition. Even under the case of noise, the results show that the searched solutions are still in reasonable precision. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
