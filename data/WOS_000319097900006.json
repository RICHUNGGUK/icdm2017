This modality however only provides information about the projected Bone Mineral Density (BMD) while the shape and spatial distribution of the bone determines the strength of the vertebrae. Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) allows for the measurement of the vertebral dimensions and volumetric densities, which have been shown to be able to determine the fracture risk more reliably than DXA. However, for the high cost and high radiation dose, QCT is not used in clinical routine for fracture risk assessment. In this work, we therefore propose a method to reconstruct the 3D shape and density volume of lumbar vertebrae from an anteroposterior (AP) and lateral DXA image used in clinical routine. The method is evaluated for the L2,1,3 and L4 vertebra. Of these vertebrae a statistical model of the vertebral shape and density distribution is first constructed from a large dataset of QCT scans. All three models are then simultaneously registered onto both AP and lateral DXA image. The shape and volumetric BMD at several regions of the reconstructed vertebrae is then evaluated with respect to the ground truth QCT volumes. For the 12, 13 and L4 vertebrae respectively the shape was reconstructed with a mean (2RMS) point-to-surface distance of 1.00 (2.64) mm, 0.93(2.52) mm and 1.34(3.72) mm and a strong correlation (r > 0.82) was found between the trabecular volumetric BMD extracted from the reconstructions and from the same subject QCT scans. These results indicate that the proposed method is able to accurately reconstruct the 3D shape and density volume of the lumbar vertebrae from AP and lateral DXA, which can potentially improve the fracture risk estimation accuracy with respect to the currently used DXA derived areal BMD measurements.
