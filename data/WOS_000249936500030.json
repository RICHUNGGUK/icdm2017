The program works for arbitrarily defined phases and background models. The numerical precisions of kinematic and dynamic ray tracing are optimized to produce traveltime errors under 0.1 s, which is well below the data uncertainty in global seismology. This tolerance level is obtained for an integration step size of about 20 kin for the most common seismic phases. We also give software to compute ellipticity, crustal and topographic corrections and attenuation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
