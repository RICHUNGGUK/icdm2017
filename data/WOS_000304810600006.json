The model is formulated on the cubed-sphere in order to avoid polar singularities. An operator-split Runge-Kutta-Rosenbrock scheme is used to couple the horizontally explicit and vertically implicit discretizations so as to maintain accuracy in time and space and enforce a global CFL condition which is only restricted by the horizontal grid spacing and wave speed. The Rosenbrock approach is linearly implicit and so requires only one matrix solve per column per time step. Using a modified version of the low-speed AUSM(+)-up Riemann solver allows us to construct the vertical Jacobian matrix analytically, and so significantly improve the model efficiency. This model is tested against a series of typical atmospheric flow problems to verify accuracy and consistency. The test results reveal that this approach is stable, accurate and effective at maintaining sharp gradients in the flow. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
