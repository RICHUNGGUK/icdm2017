This corpus focuses on dance scenes (lindy hop, salsa and classical dance), fitness and isolated sequences. 20 dancers and 16 participants were recorded performing respectively 14 dance choreographies and 13 sequences of other human activities. These different multimodal scenes have been captured through a variety of media modalities, including video cameras, depth sensors, microphones, piezoelectric transducers and wearable inertial devices (accelerometers, gyroscopes et magnetometers). These data will be available to download for research purpose.", "paper_title": "TPT-Dance&Actions : un corpus multimodal d'activites humaines", "paper_id": "WOS:000369471700006"}
