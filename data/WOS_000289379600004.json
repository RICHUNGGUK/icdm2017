Thus, clusters of multiple video servers are widely used today to provide better service. How movies are allocated to each server in a cluster is an important and ongoing research topic because the movies are large, and there are so many of them. We have developed a movie allocation algorithm based on the observation that client accesses follow a Zipf distribution. We have developed an algorithm in which servers use their storage to their full capacities, movies are assigned to servers as evenly as possible, servers receive requests as evenly as possible, and all movies are allocated to at least one server.
