Order tracking of acoustic or vibration signal is a well-known technique that can be used for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Unfortunately, most of the conventional order-tracking methods are primarily based on Fourier analysis with the revolution of the machinery. Thus, the frequency smearing effect often arises in some critical conditions. In the present study, the order tracking problem is treated as the tracking of frequency-varying bandpass signals and the order amplitudes can be calculated with high resolution. The order amplitude figures are then used for creating the data bank in the proposed intelligent fault diagnosis system. A fuzzy-logic inference is proposed to develop the diagnostic rules of the data base in the present fault diagnosis system. The experimental works are carried to evaluate the effect of the proposed system for fault diagnosis in a scooter platform under various operation conditions. The experimental results indicated that the proposed expert system is effective for increasing accuracy in fault diagnosis of scooters. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
