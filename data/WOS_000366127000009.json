In an attempt to improve the positioning result in both local positioning accuracy and global convergence probability, this paper proposes a novel MDS-MAP(LF) algorithm, which uses low frequency signal to measure the inter-sensor distance rather than shortest path algorithms. The proposed MDS-MAP(LF) algorithm leverages the propagation feature of low frequency signal to acquire a more precisely two-hop distance. The simulation and analysis results indicate that the accuracy of local positioning is improved by more than 3%. With the use of cluster expansion, MDS-MAP(LF) also shows a better convergence with comparison to the former classical distributed MDS-MAP algorithm.", "paper_title": "Distributed Locating Algorithm MDS-MAP (LF) Based on Low-Frequency Signal", "paper_id": "WOS:000366127000009"}
