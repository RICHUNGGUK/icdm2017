Accurate, efficient, and scalable model for I-edge is developed by finding the key differences between I-edge and main device drain current (I-main). It is found that I-edge has a different sub-threshold slope, body-bias coefficient, and short-channel behavior as compared to I-main. These important effects along with their dependencies on device geometry, bias conditions, and temperature are accounted for in the model. The model is in excellent agreement with experimental data verifying its scalability and readiness for production level usage.", "paper_title": "Modeling STI Edge Parasitic Current for Accurate Circuit Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000358620700007"}
