In this paper, we firstly introduce the interior-outer-set model (IOSM) based on information diffusion theory in detail. Then taking consideration its deficiencies, we represent the diffused-interior-outer-set model (DIOSM) to obtain the possibility-probability distribution (PPD). Based on the PPD, we analyze and calculate the risk results. To illustrate the procedure of the proposed method, we apply DIOSM to describe the flood disaster risk quantitatively in China by using statistical data respectively, such as the time of floods, the number of the deaths as well as the economic losses each year from 1990 to 2009. The outcomes of this research offer new insights and moreover new possibility to carry out an efficient way for various future flood disaster prevention and mitigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
