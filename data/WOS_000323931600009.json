In order to investigate the effect of alignment on modeling and find out the best alignment strategy, three different alignment rules were applied to generate CoMFA and CoMSIA models. Statistical results of the highly significant models (CoMFA q(2) = 0.748, r(2) =0.996, predicted r(2) =0.789; CoMSIA q(2) =0.755, r(2) =0.973, predicted r(2) = 0.706; HQSAR q(2) = 0.884, r(2) = 0.973, predicted r(2) = 0.734) reveal considerable predictive ability. Analysis of the contour maps of CoMFA and CoMSIA models and the atomic contribution maps of HQSAR model may contribute to develop novel and potential AChE inhibitors.", "paper_title": "CoMFA, CoMSIA and HQSAR Studies of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000323931600009"}
