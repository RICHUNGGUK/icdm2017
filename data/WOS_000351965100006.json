In this note, the general effects of deterioration and learning are considered. It is proved that some single machine scheduling problems are still polynomially solvable under the proposed model. The note also shows that some results in Lee and Lai's recent paper (Lee and Lai, 2011) are incorrect by a counterexample. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
