This paper addresses both the issues of linguistic interpretation and universal approximation of systems using hierarchical fuzzy models. Fuzzy relational equations are used to implement the sub-models of a hierarchical structure that has two very important properties: i) it can be converted into a completely equivalent nonhierarchical model, which in turn allows the extraction of linguistic knowledge in the form of consistent fuzzy IF-THEN rules; and ii) it is a universal approximator. These properties are analytically derived and the proposed model is illustrated by means of an example.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical fuzzy relational models: Linguistic interpretation and universal approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238426500008"}
