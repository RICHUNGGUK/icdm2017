The models are developed through the integration of autoregressive models, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model, and discrete wavelet transform algorithms. The premise parts of the proposed models are determined using the subtractive clustering technique and the consequent parts are optimized using weighted least squares. To train and validate the proposed fuzzy models, a large number of data sets were collected from Daecheong reservoir in Geum River in the Republic of Korea. The data include both water quality and hydrological variables. Total nitrogen, total phosphorous, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, pH, air temperature, water temperature and outflow water were evaluated as input signals while chlorophyll-a was used as an output. It is demonstrated from the simulation that the proposed fuzzy models are effective in forecasting algal blooms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
