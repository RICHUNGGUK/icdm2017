The proposed protocol employs known rollback-recovery techniques, however, while applying them, the semantics of session guarantees is taken into account. Consequently, rVsMR protocol is optimized with respect to session guarantees requirements. The paper includes the proof of safety property of the presented protocol.", "paper_title": "Rollback-recovery protocol guarantying MR session guarantee in distributed systems with mobile clients", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500047"}
