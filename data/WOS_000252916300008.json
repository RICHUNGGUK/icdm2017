Design/methodology/approach - The 3D finite element magnetic scalar potential formulation combined with the surface impedance condition approximation is used. It allows the modelling of thin skin depth effect at low cost. Findings - The paper shows how to use surface impedance condition for solid conductors with holes, when using the magnetic scalar potential. Specific equations must be added to respect Ampere's theorem. The paper establishes these equations and the coupling with the finite element formulation. The final system of equations is symmetric. Research limitations/implications - The formulation allows to treat linear material in the magneto-harmonic assumption. Originality/value - The use of surface impedance condition with: the 3D finite element magnetic scalar potential formulation is well known. The originality is to take into account holes (multiply connected conductors).", "paper_title": "A t(0)-phi surface impedance formulation for multiply connected conductors", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300008"}
