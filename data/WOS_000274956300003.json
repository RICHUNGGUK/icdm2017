A major problem occurs when the FMM is applied to approximate the Coulomb energy and Coulomb energy gradient within geometric numerical integrations of Hamiltonian systems considered for solving astronomy or molecular-dynamics problems: The FMM approximation involves an approximated potential which is not regular, implying a loss of the preservation of the Hamiltonian of the system. In this paper, we present a regularization of the Fast Multipole Method in order to recover the invariance of energy. Numerical tests are given on a toy problem to confirm the gain of such a regularization of the fast method.", "paper_title": "A regular fast multipole method for geometric numerical integrations of Hamiltonian systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000274956300003"}
