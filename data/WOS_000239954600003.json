Theories are the level of specification where object-logics are axiornatised. Isabelle's proof language Isar enables local exploration in contexts generated in the course of natural deduction proofs. Finally, locales, which may be seen as detached proof contexts, offer an intermediate level of specification geared towards reuse. All three kinds of contexts are structured, to different extents. We analyse the \"topology\" of Isabelle's landscape of specification contexts, by means of development graphs, in order to establish what kinds of reuse are possible.", "paper_title": "Interpretation of locales in Isabelle: Theories and proof contexts", "paper_id": "WOS:000239954600003"}
