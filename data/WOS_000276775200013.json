A pinning scheme with linear feedback is proposed to globally exponentially stabilize a network onto a homogeneous state. In particular, we answer an important and fundamental question about pinning control: how to select an optimal combination between the number of pinned nodes and the feedback control gain? Three illustrative examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Pinning control of general complex dynamical networks with optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000276775200013"}
