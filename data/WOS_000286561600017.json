We propose a novel supervised learning algorithm for generating face relevance maps to improve the discriminating capability of existing methods. We have successfully applied the developed technique to face identification based on the Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces methods, and also to gender classification based on principal geodesic analysis (PGA). We demonstrate how to iteratively learn the face relevance map using labelled data. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the developed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
