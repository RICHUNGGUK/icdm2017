This arithmetic processor was implemented by a cell-based flow and supports the basic mathematical operations, and numerical control. All mathematical instructions are composed of three bytes. In the first byte, it contains the operation code and the address of the operand, while the operands are in the second and third bytes. While the processor architecture compared with the conventional CPU, the performance is speed up for the number reduction of instruction cycle. The number of instruction cycle is decreased to five T-states. All of these circuits were implemented by the TSMC 0.35 mu m cell library. A 20-pin I/O PAD was selected to package this processor. The experimental results are showed and discussions are made. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
