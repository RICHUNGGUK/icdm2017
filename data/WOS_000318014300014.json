Reference logos and test images are seen as constellations of local features (interest points, regions, etc.) and matched by minimizing an energy function mixing: 1) a fidelity term that measures the quality of feature matching, 2) a neighborhood criterion that captures feature co-occurrence/geometry, and 3) a regularization term that controls the smoothness of the matching solution. We also introduce a detection/recognition procedure and study its theoretical consistency. Finally, we show the validity of our method through extensive experiments on the challenging MICC-Logos dataset. Our method overtakes, by 20%, baseline as well as state-of-the-art matching/recognition procedures.", "paper_title": "Context-Dependent Logo Matching and Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000318014300014"}
