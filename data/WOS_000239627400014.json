When applied to flat positive systems, they often lead to non feasible trajectories (negative state and control), or to rather involved nonlinear optimisation problems in the design of the flat output. The biological clock example is adressed, using several mathematical models of growing complexity. Two solutions adapted to this example are explored.", "paper_title": "Trajectory parametrisation for a positive system: The biological clock example", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400014"}
