(a) the right hand side is perturbed while the coefficient matrix remains unchanged, (b) the coefficient matrix is perturbed while the right hand side remains unchanged, and (c) both the coefficient matrix and the right hand side are perturbed. For all of the three cases, the respective relative error bounds for solutions of fuzzy linear system are derived. The results are illustrated by numerical examples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
