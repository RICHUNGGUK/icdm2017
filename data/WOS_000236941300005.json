We define a notion of abstraction for Markov chains. To be able to relate the behavior of abstract and concrete systems, we equip the notion of abstraction with the concept of simulation. Furthermore, we present model checking for abstract probabilistic systems (abstract Markov chains) with respect to specifications in probabilistic temporal logics, interpreted over a 3-valued domain. More specifically, we introduce a 3-valued version of probabilistic computation-tree logic (PCTL) and give a model checking algorithm w.r.t. abstract Markov chains.", "paper_title": "Don't know in Probabilistic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236941300005"}
