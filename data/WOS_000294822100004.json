This problem was originally formulated as a constrained optimization problem with respect to the conditional probability distribution of clusters. Based on the stationary distribution induced from the problem setting, we propose a function which measures the relevance among data objects under the problem setting. This function is utilized to capture the relation among data objects, and the entire objects are represented as an edge-weighted graph where pairs of objects are connected with edges with their relevance. We show that, in hard assignment, the clustering problem can be approximated as a combinatorial problem over the proposed graph model when data is uniformly distributed. By representing the data objects as a graph based on our graph model, various graph based algorithms can be utilized to solve the clustering problem over the graph. The proposed approach is evaluated on the text clustering problem over 20 Newsgroup and TREC datasets. The results are encouraging and indicate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "A graph model for mutual information based clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000294822100004"}
