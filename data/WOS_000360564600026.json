We present a successful application of an extended multimedia paradigm beyond the classic vision and auditory based approaches. The four pressure directions are used to evoke tactile brain potential responses, thus defining a tactile-force brain computer interface (tfBCI). We present brainwave electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing and classification procedures leading to successful online interfacing results. Experiment results with seven advanced and five naive users performing online BCI experiments provide a validation of the hand location tfBCI paradigm, while the feasibility of the concept is substantiated by noteworthy information-transfer rates.", "paper_title": "Tactile-force brain-computer interface paradigm", "paper_id": "WOS:000360564600026"}
