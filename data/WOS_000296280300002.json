The system uses new media to revive and model ancient Eastern and Confucius philosophies and teachings, presenting them in new contexts, such as online social chat, music and food. Based on the model of Eastern mind and teaching, the system enables users to have meaningful social network communication with a virtual Confucius. The Confucius Computer system offers a new artistic playground for interactive music-painting creation based on our Confucius music filters and the ancient model of Cycles of Balance. Confucius Computer also allows users to explore the traditional Chinese medicine concept of Yin-Yang through interactive recipe creation. Detailed descriptions of the systems are presented in this paper. Our user studies showed that users gave positive feedbacks to their experience of interacting with Confucius Computer. They believed that this media could improve intergenerational interaction and promote a sense of calmness.", "paper_title": "Confucius Computer: bridging intergenerational communication through illogical and cultural computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000296280300002"}
