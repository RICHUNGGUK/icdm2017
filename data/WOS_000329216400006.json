In WSNs, sink mobility brings new challenges to large-scale sensor networks. Almost all of the energy-aware routing protocols that have been proposed for WSNs aim at optimising network performance while relaying data to a stationary sink. However, through such contemporary protocols, mobility of the sink can make established routes unstable. In this paper, a Dual-Tree-Based Data Aggregation (DTDA) scheme for gridbased WSNs is proposed. The goal is to establish dual trees (a dual-tree) that have an approximate number of nodes for data aggregation. Simulation results show that the proposed DTDA minimises energy consumption and evenly distributes load to prolong network lifetime.", "paper_title": "A load balancing data aggregation scheme for grid-based wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329216400006"}
