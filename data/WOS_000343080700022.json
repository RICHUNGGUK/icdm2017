Our proposal is based on an accurate 3D reconstruction using the rich information obtained from a network of intelligent video-processing nodes. In this manner, if the scenario to cover is modeled in 3D with high precision, it will be possible to locate the detected objects in the virtual representation. Moreover, as an improvement over previous 2D solutions, having the possibility of modifying the view point enables the application to choose the perspective that better suits the current state of the scenario. In this sense, the contextualization of the events detected in a 3D environment can offer a much better understanding of what is happening in the real world and where it is exactly happening. Details of the video processing nodes are given, as well as of the 3D reconstruction tasks performed afterwards. The possibilities of such a system are described and the performance obtained is analyzed.", "paper_title": "Smart video sensors for 3D scene reconstruction of large infrastructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000343080700022"}
