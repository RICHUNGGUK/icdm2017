We assume that phi(z) satisfies a linear difference equation L(y) = 0 with polynomial coefficients, and that a summing operator for L exists (such an operator can be found-if it exists-by the Accurate Summation algorithm, or, alternatively, by Gosper's algorithm when ordL = 1). The notion of bottom summation which covers the case where phi(z) has poles in Z is introduced.", "paper_title": "On the bottom summation", "paper_id": "WOS:000257780500001"}
