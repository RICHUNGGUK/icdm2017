The scheme combines media-specific forward error correction (FEC) and error concealment (EC). Media-specific FEC is applied at the client side, where FEC bits representing strongly quantized versions of the speech vectors are introduced. At the server side, the information provided by those FEC bits is used by the EC algorithm to improve the recognition performance. We investigate the adaptation of two different EC techniques, namely minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation, which operates at the decoding stage, and weighted Viterbi recognition (WVR), where EC is applied at the recognition stage, in order to be used along with FEC. The experimental results show that a significant increase in recognition accuracy can be obtained with very little bandwidth increase, which may be null in practice, and a limited increase in latency, which in any case is not so critical for an application such as DSR.", "paper_title": "Combining media-specific FEC and error concealment for robust distributed speech recognition over loss-prone packet channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000242311700012"}
