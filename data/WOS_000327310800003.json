Although the MG method can theoretically perform as fast as O(N), the development of a clothing simulator based on the MG method calls for solving an important technical challenge: handling the constraints. Resolving constrains has been difficult in MG because there has been no clear way to transfer the constraints existing in the finest level mesh to the coarser level meshes. This paper presents a new formulation based on soft constraints, which can coarsen the constraints defined in the finest level to the coarser levels. Experiments are performed which show that the proposed method can solve the linear system up to 4-9 times faster in comparison with the modified preconditioned conjugate gradient method (MPCG) without quality degradation. The proposed method is easy to implement and can be straightforwardly applied to existing clothing simulators which are based on implicit time integration.", "paper_title": "Constrainable Multigrid for Cloth", "paper_id": "WOS:000327310800003"}
