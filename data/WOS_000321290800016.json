Results of simulations based on the model of spatially separated anodic and cathodic reactions are presented for a cavity development from a point-like damage of a protective layer and from an initially flat unprotected surface. We show some new peculiar examples of the symmetry breaking in the cavity development. The results for the initially flat surface show roughening of the surface at the beginning of the corrosion process. After that, pit merging causes a resmoothing of the surface. An oscillatory behavior of the surface roughness is observed caused by a peninsula formation with subsequent island detachment. These results are obtained in 2D because of computational limitations. We plan simulations in 3D and point out the problems we encounter in their realization.", "paper_title": "Corrosion-passivation processes in a cellular automata based simulation study", "paper_id": "WOS:000321290800016"}
