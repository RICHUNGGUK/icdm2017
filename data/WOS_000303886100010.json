Special hardware architectures are required to achieve real-time compression performance. Many fast search block matching motion estimation (BMME) algorithms have been developed in order to minimize search positions and speed up computation but they do not take into account how they can be effectively implemented by hardware. In this paper, we propose three new hardware architectures of fast search block matching motion estimation algorithm using Line Diamond Parallel Search (LDPS) for H.264/AVC video coding system. These architectures use pipeline and parallel processing techniques and present minimum latency, maximum throughput and full utilization of hardware resources. The VHDL code has been tested and can work at high frequency in a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA circuit for the three proposed architectures.", "paper_title": "FPGA architecture of the LDPS Motion Estimation for H.264/AVC Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000303886100010"}
