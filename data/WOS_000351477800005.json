A comparison of the metrical data computed for the models and the real systems shows some slight discrepancy between the metal-ancillary ligand distances - shorter distances are observed in the formers - but comparable metal-C-alpha and C-alpha-C-beta distances. Incidentally, distances computed for the model molecules match more closely those measured experimentally. Replacement of a dppe ligand tethered to the metal centers by a dpe group does not much alter the electronic properties. Therefore, overall, data obtained for the Mo-2 models 2' compare rather well with those computed for the real systems 2. Larger alteration is noticed when Cp* is substituted by Cp, even if the general trends observed for the real iron species 1 and 3 are kept overall for the iron models 1' and 3'. Indeed, the smaller electron-donor properties of Cp affect somewhat the nodal properties of the HOMOs (less metallic character) and increase the HOMO-LUMO gaps and the ionization potentials. Despite this, similarities between models and real compounds largely overtake differences. It is shown that calculations on models provide quite acceptable results.", "paper_title": "Electronic structure of modelized vs. real carbon-chain containing organometallic dinuclear complexes: similarities and differences", "paper_id": "WOS:000351477800005"}
