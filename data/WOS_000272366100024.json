The workflow in collaborative team contains information about relationships among members, roles and tasks, which could be combined with collaborative filtering to obtain members' demands for knowledge. In addition, the work schedule information contained in the workflow could also be employed to determine the proper volume of knowledge that should be recommended to each member. In this paper. we investigate the mechanism of the workflow-based recommender system, and conduct a series of experiments referring to several real-world collaborative teams to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.
