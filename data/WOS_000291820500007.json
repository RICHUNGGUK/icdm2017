However, some unique features present a challenge in interference mitigation in a two-tier heterogeneous network such as random deployment for femtocells, nonexistence of macro-femto backhaul coordination, and mandates allowing no modifications of existing macrocells. Carefully examining the existing distributed information acquisition mechanisms, cognitive radio is the most promising solution for two-tier heterogeneous networks. We therefore study possible interference mitigation approaches, including orthogonal radio resource assignment in the time-frequency and antenna spatial domains, as well as interference cancellation via novel decoding techniques. According to the information acquired by cognitive radio technology, recent innovations such as game theory and the Gibbs sampler have been explored to mitigate both cross-tier and intratier interferences. Performance evaluations show that considerable performance improvement can be generally achieved, and thus demonstrate the potential of applying cognitive radio in mitigating interference.", "paper_title": "ON EXPLOITING COGNITIVE RADIO TO MITIGATE INTERFERENCE IN MACRO/FEMTO HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291820500007"}
