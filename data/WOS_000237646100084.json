Recently, due to many desirable features of the UWB system, it has drawn much attention especially for short-range high-speed data transmission. The UWB system has two parameters to determine its data throughput; pulse repetition frequency and slot interval. In the multi-path channel with additive white Gaussian noise, the UWB system suffers from the inter-pulse interference (IPI) and noise, which result in degradation of system performance. In order to maintain or improve the system performance, the UWB system can vary the two parameters. In this paper, we demonstrate the effects of the two parameters on the data throughput of the UWB system in various multi-path indoor channels through computer simulation, and show that the variable data rate approach designed based on the observations is superior to the fixed data rate one in terms of effective throughput performance.", "paper_title": "Effects of PRF and slot interval on the data throughput of PPM-based ultra wide-band systems in multi-path channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100084"}
