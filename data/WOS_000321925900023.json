We begin by establishing the strong consistency of the nonlinear least squares estimator of the parameters of 2-D sinusoids, when the number of sinusoidal signals assumed in the field is incorrect. Based on these results, we prove the strong consistency of a new family of model order selection rules.", "paper_title": "Strongly Consistent Model Order Selection for Estimating 2-D Sinusoids in Colored Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000321925900023"}
