A specific example is presented using comb microresonators. The equation governing the resonant frequency and the transconductance values was analyzed. The mathematical formulation of the convex model was derived. The major finding is that convex models can be used as an uncertainty analysis tool in MEMS design applications.", "paper_title": "Uncertainty modeling and analysis of natural resonant frequency and transconductance parameters in microresonators design", "paper_id": "WOS:000247644800028"}
