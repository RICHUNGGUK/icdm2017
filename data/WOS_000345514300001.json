Our framework targets a complementary system setup, which consists of a depth camera coupled with an RGB camera. Inspired by a recent work that uses a nonlocal structure regularization, we regularize depth maps in order to maintain fine details and structures. We extend this regularization by combining the additional high-resolution RGB input when upsampling a low-resolution depth map together with a weighting scheme that favors structure details. Our technique is also able to repair large holes in a depth map with consideration of structures and discontinuities utilizing edge information from the RGB input. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method outperforms existing approaches for depth map upsampling and completion. We describe the complete process for this system, including device calibration, scene warping for input alignment, and even how our framework can be extended for video depth-map completion with the consideration of temporal coherence.", "paper_title": "High-Quality Depth Map Upsampling and Completion for RGB-D Cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000345514300001"}
