It requires some extra space over the compressed text that can be traded for search speed. It is usually fast for single-word searches, yet phrase searches require more expensive intersections. In this article we introduce a different kind of index. It replaces the text using essentially the same space required by the compressed text alone (compression ratio around 35%). Within this space it supports not only decompression of arbitrary passages, but efficient word and phrase searches. Searches are orders of magnitude faster than those over inverted indexes when looking for phrases, and still faster on single-word searches when little space is available. Our new indexes are particularly fast at counting the occurrences of words or phrases. This is useful for computing relevance of words or phrases. We adapt self-indexes that succeeded in indexing arbitrary strings within compressed space to deal with large alphabets. Natural language texts are then regarded as sequences of words, not characters, to achieve word-based self-indexes. We design an architecture that separates the searchable sequence from its presentation aspects. This permits applying case folding, stemming, removing stopwords, etc. as is usual on inverted indexes.", "paper_title": "Word-Based Self-Indexes for Natural Language Text", "paper_id": "WOS:000300989800001"}
