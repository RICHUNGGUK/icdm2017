The ModelCamera implements an interactive modeling pipeline based on real-time dense color and sparse depth. The operator scans the scene with a device that acquires a video stream augmented with 49 depth samples per frame. The system registers the frames using the depth and color data, and integrates them into an evolving model that is displayed continually. The operator selects views by checking the display for missing or undersampled surfaces and aiming the camera at them. A model is built from thousands of frames. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
