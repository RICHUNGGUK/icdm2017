In this study, we analyze network-specific structural and behavioral characteristics of innovation clusters with the intention of delving into differences in learning performance in clusters. Based on three representative networks of real world, scale-free, broad-scale, and single-scale networks, the learning performance of entire organizations in a cluster is examined by the simulation method. We find out that the network structure of clusters is important for the learning performance of clusters. Among the three networks, the scale-free network having the most hub organizations shows the best learning performance. In addition, the appropriate level of openness that maintains long-lasting diversity leads to the highest organizational learning performance. This study confirms the roles of innovation clusters and implies how each organization as a member of a cluster should run their organization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
