Moreover, power distribution becomes a challenge in the future detectors for high energy physics experiments. In order to address these problems, a power management is proposed. Power supply voltages and reference voltages are internally generated in CPS. Two full on-chip linear regulators are proposed in this paper. Low area, low power consumption and low noise are achieved by a novel structure. The regulators have been designed and fabricated in a 0.35-mu m commercial process. The measurement results are also presented.", "paper_title": "A low-noise and low-area-consumption power management dedicated to CMOS pixel sensors for high energy physics experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000318499700003"}
