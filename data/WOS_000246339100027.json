Network alarm clocks are connected over a wireless network to other network alarm clocks of people in the social network of a user. The wake-up time of the alarm is related to presence information (e.g., who Is up already, who is still asleep) from other users. A typical wake-up setting is: wake me between 7 am and 10 am when more than half of my family are already up. With a tangible interface the alarm can be enabled or disabled. When enabled this assumes the user has gone to bed; when disabled after ringing it is assumed the user is up. This information is used as a presence information for others.", "paper_title": "Network alarm clock (The 3AD International Design Competition)", "paper_id": "WOS:000246339100027"}
