This cipher could be applied in the Wireless Sensor Network to provide security. On the basis of the single byte-oriented fault model, we propose a differential fault analysis on the LED cipher. The attack could recover its 64-bit secret key by introducing 4 faulty ciphertexts, and 128-bit secret key by introducing 8 faulty ciphertexts. The results in this study will be beneficial to the analysis of the same type of other iterated lightweight ciphers.", "paper_title": "Single Byte Differential Fault Analysis on the LED Lightweight Cipher in the Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000309220000012"}
