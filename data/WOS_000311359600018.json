The determination of the weight distributions of such codes is an open problem. Generally, the weight distributions of cyclic codes are difficult to determine. Utilizing a class of elliptic curves, this paper determines the weight distributions of dual codes of q-ary cyclic codes with two zeros for a few more cases, where q is an odd prime power.", "paper_title": "The Weight Distributions of Cyclic Codes and Elliptic Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000311359600018"}
