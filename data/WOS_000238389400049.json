One of the key technologies to make the ray-space feasible is interpolation. In this paper, two fast interpolation methods based on feature points and directionality detection are compared with block based matching method, and the experimental results show that the two methods improve visual quality as well as PSNRs of rendered virtual viewpoint image greatly while computational burden is also reduced significantly.", "paper_title": "Quality and performance evaluation of ray-space interpolation for free viewpoint video systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400049"}
