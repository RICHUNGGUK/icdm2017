Recently, we have shown that ill-considered use of the noisy-OR model specifically can substantially decrease a network's performance, especially in domains in which causal mechanisms include cancellation effects. Motivated by this observation, we designed a new causal interaction model, with the same engineering advantages as the noisy-OR model, to describe such effects. We detail properties of our intercausal cancellation model, and compare it against existing causal interaction models. We further illustrate the application of our model in the real-world domain of pharmacology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
