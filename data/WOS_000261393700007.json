An exact relationship between the noise variance in the original signal and the noise variance in the wavelet coefficients at a generic level is derived. This relationship is crucial in the application of wavelet thresholding for signal denoising to properly select the threshold in each subband.", "paper_title": "SUBBAND VARIANCE COMPUTATION OF HOMOSCEDASTIC ADDITIVE NOISE IN DISCRETE DYADIC WAVELET TRANSFORM", "paper_id": "WOS:000261393700007"}
