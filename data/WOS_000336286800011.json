In this context, this paper discusses the relevance of project-based learning initiatives for teaching structural optimization, in the light of recent literature on the subject, as well as based on our experience in a course on form finding and structural optimization at the Brussels Faculty of Engineering. Although each project-based course has its specificities related to the teachers, their expertise, and the curriculum philosophy, some general guidelines are proposed, stressing the importance of a proper understanding of the mathematical and physical concepts, but also underlining the need to ensure sufficient room for creativity among the students.", "paper_title": "Form finding & structural optimization A project-based course for graduate students in civil and architectural engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000336286800011"}
