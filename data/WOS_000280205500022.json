For solving this problem, Wang et al. first show that with an O(vertical bar T vertical bar log vertical bar T vertical bar)-time preprocessing on T, all matched positions can be reported in O(vertical bar P vertical bar + U(d)) time, where vertical bar T vertical bar, vertical bar P vertical bar, and U(d) denote the length of T, the length of P, and the number of matched positions for discretely-scaled P in T, respectively. In this paper, for fixed alphabets we propose the first-known optimal indexing algorithm that takes O(vertical bar T vertical bar) and O(vertical bar P vertical bar + U(d)) time in its preprocessing and query phases, respectively. For integer and unbounded alphabets, our new algorithm can also be extended to obtain the best-known results.
