TPC (transmit power control) has been recognized as one of the effective ways to achieve this goal. In this paper, we study the emerging 802.11a/h systems that provide a structured means to support intelligent TPC. Based on a rigorous analysis of the relationship among different radio ranges and TPC's effects on the interference, we present an optimal low-energy transmission strategy, called MiSer, which is deployed in the format of RTS-CTS(strong)-Data(MiSer)-Ack. The key idea of MiSer is to combine TPC with PHY (physical layer) rate adaptation and compute offline an optimal rate-power combination table,then at runtime, a wireless station determines the most energy-efficient transmission strategy for each data frame transmission by a simple table lookup. Simulation results show MiSer's clear superiority to other two-way or four-way frame exchange mechanisms in terms of energy conservation.", "paper_title": "Interference analysis and transmit power control in IEEE 802.11 a/h wireless LANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000250245300003"}
