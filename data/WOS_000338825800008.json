In this study we developed a fuzzy rule based model, which uses available farm management data as required inputs, for the environmental assessment of farming systems. We also tried to make an analysis on the efficiency of current mathematical parameters in the development of our fuzzy model. Finally, in a practical example we demonstrate the applicability of the developed model for improvement of environmental status of the cane farming in Iran. A Mamdani fuzzy inference model with two inference engines was developed to combine five basic input indexes, which were selected as indicators of farms environmental status based on the experts' interview and scientific knowledge. To validate the developed model, we inserted several cycles of analysis using graphical and global sensitivity methods on the model and compared the model outcomes with experts' viewpoints. Using these analysis methods, we also evaluated the effects of changes in operators, membership function shape and defuzzification methods, on the model outcomes and their sensitivities. In this study, fuzzy inference emerged as a suitable, uncomplicated and effective tool for development of environmental assessment models. Totally, performance of one parameter was highly influenced by other parameters. For the selection of one parameter its interaction with other parameters had to be considered. Type, shape and the number of membership functions were from the most effective parameters for development of the model and significantly influenced the other factors. Case study results showed that environmental indexes of sugarcane production can enhance between 37 and 59% using simple improving strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
