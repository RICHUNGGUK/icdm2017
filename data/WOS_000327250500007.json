However, opportunistic schedulers for wireless systems have been studied since nearly twenty years, but not implemented in real systems due to their high complexity and hardly achievable requirements. In contrast, today's popularity of opportunistic schedulers extends to implementation proposals for next generation cellular technologies. Motivated by such a novel interest towards opportunistic scheduling, we provide a taxonomy for opportunistic schedulers, which is based on scheduling design's objectives; accordingly, we provide an extensive review of opportunistic scheduling proposals which have appeared in the literature during nearly two decades. The huge number of papers available in the literature propose different techniques to perform opportunistic scheduling, ranging from simple heuristic algorithms to complex mathematical models. Some proposals are only designed to increase the total network capacity, while others enhance QoS objectives such as throughput and fairness. Interestingly, our survey helps to unveil two major issues: (i) the research in opportunistic is mature enough to jump from pure theory to implementation, and (ii) there are still under-explored and interesting research areas in opportunistic scheduling, e. g., opportunistic offloading of cellular traffic to 802.11-like networks, or cooperative/distributed opportunistic scheduling.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Opportunistic Scheduling in Wireless Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000327250500007"}
