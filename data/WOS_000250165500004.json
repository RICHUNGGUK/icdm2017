Based on the Lagrange multiplier theory in optimization and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network, the model seeks to provide solutions satisfying the trade-off conditions of mean-variance-skewness. The feasibility of the RBF network-based mean-variance-skewness model is verified with a simulation experiment. The experimental results show that, for all examined investor risk preferences and investment assets, the proposed model is a fast and efficient way of solving the trade-off in the mean-variance-skewness portfolio problem. In addition, we also find that the proposed approach can also be used as an alternative tool for evaluating various forecasting models. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
