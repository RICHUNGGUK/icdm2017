Nevertheless, fault information has no definite mapping relationship to a certain PC and useful information might be submerged under the retained PCs. A new version of weighted PCA (WPCA) for process monitoring is proposed to deal with the situation of useful information being submerged and reduce missed detection rates of T-2 statistic. The main idea of WPCA is building conventional PCA model and then using change rate of T-2 statistic along every PC to capture the most useful information in process, and setting different weighting values for PCs to highlight useful information when online monitoring. Case studies on Tennessee Eastman process demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and monitoring results are compared with conventional PCA method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
