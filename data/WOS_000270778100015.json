Over-exposing photographs causes pixels to exhibit unpleasant artifacts due to saturation of the sensor Saturation removal typically involves user intervention to adjust the color values, which is tedious and time-consuming. This paper discusses how saturation can be automatically removed without compromising the essential details of the image. Our method is based on a smoothness prior: neighboring pixels have similar channel ratios and color values. We demonstrate that high quality saturation-free photos can be obtained from a simple but effective approach.", "paper_title": "Automatic Correction of Saturated Regions in Photographs using Cross-Channel Correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000270778100015"}
