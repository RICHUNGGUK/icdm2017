The proposed solution for transferring the needed session identifiers across devices is to dynamically generate pictures of 2D-barcodes containing a Web address and a session ID in an encoded form. 2D-barcodes are a cheap, fast and robust approach to the problem. They are widely known and used in Japan, and are spreading in other countries. Variations on the topic are covered in the article, including a possible migration from a mobile device to a computer (opposite direction), and between two or more mobile phones (possibly back and forth). The results show that this HCI approach is inexpensive, efficient, and works with most camera-phones on the market; the author does see any other mature technique with such assets.", "paper_title": "Dynamic 2D-barcodes for multi-device Web session migration including mobile phones", "paper_id": "WOS:000273362500004"}
