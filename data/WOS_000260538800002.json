The paper identifies parallels between computer software and such other societal artifacts as laws, processes, recipes, and instructions (e.g. for driving and kitbuilding), and suggests that there are similar parallels in the ways in which these artifacts are built and evolved. The paper suggests that technologies for supporting the automation of computer software development and evolution might facilitate work in these other domains. It also suggests that successful approaches in these other domains could have useful and important application to the domain of computer software. It is further suggested that it might be important for discussions such as these to lead to a deeper understanding of the nature of \"software\".", "paper_title": "What is software?", "paper_id": "WOS:000260538800002"}
