With the purpose of enhancing structural analysis with augmented reality (AR) technologies, the paper presents a system which integrates sensor measurement and real-time FEA simulation into an AR-based environment. By incorporating scientific visualization technologies, this system superimposes FEA results directly on real-world objects, and provides intuitive interfaces for enhanced data exploration. A wireless sensor network has been integrated into the system to acquire spatially distributed loads, and a method to register the sensors onsite has been developed. Real-time PEA methods are employed to generate fast solutions in response to load variations. As a case study, this system is applied to monitor the stresses of a step ladder under actual loading conditions. The relationships among accuracy, mesh resolution and frame rate are investigated.
