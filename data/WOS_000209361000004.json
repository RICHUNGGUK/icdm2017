The problem of finding non-uniform beams which are isospectral to a given uniform beam, with fixed-free boundary condition, leads to a multimodal optimization problem. The first Q natural frequencies of the given uniform Euler-Bernoulli beam are determined using analytical solution. The first Q natural frequencies of a non-uniform beam are obtained with the help of finite element modeling. In order to obtain the non-uniform beams isospectral to a given uniform beam, an error function is designed, which calculates the difference between the spectra of the given uniform beam and the non-uniform beam. In our study, this error function is minimized using electromagnetism inspired optimization technique, a population based iterative algorithm inspired by the attraction-repulsion physics of electromagnetism. Numerical results show the existence of the isospectral non-uniform beams for a given uniform beam, which occur as local minima. Non-uniform beams isospectral to a damaged beam, are also explored using the proposed methodology to illustrate the fact that accurate structural damage identification is difficult by just frequency measurements.
