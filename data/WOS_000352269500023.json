Understanding how these enzymes modify molecule structure is key to the development of safe, effective drugs. XenoSite server is an online implementation of the XenoSite, a recently published computational model for P450 metabolism. XenoSite predicts which atomic sites of a molecule-sites of metabolism (SOMs)-are modified by P450s. XenoSite server accepts input in common chemical file formats including SDF and SMILES and provides tools for visualizing the likelihood that each atomic site is a site of metabolism for a variety of important P450s, as well as a flat file download of SOM predictions.", "paper_title": "XenoSite server: a web-available site of metabolism prediction tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000352269500023"}
