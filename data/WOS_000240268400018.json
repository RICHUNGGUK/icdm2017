The language is based on our previously developed family of Multimodal Presentation Markup Languages (MPML) that broadly followed the \"sequential\" and \"parallel\" tagging structure scheme for generating pre-synchronized presentations featuring life-like characters and interactions with the user. The new markup language MPML3D deviates from this design framework and proposes a reactive model instead, which is apt to handle interaction-rich scenarios with highly realistic 3D characters. Interaction in previous versions of MPML could be handled only at the cost of considerable scripting effort due to branching. By contrast, MPML3D advocates a reactive model that allows perceptions of other characters or the user interfere with the presentation flow at any time, and thus facilitates natural and unrestricted interaction. MPML3D is designed as a powerful and flexible language that is easy-to-use by non-experts, but it is also extensible as it allows content creators to add functionality such as a narrative model by using popular scripting languages.", "paper_title": "MPML3D: A reactive framework for the Multimodal Presentation Markup Language", "paper_id": "WOS:000240268400018"}
