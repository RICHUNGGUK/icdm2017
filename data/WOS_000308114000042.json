We extended the DFT calculation to predict the electronic structure properties of Si-doped aluminum nitride nanotubes, which are very important for production of solid-state devices and other applications. To this aim, pristine and Si-doped AlNNT structures in two models (Si-N and Si-Al) were optimized, and then the electronic properties, the isotropic (CSI) and anisotropic (CSA) chemical shielding parameters for the sites of various Al-27 and N-14 atoms, NQR parameters for the sites of various of Al-27 and N-14 atoms, and quantum molecular descriptors were calculated in the optimized structures. The optimized structures, the electronic properties, NMR and NQR parameters, and quantum molecular descriptors for the Si-N and Si-Al models show that the Si-N model is a more reactive material than the pristine or Si-Al model.", "paper_title": "NMR and NQR study of Si-doped (6,0) zigzag single-walled aluminum nitride nanotube as n or P -semiconductors", "paper_id": "WOS:000308114000042"}
