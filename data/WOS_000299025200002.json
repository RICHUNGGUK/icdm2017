Despite that success, fundamental architectural and business limitations exist in the Internet's design. Among these limitations, we focus on a specific issue, the lack of manageability, in this paper. Although it is generally understood that management is a significant and important part of network and service design, it has not been considered as an integral part in their design phase. We address this problem with our future Internet management architecture called highly manageable network and service architecture for new generation (HiMang), which is a novel architecture that aims at integrating management capabilities into network and service design. HiMang is highly manageable in the sense that it is autonomous, scalable, robust, and evolutionary while reducing the complexity of network management. Unlike any other management framework, HiMang provides management support for the revolutionary networks of the future while maintaining backward compatibility for existing networks.", "paper_title": "HiMang: Highly Manageable Network and Service Architecture for New Generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000299025200002"}
