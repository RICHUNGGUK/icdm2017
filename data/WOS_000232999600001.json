In this paper we obtain correlations for lift-off of particles in Oldroyd-B fluids. The fluid elasticity reduces the critical shear Reynolds number for lift-off. The effect of the gap size between the particle and the wall, on the lift force, is also studied. A particle lifted from the channel wall attains an equilibrium height at which its buoyant weight is balanced by the hydrodynamic lift force. Choi and Joseph [Choi HG, Joseph DD. Fluidization by lift of 300 circular particles in plane Poiseuille flow by direct numerical simulation. J Fluid Mech 2001;438:101-128] first observed multiple equilibrium positions for a particle in Newtonian fluids. We report several new results for the Newtonian fluid case based on a detailed study of the multiple equilibrium solutions, e.g. we find that at a given Reynolds number there are regions inside the channel where no particle, irrespective of its weight, can attain a stable equilibrium position. This would result in particle-depleted zones in channels with Poiseuille flows of a dilute suspension of particles of varying densities. Multiple equilibrium positions of particles are also found in Oldroyd-B fluids. All the results in this paper are based on 2D direct numerical simulations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
