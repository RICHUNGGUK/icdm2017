Given a suitably regular 2-D function f, we form a new function g from f by using the operations of reflection, scaling, translation, and rotation. We show how the radon projections of g are related to those of f and devise a procedure that can be used to determine the parameters from the radon projections of f and g. We illustrate this process using a family of block images that include common 7 x 5 pixel representations for the letters A, B,..., Z.", "paper_title": "Identification of reflected, scaled, translated, and rotated objects from their radon projections", "paper_id": "WOS:000253272300005"}
