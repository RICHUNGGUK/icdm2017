As x-star networks become ubiquitous, extracting knowledge from x-star networks has become an important task. Similarity search in x-star network aims to find the centers similar to a given query center, which has numerous applications including collaborative filtering, community mining and web search. Although existing methods yield promising similar results, such as SimRank and P-Rank, they are not applicable for massive x-star networks. In this paper, we propose a structural-based similarity measure, NetSim, towards efficiently computing similarity between centers in an x-star network. The similarity between attributes is computed in the pre-processing stage by the expected meeting probability over attribute network that is extracted from the whole structure of x-star network. The similarity between centers is computed online according to the attribute similarities based on the intuition that similar centers are linked with similar attributes. NetSim requires less time and space cost than existing methods since the scale of attribute network is significantly smaller than the whole x-star network. For supporting fast online query processing, we develop a pruning algorithm by building a pruning index, which prunes candidate centers that are not promising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method through comparing with the state-of-the-art measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
