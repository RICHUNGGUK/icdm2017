The logic function operating on the first gate of a double-gate (DG) transistor is reconfigured by altering the charge on its second gate. Each cell in the array can act as logic or interconnect, or both, contrasting with current field-programmable gate array structures in which logic and interconnect are built and configured separately. Simulation results are presented for a fully depleted SOI DG-MOSFET implementation and contrasted with two other proposals from the literature based on directed self-assembly.", "paper_title": "A low-power reconfigurable logic array based on double-gate transistors", "paper_id": "WOS:000252577900002"}
