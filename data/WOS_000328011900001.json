However, in spite of the advantages that these protocols present in comparison to other approaches, such as distributed hash tables, they also have inherent scalability issues. In this paper, CCPS (Caching Content-based Publish-Subscribe) is presented as a publish-subscribe protocol designed to address these scalability issues. Through caching, CCPS exploits search query repetition to address load balancing problems. It has been designed having in mind its use in combination with existing publish-subscribe solutions so as to improve their performance. In the paper, the protocol description together with the implementation details of its fundamental operations are provided, while CCPS performance is evaluated against standard gossip protocols.
