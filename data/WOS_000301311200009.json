The RFID infrastructure senses the newly arriving parts to be assembled and via an integration framework, the robots are able to recognize them and perform cooperative welding operations. The parts to be welded have different characteristics, in particular, variable in both dimensions and materials. The integration framework is demonstrated in a case study coming from the automotive industry. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
