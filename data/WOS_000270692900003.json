Here, we review the evidence on this question, focusing specifically on the integration of auditory and visual information during the perception of speech. Contrary to the mainstream view that has been prevalent for the last 30 years or so, recent studies have now started to reveal that attentional resources are, in fact, recruited during audiovisual multisensory integration, at least under certain conditions. Finally, considering all of the available evidence, we discuss the extent to which audiovisual speech perception should be considered to represent a 'special' case of audiovisual, and more generally, of multisensory integration.
