A matrix computing coprocessor (MCC) is developed in this study to improve the performance of matrix computing. The proposed MCC, which is an application-specific instruction set processor for the construction of a high-performance embedded system, can independently implement the entire algorithm, including floating point matrix computing. A good definition matrix operation instruction set is also presented. A single floating-point MCC and an embedded system with the MCC are implemented. Experimental results show that the proposed MCC exhibits high performance and has excellent flexibility and good application prospect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
