In general, the larger sizes the stack filters are, the better results are. Unfortunately, available algorithms for designing stack filters can only be suit for small window sizes due to their huge computational complexities. This paper presents a new fast adaptive algorithm for designing a stack filter with large windows. The idea of the new algorithm is to divide a lager window into many subwindows. The procedures of dividing a large window are given. An Immune Memory Clonal Selection Algorithm is employed to design the stack filters with small window sizes. Because of its highly parallel structure, it can be very fast implemented. As an experiment, the algorithm was used to restore images corrupted by uncorrelated additive noise with the level from 10% to 50%. The results show that the algorithm is effective and feasible.", "paper_title": "New fast algorithm for training large window stack filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100091"}
