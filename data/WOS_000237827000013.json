A patient with hypertension in long term tends to have various kinds of vessel pathological changes such as coronary heart disease, apoplexy, and nephropathy. Consequently, the blood pressure measurement is important in daily health care for hypertension patients. Traditionally, the design and implementation of blood pressure monitor mostly focuses on the accuracy of pressure measurement and does not deal with the requirement of hypertension health care services with two-way communication via instant messages between the patient and the medical center. In this paper, a mobile-care system integrated with Bluetooth blood pressure and pulse monitor, and cellular phone is designed and implemented to transmit the physiological parameters of the patient in real time via wireless networks. The health care provider can monitor the blood pressure, body temperature, and heart rate of the patient and provide services by intelligent health care systems. The intelligent system constantly manages the health care data and periodically reports the status of the patient to the patient's family members. By the above care mechanism, the patients with hypertension can easily obtain long-term and constant monitoring of the physiological parameters and thus better health care services. A questionnaire survey has been conducted among medical personnel in Taipei municipal Wang-Fang hospital to collect their opinions of using our proposed and implemented blood pressure monitor with Bluetooth transmission function. An average of 95% of the medical personnel agree that long-term monitoring of the patients' physiological information such as blood pressure can be helpful to reduce medical cost, to provide useful reference data, and to provide long-distance health care. This thus shows strong support of the usefulness of our proposed device. Our proposed and implemented device has also been submitted to US FDA for medical device approval.", "paper_title": "A mobile-care system integrated with Bluetooth blood pressure and pulse monitor, and cellular phone", "paper_id": "WOS:000237827000013"}
