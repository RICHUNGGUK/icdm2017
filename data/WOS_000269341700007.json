Especially, ontology is becoming the pivotal methodology to represent domain-specific conceptual knowledge in order to promote the semantic capability of a QA system. In this paper we present a QA system in which the domain knowledge is represented by means of ontology. In addition, personalized services are enabled through modeling users' profiles in the form of pervasive agent ontology, and a Chinese Natural Language human-machine interface is implemented mainly through a NL parser in this system. An initial evaluation result shows the feasibility to build such a semantic QA system based on pervasive agent ontology, the effectivity of personalized semantic QA, the extensibility of pervasive agent ontology and knowledge base, and the possibility of self-produced knowledge-based on semantic relations in the pervasive agent ontology.
