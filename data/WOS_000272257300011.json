In this paper, we propose two new schemes for the detectors re-editing and censoring in the NSA. The detectors that fail to pass the negative selection phase are re-edited and updated to become qualified using the Differential Evolution (DE) method. In the detectors censoring, the qualification of all the detectors is evaluated, and only those appropriate ones are retained. Prior knowledge of the anomalous data is utilized to discriminate the detectors so that their anomaly detection performances can be improved. The effectiveness of our detectors re-editing and censoring approaches is examined with both artificial signals and a practical bearings fault detection problem.", "paper_title": "Re-editing and Censoring of Detectors in Negative Selection Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000272257300011"}
