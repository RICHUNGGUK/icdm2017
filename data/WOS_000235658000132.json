Firstly, we give the sets of correlation context, the principle and definition about the relation each other among contexts. Then, we describe the abstraction of context information, which is necessary to group cooperation in mobile computing. We express context with ontology theory and deduct with first-order predication. After that, CA-AMCM model was constructed based on it. At last, we apply the model to the MECP (Mobile Embedded Cooperation Platform). The practice indicates that the model provides a powerful means for advancing group cooperation intelligence.", "paper_title": "Adaptive mobile cooperation model based on context awareness", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000132"}
