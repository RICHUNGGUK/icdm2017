A structured Robust IP (RIP) access architecture is described and its components are analyzed through the use of a proof of concept testbed. Examples of the use of RIP and the heuristics it implements are evaluated. We also compare RIP performance to existing work. We show that there are currently some tradeoffs that need to be made between accuracy and responsiveness. We believe that this collaborative communication style between the components represents a significant step in the direction of self-defending networks and innovation in the area.
