Examples of such sets of operators comprise XOR, multiplication, abstract encryption/decryption. In this report we give an algorithm for combining decision procedures for arbitrary intruder theories with disjoint sets of operators, provided that solvability of ordered intruder constraints, a slight generalization of intruder constraints, can be decided in each theory. This is the case for most of the intruder theories for which a decision procedure has been given. In particular our result allows us to decide trace-based security properties of protocols that employ any combination of the above mentioned operators with a bounded number of sessions.
