The GPS (Global Position System) information of the vehicles can be sent to the control center by wireless communication network such as GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), Internet and Intranet. The information integration platform control center can then dispatch command and receives information from the mobile terminals. GPS, GPRS, CDMA, Internet, Intranet and M-DMB (Mobile Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) network are all integrated into the platform. Different kinds of data can be sent and received simultaneity. The stream media can replay in time. There are two key technologies in the information integration platform; one is server cluster, other is mobile terminal development.", "paper_title": "An information integration platform for mobile computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500016"}
