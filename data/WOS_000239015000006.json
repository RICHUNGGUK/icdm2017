Consequently, Sparse ICA may be done by a combination of a clustering algorithm and PCA. For the clustering part, we use, in this paper, an algorithm inspired from K-means. The final algorithm is easy to implement for any number of sources. Experimental results points out the good performance of the method, whose the main restriction is to request an exponential growing of the sample number as the number of sources increases.
