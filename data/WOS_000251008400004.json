The multiscale procedure is constructed in such a way that the emerging scalar, vectorial and tensorial potential kernels act as scaling functions. Corresponding wavelets are defined via a canonical refinement equation. A tree algorithm for fast decomposition of a tangential complex-valued vector field given on a regular surface is developed based on numerical integration rules. Some numerical test examples conclude the paper.", "paper_title": "Modeling tangential vector fields on regular surfaces by means of mie potentials", "paper_id": "WOS:000251008400004"}
