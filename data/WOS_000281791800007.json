To identify such regular behavior in streams of dynamic interaction data, we propose a new mining problem of finding a minimal set of periodically recurring subgraphs to capture all periodic behavior in a dynamic network. We analyze the computational complexity of the problem and show that it is polynomial, unlike many related subgraph or itemset mining problems. We propose an efficient and scalable algorithm to mine all periodic subgraphs in a dynamic network. The algorithm makes a single pass over the data and is also capable of accommodating imperfect periodicity. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on several real-world networks and extract interesting and insightful periodic interaction patterns. We also show that periodic subgraphs can be an effective way to uncover and characterize the natural periodicities in a system.", "paper_title": "Periodic subgraph mining in dynamic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000281791800007"}
