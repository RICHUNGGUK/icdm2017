For large we find an estimate of the final time sychronization error for global and relative synchronization. The main results concern the behavior of the network on different timescales t(N) ->infinity, N -> infinity . We discuss the existence of phase transitions and find the exact timescales for which an effective clock synchronization of the system takes place.", "paper_title": "Clock synchronization in symmetric stochastic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330767300004"}
