Still, it is well known that space mapping algorithms may suffer from convergence issues, which are consequences of certain fundamental features. In many cases, file space mapping algorithm quickly finds an acceptable solution, but then falls into oscillations with respect to the design variables and/or the objective function value; as a consequence, there are no clear criteria for terminating the optimization process. In this article, we investigate some techniques for improving the convergence properties of the space mapping algorithm., which are based on the general convergence results for such algorithms. Our approach is verified using several micro-wave design optimization problems. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals.
