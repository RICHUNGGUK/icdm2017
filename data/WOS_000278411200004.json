The electron-electron collision term must be energy-conserving, while, due to non-linearity, commonly used algorithms do not satisfy this requirement. The efficiency of the algorithm make feasible the use of a non-linear iterative solver to conserve electron energy in electron-electron collisions. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with standard numerical schemes obtaining: 1) considerable gain in computational time: 2) the conservation of the total electron energy density in e-e collisions under the required tolerance.
