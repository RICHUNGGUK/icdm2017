Many new telematics services could be created through these emerging networking technologies. The Internet of Vehicle (IoV) network refers to networking technologies that could support highly economical and effective communication channels for the interactions between vehicles (including automobiles and high-speed trains). Examples of potential services and applications on the IoV network include safety and real-time operational status for vehicles, passenger entertainment, and end-to-end secure communications for vehicles. In this paper, we provide an overview of the potential technical challenges for the IoV network. To be more specific, we discuss the communications protocols (including wireless access and routing) and security (including the secured and privacy-preserving communications) for the IoV network.", "paper_title": "Survey on Networking for Internet of Vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000329336200001"}
