In this paper, an efficient backup routing algorithm is proposed for reliable routing based on the uncorrelated degree and delay constraint in CRSNs. Numerical and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively overcome the intermittent connection problem and decrease delay greatly.", "paper_title": "Backup Routing Algorithm Based on Delay Constraint in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364078000001"}
