Based on the engineering knowledge and important parameters, combined with agent technology, this study establishes the transverse beam engineering knowledge coding and a case-based similarity method for door-shaped structures. According to the coding model, we establish an associated case-based knowledgebase to carry out data search and inference application so as to shorten the working time. This study only considers the analytic problems of the natural frequency and stress of transverse beams. Looking at these problems, this study establishes different kinds of boundary conditions and load range in sequential order, as well as the related detail parameter coding. Finally, taking a case study which includes the general direct calculation through programs and the detailed dimension trans-coding as an example, this study establishes an automatic mesh model for finite element analysis to solve the analytical problems of vibration and stress. Through the weighting factor, similarity analysis is conducted to search for the similar cases. Furthermore, taking the most similar case located as the foundation, and matching it with regression analysis, this study carries out revised calculation and comparative investigation to rapidly acquire the analytic results. Thus, the proposed method can also shorten the time required for knowledge searching and design analysis by similar structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
