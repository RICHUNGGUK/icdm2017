Accordingly, holistic approaches are needed to develop and assess hypotheses that incorporate genotypic, phenotypic, and environmental knowledge. This perspective presents translational bioinformatics as a discipline that builds on the successes of bioinformatics and health informatics for the study of complex diseases. The early successes of translational bioinformatics are indicative of the potential to achieve the promise of the Human Genome Project for gaining deeper insights to the genetic underpinnings of disease and progress toward the development of a new generation of therapies.", "paper_title": "Translational bioinformatics: linking knowledge across biological and clinical realms", "paper_id": "WOS:000292061700003"}
