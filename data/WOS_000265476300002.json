The imprecise weights are modeled by intervals and fuzzy intervals. The concepts of possible and necessary optimality under imprecision are recalled. Some efficient methods for evaluating the possible and necessary optimality of elements in the interval-valued problems are proposed. Some efficient algorithms for computing the exact degrees of possible and necessary optimality of elements in the fuzzy-valued problems are designed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
