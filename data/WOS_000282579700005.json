Based on the concept of uncertain process, an uncertain optimal control problem is dealt with. Applying Bellman's principle of optimality, the principle of optimality for uncertain optimal control is obtained, and then a fundamental result called the equation of optimality in uncertain optimal control is given. Finally, as an application, the equation of optimality is used to solve a portfolio selection model.", "paper_title": "UNCERTAIN OPTIMAL CONTROL WITH APPLICATION TO A PORTFOLIO SELECTION MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000282579700005"}
