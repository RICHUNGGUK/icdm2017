The simulations are executed by a simulated annealing-based algorithm with a time-dependent cooling schedule. The neighbourhood relation is determined by the pull-move set. The results provide experimental evidence that the maximum depth D of local minima of the underlying energy landscape can be upper bounded by D < n(2/3). The local search procedure employs the stopping criterion (In/delta)(D/gamma) where m is an estimation of the average number of neighbouring conformations, gamma relates to the mean of non-zero differences of the objective function for neighbouring conformations, and 1-delta is the confidence that a minimum conformation has been found. The bound complies with the results obtained for the ten benchmark problems. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
