In this article, state-of-the-art research achievements and challenges of H-CRANs are surveyed. In particular, we discuss issues of system architectures, spectral and energy efficiency performance, and promising key techniques. A great emphasis is given toward promising key techniques in H-CRANs to improve both spectral and energy efficiencies, including cloud-computing-based coordinated multipoint transmission and reception, large-scale cooperative multiple antenna, cloud-computing-based cooperative radio resource management, and cloud-computing-based self-organizing networks in cloud converging scenarios. The major challenges and open issues in terms of theoretical performance with stochastic geometry, fronthaul-constrained resource allocation, and standard development that may block the promotion of H-CRANs are discussed as well.", "paper_title": "HETEROGENEOUS CLOUD RADIO ACCESS NETWORKS: A NEW PERSPECTIVE FOR ENHANCING SPECTRAL AND ENERGY EFFICIENCIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000347382300018"}
