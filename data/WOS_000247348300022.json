These TFs were identified from both computational prediction and manual curation. We have provided extensive annotations including sequence features, functional domains, GO assignment and expression evidence for all TFs. In addition, DPTF contains cross-links to the Arabidopsis and rice transcription factor databases making it a unique resource for genome-scale comparative studies of transcriptional regulation in model plants.", "paper_title": "DPTF: a database of poplar transcription factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000247348300022"}
