The failure rate for each individual sensor/actuator is described by an individual random variable satisfying a certain probabilistic distribution in the interval [0,theta] (theta >= 1). Attention is focused on the analysis and design of a reliable controller such that the closed loop control system is stable in the mean-square sense and preserves a guaranteed H-infinity performance index in the presence of network-induced delays, stochastic faults of multiple sensors and actuators. A sufficient condition is obtained for the existence of admissible controller by using Lyapunov functional method, and the cone complementarity linearization algorithm is employed to cast the controller design problem into a sequential minimization one subject to linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, the control design method is further extended to more general cases, where the system matrices of the considered plant contain parameter uncertainties, represented in either norm-bounded or polytopic frameworks. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "ROBUST H-infinity CONTROL FOR NETWORKED SYSTEMS WITH PARAMETER UNCERTAINTIES AND MULTIPLE STOCHASTIC SENSORS AND ACTUATORS FAULTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302664400018"}
