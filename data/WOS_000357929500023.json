Given domain specific knowledge, design verification engineers typically specify cross coverage for certain risky areas where bugs tend to appear. This paper proposes a pragmatic coverage model based on cross coverage. We address the verification on user specified cross coverage regions. The proposed analysis models the probability of exposing the bug within a given number of samplings, and derives the expected number of samples until bug detection. The approach is applicable to random, round-robin, and hybrid sampling strategies in recurring and nonrecurring cases based on our cross coverage model. We have written Matlab and C programs that use our formulas to calculate the probabilities. Experimental results show that our analysis is consistent with Monte Carlo simulation.", "paper_title": "A Quantitative Characterization of Cross Coverage", "paper_id": "WOS:000357929500023"}
