This may be effective in intellectual discussions, but it is highly unlikely to be useful to practitioners, especially those practitioners that are facing traditional project pressures and trying to find the \"home ground\" for their situation that will increase the likelihood that they will succeed. In this paper, we discuss extensions to Boehm and Turner's five dimensions for determining a project's \"home ground\" - that is, the process configuration that might best fit the situation at hand. We have added dimensions to the basic framework provided by Boehm and Turner and have considered the process configuration question as a process itself and increased its scope to include both management and engineering key practice areas.", "paper_title": "Configuring hybrid agile-traditional software processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239455200011"}
