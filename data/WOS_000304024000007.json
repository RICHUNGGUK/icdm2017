Design/methodology/approach - The paper's aim is to present the applications in Number Theory of a new method based on alpha-dense curves first developed at the beginning of the 1980s by Yves Cherruault and Arthur Guillez. The alpha-dense curves generalize the space filling curves (Peanocurves,. . .) and fractal curves. This technique can be used for solving all problems of operational research in a simple way. The main idea consists in expressing n variables by means of a single one. Findings - Apply the method to Number Theory. One of the most important applications is related to global optimization. Multivariable optimization problems coming from operational research or from industry can be quickly and easily solved. Originality/value - The paper presents a new method based on alpha-dense curves for solving Diophantine equations.", "paper_title": "Computational resolution of Diophantine equations by means of alpha-dense curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000304024000007"}
