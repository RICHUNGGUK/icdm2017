A full computational model should be able to couple a correct simulation of the rigid body motion of the different train parts with accurate prediction of the solid wave propagation in the ground. This paper integrates the dynamics of the vehicle and the elastic soil into one monolithic system. Equations of motion for the train have been merged the system representing the FEM problem for the rest of the structure. Three models of modern high-speed locomotives were run over a solid finite element model of a rail structure. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
