The tuning procedure is realized via a fuzzy closed-loop system and applied to iterative decentralized controller design for TITO systems whose SISO equivalent processes are generally of complicated types such as high order systems with zeros and even RHP zeros. Some examples have been employed to illustrate the effectiveness and Practicability of the proposed tuning method.", "paper_title": "Iterative decentralized PID tuning based on gain and phase margins for TITO systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247493400016"}
