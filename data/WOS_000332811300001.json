Since 2005, opposition-based learning is a fast growing research field in which a variety of new theoretical models and technical methods have been studied for dealing with complex and significant problems. As a result, an increasing number of works have thus proposed. This paper provides a survey on the state-of-the-art of research, reported in the specialized literature to date, related to this framework. This overview covers basic concepts, theoretical foundation, combinations with intelligent algorithms, and typical application fields. A number of challenges that can be undertaken to help move the field forward are discussed according to the current state of the opposition-based learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
