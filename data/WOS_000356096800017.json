To reduce complexity, a unified design of 1/5 TBCC using two-level puncture is proposed for all different sizes of UCI in this paper. Compared with LTE design, the proposed design is much simpler since there is only one channel encoding scheme in user equipment (UE) and only one decoding algorithm in base station. In addition, the first three generators of the proposed 1/5 TBCC are the same as that of the TBCC in LTE, thus the proposed design is backwards compatible with the original design in LTE. Simulation results show that the frame error rate performance of the proposed two-level punctured TBCC is close to or even better than that of the original block codes with lower decoding complexity.", "paper_title": "A unified design of channel coding for LTE uplink control information", "paper_id": "WOS:000356096800017"}
