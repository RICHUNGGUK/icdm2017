Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that if connection/disconnection frequency is too high, data blocks may be lost. This is true for most of the current DHT-based systems' implementations. To deal with this problem, it is necessary to build more efficient replication and maintenance mechanisms. In this article, we study the effect of churn on PAST, an existing DHT-based P2P system. We then propose solutions to enhance churn tolerance and evaluate them through discrete event simulation.", "paper_title": "RelaxDHT: A Churn-Resilient Replication Strategy for Peer-to-Peer Distributed Hash-Tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000307171100012"}
