In the future, WSNs are expected to be integrated into the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT), where sensor nodes join the Internet dynamically, and use them to collaborate and accomplish their tasks. Because of the communications of WSN will produce a broadcast storm, the Cluster-based Wireless Sensor Network (CWSN) was proposed to ameliorate the broadcast storm. However, the capability of the fault-tolerance and reliability of CWSNs must be carefully investigated and analyzed. To cope with the influence of faulty components, reaching a common agreement in the presence of faults before performing certain tasks is essential. Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed systems. To enhance fault-tolerance and reliability of CWSN, the BA problem in CWSN is revisited in this paper. In this paper, a new BA protocol is proposed that adapts to the CWSN and derives its limit of allowable faulty components, while maintaining the minimum number of message exchanges.
