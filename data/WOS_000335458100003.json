The algorithm relies on temporal correlations and iteratively reconstructs a set of statistically independent sources from arbitrary nonlinear instantaneous mixtures. Simulations show that it is able to invert a complicated nonlinear mixture of two audio signals with a high reliability. The algorithm is based on a mathematical analysis of slow feature analysis for the case of input data that are generated from statistically independent sources.", "paper_title": "An Extension of Slow Feature Analysis for Nonlinear Blind Source Separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000335458100003"}
