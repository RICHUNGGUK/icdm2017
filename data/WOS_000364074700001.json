In this paper, the time-slot scheduling problem for the variable aggregation rate model is presented, and a time-slot scheduling integrating consideration of minimizing the energy consumption named Makeup Integer based Data Aggregation Scheduling (MIDAS) is proposed. The proposed MIDAS scheme integrates two core phases, namely, data aggregation set construction and aggregation set based scheduling algorithm. The key idea of MIDAS is to minimize the number of receiving and sending data packets in hotspot and to reduce the number of aggregated packets in network for better scheduling performance in network lifetime. Furthermore, it is also essential to increase energy utilization efficiency of the nodes in the middle layer by exploiting the remaining energy of peripheral nodes. A series of experiments are simulated to demonstrate that the proposed scheme has significantly increased the network lifetime and the energy utilization efficiency under the different aggregation rates and different network scales. Comparing with the SDAS, the lifetime can be increased by as much as 25%. The energy utilization efficiency can be improved by as much as 30%.", "paper_title": "MIDAS: A Data Aggregation Scheduling Scheme for Variable Aggregation Rate WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000364074700001"}
