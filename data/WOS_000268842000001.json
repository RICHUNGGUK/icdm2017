Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is the best methodology for developing new services and integrating them with adaptability the ability to respond to changing and new requirements. In this paper, we propose a framework for ensuring data quality between composite services, which solves semantic data transformation problems during service composition and detects data errors during service execution at the same time. We also minimize the human intervention by learning data constraints as a basis of data transformation and error detection. We developed a data quality assurance service based on SOA, which makes it possible to improve the quality of services and to manage data effectively for a variety of SOA-based applications. As an empirical study, we applied the service to detect data errors between CRM and ERP services and showed that the data error rate could be reduced by more than 30%. We also showed automation rate for setting detection rule is over 41% by learning data constraints from multiple registered services in the field of business.", "paper_title": "FRAMEWORK FOR DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE BETWEEN COMPOSITE SERVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000268842000001"}
