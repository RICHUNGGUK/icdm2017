First, candidate modes and coding orders are predicted, based on inter-layer and spatial correlations. Three early termination methods are then proposed based on CGS encoding structure. Finally, all candidate modes are checked sequentially, according to their predicted order with three early termination conditions, to improve the coding speed. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm could reduce the encoding time by an average of 84.39%, with negligible coding efficiency losses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
