Worman and J. M. Keil proved it to be polynomially tractable (Polygon decomposition and the orthogonal art gallery problem, IJCGA 17(2) (2007), 105-138). However, since their algorithm has (O) over tilde (n(17))-time complexity, where (O) over tilde (.) hides a polylogarithmic factor, and thus it is not practical, in this paper we present a linear-time 3-approximation algorithm. Our approach is based upon the novel partition of an orthogonal polygon into so-called o-star-shaped orthogonal polygons.", "paper_title": "LINEAR-TIME 3-APPROXIMATION ALGORITHM FOR THE r-STAR COVERING PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000308706700001"}
