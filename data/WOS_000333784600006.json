Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) uses Multipoint Relay (MPR) to flood Topology Control (TC) message while reducing redundant retransmissions. The downside of reducing duplicated retransmission is vulnerability of the transmitted packet to the packet error, collision, or hidden nodes. In this paper, we propose a multipoint relay selection method for robust broadcast in a wireless ad hoc network. The proposed method selects additional MPR nodes so that it can cover 2-hop MPR nodes m times not to cover all 2-hop neighbor nodes m times. The number of additional MPR nodes is analyzed using mathematical modeling and simulations. The proposed method can improve network throughput as well as delivery ratio compared with the original MPR selection method of OLSR. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
