Many countries have created new laws and legal procedures, developed new technologies, and enhanced education and research in this emerging field. Japan is no exception. In this paper, we first provide a nutshell of the Japanese political structures, legal systems, and law enforcement practice, and then present an overview of updated and new laws, awareness programs, and the research activities in digital forensics. Our views on the current issues and future work are also discussed. We believe that the result of our study will provide an opportunity for the world to see what has been done and what we are doing in this field in Japan. Meanwhile, it also provides a foundation to advance the digital forensics research and development in Japan as well as in the world.
