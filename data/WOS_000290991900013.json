The proposed control system consists of an adaptive PID controller and a fuzzy compensation controller. The adaptive PID controller is a main tracking controller, and the parameters of the adaptive PID controller are online tuned by the derived adaptation laws. In this design, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technology is adopted to search the optimal learning-rates of the adaptive PID controller to increase the learning speed. The design of the fuzzy compensation controller can guarantee the stability of the control system. Since system-on-programmable-chip (SoPC) has several benefits including low cost, high speed, and small volume, the developed control scheme is implemented in the SoPC-based hardware. Finally, simulation and experimental results of the magnetic levitation system have been performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "SoPC-Based Adaptive PID Control System Design for Magnetic Levitation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000290991900013"}
