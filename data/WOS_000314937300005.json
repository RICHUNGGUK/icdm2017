It is well known that power control increases system capacity, improves Quality of Service (QoS), and reduces multiuser interference. In this paper, an adaptive power control design based on the identification of the underlying pathloss dynamics of the fading channel is presented. Formulating power control decisions based on the measured received power levels allows modeling the fading channel pathloss dynamics in terms of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Applying the online HMM identification algorithm enables accurate estimation of the real pathloss ensuring efficient performance of the suggested power control scheme.", "paper_title": "Uplink Power Control via Adaptive Hidden-Markov-Model-Based Pathloss Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000314937300005"}
