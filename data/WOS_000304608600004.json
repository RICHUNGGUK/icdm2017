The highlight of our paper lies in two aspects. First, we focus on the distribution of information among multiple senders and receivers. Second, each receiver can simultaneously reconstruct a qubit state containing the joint information from all senders. These properties imply that our protocols may have many extensive applications in burgeoning quantum network communication. Our protocols cover a variety of class, i.e. two-to-three, N-to-three, and N-to-M. Through introducing the quantum fourier transform, the set of orthogonal basis in the M-dimensional Hilbert space is ingeniously constructed. Moreover, we present all the recovery operations in details. The success probability and the classical communication costs are also given.", "paper_title": "N-TO-M JOINT REMOTE STATE PREPARATION OF 2-LEVEL STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000304608600004"}
