As it is known, conservative compact finite volume schemes have high resolution properties while WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) schemes are essentially non-oscillatory near flow discontinuities. We extend the idea of WENO schemes to some classical finite volume compact schemes [30], where lower order compact stencils are combined with WENO nonlinear weights to get a higher order finite volume compact-WENO scheme. The newly developed positivitypreserving limiter [43,42] is used to preserve positive density and internal energy for compressible Euler equations of fluid dynamics. The HLLC (Harten, Lax, and van Leer with Contact) approximate Riemann solver [37,4] is used to get the numerical flux at the cell interfaces. Numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the high-order accuracy, positivity-preserving, high-resolution and robustness of the proposed scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
