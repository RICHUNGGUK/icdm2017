In this paper, we compare the strength of these three families of inequalities. In particular we study how well each family approximates the integer hull. We show that, in a well defined sense, triangle inequalities provide a good approximation of the integer hull. The same statement holds for quadrilateral inequalities. On the other hand, the approximation produced by split inequalities may be arbitrarily bad.", "paper_title": "On the relative strength of split, triangle and quadrilateral cuts", "paper_id": "WOS:000286218600004"}
