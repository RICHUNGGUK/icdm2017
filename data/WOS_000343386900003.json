In this paper, spatial big data mining is presented under the characteristics of geomatics and big data. First, spatial big data attracts much attention from the academic community, business industry, and administrative governments, for it is playing a primary role in addressing social, economic, and environmental issues of pressing importance. Second, humanity is submerged by spatial big data, such as much garbage, heavy pollution and its difficulties in utilization. Third, the value in spatial big data is dissected. As one of the fundamental resources, it may help people to recognize the world with population instead of sample, along with the potential effectiveness. Finally, knowledge discovery from spatial big data refers to the basic technologies to realize the value of big data, and relocate data assets. And the uncovered knowledge may be further transformed into data intelligences.", "paper_title": "Spatial Data Mining: A Perspective of Big Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000343386900003"}
