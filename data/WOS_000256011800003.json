One of the best known algorithm, the Broadcast Incremental Power (BIP) protocol, constructs an efficient spanning tree rooted at a given node. It offers very good results in terms of energy savings, but its computation is centralized and it is a real problem in ad hoc networks. Distributed versions have been proposed, but they require a huge transmission overhead for information exchange. Other localized protocols have been proposed, but none of them has ever reached the performances of BIP. In this paper, we propose and analyze an incremental localized version of this protocol. In our method, the packet is sent from node to node based on local BIP trees computed by each node in the broadcasting chain. Local trees are constructed within the k-hop neighborhood of nodes, based on information provided by previous nodes, so that a global broadcasting structure is incrementally built as the message is being propagated through the network. Only the source node computes an initially empty tree to initiate the process. Discussion and results are provided where we argue that k = 2 is the best compromise for efficiency. We also discuss potential conflicts that can arise from the incremental process. We finally provide experimental results showing that this new protocol obtains very good results for low densities, and is almost as efficient as BIP for higher densities.", "paper_title": "Localized broadcast incremental power protocol for wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000256011800003"}
