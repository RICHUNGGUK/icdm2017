Competitiveness requires not only delivering the product, but also delivering the best associated services for operation, maintenance and support. In parallel, the products and their environments are more and more complex, requiring systematic usage of digital means in order to model and to simulate the product, within multi-disciplines teams distributed in several companies all along the lifecycle of the product. In addition, achieving continuous interoperability of enterprise applications supporting the collaborative processes within an evolutionary environment is an important challenge. This paper will present a federative interoperability framework for technical enterprise applications, and more particularly its usage in combination with Dynamic Network Management within the framework of the IMAGINE European project. Federative interoperability framework and extended hypermodel for interoperability will contribute to achieve sustainable interoperability.
