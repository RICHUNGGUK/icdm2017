Most of the existing density control algorithms are based on isotropic sensing model. However, directional sensor networks, whose nodes meet directional sensing model, have great application chances. In this paper, we propose a Coverage-Preserving Density Control Algorithm (CPDCA) for directional sensor networks, which can effectively turn off redundant directional nodes to reduce network energy consumption and extend the network lifetime while maintaining a considerable ability of network coverage. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our solution, and we give detailed discussions on the effects of different system parameters.", "paper_title": "A Coverage-Preserving Density Control Algorithm for Directional Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263407200005"}
