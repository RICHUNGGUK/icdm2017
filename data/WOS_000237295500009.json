These devices must be able to discover services dynamically and share them safely, taking into account ad-hoc networks requirements such as limited processing and communication power, decentralised management, and dynamic network topology, among others. Legacy solutions fail in addressing these requirements. In this paper, we propose a service discovery protocol with security features, the Secure Pervasive Discovery Protocol. SPDP is a fully distributed protocol in which services offered by devices can be discovered by others, without a central server. It is based on an anarchy trust model, which provides location of trusted services, as well as protection of confidential information, secure communications, or access control.", "paper_title": "Secure service discovery based on trust management for ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237295500009"}
