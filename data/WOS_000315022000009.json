Data hiding plays an important role to protect medical images. Because modern medical devices have improved, high resolutions of medical images are provided to detect early diseases. The high quality medical images are used to recognize complicated anatomical structures such as soft tissues, muscles, and internal organs to support diagnosis of diseases. For instance, 16-bit depth medical images will provide 65,536 discrete levels to show more details of anatomical structures. In general, the feature of low utilization rate of intensity in 16-bit depth will be utilized to handle overflow/underflow problem. Nowadays, most of data hiding algorithms are still experimenting on 8-bit depth medical images. We proposed a novel reversible data hiding scheme testing on 16-bit depth CT and MRI medical image. And the peak point and zero point of a histogram are applied to embed secret message k bits without salt-and-pepper.", "paper_title": "Reversible and High-Capacity Data Hiding in High Quality Medical Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000315022000009"}
