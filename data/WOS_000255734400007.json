We assume that data are exchanged under given condition of quality (offered or required) and prices. Data offer may include bundling schemes, whereby different types of data are offered together with a single associated price and quality. We describe a brokering algorithm for obtaining data from peers, by minimizing the overall cost under quality requirements constraints. The algorithm extends query processing techniques over multiple database schemas to automatically derive an integer linear programming problem that returns an optimal matching of data providers to data consumers under realistic economic cost models.
