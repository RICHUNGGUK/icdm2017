In k-EoRiffL group signatures, signers can sign on behalf of a group anonymously and unlinkably up to a permitted number of times (k) per event. No party, even the group manager, can revoke the anonymity of the signer. On the other hand, everyone can identify the signer if he signs more than k times for a particular event. We then show that k-EoRiffL group signatures can be used for k-times anonymous authentication(k-TAA), compact e-cash, e-voting, etc. We formally define security model for the new notion and propose constant-size construction, that is, size of our construction is independent of the size of the group and the number of permitted usage k. Our construction is secure based on the q-strong Diffie-Hellman assumption and the y-DDHI assumption.", "paper_title": "Event-oriented k-times revocable-iff-linked group signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474000019"}
