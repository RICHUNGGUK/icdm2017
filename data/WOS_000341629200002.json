Then, by employing Lyapunov method and LaSalle-type theorem established above, we obtain some sufficient conditions ensuring the attractor and stochastic boundedness for stochastic infinite delay neural networks with Markovian switching. Finally, an example is also discussed to illustrate the efficiency of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Attractor and Stochastic Boundedness for Stochastic Infinite Delay Neural Networks with Markovian Switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000341629200002"}
