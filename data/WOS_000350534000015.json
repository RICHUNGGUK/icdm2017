However, the power estimation CAD tools for FinFET are missing at the moment, which mainly results from the absence of FinFET power analysis and FinFET power model. Three key factors for FinFET power model are: the dimension of the look-up-tables, that to find out the most significant factors that influence FinFET power and to make them as indexes for the look-up-tables; the distance between sampling points; and the interpolation method. In this paper, various factors that may contribute to the FinFET power consumption are evaluated. Of all the factors, the continuous ones are compared with sensitivity method. As to other discrete factors, methods of building them in power model are given according to the features of the each factor and the way it influences the power. Based on the simulation result, standard cell power library model for FinFET is proposed. The research work lays foundation for accurate power analysis and modeling for high-level power analysis of FinFET circuits. Besides, these key factors are also crucial for low-power FinFET circuit design.", "paper_title": "Key characterization factors of accurate power modeling for FinFET circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000350534000015"}
