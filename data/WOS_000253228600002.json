Particular attention is paid to the antecedents and consequences of two types of influence strategies-exercising power and offering IOS support-that a buyer firm often uses in increasing IOS usage with its suppliers. The research model is empirically tested with data obtained through a field survey from a sample of 233 suppliers, each exchanging electronic data interchange (EDI) documents with a nationally known retailing buyer in the United States. We find that the buyer's decision to offer EDI-related support to a supplier is negatively associated with the transaction volume with the supplier but positively with the supplier's IT capabilities as well as the supplier's transaction-specific investments made toward the relationship with the buyer. On the other hand, the buyer's decision to exercise power to a supplier is found to be negatively associated with the transaction volume between the trading partners. Our findings also indicate that offering EDI support, rather than exercising power, is more effectual in inducing greater EDI usage between the trading partners. Finally, the buyer's EDI support is found to be positively associated with suppliers' perceived benefits of using EDI in the relationship that, in turn contributes to more voluntary use of EDI with the buyer.", "paper_title": "Understanding the development of IOS-based trading partner relationships: A structural model with empirical validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253228600002"}
