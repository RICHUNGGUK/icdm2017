In this research, we have created a notation that makes the filtration process the central syntactic construction of the MSPR. As a result, we achieve lower redundancy and higher modularity than is possible using the mathematical notation commonly associated with stochastic programming. To experiment with our ideas, we have created StAMPL, a specialized modeling tool for the MSPR that is based on the AMPL modeling language. StAMPL implements our notation and converts models written in our notation to instances that can be solved using standard methods. Using this approach, we are able to represent models in a very clean, simple, and scalable format while maintaining almost all the power of the AMPL language.", "paper_title": "StAMPL: A Filtration-Oriented Modeling Tool for Multistage Stochastic Recourse Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000265756900005"}
