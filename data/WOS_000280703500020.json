It consists of three stages: filtering input sequences, identifying local similarities and post-processing local similarities. As input sequence data are released from memory after the filtering stage, genome-scale datasets can be efficiently compared in a single run. Bridges also includes 20 parameters, which enable the user to dictate the sensitivity and specificity of a search.", "paper_title": "Bridges: a tool for identifying local similarities in long sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000280703500020"}
