We pay particular attention to digital signatures, symmetric-key encryption, and leakage resilience. We find that there has been a surprising amount of uncertainty about what the \"right\" definitions might be. Even when definitions have an appealing logical elegance and nicely reflect certain notions of security, they fail to take into account many types of attacks and do not provide a comprehensive model of adversarial behavior.", "paper_title": "ANOTHER LOOK AT SECURITY DEFINITIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000315413900002"}
