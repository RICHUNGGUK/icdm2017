Comput. Phys. 2007; 223:262-297) that can be used to maintain sharp material interfaces. The method takes the form of an artificial compression which is designed so that the material indicator jumps across only a few cells but which does not excite physical instabilities in the flow. The advantages of the approach include its simplicity and flexibility in that it provides a parameter that effectively determines the captured interface thickness.
