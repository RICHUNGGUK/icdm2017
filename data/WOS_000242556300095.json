Because PMD possesses the time-varying and statistical properties, to establish an effective control algorithm for adaptive or automatic PMD compensation is a challenging task. Widely used control algorithms are the gradient-based peak search methods, whose main drawbacks are easy being locked into local sub-optima for compensation and no ability to resist noise. In this paper, we introduce a new evolutionary approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO), into automatic PMD compensation as feedback control algorithm. The experiment results showed that PSO-based control algorithm had unique features of rapid convergence to the global optimum without being trapped in local sub-optima and good robustness to noise in the transmission line that had never been achieved in PMD compensation before.", "paper_title": "An application of intelligent PSO algorithm to adaptive compensation for polarization mode dispersion in optical fiber communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300095"}
