To specify the property of streams, a multimedia stream is modeled as an (m,k)-firm stream that is known to have the characteristics of weakly hard real-time system. In addition, a distributed, measurement-based routing scheme for (m,k)-firm streams is newly proposed while considering several constraints on node as well as on communication medium. Simulations and their analysis are provided to validate the suitability of traffic modeling, reduced dynamic failure probability, and extended network lifetime when the proposed routing protocol is employed.
