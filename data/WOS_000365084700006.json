The networks are modeled as systems of ordinary differential equations based on mass conversation laws on directed graphs with limited flow capacities on the links and constant external inflows at certain origin nodes. Under monotonicity assumptions on the routing policies, it is proven that, if the external inflow at the origin nodes does not violate any cut capacity constraints, then there exists a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium, and the network achieves maximal throughput. On the contrary, should such a constraint be violated, the network overload behavior is characterized. In particular, it is established that there exists a cut with respect to which the flow densities on every link grow linearly over time (respectively, reach their respective limits simultaneously) in the case where the buffer capacities are infinite (respectively, finite).", "paper_title": "Throughput Optimality and Overload Behavior of Dynamical Flow Networks Under Monotone Distributed Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000365084700006"}
