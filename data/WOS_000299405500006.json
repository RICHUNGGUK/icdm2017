In the current clinical routine this is done manually by analyzing the 3-D CT image slice by slice to find nodes, evaluate them quantitatively, and assign labels to them for describing the clinical and pathologic extent of metastases. In this paper we present a method to automate the process of lymph node detection and labeling by creation of a mediastinal average image and a novel lymph node atlas containing probability maps for mediastinal, aortic, and N1 nodes. Utilizing a fast deformable registration approach to match the atlas with CT images of new patients, our method can maintain an acceptable runtime. In comparison to previously published methods for mediastinal lymph node detection and labeling it also shows a good sensitivity and positive predictive value. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
