In addition, online collaborative communication represents a practical and a constructivist method to transmit the knowledge and experience from the teacher to students, overcoming physical distance and isolation. This paper describes the extension of two open source tools: 1) the learning management system Moodle, and 2) the tool to create VRLs Easy Java Simulations (EJS). Our extension provides: 1) synchronous collaborative support to any VRL developed with EJS (i.e., any existing VRL written in EJS can be automatically converted into a collaborative lab with no cost), and 2) support to deploy synchronous collaborative VRLs into Moodle. Using our approach students and/or teachers can invite other users enrolled in a Moodle course to a real-time collaborative experimental session, sharing and/or supervising experiences at the same time they practice and explore experiments using VRLs.", "paper_title": "Providing Collaborative Support to Virtual and Remote Laboratories", "paper_id": "WOS:000328694400003"}
