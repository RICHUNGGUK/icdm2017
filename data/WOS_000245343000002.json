A deterministic causal recurrent network relates a random initial state to an ordered final state. A perceptron-like, feed-forward network provides a memory mechanism that links the final states to the original initial states. A non-supervised learning mechanism that selects which final states are defined as goals to be retrieved together with initial states leading to them. Causal sequences of states are transformed into procedures directed towards the achievements of goals. We propose a mechanism through which goals and their achievement in goal-directed actions can be emerging properties of self-organizing networks, not initially endowed with intentionality. This allows for a monist, non-mentalist description which does not need to resort to intentional mental states as causes of intentional actions. Cognitive, neurophysiological and philosophical implications are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
