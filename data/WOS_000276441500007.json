The prototypes take cues from user led innovation and provide multiple avatars that allow individuals to define and manage their own virtual identity. This paper briefly maps the evolution of the prototypes and then describes how the pre-defined, colour-coded avatars in the latest version are being given greater context and personalization through the use of digital images. This not only gives 'serendipity a nudge' by allowing groups to come together more easily, but also provides contextual information that can reduce gratuitous contact.", "paper_title": "Conveying identity with mobile content", "paper_id": "WOS:000276441500007"}
