These models were implemented, simulated, and visualized using the Modelica modelling and simulation language [P. Fritzson, Principles of object-oriented modelling and simulation with modelica 2.1 Wiley-IEEE Press, USA, 2004.] and an associated tool. The differences and similarities between the MathModelica Model Editor and three other ecological modelling tools have also been evaluated. The results show that the models can well be modelled and simulated in the MathModelica Model Editor, and that nitrogen decrease in a constructed treatment wetland should be described and simulated using the Nitrification/Denitrification model as this model has the highest overall quality score and provides a more variable environment.
