The existing privacy-preserving work cannot deal with vulnerability in sensitivity, under which an attacker can effectively infer the victim's sensitivity of the sensitive value with limited knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy model, (V, L)-anonymity, to avoid sensitivity vulnerability while having the capabilities of the existing PPDP models. This model considers the difference among sensitive values (SV) and applies SV classification, named as sensitivity levels. The model can be applied not only to the single attribute, but also to multiple sensitive attributes situation. We use (l(1), l(2))-diversity to validate the capability of our model theoretically. We carry out extensive experiments to verify the improvement on effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we present a Levels of Sensitive Values (LSV) measure to calculate the sensitivity level.", "paper_title": "Privacy beyond sensitive values", "paper_id": "WOS:000358136300014"}
