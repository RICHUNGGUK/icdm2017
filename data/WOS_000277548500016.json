Color differences, texture similarity, image complexity, etc. are taken into account to measure the distance between two images. Based on this distance, a dynamic programming algorithm is used to generate the best playing sequence which minimizes the sum of distances between successive images. The embedded image is naturally merged with the current one for smooth sequence through a graph-cut-guided blending strategy, and interframe coherence is maintained to avoid abrupt change. Experiments show that our approach is very effective on image collections of scenic spots.", "paper_title": "Making Slide Shows with Zoomquilts", "paper_id": "WOS:000277548500016"}
