However, the paradoxical relationship between ESN implementation and the promised benefits has been attributed to employees' underutilization. Our research focuses on factors influencing employees' decision to use ESN in their work role and draws on case studies of two multinational professional service firms (PSFs) based in Australia. Qualitative data were collected during ten semi-structured interviews with employees from both organizations, to determine their perceptions of ESN usage and capture the factors that influence their use behavior. The findings illustrate that the likelihood of ESN use is significantly influenced by technological, organizational, social and individual factors. A successful ESN use within an organization involves the nexus between these four factors and recommendations are made, as guidelines for organizational actors about how ESNs usage can be increased.", "paper_title": "Exploring Factors Influencing the Use of Enterprise Social Networks in Multinational Professional Service Firms", "paper_id": "WOS:000359482900003"}
