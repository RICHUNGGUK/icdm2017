In this paper, we describe the application of two middleware frameworks in an integrated fashion to provide a scalable and efficient system for execution of seismic data analysis on large datasets in a distributed environment. We investigate different strategies for efficient querying of large datasets and parallel implementations of a seismic image reconstruction algorithm. Our results on a state-of-the-art mass storage system coupled with a high-end compute cluster show that our implementation is scalable and can achieve about 2.9 Gigabytes per second data processing rate - about 70% of the maximum 4.2GB/s application-level raw I/O bandwidth of the storage platform.", "paper_title": "Supporting scalable and distributed data subsetting and aggregation in large-scale seismic data analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000239512200009"}
