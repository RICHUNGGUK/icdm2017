The fact that the optimization process is subject to the presence of uncertainty concerning asset returns is likely to lead to unreliable solutions. This work suggests extending the classic mean-variance optimization problem with a third explicit robustness objective. This results on sets of portfolios that can be subsequently grouped together according to their reliability. This additional information allows for a better informed decision making regarding asset allocation.", "paper_title": "Extended mean-variance model for reliable evolutionary portfolio optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000336524000008"}
