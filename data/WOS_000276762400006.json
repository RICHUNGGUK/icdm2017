This approach leads to dynamic models of lower order, based on a partition in slow, dominant and fast modes. In the reduced models, slow dynamics are incorporated as non-linear manifold consistent with mean-field theory. Fast dynamics are stochastically treated and can be lumped in eddy-viscosity approaches. The employed interaction models between slow, dominant and fast dynamics respect momentum and energy balance equations in a mathematically rigorous manner unlike unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes models or Smagorinsky-type reductions of the Navier Stokes equation. The proposed system reduction strategy is employed to the cylinder wake benchmark.
