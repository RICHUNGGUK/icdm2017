A (quantum) fingerprinting scheme maps a binary string of length n to d (qu)bits, typically d << n, such that given any string y and a fingerprint of x, one can decide with high accuracy whether x = y. It can be seen that a classical fingerprint of x that guarantees error <= epsilon necessarily reveals Omega(min {n, log(1/epsilon)}) bits of information about x. We call a scheme hiding if it reveals o(min {n, log(1/epsilon)}) bits; accordingly, no classical scheme is hiding. We construct quantum hiding fingerprinting schemes. Our schemes are computationally efficient and their hiding properties are shown to be optimal.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM FINGERPRINTS THAT KEEP SECRETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000324004300003"}
