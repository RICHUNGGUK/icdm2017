Using a survey of 34,514 respondents from myYearbook.com, the research reported in this paper is an inferential analysis of information seeking and sharing behaviours in the ecommerce domain on four social networking sites (Facebook, MySpace, myYearbook and Twitter). Using k-means clustering analysis, we find clusters within this demographic based on levels of being connected on and being engaged with social networking services. Research results show that the majority of this demographic have accounts on multiple social networking sites, with more than 40% having profiles on three social networking sites and an additional 20% having four social networking accounts. We also investigate the motivations for using different social media sites, showing that the reasons for engaging differ among sites. Companies and organizations interested in marketing to this demographic cannot cluster social networking users for more personalized targeting of advertisements and other information.", "paper_title": "Classifying ecommerce information sharing behaviour by youths on social networking sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000289408600002"}
