Exemplars that belong to the source region are segmented based on their features. To express characteristics of exemplars such as shapes of structures and smoothness of textures, the Harris corner response and the variance of pixel values are employed as a feature vector. Enhancements on restoration plausibility and processing speedup are achieved as shown in the experiments.", "paper_title": "Exemplar-Based Inpainting Driven by Feature Vectors and Region Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589800027"}
