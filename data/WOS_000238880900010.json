In particular, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is derived for the general case of multiple input multiple output (SIMO) UWB-IR systems and used to compare the ultimate performance of three basic transmit schemes, thereinafter referred to as single input multiple output (SIMO), MIMO equal signaling (MIMO-ES), and MIMO orthogonal signaling (MIMO-OS) ones. Thus, the noncoherent NIL synchronizer is developed for the better performing transmit scheme (i.e., the SIMO one) and its performance is evaluated under both signal acquisition and tracking operating conditions. The performance gain in the synchronization of UWB-IR signals arising by the utilization of the multi-antenna technology is also evaluated.", "paper_title": "Multi-antenna noncoherent ML synchronization for UWB-IR faded channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000238880900010"}
