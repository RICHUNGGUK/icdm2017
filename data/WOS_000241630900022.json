This paper considers an attack scenario where an adversary who encrypts the PI for backup purpose tries to hide the plain PI in a valid-looking ciphertext without being detected. We show that the standard security notion IND-CCA2 does not capture such a scenario. For example, the Cramer-Shoup scheme is vulnerable to such an attack. To capture such a scenario, we define a new notion of \"ciphertext-auditability\" as a new property of public key encryption schemes (PKESs). It requires that, given a public key and a ciphertext, anyone should be able to verify whether the ciphertext was actually generated using the public key. Also, it requires that, given a public key and a plaintext, no adversary should be able to generate a valid-looking ciphertext so that the verification passes, but nevertheless the plaintext can be recovered from the ciphertext without the corresponding secret key. We propose a general construction of such PKESs based on standard cryptographic primitives in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "Ciphertext-auditable public key encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630900022"}
