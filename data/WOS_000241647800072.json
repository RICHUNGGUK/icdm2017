It combines general knowledge with contextual cues, being ingrained with both faceted and evolving objects, such as musical language, execution style, or even taste. In the present work we introduce BREVE, a system for tonal analysis. BREVE automatically learns to analyse music using the recently developed framework of conditional models. The system is presented and assessed on a corpus of Western classical pieces from the 18(th) to the late 19(th) Centuries repertoire. The results are discussed and interesting issues in modeling this problem are drawn.", "paper_title": "A conditional model for tonal analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800072"}
