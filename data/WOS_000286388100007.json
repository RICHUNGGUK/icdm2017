A message initially convinces a set of vertices, called the seeds, of the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n, p). Whenever more than a rho is an element of (0, 1) fraction of a vertex nu's neighbors are convinced of the message, nu will be convinced. The spreading proceeds asynchronously until no more vertices can be convinced. This paper derives lower bounds on the minimum number of initial seeds, min-seed(n, p, delta, rho), needed to convince a delta is an element of {1/n, ..., n/n} fraction of vertices at the end. In particular, we show that (1) there is a constant beta > 0 such that min-seed(n, p, delta, rho) = Omega (min{delta, rho}n) with probability 1 - n(-Omega(1)) for p >= beta (ln(e/min{delta,rho}))/(rho n) and (2) min-seed(n, p, delta, 1/2) = Omega(delta n/ln(e/delta)) with probability 1 - exp(-Omega(delta n)) - n(-Omega(1)) for all p is an element of [0, 1]. The hidden constants in the Omega notations are independent of p.", "paper_title": "Spreading of Messages in Random Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000286388100007"}
