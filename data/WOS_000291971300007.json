Shift handovers and transfers are both regular features of hospital work but there is currently great variation in how such handovers are conducted, presenting a challenge for those seeking to develop technology to support handover. This article presents the ConStratO model of handover, which captures aspects of the context that influence how the handover is conducted, a range of different handover strategies relating to different aspects of the handover and possible outcomes of handover. The model is based on detailed data collection in a range of clinical settings. We present the model as a tool for developing and evaluating technology support for handover.", "paper_title": "The ConStratO model of handover: a tool to support technology design and evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000291971300007"}
