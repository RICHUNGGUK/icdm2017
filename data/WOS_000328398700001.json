In our research, we systematically examine the requirements and then propose a new architecture for museum/exhibition guidance service; we further, based on ZigBee and ontology, implemented a new guide device and a new guidance and recommendation system. The contributions include (1) an extendable and comprehensive architecture for guidance service; (2) an automatic and personalized guidance service system; (3) overcoming the limitations and weaknesses of conventional guidance systems short distance limitation and network saturation problem in crowded environments; and (4) on-line user status monitoring and real-time recommendation service.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of ZigBee-Ontology-Based Exhibit Guidance and Recommendation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000328398700001"}
