The proposed stochastic framework makes use of the idea covariance matrix to reach this goal. Also, in order to reach the maximum efficiency of the reconfiguration strategy, reliability indices are considered along with the traditional targets in the multi-objective framework. Therefore, the objective functions to be optimized are System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), Average Energy Not Supplied (AENS), total active power losses and the total network costs. Since the problem investigated is a complex, nonlinear optimization problem, a new optimization method based on krill herd algorithm (KH) is introduced. In addition, a new modification method is proposed for the KH algorithm to improve its total search ability. The feasibility and performance of the proposed method are examined on the IEEE standard test system.", "paper_title": "A sufficient stochastic framework based on U-transform to solve the practical reconfiguration strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800044"}
