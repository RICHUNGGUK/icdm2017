First, SVR model and its online training algorithm are introduced. A kernel cache method is used to accelerate the online training algorithm, which makes it suitable for real-time control application. Then it is used in internal model control (fMC) for online constructing internal model and designing the internal model controller. Output errors of the system are used to control online SVR algorithm, which made the whole control system a closed-loop one. Last, the fast online SVM based adaptive internal model control was used to control a benchmark nonlinear system. Simulation results show that the controller has simple structure, good control performance and robustness.", "paper_title": "Fast online SVR algorithm based adaptive internal model control", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000136"}
