Based on envelope detection, the system employs a down converter, a digitally controlled oscillator, a low-pass filer (LPF), a rectifier, a comparator, and a digital control unit to realize spectrum sensing with 10-bit frequency representation. With variable-gain function of the LPF, signal strength can be measured and presented with a 5-bit signal strength index.", "paper_title": "Searching for Spectrum Holes: A 400-800 MHz Spectrum Sensing System", "paper_id": "WOS:000365206300009"}
