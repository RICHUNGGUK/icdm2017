The samples are generated using coalescence simulations permitting various demographic scenarios and the program uses an infinite sites model to generate polymorphism data for the samples. By generating serially sampled population-genetic data, COMPASS allows investigating properties of polymorphism data that has been collected at different time points, and aid in making inference from ancient polymorphism data.", "paper_title": "COMPASS: a program for generating serial samples under an infinite sites model", "paper_id": "WOS:000271106800018"}
