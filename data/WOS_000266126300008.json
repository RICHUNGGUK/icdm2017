Next, back-stepping control law is derived to make the error signals between drive 2D discrete-time chaotic system and response 2D discrete-time chaotic system with two uncertain parameters asymptotically synchronized. Finally, the approach is extended to the synchronization problem for 3D discrete-time chaotic system with two unknown parameters. Numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed chaos synchronization scheme.", "paper_title": "ANTICIPATED FUNCTION SYNCHRONIZATION WITH UNKNOWN PARAMETERS OF DISCRETE-TIME CHAOTIC SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266126300008"}
