First, we use the homographic transformation to simulate the distortion between two corresponding patches around the feature points. Then, binary descriptors are constructed by comparing the intensity of sample points surrounding the feature location. We transform the location of the sample points with simulated homographic matrices. This operation is to ensure that the intensities which we compared are the realistic corresponding pixels between two image patches. Since the exact perspective transform matrix is unknown, an Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) algorithm-based iterative procedure is proposed to estimate the real transformation angles. Experimental results obtained on five different datasets show that PBRIEF outperforms significantly the existing methods on images with large viewpoint difference. Moreover, the efficiency of our framework is also improved comparing with Affine-Scale Invariant Feature Transform (ASIFT).", "paper_title": "PERSPECTIVE-INVARIANT IMAGE MATCHING FRAMEWORK WITH BINARY FEATURE DESCRIPTOR AND APSO", "paper_id": "WOS:000346223100004"}
