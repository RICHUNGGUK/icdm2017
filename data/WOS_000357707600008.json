However, the new mined knowledge will be useless if data is fake, or sometimes the massive amounts of data cannot be collected due to the worry on the abuse of data. This situation asks for new security solutions. On the other hand, the biggest feature of Big Data is \"massive\", which requires that any security solution for Big Data should be \"efficient\". In this paper, we propose a new identity-based generalized signcryption scheme to solve the above problems. In particular, it has the following two properties to fit the efficiency requirement. (1) It can work as an encryption scheme, a signature scheme or a signcryption scheme as per need. (2) It does not have the heavy burden on the complicated certificate management as the traditional cryptographic schemes. Furthermore, our proposed scheme can be proven-secure in the standard model.
