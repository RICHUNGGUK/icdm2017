The established 2D-QSAR model shows not only significant statistical quality, but also predictive ability, with the square of adjusted correlation coefficient R-A(2) of 0.869 and the square of the crossvalidation coefficient q(2) of 0.834 as well as the square of predictive correlation coefficient R-pred(2) of 0.867 for the test set. The 3D-QSAR model also shows good correlative and predictive capabilities in terms of R-2 (0.993) and q(2) (0.674) when CoMFA fields are used for the whole studied compounds. The results from 2D- and 3D-QSAR analyses conformably show that the steric interaction plays a crucial role in determining the cytotoxicity of the compounds and that selecting a moderate-size substituent R as well as increasing the negative charge Of C-28 at the same time are advantageous to improving the antitumor activity. Such results might offer some useful theoretical references for understanding the action mechanism and directing the molecular design of this kind of compound with antitumor activity.", "paper_title": "Combined 2D-and 3D-QSAR study on analogues of ARC-111 with antitumor activity", "paper_id": "WOS:000257477000007"}
