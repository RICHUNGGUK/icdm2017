Such constraints may be used to model various industrial situations, for instance the production of perishable products. We present theoretical results concerning two-machine cases, we prove that the two-machine permutation flowshop with constant maximal time lags is strongly NP-hard. We develop an optimal branch and bound procedure to solve the m-machine permutation flowshop problem with minimal and maximal time lags. We test several lower bounds and heuristics providing upper bounds on different classes of benchmarks, and we carry out a performance analysis. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
