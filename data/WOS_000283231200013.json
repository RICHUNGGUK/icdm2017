However, as observed in most neural network implementations, tuning all the parameters of the network may cause learning complicated, poor generalization, overtraining and unstable. Unlike conventional neural network theories, this brief gives a constructive proof for the fact that a decay RBF neural network with n + 1 hidden neurons can interpolate n + 1 multivariate samples with zero error. Then we prove that the given decay RBFs can uniformly approximate any continuous multivariate functions with arbitrary precision without training. The faster convergence and better generalization performance than conventional RBF algorithm, BP algorithm, extreme learning machine and support vector machines are shown by means of two numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Constructive Approximation to Multivariate Function by Decay RBF Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000283231200013"}
