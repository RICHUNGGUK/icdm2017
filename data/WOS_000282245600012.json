The excitation vector of ambient noise is efficiently obtained at the near-end and then combined with the excitation signal of the far-end for a suitable reinforcement gain within the G.729 CS-ACELP Annex. B framework. For this reason, this can be clearly different from previous approaches in that the present approach does not require an additional arithmetic step such as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Experiinental results indicate that the proposed method shows better performance than or at least comparable to conventional approaches with a lower computational burden.", "paper_title": "Efficient Speech Reinforcement Based on Low-Bit-Rate Speech Coding Parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000282245600012"}
