To conduct the interval-valued data mining, we conduct two investigations: (1) construct the interval-valued information system, and (2) conduct the interval-valued knowledge discovery. In constructing the interval-valued information system, we first make the paired attributes in the database discovered, and then, make them stored in the neighbour locations in a common database and regard them as 'one' new field. In conducting the interval-valued knowledge discovery, we utilise some related priori knowledge and regard the priori knowledge as the control objectives; and design an approximate closed-loop control mining system. On the implemented experimental platform (prototype), we conduct the corresponding experiments and compare the proposed algorithms with several typical algorithms, such as the Apriori algorithm, the FP-growth algorithm and the CLOSE+ algorithm. The experimental results show that the interval-valued information system method is more effective than the conventional algorithms in discovering interval-valued patterns.", "paper_title": "A framework for interval-valued information system", "paper_id": "WOS:000306409300002"}
