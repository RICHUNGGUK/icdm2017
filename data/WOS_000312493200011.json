The plant is identified as a fuzzy combination of Takagi-Sugeno type linear models, and the fuzzy controller is optimized by genetic algorithms according to both the tracking performance and the attenuation level. The procedure applies the lately proposed idea of the fuzzy Lyapunov function that is less conservative then the traditional Lyapunov function candidate approach, and ensures H-infinity robust tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by the fuzzy tracking control of an uncertain chaotic system with external disturbance.", "paper_title": "Optimal fuzzy tracking control of uncertain nonlinear systems based on genetic algorithms and fuzzy Lyapunov function", "paper_id": "WOS:000312493200011"}
