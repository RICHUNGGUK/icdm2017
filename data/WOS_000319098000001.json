The main purpose of this paper is to overcome this inability. One of the methods for ranking efficient DMUs is minimizing the Coefficient of Variation (CV) for inputs-outputs weights, which, was suggested by Bal et al. (2008). In this paper, we modify the model and introduce two new models for ranking efficient DMUs based on Norm 1 and using means of inputs-outputs weights. To illustrate purpose, numerical examples are given.
