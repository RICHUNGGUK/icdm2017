The coded streams are then linearly precoded using the encoding matrix of a perfect linear dispersion space-time code. At the receiver side, integer-forcing equalization is applied, followed by standard single-stream decoding. It is shown that this communication architecture achieves the capacity of any Gaussian MIMO channel up to a gap that depends only on the number of transmit antennas.", "paper_title": "Precoded Integer-Forcing Universally Achieves the MIMO Capacity to Within a Constant Gap", "paper_id": "WOS:000346980400022"}
