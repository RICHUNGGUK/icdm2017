In the current study, using 30 us molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures, an aqueous activation was detected for T1 lipase. This aqueous activation in T1 lipase was mainly caused by a double-flap movement mechanism. The double flaps were constituted by the hydrophobic helices 6 and 9. Helix 6 employed two major components with the hydrophilic part at the surface and the hydrophobic part inside. In the aqueous solution, the hydrophobic part could provide enough power for helix 6 to move away, driving the protein into an open configuration and exposing the catalytic triad. Our findings could provide structural evidence to support the double-flap movement, revealing the catalytic mechanism or T1 lipase.", "paper_title": "Molecular Dynamics Studies on T1 Lipase: Insight into a Double-Flap Mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000277911600015"}
