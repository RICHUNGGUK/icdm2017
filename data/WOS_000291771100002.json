In this context, we develop a level-set framework specifically dedicated to the detection of annular shapes. Thanks to a fast solution to the least-squares fitting problem of similar patterns, our model handles the segmentation task efficiently with a single level-set function. The behavior of this approach is illustrated on images from various fields. An evaluation is then performed for the myocardium detection in MRI and ultrasound cardiac images. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
