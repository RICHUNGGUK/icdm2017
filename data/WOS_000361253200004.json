Though methodological and technological support for developing these systems has been achieved to a relatively high degree, means to provide objective identification and justification of automation opportunities are currently lacking. Objective: In this paper, a method for the identification of automation opportunities is introduced. Method: This method relies on the quantification of information waste in existing engineering processes. Results and Conclusions: A detailed case study application in the service engineering domain shows the feasibility and applicability of the developed method. Summaries of two other case studies are provided to highlight the generalizability to engineering processes from other lifecycle domains (design; production). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
