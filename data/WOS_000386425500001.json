Our goal is to provide users with the highest possible level of control over the error-generation process, and at the same time develop solutions that scale to large databases. We show in the paper that the error-generation problem is surprisingly challenging, and in fact, NP-complete. To provide a scalable solution, we develop a correct and efficient greedy algorithm that sacrifices completeness, but succeeds under very reasonable assumptions. To scale to millions of tuples, the algorithm relies on several non-trivial optimizations, including a new symmetry property of data quality constraints. The trade-off between control and scalability is the main technical contribution of the paper.", "paper_title": "Messing Up with BART: Error Generation for Evaluating Data-Cleaning Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000386425500001"}
