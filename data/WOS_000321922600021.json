Our calculation results reveal that interfacial interaction increases with increasing numbers of epoxy monomers on the surface of SWCNTs. Furthermore, density of states (DOS) results showed no orbital hybridization between the epoxy monomers and nanotubes. Mulliken charge analysis shows that the epoxy polymer carries a positive charge that is directly proportional to the number of monomers. The Young's modulus of the nanotubes was also studied as a function of monomer content. It was found that, with increasing number of monomers on the nanotubes, the Young's modulus first decreases and then approaches a constant value. The results of a SWCNT pullout simulation suggest that the interfacial shear stress of the epoxy/SWCNT complex is approximately 68 MPa. These results agreed well with experimental results, thus proving that the simulation methods used in this study are viable.", "paper_title": "Density functional theory study of epoxy polymer chains adsorbing onto single-walled carbon nanotubes: electronic and mechanical properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000321922600021"}
