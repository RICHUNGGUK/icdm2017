XiP allows the construction of workflows by linking components written in both R and Java, the analysis of high-throughput data in grid engine systems and also the development of customized pipelines that can be encapsulated in a package and distributed. XiP already comes with several ready-to-use pipeline flows for the most common genomic and transcriptomic analysis and similar to 300 computational components.", "paper_title": "XiP: a computational environment to create, extend and share workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000312654600025"}
