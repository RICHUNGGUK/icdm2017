[J Comput Phys 2005:209:290-321], the boundary point method (BPM) is a newly developed boundary-type meshless method enjoying the favorable features of both the method of fundamental solution (MFS) and the boundary element method (BEM). The present paper extends the BPM to the numerical analysis of linear elasticity. In addition to the constant moving elements, the quadratic moving elements are introduced to improve the accuracy of the stresses near the boundaries in the post processing and to enhance the analysis for thin-wall structures. Numerical tests of the BPM are carried out by benchmark examples in the two- and three-dimensional elasticity. Good agreement is observed between the numerical and the exact solutions.
