In this study, the effects of several parameters which may affect the wall deflections were investigated. These parameters are (1) wall embedment length; (2) tamping distance; (3) impact energy per blow; (4) blow counts: (5) soil types on the supporting side of sheet pile walls; and (6) wall stiffness. The effects of these parameters were quantified and discussed, and the factors that help to reduce wall deflections were identified. A series of figures which depict the effects of these parameters were generated. Finally, some suggestions and recommendations for design and construction were reached. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
