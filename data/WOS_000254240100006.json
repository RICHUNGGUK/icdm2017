By combining different partial motions, we can generate new motion sequences. We select the most natural-looking combinations by analyzing the similarity of partial motions, using techniques such as motion segmentation, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. These new combinations can dramatically increase the size of a motion database, allowing more score in selecting motions to meet constraints, such as collision avoidance. We verify the naturalness and physical plausibility of the new motions using an SVM learning model and by analysis of static and dynamic balance.", "paper_title": "Enriching a motion database by analogous combination of partial human motions", "paper_id": "WOS:000254240100006"}
