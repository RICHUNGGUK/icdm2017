A new concept of FTS is introduced and sufficient conditions for a switched impulsive system to be finite-time stable are presented by using switched Lyapunov functions. Some results of FTS of impulsive systems and switched systems can be obtained from this article as special cases, respectively. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Finite-time stability of nonlinear switched impulsive systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000315656100008"}
