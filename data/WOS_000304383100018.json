The situation becomes even more challenging when outsourced data sources in a cloud environment are managed by multiple outsourcers who hold different access rights. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and novel tree-based key management scheme that allows a data source to be accessed by multiple parties who hold different rights. We ensure that the database remains secure, while some selected data sources can be securely shared with other authorized parties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
