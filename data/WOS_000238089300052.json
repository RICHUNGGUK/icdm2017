This paper reviews the related work and programs of this field first, and then explores the mechanism which leads to Game Addiction (GA) from the perspective of inner architecture of game. We find that game addiction is due to the PS-DA cycle embedded in games, and provide a method to control and utilize GA from the source of edutainment game development. Furthermore, we discuss the possibilities of implanting the PS-DA mechanism into instruction and general activities.", "paper_title": "PS-DA model of game addiction: Theoretical hypothesis and case analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300052"}
