Based on the results of maximizing the RDE, we develop a supervised feature extraction algorithm called regularized discriminant entropy analysis (RDEA). RDEA is quite simple and requires no approximation in theoretical derivation. The experiments with several publicly available data sets show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with encouraging results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
