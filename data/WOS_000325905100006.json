Indeed, nu-CA are cellular automata which can have different local rules at each site of their lattice. The assignment of local rules to sites of the lattice completely characterizes nu-CA. In this paper, sets of assignments sharing some interesting properties are associated with languages of bi-infinite words. The complexity classes of these languages are investigated providing an initial rough classification of nu-CA. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
