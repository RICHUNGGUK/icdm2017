First, image normalization is used for the invariance of translation and scaling, then the magnitudes of Bessel-Fourier moments of normalized image are computed, which have rotation invariance and are used to construct the feature image regarded as watermarking. Experimental results and analyses show that the proposed method has strong robustness to various attacks, such as blurring, JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, rotation, scaling, Stirmark and print_photocopy_scan. Compared to the congener zero-watermarking schemes and Zernike moment, the developed method has better performance.", "paper_title": "Bessel-Fourier moment-based robust image zero-watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000349356400009"}
