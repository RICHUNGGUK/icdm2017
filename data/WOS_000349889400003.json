In this paper, we present the browser-based gDelta tool, which aims to provide grammar engineers with more immediate feedback on the impact of changes made to a grammar by comparing parser output from two different grammar versions. We describe an attribute weighting algorithm for highlighting components of the grammar that have been strongly impacted by a modification to the grammar, as well as a technique for clustering test suite items whose parsability has changed, in order to locate related groups of effects. These two techniques are used to present the grammar engineer with different views on the grammar to inform them of different aspects of change in a data-driven manner.", "paper_title": "gDelta: a missing link in the grammar engineering toolchain", "paper_id": "WOS:000349889400003"}
