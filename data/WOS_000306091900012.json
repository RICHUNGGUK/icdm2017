Our method consists of three stages: region segmentation, region description and region classification. The performance of our region segmentation method guarantees that if a polyp is present in the image, it will be exclusively and totally contained in a single region. The output of the algorithm also defines which regions can be considered as non-informative. We define as our region descriptor the novel Sector Accumulation-Depth of Valleys Accumulation (SA-DOVA), which provides a necessary but not sufficient condition for the polyp presence. Finally, we classify our segmented regions according to the maximal values of the SA-DOVA descriptor. Our preliminary classification results are promising, especially when classifying those parts of the image that do not contain a polyp inside. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
