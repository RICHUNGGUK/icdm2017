This method is based on the perturbation theory and Laplace transformation. The proposed technique allows us to obtain an approximate solution in a series form. The computed results are in good agreement with the results of Adomian decomposition method. Results are presented graphically and in tabulated forms to study the efficiency and accuracy of method. The present approach provides a reliable technique, which avoids the tedious work needed by classical techniques and existing numerical methods. The nonlinear time-dependent drainage model is solved without linearizing or discretizing the nonlinear terms of the equation. The method does not require physically unrealistic assumptions, linearization or discretization in order to find the solutions of the given problems.", "paper_title": "A method for solving nonlinear time-dependent drainage model", "paper_id": "WOS:000322139500018"}
