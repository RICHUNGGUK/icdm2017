The main contribution of this paper is a discussion of the design and functioning of a fully integrated platform for multimedia adaptation and delivery, called NinSuna. This platform is able to efficiently deal with the aforementioned heterogeneity in the present-day multimedia ecosystem, thanks to the use of format-agnostic adaptation engines (i.e., engines independent of the underlying coding format) and format-agnostic packaging engines (i.e., engines independent of the underlying delivery format). Moreover, NinSuna also provides a seamless integration between metadata standards and adaptation processes. Both our format-independent adaptation and packaging techniques rely on a model for multimedia bitstreams, describing the structural, semantic, and scalability properties of these multimedia streams. News sequences were used as a test case for our platform, enabling the user to select news fragments matching his/her specific interests and usage environment characteristics.", "paper_title": "NinSuna: a fully integrated platform for format-independent multimedia content adaptation and delivery using Semantic Web technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000273480300010"}
