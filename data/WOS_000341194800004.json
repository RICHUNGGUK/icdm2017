Our results generalize the classical result for G(n,p), when p = c logn/n. We draw n independent points X-i from a general distribution on a separable metric space, and let their indices form the vertex set of a graph. An edge (i,j) is added with probability min(1, kappa(X-i, X-j) log n/n), where kappa >= 0 is a fixed kernel. We show that, under reasonably weak assumptions, the connectivity threshold of the model can be determined.
