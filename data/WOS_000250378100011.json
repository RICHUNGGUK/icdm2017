Improvements, effect of the different setting parameters, and functionality of the algorithm are shown in the scope of classical structural optimization problems. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by three benchmark structural optimization tasks. Results show the ability of the proposed methodology to find better optimal solutions for structural optimization tasks than other optimization algorithms. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
