How to handle the different effects of various historical data to the forecasting results is also a trouble. By employing the properties of the adaptive modeling technique and the forecasting precise model, this paper presents a new RFF-based adaptive prediction (RAP) approach. The approach use the weighted recursive least square estimate method with variable forgetting factor to estimate model parameters, and apply the forecasting precise criterion to guarantee model optimization. By using the approach, the parameter estimates and even the structure coefficients can be automatically updated to obtain the optimal forecasting results. An illustrative example indicates that the proposed approach produces higher accurate results against with several traditional forecasting algorithms.", "paper_title": "A study on the RAP approach and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400102"}
