However, from the efficiency view, many proposed proxy signature schemes in these literatures are not satisfying and cannot fit to the mobile communication. Therefore, there is a desire to design efficient proxy signature schemes. Based on Boneh et al.'s pairing-based short signature, this paper presents two proxy signature schemes. One is proxy-protected signature scheme, and the other is proxy aggregate signature scheme. Since both of them can achieve high efficiency, it is believed that they are specially suitable for mobile communication environment.", "paper_title": "Designing efficient proxy signature schemes for mobile communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000252470500007"}
