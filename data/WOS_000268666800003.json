However, no attention has been paid to other fuzzy weighted means such as fuzzy weighted geometric mean (FWGM), fuzzy weighted harmonic mean (FWHM) and the like. This paper presents a very general fuzzy weighted mean, which we refer to as generalised fuzzy weighted mean (GFWM). It includes FWA, FWGM, FWHM, fuzzy weighted quadratic mean (FWQM) and fuzzy weighted root-power mean (FWRM) as its special cases. Linear programming models for solving GFWM and its special cases are developed and the order relationships among FWA, FWGM and FWHM are investigated. Numerical examples that illustrate the computational processes of FWA, FWGM and FWHM are provided and their order relationships are numerically examined.", "paper_title": "Generalised fuzzy weighted mean and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000268666800003"}
