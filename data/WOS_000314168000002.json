Two kinds of stochastic time-varying communication delays, namely stochastic discrete delays and stochastic distributed delays, are simultaneously considered. The purpose of the addressed filtering problem is to design a filter such that, for the admissible random measurement missing and communication delays, the filtering error dynamics is asymptotically stable in the mean square with a prescribed H 8 performance index. In terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, a sufficient condition is established that ensures the asymptotical stability in the mean square with a prescribed H 8 performance index of the filtering error dynamics and then the filter parameters are characterised by the solution to an LMI. A numerical example is introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedures.", "paper_title": "H infinity filtering for discrete-time singular networked systems with communication delays and data missing", "paper_id": "WOS:000314168000002"}
