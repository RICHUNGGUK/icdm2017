Partially traced categories were later introduced to account for cases where the trace is not always defined, and it was shown that partially traced category can always be seen as a subcategory of a totally traced one. We give a new proof of this representation theorem, using a construction that is different from the original one. However, since they satisfy the same universal property they are naturally isomorphic.", "paper_title": "Representation of Partial Traces", "paper_id": "WOS:000372714600004"}
