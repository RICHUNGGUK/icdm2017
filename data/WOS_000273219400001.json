Previous broadcast algorithms exploit the greedy routing mechanisms of a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to achieve the scalability. However, they suffer from load unbalancing and high overhead for constructing and maintaining a distributed broadcast tree (DBT). This paper presents DHT-based lightweight broadcast algorithms to overcome these limitations. Our algorithms leverage the topology and routing mechanism of Chord to select appropriate children of each node in a top-down approach. According to the node identifier distribution of Chord, we propose two broadcast algorithms over DHT. When nodes are uniformly distributed in the identifier space, a token-based broadcast algorithm is proposed, where each node selects the finger nodes as its children by a token value. When nodes are arbitrarily distributed in the identifier space, a partition-based broadcast algorithm is proposed, where each node partitions its identifier space into two subspaces and selects the agent nodes in the subspaces as its children. We show theoretically and experimentally that both token-based and partition-based algorithms can implicitly build a balanced DBT from the novel routing paths of DHT, where the branching factor is at most two and the tree height is O(log n) in a Chord of n nodes, without extra space for storing children and additional overhead for explicitly maintaining the parent-child membership.
