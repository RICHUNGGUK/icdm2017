The proposed AVEF model has the advantage of preventing active contours from moving across object boundary's weak edges with strong neighbors while keeping the desirable properties of the VEF model, such as large capture range and fast computation time. The experiments conducted on synthetic and real images show the high performance of the AVEF model on image segmentation. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
