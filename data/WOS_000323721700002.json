The metadata is in the form of linguistic tags attached to items in an on-line domain. We formulate four hypotheses about the structure implicit in a set of tags and evaluate them using data from public tag sets. The results confirm three of the four hypotheses and show that it is feasible for ontological information - specifically subclass relationships - to be made explicit and hence available for inferencing.", "paper_title": "Exposing, formalizing and reasoning over the latent semantics of tags in multimodal data sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000323721700002"}
