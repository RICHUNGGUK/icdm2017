Specifically, wearable technology and robotics can enable a user to collect the required human signals in a comfortable way. HealthIoT is the basic infrastructure for realizing health surveillance, and should be flexible to support multiple application demands and facilitate the management of infrastructure. Therefore, enlightened by the software defined network, we put forward a smart healthcare oriented control method to software define health monitoring in order to make the network more elastic. In this article, we design a centralized controller to manage physical devices and provide an interface for data collection, transmission, and processing to develop a more flexible health surveillance application that is full of personalization. With these distinguished characteristics, various applications can coexist in the shared infrastructure, and each application can demand that the controller customize its own data collection, transmission, and processing as required, and pass the specific configuration of the physical device. This article discusses the background, advantages, and design details of the architecture proposed, which is achieved by an open-ended question and a potential solution. It opens a new research direction of HealthIoT and smart homes.", "paper_title": "SOFTWARE DEFINED HEALTHCARE NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000367729400010"}
