Instead of applying one zig-zag scan to all transform blocks, the proposed method applies a field scan to a horizontally predicted block, a horizontal scan to a vertically predicted block, and a zig-zag scan to blocks predicted in other prediction modes. Experiments based on JM9.6 were performed using only intra coding. Results of the experiments show that the proposed method yields an average PSNR enhancement of 0.16 dB and a maximum PSNR enhancement of 0.31 dB over the current H.264 using zig-zag scan.", "paper_title": "Adaptive transform coefficient scan for H.264 intra coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000250094800028"}
