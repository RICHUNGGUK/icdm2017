If the solution is pointwise bounded, we prove that finite difference approximations of those classes of equations can be closed with two orders less accuracy at the boundary without reducing the global order of accuracy. This result is generalised to initial-boundary value problems with an mth-order principal part. Then, the boundary accuracy can be lowered m orders. Further, it is shown that schemes using summation-by-parts operators that approximate second derivatives are pointwise bounded. Linear and nonlinear computations, including the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, corroborate the theoretical results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
