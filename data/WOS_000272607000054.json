And then a time-discrete response system with negative feedback and impulsive effect is designed. Some sufficient conditions are given to ensure that the drive-response systems are globally impulsively exponentially synchronized. At last, the effective and the feasibility of the drive-response systems are illustrated by some numerical examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
