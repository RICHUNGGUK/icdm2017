Although CAD, CAPP and CAM technology has advanced greatly, the links between these systems are still weak. Currently the information from CAD and CAPP systems cannot be interpreted directly by CAM systems. It is the users who interpret the information and make the connection between CAD and CAM systems. The current method to generate tool paths and NC programs, especially machining geometry preparation, involves extensive manual interactions in a CAM system. To improve production efficiency further, a tighter CAD/CAM integration is needed to automate the design-to-manufacturing process. The paper discusses the automation of tool path generation in an integrated CAD/CAPP/CAM system based on machining features. Machining features are utilized to carry machining geometry information from CAPP to CAM systems. An integration layer between FBMach and Unigraphics is implemented to achieve an integrated CAD/CAPP/CAM system based on machining features. The integration layer makes product information as well as process information available immediately in an electronic form for the preparation of tool paths. The integrated system automates the process of tool path generation from solid models and significantly reduces user interactions and the amount of time preparing tool paths.", "paper_title": "Automatic tool path generation of a feature-based CAD/CAPP/CAM integrated system", "paper_id": "WOS:000237805900005"}
