The objectives of this study were to evaluate the applicability of FE for analyzing GRS two-tier walls with various offset distances and to investigate the performance and behavior of GRS two-tier walls in various stress states. The FE simulations were first verified according to the centrifuge test results by comparing the locations of failure surfaces. The FE results were then used to investigate the effective overburden pressure, mobilization and distribution of reinforcement tensile loads, and horizontal deformation at the wall faces. The interaction between two tiers was investigated based on the FE results, which were also used to examine the modeling assumption of reinforcement tensile loads in limit equilibrium (LE) analysis and to evaluate the design methods in current design guidelines. This study demonstrated favorable agreement between FE and the centrifuge model in locating the failure surface. The FE results indicated that as the offset distance increased, the reinforcement tensile load and wall deformation decreased in both the upper and lower tiers, suggesting the attenuation of interaction between the two tiers. The maximum tensile loads of all reinforcement layers at the wall failure predicted using FE analysis and LE method assuming uniform distribution of reinforced tensile loads were comparable. Compared with the FE results, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) design guidelines are conservative in determining the effect of overburden pressure, required tensile strength, location of maximum tension line (for designing the reinforcement length), and the critical offset distance. Furthermore, the FHWA design guidelines do not account for the influence of the lower tier on the upper tier that was observed in this study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
