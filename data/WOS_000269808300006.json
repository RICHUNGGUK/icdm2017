However, for STDP to contribute to the synaptic organization, its learning curve should satisfy a requirement that the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) is approximately the same as that of long-term depression (LTD). Without such balance between LTP and LTD, all the synapses are potentiated toward the upper limit or depressed toward the lower limit. Therefore, in this study, we explore the mechanisms by which the LTP/LTD balance in STDP can be modulated adequately. We examine a plasticity model that incorporates an activity-dependent feedback (ADFB) mechanism, wherein LTP induction is suppressed by higher postsynaptic activity. In this model, strengthening an ADFB function gradually decreases the temporal average of the ratio of the magnitude of LTP to that of LTD, whereas enhancing background inhibition augments this ratio. Additionally, correlated inputs can be strengthened or weakened depending on whether the correlation time is shorter or longer than a threshold value, respectively, suggesting that STDP may lead to either Hebbian or anti-Hebbian plasticity Outcomes. At an intermediate range of correlation times, the reversal between the two distinct plasticity regimes can Occur by changing the level of ADFB modulation and inhibition, providing a physiological mechanism for neurons to select from functionally different forms of learning rules.
