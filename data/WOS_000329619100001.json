Given a set P of n points in the plane, source and destination points s, taP, and an integer k > 0, one has to locate k Steiner points, such that the length of the longest edge of a bottleneck path between s and t is minimized. In this paper, we present an O(nlog(2) n)-time algorithm that computes an optimal solution, for any constant k. This problem was previously studied by Hou et al. (in Wireless Networks 16, 1033-1043, 2010), who gave an O(n (2)logn)-time algorithm. We also study the dual version of the problem, where a value lambda > 0 is given (instead of k), and the goal is to locate as few Steiner points as possible, so that the length of the longest edge of a bottleneck path between s and t is at most lambda. Our algorithms are based on two new geometric structures that we develop-an (alpha,beta)-pair decomposition of P and a floor (1+epsilon)-spanner of P. For real numbers beta >alpha > 0, an (alpha,beta)-pair decomposition of P is a collection of pairs of subsets of P, satisfying the following: (i) For each pair , both minimum enclosing circles of A (i) and B (i) have a radius at most alpha, and (ii) for any p, qaP, such that |pq|a parts per thousand currency sign beta, there exists a single pair , such that paA (i) and qaB (i) , or vice versa. We construct (a compact representation of) an (alpha,beta)-pair decomposition of P in time O((beta/alpha)(3) nlogn). In some applications, a simpler (though weaker) grid-based version of an (alpha,beta)-pair decomposition of P is sufficient. We call this version a weak (alpha,beta)-pair decomposition of P. For epsilon > 0, a floor (1+epsilon)-spanner of P is a (1+epsilon)-spanner of the complete graph over P with weight function w(p,q)=aOES|pq|aOE <. We construct such a spanner with O(n/epsilon (2)) edges in time O((1/epsilon (2))nlog(2) n), even though w is not a metric. Finally, we present two additional applications of an (alpha,beta)-pair decomposition of P. In the first, we construct a strong spanner of the unit disk graph of P, with the additional property that the spanning paths also approximate the number of substantial hops, i.e., hops of length greater than a given threshold. In the second application, we present an O((1/epsilon (2))nlogn)-time algorithm for computing a one-sided approximation for distance selection (i.e., given k, , find the k'th smallest Euclidean distance induced by P), significantly improving the running time of the algorithm of Bespamyatnikh and Segal.", "paper_title": "The Euclidean Bottleneck Steiner Path Problem and Other Applications of (alpha,beta)-Pair Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000329619100001"}
