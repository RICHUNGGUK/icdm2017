Three types of self-dual codes are defined. For each type, the possible values alpha;beta such that there exist a self-dual code C subset of Z(2)(alpha) x Z(4)(beta) are established. Moreover, the construction of such a code for each type and possible pair (alpha; beta) is given. The standard techniques of invariant theory are applied to describe the weight enumerators for each type. Finally, we give a construction of self-dual codes from existing self-dual codes.", "paper_title": "CHARACTERIZATION AND CONSTRUCTIONS OF SELF-DUAL CODES OVER Z(2) x Z(4)", "paper_id": "WOS:000307876400003"}
