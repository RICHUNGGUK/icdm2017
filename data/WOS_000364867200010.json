Moreover, this design could easily identify and reclaim the space released by file systems. Experiments based on benchmark traces show significant performance improvement of garbage collection with limited system overheads.", "paper_title": "Efficient Victim Block Selection for Flash Storage Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000364867200010"}
