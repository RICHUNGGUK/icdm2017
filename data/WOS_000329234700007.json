(Multiscale Model. Simul. 4(4):1091-1115, 2005) and Gilboa and Osher (Multiscale Model. Simul. 7:1005-1028, 2008) we introduce new nonlocal operators to interpret the nonlocal means filter (NLM) as a regularization of the corresponding Dirichlet functional. Then we use these nonlocal operators to propose a new nonlocal H (1) model, which is (slightly) different from the nonlocal H (1) model of Gilboa and Osher (Multiscale Model. Simul. 6(2):595-630, 2007; Proc. SPIE 6498:64980U, 2007). The key point is that both the fidelity and the smoothing term are derived from the same geometric principle. We compare this model with the nonlocal H (1) model of Gilboa and Osher and the nonlocal means filter, both theoretically and in computer experiments. The experiments show that this new nonlocal H (1) model also provides good results in image denoising and closer to the nonlocal means filter than the H (1) model of Gilboa and Osher. This means that the new nonlocal operators yield a better interpretation of the nonlocal means filter than the nonlocal operators given in Gilboa and Osher (Multiscale Model. Simul. 7:1005-1028, 2008).", "paper_title": "A New Nonlocal H (1) Model for Image Denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000329234700007"}
