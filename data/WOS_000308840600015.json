Design/methodology/approach - In view of this, based on the statistical data compilation of the Universities of Science and Technology of China from 2002 to 2008, the visual diagrams, econometric model and grey incidence model were used to analyze the situation of the technology innovation and technology transformation on the combined learning with research in Jiangsu. Then, the conceptual model and the organization management pattern for network-based Industry-University-Research collaboration was put forward. Findings - The results are convincing the new web-based knowledge flow model in this paper could overcome barriers in the knowledge flow process of the Industry-University collaboration with the innovation and the integration of the cross-border and also promote the exchange of knowledge especially for tacit knowledge and value-added mobile and can also improve the regional technological innovation ability and technology transformation capabilities. Originality/value - The paper succeeds in constructing the web-based knowledge flow model to develop the Industry-University collaboration and help improve regional innovation and technology transformation.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the technology innovation and technology transformation capacity and network-based optimization pattern for regional.
