The proposed eye detection system is based on a hierarchy cascade Float-Boost classifier combined with an MLP neural net post classifier. The system firstly locates the face and eye candidates' areas in the whole image by a hierarchical Float-Boost classifier. Then geometrical and relative position information of eye-pair and the face are extracted. These features are input to a MLP neural net post classier to arrive at an eye/non-eye decision. Experimental results show that our cellular phone embedded eye detection system can accurately locate double eyes with less computational and memory cost. It runs at 400ms per image of size 256x256 pixels with high detection rates on a SANYO cellular phone with ARM926EJ-S processor that lacks floating-point hardware.", "paper_title": "A hierarchical Float-Boost and MLP classifier for mobile phone embedded eye location system", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000004"}
