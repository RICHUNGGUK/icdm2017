The questionnaire was evaluated using four types of moving images; playing a TV game using an HMD or a TV, viewing images with and without stabilization of camera shake, viewing a movie with and without colour break-up and viewing either a stereoscopic movie (anaglyph method) or a nonstereoscopic movie. Factor analysis revealed five factors: (1) Eye Strain, (2) General Discomfort, (3) Nausea, (4) Focusing Difficulty and (5) Headache, which were effective for classifying motion images.
