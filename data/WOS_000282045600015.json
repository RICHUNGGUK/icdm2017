It is shown that for static dense TH-IR UWB wireless sensor network, which sensor nodes are distributed in a square of unit area according to a Poisson point process of intensity n, the lower bound on the lifetime is Omega ( (root n/log root n)(alpha) (2)), where alpha > 2 is the path loss exponent, thus dense TH-IR UWB wireless sensor network is fit to be employed in large-scale network. For static extended TH-IR UWB wireless sensor network which sensor nodes are distributed in a square [0, root n] x [0, root n] according to a Poisson point process of unit intensity, the lower bound on the lifetime is Omega( (log root n)(2-alpha)/n), therefore large-scale extended network will lead to shorten network lifetime. The results also indicate that the lower bound on the lifetime in the ideal case is longer than that of a static network by a factor of n(1/2) (log root n)(alpha-4) . Hence mobility of sensor nodes can improve network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Lower bounds on lifetime of ultra wide band wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282045600015"}
