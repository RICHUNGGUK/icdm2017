The expression for the R-FOG system's demodulation curve under RIM is obtained. Through numerical simulation with different RIM coefficients and modulation frequencies, we find that a zero deviation is induced by the RIM effect on the demodulation curve, and this zero deviation varies with the RIM coefficient and modulation frequency. The expression for the system error due to this zero deviation is derived. Simulation results show that the RIM-induced error varies with the RIM coefficient and modulation frequency. There also exists optimum values for the RIM coefficient and modulation frequency to totally eliminate the RIM-induced error, and the error increases as the RIM coefficient or modulation frequency deviates from its optimum value; however, in practical situations, these two parameters would not be exactly fixed but fluctuate from their respective optimum values, and a large system error is induced even if there exists a very small deviation of these two critical parameters from their optimum values. Simulation results indicate that the RIM-induced error should be considered when designing and evaluating an R-FOG system.", "paper_title": "Residual intensity modulation in resonator fiber optic gyros with sinusoidal wave phase modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000339378100007"}
