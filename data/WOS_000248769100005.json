The generalized particle model (GPM) transforms the optimization process into the kinematics and dynamics of massive particles in a force-field. The GPM approach has many advantages in terms of the high-scale parallelism, multi-objective optimization, multi-type coordination, multi-degree personality, and the ability to handle complex factors. Simulations show the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed GPM approach to optimize the enterprise computing. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
