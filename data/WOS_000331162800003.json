In this paper, we propose an XML privacy protection model by separating the structure and content, and with cloud storage to save content information and Trusted Third Party (TTP) to help manage structure information. To protect data privacy more effectively, we will create different Document Type Definition (DTD) views for different users according to users' privacy practice and the provider's privacy preferences. To further speed up the process of gaining access to data we will adopt the start-end region encoding scheme to encode the nodes in XML document and DID views. The experiment result shows that this mechanism has a good performance in space and time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
