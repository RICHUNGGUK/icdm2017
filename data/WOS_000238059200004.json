This paper presents a peer-to-peer system relying on the partitionning of a de Bruijn graph. The proposed system integrates mechanisms that perform index and storage load balancing. Index load refers to the network traffic incurred by a peer in managing an object index, while storage load refers to the storage space and network traffic required to store objects. The proposed mechanisms allow to effectively distribute both index load and storage load according to the peers' capacities.", "paper_title": "A structured peer-to-peer system with integrated index and storage load balancing", "paper_id": "WOS:000238059200004"}
