We make use of a vector formalism in which vectors consist of a first subvector containing a set of missing samples and a second one containing a set of available context samples. The missing subvector is reconstructed by a minimum mean square error estimator which employs a probability density function (pdf) obtained by KDE. As in any kernel-based method, the main issue to deal with is the estimation of an appropriate kernel bandwidth. We propose an adaptive procedure for bandwidth estimation (BE) especially conceived for signal reconstruction. Thus, unlike general KDE or kernel-based regression, which try to obtain a general fit, the focus of this BE procedure is on the specific missing subvector. Also, in order to exploit local signal correlations, our BE proposal adopts a scaling approach in which the bandwidth is computed as the local covariance matrix scaled by two factors. These two scale factors are obtained by minimization of two different approximations to the reconstruction error. The resulting reconstruction methodology is tested on a spatial error concealment (EC) application in which intracoded images have been transmitted through an error prone channel. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed approach over a wide range of existing EC techniques.", "paper_title": "Kernel-Based MMSE Multimedia Signal Reconstruction and Its Application to Spatial Error Concealment", "paper_id": "WOS:000344720200020"}
