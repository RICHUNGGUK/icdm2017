This paper surveys and discusses in-network querying and tracking services for static and mobile networks. Querying and tracking services are categorized by tree-based, hierarchical cluster-based, geometrical and hash-based. Mobility effects of network units and several design metrics including energy-efficiency, distance-sensitivity, scalability and fault-tolerance are also discussed. The paper includes open research issues for querying and tracking services in various domains. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
