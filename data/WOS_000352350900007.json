This study develops three hypotheses built on the perspective of the upper echelons and Harrison and Klein's (2007) diversity typology. Focusing on age diversity and using a board of directors as a unit of analysis, this study empirically tests the effects of each type of age diversity on corporate performance in a sample of European listed firms for the year 2009. This study advances the understanding of board behavior and its relationships with corporate results, and presents a new approach to study age diversity from an integrated point of view.", "paper_title": "Age Diversity: An Empirical Study in the Board of Directors", "paper_id": "WOS:000352350900007"}
