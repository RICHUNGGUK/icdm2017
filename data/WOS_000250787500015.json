Protective anticipatory movement is built upon several actions that have been identified in the psychology literature as response mechanisms in monkeys and in humans. These actions are parameterized by a model of the approaching object (the threat) and are defined as procedural rules. We present a hybrid forward and inverse kinematic blending technique to guide the character to the pose that results from these rules while maintaining properties of a balanced posture and characteristics of the behavior just prior to the interaction. In our case, these characteristics are determined by a motion capture sequence. We combine our anticipation model with a physically-based dynamic response to produce animations where a character anticipates an impact before collision and reacts to the contact, physically, after the collision. We present a variety of examples including threats that vary in approach direction, size, and speed.", "paper_title": "Psychologically inspired anticipation and dynamic response for impacts to the head and upper body", "paper_id": "WOS:000250787500015"}
