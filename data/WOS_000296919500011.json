While role engineering is proposed to define an architectural structure of the organization's security policies, none of the work has employed constraint mining in migrating a non-RBAC system to an RBAC system to our knowledge, thus providing the motivation for this work. In this paper, we first define a wide variety of constraints, which are the best-known ones to date, and then create a relationship between the conventional data mining technology and the constraints. We further propose an anti-association rule mining algorithm to generate the constraints. Experiments on performance study prove the superiority of the new algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
