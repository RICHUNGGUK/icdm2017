Unlike traditional level-wise approaches which preserve the monotonicity of frequency, our block-wise approach preserves monotonicity of feature reducibility and redundancy, which are important in propositionalization employed in the context of classification learning. With pruning based on these properties, our block-wise approach efficiently scales to features including tens of first-order atoms, far beyond the reach of state-of-the art propositionalization or inductive logic programming systems.", "paper_title": "Block-wise construction of tree-like relational features with monotone reducibility and redundancy", "paper_id": "WOS:000289255700003"}
