In order to develop the model, 200 different mixes are cast in the laboratory as a part of an extensive experimental research program. The data used in the ANN model are arranged in a format of fourteen input parameters covering water-binder ratio, four different mineral additives (calcium carbonate, metakaolin, silica fume, and limestone), five different superplasticizers based on the poly carboxylate and naphthalene and four different Viscosity Modified Admixtures (VMAs). Two common output parameters including the mini slump value and flow cone time are chosen for measuring the rheological properties of fresh self consolidating cement paste. Having validated the model, the influence of effective parameters on the rheological properties of fresh self consolidating cement paste is investigated based on the ANN model outputs. The output results of the model are then compared with the results of previous studies performed by other researchers. Ultimately, the analysis of the model outputs determines the optimal percentage of additives which has a strong influence on the rheological properties of fresh self consolidating cement paste. The proposed ANN model shows that metakaolin and silica fume affect the rheological properties in the same manner. In addition, for providing the suitable rheological properties, the ANN model introduces the optimal percentage of metakaolin, silica fume, calcium carbonate and limestone as 15, 15, 20 and 20% by cement weight, respectively.", "paper_title": "Modeling the effects of additives on rheological properties of fresh self-consolidating cement paste using artificial neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000291712200002"}
