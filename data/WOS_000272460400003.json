This is made possible by tracking and calibrating the echo probe and registering it to the roadmap coordinate system. We compare two techniques. The first uses only echo-echo registration to predict a motion-correction transformation in roadmap coordinates. The second combines echo-echo registration with a model of the respiratory motion of the heart. Using experiments with cardiac MRI and 3-D echo data acquired from eight volunteers, we demonstrate that the second technique is more robust than the first, resulting in motion-correction transformations that were accurate to within 5 mm in 60% of cases, compared to 42% for the echo-only technique, based on subjective visual assessments. Objective validation showed that the model-based technique had an accuracy of 3.3 +/- 1.1 mm, compared to 4.1 +/- 2.2 mm for the echo only technique. The greater errors of the echo-only technique were mostly found away from the area of echo coverage. The model-based technique was more robust away from this area, and also has significant benefits in terms of computational cost. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
