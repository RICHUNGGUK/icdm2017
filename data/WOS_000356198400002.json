Under mild conditions, some new sufficient conditions for global mu-stability of considered CVNNs are derived. Moreover, some new sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the global mu-stability of CVNNs in the form of complex-valued LMIs as well as real-valued LMIs by using an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Both of complex-valued LMIs as well as real-valued LMIs are easily solved by using standard numerical algorithms. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our theoretical results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
