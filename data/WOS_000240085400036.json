For any weighted graph G=(V,E), v(i)is an element of V, 1 <= i <= n, where exists weight w(ij) on edge v(i)v(j), we use two DNA strands with different lengths to encode each of the edges. The longer DNA strand consists of three parts: one for the departure vertex, another for the weight, and the last for the arrival vertex. The shorter DNA strand is the reverse complementation of the center part of the longer one. ne proposed weight encoding method is an improvement on the previous weight encoding methods, and it can more easily find the optimal solutions than the former ones. This work extends the capability of DNA computing to solving numerical optimization problems, which is contrasted with other DNA computing methods focusing on decision problems.", "paper_title": "A new DNA encoding method for traveling salesman problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400036"}
