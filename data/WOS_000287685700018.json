J. Chem, Inf. Model, 2008, 48, 364-369). The text-mining technique is based on natural language processing and can extract chemical names and their interaction patterns according to sentence context. After chemicals were automatically extracted and classified into CYP substrates, inhibitors, and inducers, 709 substrates were retrieved from the PubChem database and categorized as 216, 145, 136, 217, 156, and 379 substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, respectively. Although the previous classification model was developed using data from only 161 compounds, the model classified the substrates found by text-mining analysis with reasonable accuracy. This confirmed the validity of both the multi-objective classification model for CYP substrates and the text-mining procedure.", "paper_title": "Automated Information Extraction and Structure-Activity Relationship Analysis of Cytochrome P450 Substrates", "paper_id": "WOS:000287685700018"}
