This gives rise to the inventory-routing problem in which the goal is to coordinate inventory replenishment and transportation to minimize costs. The problem tackled in this paper is the stochastic inventory-routing problem, where stochastic demands are specified through general discrete distributions. The problem is formulated as a discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision problem. Heuristics based on finite scenario trees are developed. Computational results confirm the efficiency of these heuristics.", "paper_title": "Scenario Tree-Based Heuristics for Stochastic Inventory-Routing Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000265756900007"}
