To this direction, the use of forward error correction (FEC) on the application layer is widely adopted in several mobile multicast standards. FEC is a feedback free error control method, where the transmitter introduces in advance redundant information within the source data to enable receivers recovering arbitrary data erasures. On multicast delivery where retransmission-based error recovery methods are not efficient, the most suitable error control method is the use of application layer forward error correction (AL-FEC) codes. In this work, we introduce novel AL-FEC deployment policies over mobile multicast environments utilizing online algorithms. We aim at the efficient application of AL-FEC protection with RaptorQ codes over multicast delivery in the context of competitive analysis. We provide a competitiveness analysis model of AL-FEC application over mobile multicast environments. Furthermore, we propose two online algorithms adjusting the introduced redundancy of AL-FEC protection according to several FEC encoding parameters and constraints of mobile multicast delivery.", "paper_title": "Deploying AL-FEC protection with online algorithms for multicast services over cellular networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342229400029"}
