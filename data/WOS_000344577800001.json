Positive moment reinforcement in the form of hairpin bars as recommended by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report No 519 is incorporated in the model. The cold construction joint that develops at the interface between girder ends and continuity diaphragms is also simulated via contact elements. The model is then subjected to the positive moment and corresponding shear forces that would develop over the service life of the bridge. The stress distribution in the continuity diaphragm and the axial force distribution in the hairpin bars are presented. It was found that due to the asymmetric configuration of the hairpin bars, asymmetric stress distribution develops at the continuity diaphragm, which can be exacerbated by other asymmetric factors such as skewed bridge configurations. It was also observed that when the joint is subjected to a positive moment, the tensile force is transferred from the girder end to the continuity diaphragm only through the hairpin bars due to the lack of contact between the both members at the construction joint. As a result, the stress distribution at girder ends was found to be concentrated around the hairpin bars influence area, rather than be resisted by the entire girder composite section. Finally, the results are used to develop an approach for estimating the cracking moment capacity at girder ends based on a proposed effective moment of inertia.", "paper_title": "Force transfer mechanism in positive moment continuity details for prestressed concrete girder bridges", "paper_id": "WOS:000344577800001"}
