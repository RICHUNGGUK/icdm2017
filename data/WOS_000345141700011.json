In particular, a protocol is proposed for the measurement of the principal strain lines (PSL) in the walls of the LV; this protocol is tested by means of a computational model which resembles a human LV. When the analysis is focused on the epicardial surface, PSL can be used to derive information on the directions of muscle fibres during the entire cardiac cycle, not only the systolic phase.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of the strain-line patterns in a human left ventricle: a simulation study", "paper_id": "WOS:000345141700011"}
