The approximate inclusion-exclusion problem, due to Linial and Nisan (1990), is to estimate P[A(1) boolean OR...boolean OR A(n)] given P[boolean AND(i is an element of S) A(i)] for vertical bar S vertical bar <= k. Kahn et al. (1996) solved this problem optimally for each k. We study the following more general question: estimate P[f(A(1),..., A(n))] given P[boolean AND(i is an element of S) A(i)] for vertical bar S vertical bar <= k, where f : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1} is a given symmetric function. We solve this general problem for every f and k, giving an algorithm that runs in polynomial time and achieves an approximation error that is essentially optimal. We prove this optimal error to be 2(-(Theta) over tilde)(k(2)/n) for k above a certain threshold, and Theta(1) otherwise. As part of our solution, we analyze, for every nonconstant symmetric f : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1} and every epsilon is an element of [2(-n), 1/3], the least degree deg(epsilon)(f) of a polynomial that approximates f pointwise within epsilon. We show that deg epsilon(f) = (Theta) over tilde (deg(1/3)(f) + root nlog(1/epsilon)), where deg(1/3)(f) is well-known for each f. Previously, the answer for vanishing epsilon was known only for f = OR. We construct the approximating polynomial explicitly for all f and epsilon.", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATE INCLUSION-EXCLUSION FOR ARBITRARY SYMMETRIC FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000267365500004"}
