In this work, the link between hybrid and MPFA formulations is shown algebraically For the lowest order mixed methods of Raviart-Thomas (RT0) and Brezzi-Douglas-Marini (BDM1) on triangles. The efficiency of the four mixed formulations (Hybrid_RT0, MPFA_RT0, Hybrid_BDM1 and MPFA_BDM1) is investigated on high anisotropic and heterogeneous media and for unstructured triangular discretizations. Numerical experiments show that the MPFA_BDM1 formulation outperforms both Hybrid_RT0 and Hybrid-BDM1 in the case of anisotropic domains and highly unstructured meshes.
