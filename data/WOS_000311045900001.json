This work intends to shed some light on a more flexible way of matching ontologies using ontology meta-matching. This emerging technique selects appropriate algorithms and their associated weights and thresholds in scenarios where accurate ontology matching is necessary. We think that an overview of the problem and an analysis of the existing state-of-the-art solutions will help researchers and practitioners to identify the most appropriate specific features and global strategies in order to build more accurate and dynamic systems following this paradigm.", "paper_title": "An overview of current ontology meta-matching solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000311045900001"}
