In recent years, depth image-based rendering (DIBR) has been generally used to synthesize virtual view images in free viewpoint television (FTV) and 3-D video. To conceal the zero-region more accurately and improve the quality of a virtual view synthesized frame, an integrated hole-filling algorithm for view synthesis is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm contains five parts: an algorithm for distinguishing different regions, foreground and background boundary detection, texture image isophotes detection, a textural and structural isophote prediction algorithm, and an in-painting algorithm with gradient priority order. Based on the texture isophote prediction with a geometrical principle and the in-painting algorithm with a gradient priority order, the boundary information of the foreground is considerably clearer and the texture information in the zero-region can be concealed much more accurately than in previous works. The vision quality mainly depends on the distortion of the structural information. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm improves not only the objective quality of the virtual image, but also its subjective quality considerably; human vision is also clearly improved based on the subjective results. In particular, the algorithm ensures the boundary contours of the foreground objects and the textural and structural information.", "paper_title": "An Integrated Hole-Filling Algorithm for View Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000320014500033"}
