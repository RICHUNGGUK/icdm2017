This path, however, is typically not a shortest path in the continuous terrain. In this overview article, we discuss a path-planning methodology for quickly finding paths in continuous terrain that are typically shorter than shortest grid paths. Any-angle path-planning algorithms are variants of the heuristic path-planning algorithm A* that find short paths by propagating information along grid edges (like A*, to be fast) without constraining the resulting paths to grid edges (unlike A*, to find short paths).", "paper_title": "Any-Angle Path Planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000336892000007"}
