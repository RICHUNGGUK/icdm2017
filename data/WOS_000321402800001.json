This paper is interested in gaining insights of approximate expressions of the periodic solutions in a fractional order Van der Pol oscillator. The presence of fractional derivatives requires the use of suitable criteria, which usually makes the analytical work much hard. Most existing methods for studying the nonlinear dynamics fail when applied to such a class of fractional order systems. In this paper, based on the residue harmonic balance method, a detailed analysis on approximations to the periodic oscillations of the fractional order Van der Pol equation is investigated. The relations that express the frequency and amplitude of the generated oscillations as functions of the orders and parameters are shown. Moreover, some examples are provided for comparing approximations with numerical solutions of the periodic oscillations. Numerical results reveal that the residue harmonic balance method is very effective for obtaining approximate solutions of fractional oscillations. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
