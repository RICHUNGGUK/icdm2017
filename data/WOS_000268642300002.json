The logic of all neighbourhood models is called classical modal logic. In coalgebraic terms, a neighbourhood frame is a coalgebra for the contravariant powerset functor composed with itself, denoted by 2(2). We use this coalgebraic modelling to derive notions of equivalence between neighbourhood structures. 2(2)-bisimilarity and behavioural equivalence are well known coalgebraic concepts, and they are distinct, since 2(2) does not preserve weak pullbacks. We introduce a third, intermediate notion whose witnessing relations we call precocongruences (based on pushouts). We give back-and-forth style characterisations for 2(2)-bisimulations and precocongruences, we show that on a single coalgebra, precocongruences capture behavioural equivalence, and that between neighbourhood structures, precocongruences are a better approximation of behavioural equivalence than 2(2)-bisimulations. We also introduce a notion of modal saturation for neighbourhood models, and investigate its relationship with definability and image-finiteness. We prove a Hennessy-Milner theorem for modally saturated and for image-finite neighbourhood models. Our main results are an analogue of Van Benthem's characterisation theorem and a model-theoretic proof of Craig interpolation for classical modal", "paper_title": "NEIGHBOURHOOD STRUCTURES: BISIMILARITY AND BASIC MODEL THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000268642300002"}
