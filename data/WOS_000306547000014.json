Vanclay's manuscript \"Impact Factor: outdated artefact or stepping-stone to journal certification?\" we discuss the value of journal metrics for the assessment of scientific-scholarly journals from a general bibliometric perspective, and from the point of view of creators of new journal metrics, journal editors and publishers.
