Under noise conditions when the stationarity assumption is valid, effective techniques have been established to provide excellent recognition accuracies. Under the conditions when this assumption cannot hold, recognition performance de- clines rapidly. Missing data, MD, theory is a promising method for robust automatic speech recognition, ASR, under an y noise condition. Unfortunately, the choice of feature used in the recognizer process is commonly limited to spectral based representations. The combination of recognizers approach to MD ASR allows the use of cepstral based features within the MD framework through a fusion of features mechanism in the pat- tern recognition stage. It was found that under two types of non-stationary noise conditions the combined fused effect, experienced by the fusion process, increased recognition accuracies substantially over traditional MD and cepstral based recognizers.", "paper_title": "Feature Fusion Applied to Missing Data ASR with the Combination of Recognizers", "paper_id": "WOS:000274519900007"}
