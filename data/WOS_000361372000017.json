So far, it is being widely applied in areas closely related to national economy and people's daily lives. Therefore, CPS security problems have drawn a global attention and an appropriate risk assessment for CPS is in urgent need. According to the researches and discussions in recent years, we believe that most researchers have already established a comprehensive understanding about CPS. This paper systematically introduced CPS's conception, development and applications assisted. In addition, concerning about its aspects of safety and security, we also analyzed CPS's risks and new requirements as an up-to-date technique brings. We elaborate the existing work and propose a research focus that has not been paid enough attention to, and proposed a security framework for CPS. At last, after providing a classic modeling and simulation method of CPS, we bring forward a new idea for accessing the experimental results into existing systems.", "paper_title": "A Systematic Review of Studies on Cyber Physical System Security", "paper_id": "WOS:000361372000017"}
