A bank of discriminative articulatory feature classifiers provides input to the DBN, in the form of either virtual evidence (VE) (scaled likelihoods) or raw classifier margin outputs. We present experiments on two tasks, a medium-vocabulary word-ranking task and a small-vocabulary phrase recognition task. We show that articulatory feature-based models outperform baseline models, and we study several aspects of the models, such as the effects of allowing articulatory asynchrony, of using dictionary-based versus whole-word models, and of incorporating classifier outputs via virtual evidence versus alternative observation models.", "paper_title": "Multistream Articulatory Feature-Based Models for Visual Speech Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000267369800012"}
