However, the architecture suffers from the lack of higher-level APIs and services that would simplify AA code and could be shared by multiple AAs. We propose a modified architecture that introduces an Application Environment (AE) layer above the EE layer to fill the gap. The AE layer offers higher-level services to simplified User-define Processing Modules (UPMs). Together they replace the conventional AA and offer a higher-level API to code to. This paper discusses the issues that arise when breaking the existing AA layer into two layers, and presents our experiences implementing a concast service using the new architecture. We also present performance numbers for our concast service (running on the ASP EE) that show the additional overhead incurred is acceptable. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
