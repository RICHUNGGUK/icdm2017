This paper describes a distributed fuzzy expert system, called Smart-Drill, aimed in helping petroleum engineers to diagnose and solve lost circulation problems. To represent and manipulate perception-based evaluations of uncertainties of facts and rules, the expert system uses an uncertainty model with qualitative scales of plausibility values and multi-setbased fuzzy algebra of strict monotonic operations. Its realization in inference procedures permits taking into account the change of plausibility of premises in expert systems rules. Original tools like CAPNET Expert System Shell, Knowledge Acquisition Tool and WITSML Converter implementing the proposed model were used for the development of the Smart-Drill. Overall, the system architecture is discussed and implementation details are provided. Both desktop and Web-based implementations permit petroleum engineers benefit from the system working out in the field. The system is currently at field testing phase in PEMEX, Mexican Oil Company.
