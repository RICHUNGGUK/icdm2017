Given a smooth base surface with relief, it locates relief features (concavities, convexities and inflections) around each surface point and at multiple scales, using cubic-polynomial fitting. This object-space, per-vertex information is then used to guide a variety of shading techniques including normal enhancement, feature visualization, accessibility shading and radiance scaling. Thanks to this approach, features at multiple scales are easily combined, filtered and shaded, allowing users to explore surface relief in real-time.", "paper_title": "Surface Relief Analysis for Illustrative Shading", "paper_id": "WOS:000305993000013"}
