Replaying system call traces alone sometimes leads to inaccurate predictions because paging, and access to memory-mapped files, are not modelled. This paper extends tracing to handle such workloads. At trace capture time, the application's page-level virtual memory access is monitored. The size of the page access trace, and capture overheads, are reduced by excluding recently-accessed pages. This leads to a slight loss of accuracy. Using a suite of memory-intensive applications, we evaluate the capture overhead and measure the predictive accuracy of the approach. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
