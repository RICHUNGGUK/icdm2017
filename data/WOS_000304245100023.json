The new inequalities were proved originally by Makarychev et al. for the Shannon entropy, using properties of probability distributions. Our approach extends the proof of the inequalities to the quantum domain, and includes their independence for the quantum and also the classical cases.", "paper_title": "Infinitely Many Constrained Inequalities for the von Neumann Entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000304245100023"}
