Drawing on the core premises of contemporary practice theory to ground the methodological and theoretical perspectives, the aim of this paper is to provide the initial \"inside\" view of traditional public library face-to-face reference work from a practice-based perspective. Design/methodology/approach - The paper includes an ethnographic case study of face-to-face reference service in four branches of one urban public library involving 170 hours of participant observation, 24 hours of unobtrusive observation, 480 reference interactions, and 28 participant interviews and analysis of policy documents. Findings - This analysis highlights the structuring and mediating role of objects in the enactment of reference work. A practice-based typology of reference interactions is introduced which characterizes the types of questions asked, knowledge processes in action, interpersonal communication style and mode of practice. The collective organizing actions of reference work are unpackaged in a non-hierarchical or flattened plane that recognizes the key actors and dynamics of the practice as it endures across time and space. Originality/value - Evidence and an approach are introduced to support re-conceptualizing public library reference work as an epistemic practice.", "paper_title": "Interpreting reference work with contemporary practice theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000317150200004"}
