The problem of predicting the future failure times, both point and interval prediction, based on the observed joint type-II censored data, is also addressed from a Bayesian viewpoint. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to compare the Bayesian estimators with the maximum likelihood estimator developed by Balakrishnan and Rasouli [Exact likelihood inference for two exponential populations under joint type-II censoring. Comput Stat Data Anal. 2008; 52: 2725-2738]. Finally, a numerical example is utilized for the purpose of illustration.", "paper_title": "Bayesian inference based on a jointly type-II censored sample from two exponential populations", "paper_id": "WOS:000340102000010"}
