More specially, Bayesian linear estimation (BLE) is applied to observation models between remote sensing images with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The proposed method only estimates the mean vector and covariance matrix of the high-resolution multispectral (MS) images, instead of assuming the joint distribution between the panchromatic (PAN) image and low-resolution multispectral image. Furthermore, the proposed method can enhance the spatial resolution of several principal components of MS images, while the traditional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is limited to enhance only the first principal component. Experimental results with real MS images and PAN image of Landsat ETM+ demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than traditional methods based on statistical parameter estimation, PCA-lbased method and wavelet-based method.", "paper_title": "Remote sensing image fusion based on Bayesian linear estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000245743200007"}
