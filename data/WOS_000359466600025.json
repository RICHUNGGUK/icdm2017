Under the assumption that a restricted encoder is employed at each user, an outer bound on the capacity region is derived first. Then, a decode-and-forward (DF) strategy is proposed and the corresponding rate region is characterized. The explicit outer bound and the achievable rate region for the Gaussian MWRC-DL are also derived. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed DF strategy.", "paper_title": "Information-Theoretic Limits for the Multi-Way Relay Channel with Direct Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466600025"}
