Energy-efficient resource allocation is one of the key issues in mobile ad hoc computational Grids due to limited battery life of mobile nodes. To reduce energy consumption, we propose a hybrid power-based resource allocation scheme for allocation of interdependent tasks to nodes within mobile ad hoc computational Grid. The basic idea is to exploit dependencies and task type, and allocate interdependent tasks to nodes accessible at minimum transmission power. We also propose a power-based algorithm to search a group of closest nodes to allocate a set of interdependent tasks. Compared to traditional algorithms, complexity of proposed algorithm depends on number of transmission power levels rather than number of nodes within a Grid. The scheme is validated in a simulation environment using various workloads and parameters.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation Scheme for Mobile Ad Hoc Computational Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000293973700002"}
