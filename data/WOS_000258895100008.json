We develop an efficient polynomial-time algorithm for the general case, followed by specific polynomial-time algorithms producing Horn, dual Horn, and bijunctive formulas for sets of vectors closed under the operations of conjunction, disjunction, and median, respectively. Our results generalize the work of Dechter and Pearl on relational data, as well as the papers by Hebrard and Zanuttini.
