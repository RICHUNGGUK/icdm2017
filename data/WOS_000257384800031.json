In particular, the simulation of painting tools is very important because this enables an intuitive painting experience for a user and generates rich painting effects. Many painting systems have been proposed using brushes, but less for other painting tools. As a result, there is still a limitation in the variety of painting effects that can be generated. In this paper, we propose a method to simulate painting using a painting knife, which is an important tool in oil painting. We model a painting knife and model the pigments such that the system is suitable for realizing the impasto style. We also present a technique for simulating the interaction between a painting knife and pigments on a canvas in real-time.", "paper_title": "A virtual painting knife", "paper_id": "WOS:000257384800031"}
