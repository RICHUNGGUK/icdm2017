However, none meets the burst structure characteristics required by the IEEE 802.16 standard. In this study, two heuristic algorithms, Best Corner Oriented (BCO) and Best Subchannel Oriented (BSO), are proposed to provide high throughput for uplink burst construction in IEEE 802.16 networks. The BCO maintains all available slots as a continuous area and attempts to construct each burst from one of the two ending slots of this area. The BSO, however, constructs each burst in its best quality subchannels to adopt a better modulation coding scheme (MCS). The simulation results under a heavy load indicate that BSO and BCO achieve 2 and 1.5 times, respectively, the throughput achieved by Raster, the conventional algorithm. However, the superior performance of BSO is achieved at the expense of increased time complexity. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.
