Despite its applicability, one of its drawbacks in practical application is the high computational load. On the other hand, Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which was originally developed for acceleration of computer graphics, now provides unprecedented capability for scientific computations. The main objective of this study is to develop a GPU-accelerated MPS code using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) language. Several techniques have been shown to optimize calculations in CUDA. In order to promote the acceleration by CPU, particular attentions are given to both the search of neighboring particles and the iterative solution of simultaneous linear equations in the Poisson Pressure Equation. In this paper, 2-dimensional calculations of elliptical drop evolution and dam break flow have been carried out by the GPU-accelerated MPS method, and the accuracy and performance of GPU-based code are investigated by comparing the results with those by CPU. It is shown that results of GPU-based calculations can be obtained much faster with the same reliability as the CPU-based ones. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
