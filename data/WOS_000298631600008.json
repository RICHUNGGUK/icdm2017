Direct torque control strategy is applied to control the induction generator where both rotor flux and DC bus voltage are controlled through the application of the standard switching table for operations in the 4 quadrants. The flywheel energy storage system is used to improve the quality of the electric power delivered by the wind generator. The proposed system, controlled thanks to Direct Torque Control (DTC) strategy, is validated through simulations. The obtained results are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Wind energy conversion system associated to a flywheel energy storage system", "paper_id": "WOS:000298631600008"}
