Among them, we focus on the identification of a relevant abstraction for the component expression and verification of properties like substitutivity: when is it possible to formally accept or reject the substitution of a component in a composition? This paper suggests integer weighted automata to tackle this problem when considering a new factor - Quality of Service (QoS). Four notions of simulation-based substitutivity managing QoS aspects are proposed, and related complexity issues on integer weighted automata are investigated. Furthermore, the paper defines composition operators: sequential, strict-sequential and parallel compositions, bringing path costs into the analysis. New results on the compatibility of proposed substitutivity notions w.r.t. sequential and parallel composition operators are established. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
