We say that a subgraph F of G connects a demand (S-i, T-i) when it contains a path with one endpoint in S-i and the other in T-i. The goal is to identify a minimum weight subgraph that connects all demands in D. Alon et al. (SODA '04) introduced this problem to study online network formation settings and showed that it captures some well-studied problems such as Steiner forest, facility location with nonmetric costs, tree multicast, and group Steiner tree. Obtaining a nontrivial approximation ratio for generalized connectivity was left as an open problem. We describe the first poly-logarithmic approximation algorithm for generalized connectivity that has a performance guarantee of O(log(2) nlog(2) k). Here, n is the number of vertices in G and k is the number of demands. We also prove that the cut-covering relaxation of this problem has an O(log(3) nlog(2) k) integrality gap. Building upon the results for generalized connectivity, we obtain improved approximation algorithms for two problems that contain generalized connectivity as a special case. For the directed Steiner network problem, we obtain an O(k(1/2+epsilon)) approximation which improves on the currently best performance guarantee of (O) over tilde (k(2/3)) due to Charikar et al. (SODA '98). For the set connector problem, recently introduced by Fukunaga and Nagamochi (IPCO '07), we present a poly-logarithmic approximation; this result improves on the previously known ratio which can be Omega(n) in the worst case.", "paper_title": "Set Connectivity Problems in Undirected Graphs and the Directed Steiner Network Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000292839300005"}
