Product customization can satisfy consumer needs and preferences. Altering the colors and appearance of module parts is an effectual method of achieving product change. Specifically, different color combinations can create a more stylish image. Nevertheless, too many color options overwhelm consumers leaving them unable to make any choice at all. This study presents a decision-making support model that assists consumers in choosing among options and can effectively design products. Factor analysis is utilized to differentiate multifarious products into several styles, which will allow consumers to choose one style according to their preferences. Next, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) combined with the image compositing technique is applied to construct the design decision-making support model provided for choosing the optimum product. Finally, implementation of this proposed model is demonstrated in detail via a case study of leather sofa design. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
