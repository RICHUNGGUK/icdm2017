The asymptotic estimations of K(n)((K) over tilde (p)(K), (K) over tilde (p)(K))(q) and (K) over tilde (n) ((B) over tilde (p)(C), (B) over tilde (p) (C))(q) are obtained for p = 1 and infinity, 1 <= q <= infinity. We also defined a new concept of the average relative widths and obtained the exact results of the average relative widths of the classes of some smooth functions in L(2)(R(d)).", "paper_title": "THE RESEARCH PROGRESS OF BNU GROUP ON RELATIVE WIDTHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272695100005"}
