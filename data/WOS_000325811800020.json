Recent research on brain theory suggests that the human visual system (HVS) actively predicts the primary visual information and tries to avoid the residual uncertainty for image perception and understanding. Therefore, the perceptual quality relies to the information fidelities of the primary visual information and the residual uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel RR IQA index based on visual information fidelity. We advocate that distortions on the primary visual information mainly disturb image understanding, and distortions on the residual uncertainty mainly change the comfort of perception. We separately compute the quantities of the primary visual information and the residual uncertainty of an image. Then the fidelities of the two types of information are separately evaluated for quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed index uses few data (30 bits) and achieves high consistency with human perception.", "paper_title": "Reduced-Reference Image Quality Assessment With Visual Information Fidelity", "paper_id": "WOS:000325811800020"}
