This problem is already studied in the literature and there is a mathematical model and a genetic algorithm for the problem. We analyzed the model and algorithm, and showed that they suffer from serious shortcomings. Then, we propose three mathematical models for makespan and total completion time objectives. The proposed models are compared with the available model in both size and computational complexities. The available model is significantly outperformed. Moreover, we propose three effective metaheuristics based on artificial bee colony algorithms. The proposed metaheuristics are compared against the four available algorithms on both small and large instances. The proposed metaheuristics perform much more effectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
