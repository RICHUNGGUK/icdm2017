The mobile medicine system can provide (i) measured blood pressure and body temperature, (ii) medical signals measured by the electrocardiogram (ECG) device, (iii) mobile patient's history, (iv) G. 729 audio signals, (v) Joint Photographic Experts Group 2000 Medical images and Moving Picture Experts Group 4 charge-coupled device sensor video signals. By utilizing a multi-code CDMA spread spectrum communication system with downlink power-control strategy, it is possible for this system to meet the quality of service requirements of a mobile medicine network. In addition, such a system can maximize the resource utilization. For different messages to be sent, the power is controlled according to the requisite bit error rate (BER). Higher transmission power is given to the media with lower BER requirement. Numerical analysis shows that the ratios of transmission power for voice, video, and data virtual channels is approximately 1: 2: 13 when the BERs for voice, video, and data are 10 boolean AND(- 3), 10 boolean AND(- 4), and 10 boolean AND(- 7), respectively. This power ratio is similar to the ratio of signal-to-noise plus interference power ratio for voice, video, and data during transmission. For the purpose of verifying the proposed argument, a simulation has been done and the results match the derivation very well.", "paper_title": "Downlink power control in multi-code CDMA for mobile medicine", "paper_id": "WOS:000240032500009"}
