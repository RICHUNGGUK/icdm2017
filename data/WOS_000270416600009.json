It uses ontologies as a central modelling strategy for the capture of knowledge from legacy documents via automated means, or directly in systems interfacing with knowledge workers, via user-defined, web-based forms. The domain ontologies used for knowledge capture also guide the retrieval of the knowledge extracted from the data using a semantic search system that provides support for multiple modalities during search. This approach has been applied and evaluated successfully within the aerospace domain, and is currently being extended for use in other domains on an increasingly large scale.", "paper_title": "Applying semantic web technologies to knowledge sharing in aerospace engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000270416600009"}
