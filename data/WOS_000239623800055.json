Experimental results have shown that the MCM method has good retrieval performance and efficiency, due to the capability of integrating color composition, color spatial layout and texture characteristics into its coarse-granule region representation.", "paper_title": "A novel image retrieval approach combining multiple features of color-connected regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800055"}
