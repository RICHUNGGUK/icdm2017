Projection pursuit for classification finds projections that reveal differences between classes. Even though projection pursuit is used to bypass the curse of dimensionality, most indexes will not work well when there are a small number of observations relative to the number of variables, known as a large p (dimension) small n (sample size) problem. This paper discusses the relationship between the sample size and dimensionality on classification and proposes a new projection pursuit index that overcomes the problem of small sample size for exploratory classification.", "paper_title": "A projection pursuit index for large p small n data", "paper_id": "WOS:000278472800010"}
