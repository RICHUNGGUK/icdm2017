In this paper, we hope to discover possible trends and needs of business aviation for supporting the government to make decision in anticipation of eventual deregulation in the near future. We adopt knowledge-discovery tools based on rough set to analyze the potential for business aviation through an empirical study. Although our empirical study uses data from Taiwan, we are optimistic that our proposed method can be similarly applied in other countries to help governments there make decisions about a deregulated market in the future.", "paper_title": "Combined rough sets with flow graph and formal concept analysis for business aviation decision-making", "paper_id": "WOS:000290037600006"}
