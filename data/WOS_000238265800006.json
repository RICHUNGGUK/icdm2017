We use the Penna model with intelligence to describe the individual. The individuals are set in a lattice of L x L and the rules of learning is expressed by cellular automata. Then, we present the results of our simulations and discuss the evolution of intelligence and knowledge respectively. From the results we find that the intelligence for the living individuals is more than that for the dead individuals. It can be concluded the effect of natural selection on the evolution of intelligence.", "paper_title": "A cellular automata model of learning based on bit-string with intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000238265800006"}
