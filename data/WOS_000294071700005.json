This paper deals with the open problem of optimizing this parameter for secret sharing schemes with general access structures. Specifically, our objective is to determine the optimal complexity of the access structures with exactly four minimal qualified subsets. Lower bounds on the optimal complexity are obtained by using the known polymatroid technique in combination with linear programming. Upper bounds are derived from decomposition constructions of linear secret sharing schemes. In this way, the exact value of the optimal complexity is determined for several access structures in that family. For the other ones, we present the best known lower and upper bounds.", "paper_title": "Optimal complexity of secret sharing schemes with four minimal qualified subsets", "paper_id": "WOS:000294071700005"}
