We explore how this model allows us to expand the range of benefits of using the Internet Cloud model, especially when it comes to media processing and user customization. A prototype that transcodes audio/video stream inside the Cloud has been implemented and presented. The prototype is deployed in two different environments: in a local lab and in the Amazon EC2 public Cloud. We also study the performance of the prototype by analyzing the inter-arrival jitter.
