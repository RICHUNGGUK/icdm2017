Design/methodology/approach - A 12-slot 14-pole PMSM designed for an in-wheel traction application is chosen for the comparison. With the same volume constraint, three 12/14 FSM structures are created. Both the PMSM and the three FSM structures are modeled using the software Flux. Based on these models, finite element analyses (FEA) are performed, and the results are compared in terms of open-circuit back electromotive force (EMF), electrical loading capability, and thermal conditions. Findings - Within the same volume constraint, a 12/14 FSMs can achieve the maximum torque higher than the one of 12/14 PMSM. This conclusion is drawn based on the observed facts that at the same rotor speed, a larger open-circuit back EMF is induced in the FSM, while a larger electrical loading is also allowed in this machine, compared to the PMSM. In addition, the risk of demagnetization during the process of field weakening proves to be lower in FSMs than PMSMs. This advantage suggests a potentially wide constant power speed range (CPSR) of FSMs, which is especially beneficial in automotive applications. Research limitations/implications - This research can be continued with investigating the field weakening capability and iron losses of FSMs. Originality/value - This paper proposed two optional structures of FSMs to reduce the amount of permanent magnets. It also highlighted the effectiveness of FSMs in cooling these magnets.", "paper_title": "Comparison of flux-switching machines and permanent magnet synchronous machines in an in-wheel traction application", "paper_id": "WOS:000314484400009"}
