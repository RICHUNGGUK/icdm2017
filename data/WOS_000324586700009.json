That is because the depth of information provided by the Kinect sensor opens an effective and innovative way for scene classification. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for scene classification, which applies locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) to local SIFT features for representing the RGB-D samples and classifies scenes through the cooperation between a new rank preserving sparse learning (RPSL) based dimension reduction and a simple classification method. RPSL considers four aspects: 1) it preserves the rank order information of the within-class samples in a local patch; 2) it maximizes the margin between the between-class samples on the local patch; 3) the L1-norm penalty is introduced to obtain the parsimony property; and 4) it models the classification error minimization by utilizing the least-squares error minimization. Experiments are conducted on the NYU Depth V1 dataset and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of RPSL for scene classification.", "paper_title": "Rank Preserving Sparse Learning for Kinect Based Scene Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000324586700009"}
