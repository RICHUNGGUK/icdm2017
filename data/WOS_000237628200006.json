One of the most significant of these was Oedipus, a special-purpose rapid analytical machine using novel digital storage. Oedipus was developed by GCHQ and the UK companies Elliott and Ferranti. Oedipus contained a large semiconductor associative memory, a magnetic drum with oh-the-fly searching, and a high-speed RAM cache. Its history has only recently been made publicly available.", "paper_title": "In the footsteps of Colossus: A description of Oedipus", "paper_id": "WOS:000237628200006"}
