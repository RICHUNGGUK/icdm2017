In this letter, we indicate two severe methodological and statistical flaws in this paper. We show how, in general, such flaws can affect experimental research. Due to these flaws, the conclusions by Akdemir and Oguz are unfounded: one cannot reach these conclusions on basis of this design and analysis. We provide a set of guidelines and advices to avoid methodological problems when setting up an educational experiment. (C) 2015 The Authors.
