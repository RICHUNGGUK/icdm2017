We find the best fuzzy partitions of the attribute domains with respect to which we determine the direct and inverse fuzzy transforms. We use two specific regression indexes (which must be smaller than a threshold deduced experimentally) for evaluating dependency between numerical attributes. The experiments are conducted on two well known datasets: \"El Nino\" (http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/el_nino/el_nino.data.html) and the remote sensing data determined from US Forest Service (Region 2, Resource Information System, http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/ covertype/covertype.data.html). Our results are quite in agreement with the regression analysis of the same-data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
