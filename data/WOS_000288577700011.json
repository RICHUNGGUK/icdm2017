Local shape descriptors are used for establishing point correspondences between two surfaces by way of encapsulating local shape, such that their similarity indicates geometric similarity between respective neighbourhoods. We present a generalized platform for constructing local shape descriptors that subsumes a large class of existing methods, and that allows for tuning to the geometry of specific models. Experimental analysis confirms the superiority of optimized descriptors over generic ones in object recognition tasks using real LIDAR and stereo range images. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
