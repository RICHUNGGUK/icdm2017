One of the most important problems is the discrimination between these mechanical defects using a measured TF. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a new method based on the TF estimation, to detect the type of the mechanical defects in high voltage inhomogeneous winding of a power transformer, i.e. the winding is not homogeneous and has interleaved and inverted disks. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology of this paper is based on the estimation of the TF and in normal and defected cases can be properly achieved using vector fitting method. To study the mechanical defects, the detailed model of the transformer is in the frequency range of kHz < f. Findings - In this paper, comparison of Nyquist diagrams of the estimated TF curves result in a new discrimination method between mechanical defects and localization of the deformed section in the transformer winding. The interpretation of the TF changes is based on comparison of the Nyquist diagrams in a selected frequency range. Originality/value - This paper suggests new discrimination method between mechanical defects and localization of the deformed section in the transformer winding which is based on the TF estimation.", "paper_title": "Estimation of simulated transfer function to discriminate axial displacement and radial deformation of transformer winding", "paper_id": "WOS:000308896700021"}
