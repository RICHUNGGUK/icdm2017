Here, we adopt nonsmooth analysis and control theory to handle memristor-based chaotic neural networks with discontinuous right-hand side. In particular, several new sufficient conditions ensuring exponential stabilization of memristor-based chaotic neural networks are obtained via periodically intermittent control. In addition, the proposed results here are easy to verify and they also extend the earlier publications. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Exponential Stabilization of Memristor-based Chaotic Neural Networks with Time-Varying Delays via Intermittent Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000356506700007"}
