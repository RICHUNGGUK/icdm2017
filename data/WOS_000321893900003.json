The purpose of this paper is to propose such an approach. The proposed approach consists of three steps to drive the development of Problem Frames. In the first step, business process models are developed to capture the behavioural view of the problem context. In the second step, object analysis models are used to capture the structural view of the problem context. Together, these two views collectively and adequately capture the early context knowledge. These two types of model will then be used in the third step to construct context diagrams and derive Problem Frames. A complex real-world problem - equity trading problem - is used to illustrate this approach.", "paper_title": "Deriving problem frames from business process and object analysis models", "paper_id": "WOS:000321893900003"}
