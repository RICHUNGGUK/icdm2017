Recently, we have developed a fast approach for predicting protein structure fluctuations from a single protein model: the CABS-flex. CABS-flex was shown to be an efficient alternative to conventional all-atom molecular dynamics ( MD). In this work, we evaluate CABS-flex and MD predictions by comparison with protein structural variations within NMR ensembles. Results: Based on a benchmark set of 140 proteins, we show that the relative fluctuations of protein residues obtained from CABS-flex are well correlated to those of NMR ensembles. On average, this correlation is stronger than that between MD and NMR ensembles. In conclusion, CABS-flex is useful and complementary to MD in predicting protein regions that undergo conformational changes as well as the extent of such changes.", "paper_title": "CABS-flex predictions of protein flexibility compared with NMR ensembles", "paper_id": "WOS:000340049100009"}
