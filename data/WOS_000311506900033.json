However, traditional rough set approach ignores that the desired reducts are not necessarily unique since several reducts could include the same value of the strength index. In addition, the current RS algorithms have the ability to generate a set of classification rules efficiently, but they cannot generate rules incrementally when new objects are given. Numerous studies of incremental approaches are not capable to deal with the problems of large database. Therefore, an incremental rule-extraction algorithm is proposed to solve these issues in this study. Using this algorithm, when a new object is added up to an information system, it is unnecessary to re-compute rule sets from the very beginning, which can quickly generate the complete but not repetitive rules. In the case study, the results show that the incremental issues of new data add-in are resolved and a huge computation time is saved. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
