Dynamic, automated replication in response to jobs may also be useful and has been investigated using the grid simulator OptorSim. In this paper, results are presented from simulations of the LHC Computing Grid in 2008, in a physics analysis scenario. These show, first, that dynamic replication does give improved job throughput; second, that for this complex grid system, simple replication strategies such as Least Recently Used and Least Frequently Used are as effective as more advanced economic models; third, that grid site policies that allow maximum resource sharing are more effective; and lastly, that dynamic replication is particularly effective when data access patterns include some files being accessed more often than others, such as with a Zipf-like distribution.
