The Karhunen-Loeve expansion was employed to characterize the random field as a reduced set of random variables. Efficient method of sensitivity analysis was developed and integrated into the density based topology optimization approach. The numerical example demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed approach and the effect of loading uncertainty on the robust design results.", "paper_title": "Robust structural topology optimization under random field loading uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000340401600012"}
