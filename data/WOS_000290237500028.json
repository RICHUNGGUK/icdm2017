The cost structure and the optional strategies for this model were first discussed. Bi-level programming models of integrated delivery strategies were established. We introduced the genetic algorithm to solve the problem. Finally the merit and demerit of each model and the adaptability were analyzed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
