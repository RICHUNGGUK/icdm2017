In this paper, we propose a deployment strategy for multiple types of requirements to solve the problem of deterministic and grid-based deployment. This deployment strategy consists of three deployment algorithms, which are for different deployment objectives. First, instead of general random search, we put forward a deterministic search mechanism and the related cost-based deployment algorithm, in which nodes are assigned to different groups which are connected by nearshortest paths, and realize significant reduction of path length and deployment cost. Second, rather than ordinary nondirection deployment, we present a notion of counterflow and the related delay-based deployment algorithm, in which the profit of deployment cost and loss of transmission delay are evaluated, and achieve much diminishing of transmission path length and transmission delay. Third, instead of conventional uneven deployment based on the distances to the sink, we propose a concept of node load level and the related lifetime-based deployment algorithm, in which node distribution is determined by the actual load levels and extra nodes are deployed only where really necessary. This contributes to great improvement of network lifetime. Last, extensive simulations are used to test and verify the effectiveness and superiority of our findings.", "paper_title": "A Deployment Strategy for Multiple Types of Requirements in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361751900029"}
