When the input graph cannot fit in main memory, triangle listing requires random disk accesses that can incur prohibitively huge I/O cost. Some streaming, semistreaming, and sampling algorithms have been proposed but these are approximation algorithms. We propose an I/O-efficient algorithm for triangle listing. Our algorithm is exact and avoids random disk access. Our results show that our algorithm is scalable and outperforms the state-of-the-art in-memory and local triangle estimation algorithms.", "paper_title": "Triangle Listing in Massive Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000312924700004"}
