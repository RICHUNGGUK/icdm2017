The model, SimClast, is capable of simulating fluvial channel network dynamics, plume deposition, wave-induced cross-shore and longshore transport, and large-scale marine circulation. Fluvial channel networks and coastal dynamics are below the resolution of the model discretization and have been pararneterized. This subgrid parameterization allows SimClast to maintain a realistic representation of these important sedimentary processes without significantly compromising computational efficiency. Open marine currents and river plume hydrodynamics are represented using a combined potential flow field, which allows SimClast to be used under a wide variety of settings, ranging from single river systems to full basin scale with multiple tributaries and marine currents. The most significant addition to the current suite of dynamic, stratigraphic models is the down and up dip interaction between several sedimentary environments. The explicit linking of the sedimentary environments allows feedback loops to be studied in more detail. Modeling results under time-invariant forcing are consistent with generalized conceptual models of stacking patterns. Yet, internal facies architecture is very complex for both wave- and fluvial-dominated deltas due to the interaction of several competing sedimentary processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
