Although the mobile agent is primarily driven by an operator at a remote site, it reacts autonomously for avoiding collision with obstacles and for preventing rollover when it suspects/detects possible collision or rollover. The autonomous reactive motion is normally unexpected, thus there exists the inconsistency between the intended motion and the controlled motion of the agent from the operator. A force-reflection technique utilizing a force-feedback joystick is developed to manipulate this inconsistency. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed navigation method, experiments with the Robot for Hazardous Application-Double Tracks (ROBHAZ-DT) (actual mobile agent) are successfully carried out.", "paper_title": "Rollover-free navigation for a mobile agent in an unstructured environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239408100009"}
