To solve this problem, we developed a freely available R/Bioconductor package, called Compound-Protein Interaction with R (Rcpi), for complex molecular representation from drugs, proteins and more complex interactions, including protein-protein and compound-protein interactions. Rcpi could calculate a large number of structural and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino acid sequences, molecular descriptors of small molecules from their topology and protein-protein interaction and compound-protein interaction descriptors. In addition to main functionalities, Rcpi could also provide a number of useful auxiliary utilities to facilitate the user's need. With the descriptors calculated by this package, the users could conveniently apply various statistical machine learning methods in R to solve various biological and drug research questions in computational biology and drug discovery.", "paper_title": "Rcpi: R/Bioconductor package to generate various descriptors of proteins, compounds and their interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000347832300024"}
