The recently proposed Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach or Correction Procedure using Reconstruction (CPR) is based on a differential formulation and provides a unifying framework for these high-order schemes. Here we present a brief review of recent progress in FR/CPR research as well as some pacing items and future challenges.
