However, each security technology only addresses specific vulnerabilities and potentially creates additional vulnerabilities. The objective of this research is to present and evaluate a Genetic Algorithm (GA)based approach enabling organizations to choose the minimal-cost security profile providing the maximal vulnerability coverage. This approach is compared to an enumerative approach for a given test set. The GA-based approach provides favorable results, eventually leading to improved tools for supporting information security investment decisions.
