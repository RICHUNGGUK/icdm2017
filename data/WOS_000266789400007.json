Previous work in the area of structural-acoustic response considered systems subject to deterministic excitations. The response computation depends on the excitation; therefore, new methods are developed to account for stochastic excitation. The structural-acoustic response is calculated using finite element methods and stochastic analysis techniques. An accurate and highly efficient algorithm series for structural stationary random response analysis, pseudo excitation method (PEM) is used. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods and the program.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity analysis of coupled structural-acoustic systems subjected to stochastic excitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000266789400007"}
