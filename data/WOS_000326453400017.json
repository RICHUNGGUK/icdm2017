The dv/dt noise is removed completely by the mutual controlling of the high-side voltage signal, which improves the incapability of the full removal of dv/dt noise by conventional noise remove circuit due to the mismatch in the high-side circuit. In addition, no additional circuit is introduced to the noise canceling circuit. Fabricated in 700 V 0.5 mu m BCD with simulation tool HspiceD, the circuit shows good performances of a quiescent current less than 50 mu A, and a full removal of 70 V/ns dv/dt noise by the noise elimination function block. Moreover, a mismatch rate ranging within +/- 100 % can also be fully eliminated, thus ensuring the stability and reliability of the ultra-high-voltage gate driver's performance.", "paper_title": "dv/dt Noise canceling circuit in ultra-high-voltage MOS gate drivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000326453400017"}
