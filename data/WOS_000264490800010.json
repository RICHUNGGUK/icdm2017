The proposed prediction scheme is applicable to linear, stable, auto-regressive (AR) systems. The uncertainty predictors utilize the structure of the lattice filters. Subject to the saturation limits of the excitation signal, the measurement of the system output, and the a priori bounds of the reflection coefficients, the set of the feasible predicted output variables is computed. The suggested scheme is recursively computed over an l-step ahead future time window, while the prediction uncertainty intervals are similarly computed over the lattice stages, regarding the forward and the backward prediction errors. Simulation results are presented that prove the efficacy of the employed lattice uncertainty predictors.", "paper_title": "AR LATTICE l-STEP AHEAD OUTPUT UNCERTAINTY PREDICTION SCHEME WITH UNCERTAINTY INTERVALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264490800010"}
