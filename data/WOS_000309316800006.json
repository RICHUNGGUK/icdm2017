In this kind of computer vision technology, 3D face reconstruction is a hot research topic. This paper presents a method for feature points matching used in 3D reconstruction. In this method, the feature points can be identified exclusively taking advantage of the window unique property of a pseudo-random array. Thus, the matching problem can be solved by finding the correspondence between 2D coordinates of feature points in the pixel image and those in the code of the projected template. Then, the 3D reconstruction can be carried out with only a single image with the benefit of easy operation and simple calculation. An experiment for 3D face reconstruction with simulated data is given. The performances show that this method has high matching precision for object matching of feature points. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
