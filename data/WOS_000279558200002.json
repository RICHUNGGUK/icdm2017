A substantial challenge for making stylized line drawings from 3D models is the visibility computation. Current algorithms for computing line visibility in models of moderate complexity are either too slow for interactive rendering, or too brittle for coherent animation. We introduce two methods that exploit graphics hardware to provide fast and robust line visibility. First, we present a simple shader that performs a visibility test for high-quality, simple lines drawn with the conventional implementation. Next, we offer a full optimized pipeline that supports line visibility and a broad range of stylization options.", "paper_title": "Two Fast Methods for High-Quality Line Visibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000279558200002"}
