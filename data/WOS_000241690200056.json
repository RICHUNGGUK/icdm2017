In the proposed method, it is assumed that, for a certain technical domain, a list of known technical terms of the domain is given. Technical documents of the domain are collected through the Web search engine, which are then used for generating a vector space model for the domain. The domain specificity of a target term is estimated according to the distribution of the domain of the sample pages of the target term. Experimental evaluation results show that the proposed method achieved mostly 90% precision/recall.", "paper_title": "Towards automatic domain classification of technical terms: Estimating domain specificity of a term using the Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200056"}
