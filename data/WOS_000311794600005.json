We present three node architectures that implement the add/drop ratio restrictions of these schemes. Numerical experiments elucidate that restricting the add/drop ratios allows the hardware scale to be substantially reduced while the number of additional line fiber ports is minimal.", "paper_title": "Evaluations of OXC Hardware Scale and Network Resource Requirements of Different Optical Path Add/Drop Ratio Restriction Schemes [Invited]", "paper_id": "WOS:000311794600005"}
