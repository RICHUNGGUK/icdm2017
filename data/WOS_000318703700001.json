To prolong the life time of each node in MSNs, energy model and conservation should be considered carefully when designing the data communication mechanism in the network. The limited battery volume and high workload on channels worsen the life times of the busy nodes. In this paper, we propose a new energy evaluating methodology of packet transmissions in MSNs, which is based on redividing network layers and describing the synchronous data flow with matrix form. We first introduce the cache coherence layer to the protocol stack of MSNs. Then, we use a set of energy probability matrices to describe and calculate the energy consumption of each state in the protocol. After that, based on our energy model, we will give out an energy evaluating method of the MSNs design, which is suitable for measuring and comparing the energy consumption from different implements of hardware/software. Our experimental results show that our approach achieves a precision with less than 2% error and provides a credible quantitative criterion for energy optimization of data communication in MSNs.", "paper_title": "An Probability-Based Energy Model on Cache Coherence Protocol with Mobile Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000318703700001"}
