Our proposed Dynamic Attention-Aware Disparity Control (DADC) method produces depth-rich stereo rendering that improves viewer comfort through joint optimization of stereo parameters. While constructing the optimization model, we consider the importance of scene elements, as well as their distance to the camera and the locus of attention on the display. Our method also optimizes the depth effect of a given scene by considering the individual user's stereoscopic disparity range and comfortable viewing experience by controlling accommodation/convergence conflict. We validate our method in a formal user study that also reveals the advantages, such as superior quality and practical relevance, of considering our method.", "paper_title": "Attention-Aware Disparity Control in interactive environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000319478400022"}
