Since this calculus is non-deterministic, two different notions of solvability arise, one optimistic (angelical, may) and one pessimistic (demoniac, must). We give a syntactical, operational and logical characterization for the may-solvability and only a partial characterization of the must-solvability. Finally, we discuss the open problem of a complete characterization of the must-solvability.", "paper_title": "Linearity, Non-determinism and Solvability", "paper_id": "WOS:000285459000010"}
