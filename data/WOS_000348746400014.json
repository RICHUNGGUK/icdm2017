It is observed that when the advection becomes dominant, the analytical solution becomes ill-behaved and harder to evaluate. Therefore another approach is designed where the solution is decomposed in a simple wave solution and a viscous perturbation. It is shown that an exponential layer builds up close to the downstream boundary. Discussion and comparison of both solutions are carried out extensively offering the numericist a new test model for the numerical integration of the Navier-Stokes equation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
