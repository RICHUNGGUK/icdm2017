However, the ideal graph is, in practice, difficult to discover. Usually, one needs to construct graph empirically according to various motivations, priors, or assumptions; this is independent of the subsequent DR mapping calculation. Different from the previous works, in this paper, we attempt to learn a graph closely linked with the DR process, and propose an algorithm called dimensionality reduction with adaptive graph (DRAG), whose idea is to, during seeking projection matrix, simultaneously learn a graph in the neighborhood of a prespecified one. Moreover, the pre-specified graph is treated as a noisy observation of the ideal one, and the square Frobenius divergence is used to measure their difference in the objective function. As a result, we achieve an elegant graph update formula which naturally fuses the original and transformed data information. In particular, the optimal graph is shown to be a weighted sum of the pre-defined graph in the original space and a new graph depending on transformed space. Empirical results on several face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Dimensionality reduction with adaptive graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000325129700010"}
