Here we introduce a Markov model of nucleotide sequence evolution in which the instantaneous substitution rate at a site depends on the states of other sites. Based on the concept of neighbourhood systems, our model represents a universal description of arbitrarily complex dependencies among sites. Results: We show how to define complex models for some illustrative examples and demonstrate that our method provides a versatile resource for simulations of sequence evolution with site-specific interactions along a tree. For example, we are able to simulate the evolution of RNA taking into account both secondary structure as well as pseudoknots and other tertiary interactions. To this end, we have developed a program Simulating Site-Specific Interactions (SISSI) that simulates evolution of a nucleotide sequence along a phylogenetic tree incorporating user defined site-specific interactions. Furthermore, our method allows to simulate more complex interactions among nucleotide and other character based sequences.", "paper_title": "In silico sequence evolution with site-specific interactions along phylogenetic trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000236111600012"}
