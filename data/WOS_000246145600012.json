Independent component analysis (ICA) is utilized to separate source images from watermarked and reference images. Three independent component analysis approaches are examined in the proposed algorithm, which includes joint approximate diagonalization of eigenmatrices, second-order blind identification, and FastICA. Moreover, five different visible watermarking methods to embed uniform and linear-gradient watermarks are implemented. The experimental results show that visible watermarks are successfully removed, and that the proposed algorithm is independent of both the adopted ICA approach and the visible watermarking method. In the final experiment, several public domain images sourced from various websites are tested. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can blindly and successfully remove the visible watermarks without knowing the watermarking methods in advance.", "paper_title": "A novel image recovery algorithm for visible watermarked images", "paper_id": "WOS:000246145600012"}
