However, Web applications based on description logics should allow the treatment of the inherent imprecision. Therefore, it is necessary to add fuzzy features to description logics. A family of extended fuzzy description logics, which is a fuzzy extension of description logics by introducing cut set to describe fuzzy feature, is proposed to enable representation and reasoning for complex fuzzy information. This paper discusses the reasoning technique for reasoning tasks of a given extended fuzzy description logic extended fuzzy ALCQ by adopting classical description logic ACCQ to discretely simulate extended fuzzy ALCQ in polynomial time and reusing the existing result to prove the complexity of extended fuzzy ALCQ reasoning tasks.", "paper_title": "Reasoning technique for extended fuzzy ALCQ", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100125"}
