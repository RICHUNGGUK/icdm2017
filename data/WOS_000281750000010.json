To make this vision a reality, context-aware workflow management is one of key issues because the context of pervasive applications is changing dynamically. In this paper, we propose a context model for intelligent navigation applications and then present a context-aware workflow management algorithm (CAWM) which can adaptively adjust workflow execution behaviours based on current context information. The correctness of the CAWM algorithm has been also verified theoretically by formulating it as a Petri-net model. Furthermore, the proposed context model and workflow management algorithm can apply to other applications by simply revising the corresponding context structures only.", "paper_title": "CONTEXT-AWARE WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT FOR INTELLIGENT NAVIGATION APPLICATIONS IN PERVASIVE ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281750000010"}
