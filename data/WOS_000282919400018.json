In the proposed control, it, is not necessary to know the dynamics of the robotic arms It is proven that the closed loop system of the proportional derivative control with sliding mode gravity compensation applied to robotic arms is asymptotic stable 2) A high gain observed is used to estimate the joint velocities to avoid the necessity of the velocity measures. It, is proven that the high gain observer applied to the robotic arms is uniformly stable. 3) A proportional derivative con tivl with sliding mode gravity compensation that, uses the high, gain observer to estimate the joint velocities for robotic arms is proposed It is proven, the closed loop system of the proportional derivative control with sliding mode gravity compensation with the high gain observer applied to robotic arms is asymptotic stable. The simulations give the effectiveness of the suggested control", "paper_title": "AN ASYMPTOTIC STABLE PROPORTIONAL DERIVATIVE CONTROL WITH SLIDING MODE GRAVITY COMPENSATION AND WITH A HIGH GAIN OBSERVER FOR ROBOTIC ARMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400018"}
