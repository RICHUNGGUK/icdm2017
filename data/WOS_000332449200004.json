The goal of our Fuzzy Believer system presented in this paper is to extract and analyze statements of opinion from newspaper articles. Beliefs are modeled using the fuzzy set theory, applied after Natural Language Processing-based information extraction. The Fuzzy Believer models a human agent, deciding what statements to believe or reject based on a range of configurable strategies.", "paper_title": "Modeling human newspaper readers: The Fuzzy Believer approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000332449200004"}
