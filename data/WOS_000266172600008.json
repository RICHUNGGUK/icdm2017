Despite best practice research that identified Success factors for health information technology projects, a majority, in some sense, still fail. Similar problems plague a variety of different kinds of applications, and have done so for many years. Tell AMIA,working groups sponsored a workshop at the AMIA Fall 2006 Symposium. It was entitled \"Avoiding The F-Word: IT Project Morbidity, Mortality, and Immortality\" and focused on this under-addressed problem. Participants discussed communication, workflow, and quality; the complexity of information technology undertakings; the need to integrate all aspects of projects, work environments, and regulatory and policy requirements; and the difficulty Of getting all the parts and participants in harmony. While recognizing that there still are technical issue.,; related to functionality and interoperability, discussion affirmed the emerging consensus that problems ire due to sociological, Cultural, and financial issues, and hence are more managerial than technical. Participants drew oil lessons from experience and research in identifying important issues, action items, and recommendations to address the following: what \"success\" and \"failure\" mean, what contributes to making Successful Or unsuccessful systems, how to use failure as an enhanced learning opportunity for continued improvement, how system successes or failures Should be studied, and what AMIA Should do to enhance opportunities for successes. The workshop laid out a research agenda and recommended action items, reflecting the conviction that AMIA members and AMIA as an organization can take a leadership role to make projects more practical and likely to Succeed in health care settings.
