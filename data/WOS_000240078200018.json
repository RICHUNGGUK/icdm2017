This includes analysis of effects of dynamic behavior (like glitches) on critical paths, simultaneous switching, and identification of specific patterns and their timings. This paper proposes a novel approach that uses a combination of symbolic event propagation and temporal reasoning to extract timing properties of gate-level circuits. The formulation captures the complex situations like triggering of traditional false paths and simultaneous switching in a unified symbolic representation in addition to identifying false paths, critical paths, as well as conditions for such situations. This information is then represented as an event-time graph. A temporal logic on events is proposed that can be used to formulate a wide class of useful queries for various input scenarios. These include maximum/minimum delays, transition times, duration of patterns, etc. An algorithm is developed that retrieves answers to such queries from the event-time graph. A binary decision diagram-based implementation of this system has been made. Results on the International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)85 benchmarks are presented.", "paper_title": "Reasoning about timing behavior of digital circuits using symbolic event propagation and temporal logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000240078200018"}
