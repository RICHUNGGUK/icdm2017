We denote by OA((lambda, mu))(t, k, (v, w)) (or OA(t, k, (v, w)) if lambda = mu = 1) a (symmetric) orthogonal array OA (lambda) (t, k, v) with a nested OA (mu) (t, k, w) (as a subarray). It is proved in this article that an OA(t, t + 1,(v, w)) exists if and only if v a parts per thousand yen 2w for any positive integers v, w and any strength t a parts per thousand yen 2. Some constructions of OA((lambda, mu))(t, k, (v, w))'s with lambda not equal mu and k - t > 1 are also presented.", "paper_title": "Further results on the existence of nested orthogonal arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000316207200008"}
