In this article, a neural computation approach is reported that estimates illuminant direction from scenario reflectance map. Since the reflectance map recovered from depth map and image is a variable sized point cloud, we propose to parameterize it as a two dimensional polynomial function. Afterwards, a novel network model is presented for mapping from continuous function (reflectance map) to vectorial output (illuminant direction). Experimental results show that the proposed model works well on both synthetic and real scenes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
