We here present a new linear-time algorithm for finding maximal k-regions in alignments of three sequences, which can be used for the detection of segments featuring a certain degree of similarity, as well as the boundaries of distinct genomic environments such as gene clusters or haplotype blocks. k-regions are defined as these which have a center sequence whose Hamming distance from any of the alignment rows is at most k, and their determination in the general case is known to be NP-hard.", "paper_title": "A linear-time algorithm for studying genetic variation", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125600032"}
