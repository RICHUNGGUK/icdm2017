Multidimensional indexing techniques have been shown to greatly improve range query performance into large scientific datasets. In this paper, we discuss several ways of distributing a multidimensional index in order to speed up access to large distributed scientific datasets. This paper compares the designs, challenges, and problems for distributed multidimensional indexing schemes, and provides a comprehensive performance study of distributed indexing to provide guidelines to choose a distributed multidimensional index for a specific data analysis application.", "paper_title": "Analyzing design choices for distributed multidimensional indexing", "paper_id": "WOS:000299509500023"}
