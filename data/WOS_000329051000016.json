They can be quite big and complex and, thus, difficult to be accessed manually. The ability to query a single schema, a collection of schemas or to retrieve schema components that meet certain structural constraints significantly eases schema management and is, thus, useful in many contexts. In this paper, we propose a query language, named XSPath, specifically tailored for XML schema that works on logical graph-based representations of schemas, on which it enables the navigation, and allows the selection of nodes. We also propose XPath/XQuery-based translations that can be exploited for the evaluation of XSPath queries. An extensive evaluation of the usability and efficiency of the proposed approach is finally presented within the EXup system [9].", "paper_title": "XSPath: Navigation on XML Schemas Made Easy", "paper_id": "WOS:000329051000016"}
