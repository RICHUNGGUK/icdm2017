In our study, a symmetric-key cryptosystem was designed by applying a modern DNA biotechnology, microarray, into cryptographic technologies. This is referred to as DNA symmetric-key cryptosystem (DNASC). In DNASC, both encryption and decryption keys are formed by DNA probes, while its cipher-text is embedded in a specially designed DNA chip (microarray). The security of this system is mainly rooted in difficult biology processes and problems, rather than conventional computing technology, thus it is unaffected by changes from the attack of the coming quantum computer. The encryption process is a fabrication of a specially designed DNA chip and the decryption process is the DNA hybridization. In DNASC, billions of DNA probes are hybridized and identified at the same time, thus the decryption process is conducted in a massive, parallel way. The great potential in vast parallelism computation and the extraordinary information density of DNA are displayed in DNASC to some degree.", "paper_title": "Symmetric-key cryptosystem with DNA technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000247829800005"}
