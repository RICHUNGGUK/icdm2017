The results are carefully analyzed and compared to each other. The final goal of this paper is to show that it is possible to couple passive and active control techniques to improve the flow control. In the present study, a drag reduction of 30% is achieved, almost corresponding to the goal of automotive industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
