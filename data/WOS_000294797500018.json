In recent years, e-mail has become a popular medium for various types of data transmission. The Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) program is one solution that ensures the confidentiality of e-mail. Unfortunately, PGP does not provide the secure requirement of perfect forward secrecy for e-mail. Recently, many secure e-mail protocols have been proposed to overcome this potential drawback of PGP. In this article, we point out some other potential drawbacks of existing protocols and propose a feasible, efficient e-mail protocol for mobile devices.", "paper_title": "A SECURE E-MAIL PROTOCOL FOR MOBILE DEVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500018"}
