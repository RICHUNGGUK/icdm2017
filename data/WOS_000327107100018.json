Inspired by various artists, interesting effects can be produced by using a minimal rendering, where the minimum refers to the number of tones as well as the number and complexity of the primitives used for rendering. Our method is based on various computer vision techniques, and uses a combination of refined lines and blocks (potentially simplified), as well as a small number of tones, to produce abstracted artistic rendering with sufficient elements from the original image. We also considered a variety of methods to produce different artistic styles, such as colour and 2-tone drawings, and use semantic information to improve renderings for faces. By changing some intuitive parameters a wide range of visually pleasing results can be produced. Our method is fully automatic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments and a user study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
