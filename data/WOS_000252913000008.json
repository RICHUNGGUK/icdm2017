Visual fatigue caused by stereoscopic images is a safety issue. Fatigue is possible caused by the discrepancy between accommodative and convergence stimuli that are included in the image. Studies on accommodation and convergence are surveyed and an explanation regarding the characteristics of these functions is offered. Studies in the literature on changes in oculomotor function after viewing stereoscopic images, including changes in pupillary responses, are discussed. Evaluation of visual fatigue, particularly in relation to different methods of viewing stereoscopic displays is described. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
