We do not assume the availability of synchronized physical clocks because they may not be available or may be too expensive for predicate detection in such environments with a (relatively) low event occurrence rate. We address the problem of detecting each occurrence of a global predicate, at the earliest possible instant, by proposing a suite of three on-line middleware protocols having varying degrees of accuracy. We analyze the degree of accuracy for the proposed protocols. The extent of false negatives and false positives is determined by the run-time message processing latencies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
