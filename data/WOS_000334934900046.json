Calculations suggest that a dianion is not formed, which conforms to classical dianion formation normally requiring strong kinetic bases. Instead ethoxide in ethanol produces a monoanionic species driving the MCD cyclization. This endeavor has opened up potential to expand the scope of this unique reaction and provide educational clarity.", "paper_title": "Mechanistic aspects of the lycopodine Michael-Claisen domino cyclization", "paper_id": "WOS:000334934900046"}
