The tracking initialization has been discussed for different types of video cameras A multiple tracking management module is applied to optimize the system. The principal objective of this paper is to test and demonstrate the feasibility of tracking multiple workers from statically placed and dynamically moving cameras Published by Elsevier Ltd", "paper_title": "Tracking multiple workers on construction sites using video cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000283403900006"}
