Conducting ODC classification on existing organizational defect reports is human-intensive and requires experts' knowledge of both ODC and system domains. This paper presents AutoODC, an approach for automating ODC classification by casting it as a supervised text classification problem. Rather than merely applying the standard machine learning framework to this task, we seek to acquire a better ODC classification system by integrating experts' ODC experience and domain knowledge into the learning process via proposing a novel relevance annotation framework. We have trained AutoODC using two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for text classification, Naive Bayes (NB) and support vectormachine (SVM), and evaluated it on both an industrial defect report from the social network domain and a larger defect list extracted from a publicly accessible defect tracker of the open source system FileZilla. AutoODC is a promising approach: not only does it leverage minimal human effort beyond the human annotations typically required by standard machine learning approaches, but it achieves overall accuracies of 82.9 % (NB) and 80.7 % (SVM) on the industrial defect report, and accuracies of 77.5 % (NB) and 75.2 % (SVM) on the larger, more diversified open source defect list.", "paper_title": "AutoODC: Automated generation of orthogonal defect classifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000351476800002"}
