Practical results are obtained which overcome those based on the extension principle or alpha-cuts. The proposed approach is based on a different representation of fuzzy numbers, though most common arithmetic operators cannot be directly applied for designing a fuzzy controller due to the unjustified overestimation effect. To avoid this phenomenon, a procedure based on an \"exact\" resolution calculus is proposed, whose solutions allow creating a fuzzy internal model control scheme. The validity of the new method is illustrated by a real-time educational engineering application on classical control design: a coupled tanks system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
