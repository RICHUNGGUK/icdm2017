While progress is being made in scheduling arbitrarily divisible loads, previous approaches have no support for advance reservations. However, with the emergence of Grid applications that require simultaneous access to multi-site resources, supporting advance reservations in a cluster has become increasingly important. In this paper we propose a new real-time divisible load scheduling algorithm that supports advance reservations in a cluster. The impact of advance reservations on system performance is systematically studied. Simulation results show that, with the proposed algorithm and appropriate advance reservations, the system performance could be maintained at the same level as the no reservation case. Thus, Our approach enforces the real-time agreement vis-a-vis addresses the under-utilization concerns.", "paper_title": "Scheduling real-time divisible loads with advance reservations", "paper_id": "WOS:000301847500002"}
