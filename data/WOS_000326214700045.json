On a country level, clusters were identified and characterized by patterns of proposal production per inhabitant, score and international cooperation. Belgium and Sweden constitute a cluster characterized by high proposal production, with very high scores and extensive international collaboration. Belgium also excels from another cluster analysis, being as the only country where 100% of proposals involve industry-academia cooperation and obtain scores above 10. Other findings show that single partner proposals have significantly lower quality than multi-partner proposals but, on the other hand, the number of countries involved shows no influence on the quality of the proposals. Despite the high number of industrial participants present on the proposals, it is observed that they play secondary roles in the proposals, with a very low number projects leaded by companies. Also, it is observed that partnerships between research institutions (non-universities) are the most successful. Concerning topics of the proposals, the technology human-robot interface and the product vision robot for small-scale manufacturing are the most significant. Finally, the paper shows clusters of institutions extracted from the giant network of relations obtained from the ECHORD set of proposals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
