According to user's RFID tag, the platform accesses the remote digital content database and broadcasts the corresponding digital content related to the end-user's personal requirements, locations, or historical user records. On the basis of the mobility prediction, the individual and diverse information services are seamlessly provided to each user. The real test and verification prove that the proposed platform can certainly reduce the construction cost of specific area service system deployment.", "paper_title": "Mobility corresponding location-aware information services based on embedded RFID platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000300789500006"}
