Since the true dynamics are hidden, various diffusion models have been exposed to explain the cascading behavior. Such models require extensive simulation for estimating the dissemination over time. In an earlier work, we proposed a unified model which provides an approximate analytical solution to the problem of predicting probability of infection of every node in the network over time. Our model generalizes a large class of diffusion process. We demonstrate through extensive empirical evaluation that the error of approximation is small. We build upon our unified model to develop an efficient method for influence maximization. Unlike most approaches, we assume that diffusion spreads not only via the edges of the underlying network, but also through temporal functions of external out-of-network processes. We empirically evaluate our approach and compare it against state-of-the-art approaches on real-world large-scale networks. The evaluation demonstrates that our method has significant performance gains over widely used seed-set selection algorithms.", "paper_title": "The unified model of social influence and its application in influence maximization", "paper_id": "WOS:000366196300041"}
