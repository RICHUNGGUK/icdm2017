With this aim, we introduce a small adimensional parameter epsilon related to the depth. First we make a change of variable to a domain independent of epsilon and then we use asymptotic analysis to study what happens when epsilon becomes small. This way we obtain two new models for epsilon small that, after coming back to the original domain and without making a priori assumptions about velocity or pressure behaviour, give us a shallow water model including a new diffusion term (obtained from Navier-Stokes equations) and a shallow water model without viscosity and explicit dependence on depth (obtained from Euler equations).
