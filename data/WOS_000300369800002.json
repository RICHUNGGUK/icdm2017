One of the research issues in EPON is to support service differentiation and fairness. For service differentiation, the conventional limited algorithm is extended with strict priority queuing (SPQ). However, due to ONU-bounded bandwidth allocation, those extensions from the limited algorithm have difficulties in supporting QoS and fairness when the uplink is instantaneously overloaded. To overcome the disadvantages of ONU-bounded bandwidth allocation, instead of allocating the bandwidth on per ONU basis, the proposed class-limited algorithm allocates the bandwidth on per service class basis. Our simulations showthat the class-limited algorithm is more efficient to differentiate services and to fairly share residual bandwidth than other limited schemes combined with SPQ, particularly for instantaneous overload condition.", "paper_title": "Class-limited algorithm for supporting QoS and fairness in Ethernet passive optical network", "paper_id": "WOS:000300369800002"}
