A new spatial error concealment method for stereoscopic video coding based on pixel matching in the decoder is proposed in this paper. The lost macroblocks are recovered by utilizing disparity matching between two-view images on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Firstly, we get the candidate disparity vectors of the four neighboring pixels of the lost pixel by disparity matching in the decoder. Secondly, by calculating the boundary pixel difference, we determine an optimal replacing pixel in the reference image, and then we recover the lost pixel by the optimal pixel in the reference image. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better comparing to the previous technique.", "paper_title": "Spatial error concealment for stereoscopic video coding based on pixel matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000294498100008"}
