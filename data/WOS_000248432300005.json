Yet, there has been little research on the link between OIP capabilities and employees' perceived usability of KM tools in an organization. We developed a path model employing several constructs: teachability, codificability, information acquisition, information dissemination, organizational memory, information integration, and perceived usability. We then explored the relationships between employees' perception of the effectiveness of KM activities and empirically tested the model using a sample of 157 enterprises from the Taiwanese Information Service Industry. Our results showed that all proposed relationships except a link between codificability and memory capability were supported by the data. The findings and their implications are discussed.
