Implementing SpGEMM efficiently on throughput-oriented processors, such as the graphics processing unit (GPU), requires the programmer to expose substantial fine-grained parallelism while conserving the limited off-chip memory bandwidth. Balancing these concerns, we decompose the SpGEMM operation into three highly parallel phases: expansion, sorting, and contraction, and introduce a set of complementary bandwidth-saving performance optimizations. Our implementation is fully general and our optimization strategy adaptively processes the SpGEMM workload row-wise to substantially improve performance by decreasing the work complexity and utilizing the memory hierarchy more effectively.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication for the GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000363733000003"}
