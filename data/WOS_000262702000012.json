Exploiting the factor that the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is unitary, the proposed receiver can equalize the signals by the MMSE detecting to the spectrums in the frequency domain instead of the waveforms in the time domain. In order to obtain the right decisions, the detector must be able to equalize the overall spectrum with regard to each layer. This work can be performed very efficiently since the system matrix has been designed as a special block-circulant-block matrix. Similar to other V-BLAST-like systems, the detecting order has strong impact on the performance of MMSE-FDDF. Therefore, we further give a fast optimally sorting scheme for the MMSE-FDDF architecture. By using the newly constructed matrix, the coefficients computation and the sorting can be combined into one process, and then we employ the modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) to simplify the process. The simulation results and the computational complexity analysis show that the proposed MMSE-FDDF has better tradeoff between the performance and the complexity than the existing algorithms. In addition, MMSE-FDDF can avoid the performance floor caused by the overlap-and-save technique in the severe dispersive channel.", "paper_title": "Fast frequency-domain equalization for single-carrier V-BLAST systems over multipath channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000262702000012"}
