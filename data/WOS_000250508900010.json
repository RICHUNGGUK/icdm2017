Through the use of one age-based and another calendar time- based dynamic Bayesian model, we are able to examine how the impact of these factors changes over time. Our results are based on data from 115 publicly-traded Internet. firms and suggest that Internet firm survival relates to different factors, such as the initial public offerings rate of Internet stocks in the market,. financial capital and. firm size at different stages in their lifetimes, whose influence may have changed over time.
