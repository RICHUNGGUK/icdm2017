The research on passive dynamic bipedal walking helps create an understanding of walking mechanics. Moreover, the experimental passive dynamic research provides a base to compare and validate computer simulation results. An improved kneed bipedal walking mechanism was designed and built to study the passive gait patterns. The first aim of this study is to determine the equivalency of testing a passive dynamic biped walker on a treadmill to testing on a ramp. Based on the small difference between the gait patterns measured on the two test platforms, testing on a treadmill was found equivalent to testing on a ramp. Gait measurements were then conducted on the treadmill to evaluate the effects of the treadmill inclination angle, mass distribution of the biped, and the length of flat feet on the gait pattern. Results show that most of these parameters had significant effects on the step length, step period and hip velocity of the passive walker. Our experimental results are also compared with previous experimental results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
