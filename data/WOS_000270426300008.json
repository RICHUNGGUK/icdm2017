AHS employs adaptive method to adjust two important parameters, pitch adjusting rate (PAR) and bandwidth (bw). The proposed AHS algorithm is tested numerically and contrasted with improved harmony search (IHS) algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing (SA). Our simulation results reveal that AHS is superior to IHS, PSO, and SA in terms of robustness and efficiency. Finally, an engineering optimization problem is solved. And the result obtained using AHS algorithm is better than those reported previously in the literature.", "paper_title": "ON AN ADAPTIVE HARMONY SEARCH ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000270426300008"}
