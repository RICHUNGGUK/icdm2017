Based on this formula a new topological Cl index is proposed. In this note it is observed that co graphs are precisely isometric subgraphs of hypercubes alias partial cubes. Some fact about partial cubes and their uses in chemical graph theory are listed. A couple of comments on the CI index are also given.", "paper_title": "Some comments on CO graphs and CI index", "paper_id": "WOS:000252605700007"}
