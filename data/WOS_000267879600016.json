These solutions, even of a high quality. suffer from some drawbacks. Most of them related to the lack of interoperability among different Public Administrations or the difficulties to locate or invoke the desired service. To deal with these issues. a semantic-based approach centered in citizens is proposed. This paper tackles the provision of a front-end solution to access services in Public Administrations. A complete software interface within a holistic model of service is deeply discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
