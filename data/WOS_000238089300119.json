These vertical faces were concatenated to create an approximate model on which the images could be backprojected as textures. We proposed a retrieval technique of selecting vertical-textured planar faces from archived 3D image mosaics to fast represent a 3D world, where this selection is based on proximity to the user location in the virtual world. The chosen vertical-textured planar faces are recomposed as a continuous set formed stream and are then rendered in 3D virtual space.", "paper_title": "Retrieval of 3D video mosaics for fast 3D visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300119"}
