By establishing an integral delay inequality and using the inequality method, some sufficient conditions ensuring impulsive exponential anti-synchronization of two chaotic delayed networks are derived. To illustrate the effectiveness of the new scheme, a numerical example is given. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
