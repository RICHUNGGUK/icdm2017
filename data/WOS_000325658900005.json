MCC alleviates the burden of storage and computation on mobile devices. In this article, we describe design requirements and an architecture for MCC. The novelty in this architecture is an integrated cloudlet and base station subsystem that can meet application-level quality of service requirements and allow mobile resource provisioning close to the user. We present a layered architecture for MCC that elucidates the required functions and protocols. We also propose a connection handoff mechanism among cloudlets and discuss related resource management challenges for MCC.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Cloud Architecture for Mobile Multimedia Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000325658900005"}
