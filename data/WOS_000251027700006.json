It is assumed that component 2 after a repair is \"as good as new'' while component 1 after a repair is not, but component 1 is given priority in use. Under these assumptions, by using the geometric process repair model, we consider a replacement policy N based on the number of failures of component 1 under which the system is replaced when the number of failures of component 1 reaches N. Our problem is to determine an optimal policy N* such that the long-run average cost per unit time (i. e. the average cost rate) of the system is minimized. The explicit expression of the average cost rate of the system is derived and the corresponding optimal replacement policy N* can be determined numerically. Finally, a special system with Weibull-distributed working time and repair time of component 1 is given to illustrate the theoretical results in this article.", "paper_title": "An optimal replacement policy for repairable cold standby system with priority in use", "paper_id": "WOS:000251027700006"}
