Moreover, our remote actions are not reflected in the live event, so the objective of supporting our team is never really accomplished. By introducing a new interaction paradigm, which stimulates remote fans to participate in the actions happening in the stadium, it is possible to provide users with entertainment and to bring the venue atmosphere and its emotional level to remote users. This paper presents the concepts and prototypes that have been designed to engage remote fans in broadcasted sports, and to make fans, both at the venue and worldwide, feel part of the same community. These prototypes are multiplayer mobile games, which allow remote fans to interact and mimic common actions usually performed by supporters attending sports events.", "paper_title": "Engaging remote fans in live sports", "paper_id": "WOS:000375125900003"}
