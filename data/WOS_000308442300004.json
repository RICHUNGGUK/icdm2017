This is why several learning methods, to some extent robust to outliers, have been proposed. In this paper we present a new robust learning algorithm based on the iterative Least Median of Squares, that outperforms some existing solutions in its accuracy or speed. We demonstrate how to minimise new non-differentiable performance function by a deterministic approximate method. Results of simulations and comparison with other learning methods are demonstrated. Improved robustness of our novel algorithm, for data sets with varying degrees of outliers, is shown.", "paper_title": "Robust Learning Algorithm Based on Iterative Least Median of Squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000308442300004"}
