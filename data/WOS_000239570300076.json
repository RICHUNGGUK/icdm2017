Under the conditions of several statistical assumptions, closed formulae of probability and mathematical expectation are derived for each type of connections. Both the theoretical deduction and simulation results are given to verify our approach. The elementary research can be applied to implement and optimize the interconnect resource of mesh-based reconfigurable computing.", "paper_title": "Interconnect estimation for mesh-based reconfigurable computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300076"}
