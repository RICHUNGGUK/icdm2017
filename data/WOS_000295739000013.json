A general setting where the user rates and the average channel gains are not restricted to be symmetric is investigated. This asymmetric scenario allows to analyze networks with \"mixed\" interference, i.e., when different sources are at different distance from their intended destination, that are not possible under the commonly used symmetric assumption. Inner and outer bounds for the diversity are derived. The outer bound is based on the recent \"to within one bit\" capacity result of Etkin et al. for the unfaded Gaussian channel and is a re-derivation of a known bound for which an error is pointed out. The inner bound is based on the Han and Kobayashi achievable region both without rate splitting and with a rate spitting inspired by the \"to within one bit\" capacity result. An analytical comparison of the diversity upper and lower bounds for a general channel seems difficult; by numerical evaluations, the two bounds are shown to coincide for a fairly large set of channel parameters.", "paper_title": "Outage Analysis of Block-Fading Gaussian Interference Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000013"}
