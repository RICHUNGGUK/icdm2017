Design/methodology/approach - Finite element method is used for motors performance determination. The BLDC operation mode for the motors with different slot and pole number combination and concentrated windings was accounted for in the comparison. Findings - In the BLDC operation mode motor structures with concentrated windings with similar slot and pole numbers exhibit at the same current density similar or even higher torque capability and lower electromagnetic torque ripple in comparison to the motor structure with distributed windings. Motor structures with 9-slot/8-pole, 9-slot/10-pole, 12-slot/10-pole slot and pole number combinations are the most appropriate for the BLDC operation. Originality/value - The paper shows which motor structures with distributed or concentrated windings in the BLDC operation mode produce lower torque ripple and higher average torque per ampere.", "paper_title": "Permanent magnet synchronous motor with exterior-rotor - Distributed or concentrated windings - motor performance comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000239539900021"}
