It requires a system that can manage some kind of knowledge to interpret that emotional language is being used. In this work, we try to provide this knowledge to the system by considering alternative sets of features obtained according to different criteria. We test a range of different feature sets using two different classifiers. Our results show that the sarcasm detection task benefits from the inclusion of linguistic and semantic information sources, while nasty language is more easily detected using only a set of surface patterns or indicators.
