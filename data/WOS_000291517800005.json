It supports rectangular structuring element, runs in linear time w.r.t. the image size and constant time w.r.t. the structuring element size, and has minimal memory usage. It has zero algorithm latency and processes data in stream. These properties are inherited by operators composed by concatenation, and allow their efficient implementation. We show how to compute in one pass an Alternate Sequential Filter (ASF(n)) regardless the number of stages n. This algorithm opens the way to such time-critical applications where the complexity and memory requirements of serial morphological operators represented a bottleneck limiting their usability.
