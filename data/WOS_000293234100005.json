The minimum cardinality of a PDS of G is its power domination number. In this article, we find upper bounds for the power domination number of some families of Cartesian products of graphs: the cylinders P(n)square C(m) for integers n >= 2, m >= 3, and the tori C(n)square C(m) for integers n, m >= 3. We apply similar techniques to present upper bounds for the power domination number of generalized Petersen graphs P(m, k). We prove those upper bounds provide the exact values of the power domination numbers if the integers m, n, and k satisfy some given relations. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
