Instead of failing, the swarm continues to perform based on the inputs of the remaining sensors. In this technical correspondence, a multiobjective scenario is designed for a swarm of agents to complete. Once optimized, the swarm is modified by removing one of its sensors. Maintaining the original objective, the evolution process is continued to allow the swarm to compensate for its handicap. This technical correspondence describes the different emergent behaviors of the swarm to compensate for the loss of function. The solution for the diminished swarm can vary significantly from that of the original.", "paper_title": "Recovery from Sensor Failure in an Evolving Multiobjective Swarm", "paper_id": "WOS:000346733600014"}
