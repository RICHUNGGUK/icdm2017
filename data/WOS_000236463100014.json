When dealing with large corpora of videos documents, using a feature representation requires the on-line computation of distances between all documents and a query. Hence, a dissimilarity representation may be preferred because its offline computation speeds up the retrieval process. We show how distances related to visual and audio video features can directly be used to learn complex concepts from a set of positive and negative examples provided by the user. Based on the idea of dissimilarity spaces, we derive three algorithms to fuse modalities and therefore to enhance the precision of retrieval results. The evaluation of our technique is performed on artificial data and on the annotated TRECVID corpus.", "paper_title": "Learning user queries in multimodal dissimilarity spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000236463100014"}
