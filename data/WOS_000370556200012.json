In this work, we demonstrate that some coarse-grained scheduling mechanisms can be easily offered by SDN switches without requiring any unsupported operation in OpenFlow. We leverage the feedback loop - flow statistics - exposed by SDN switches to the controller, combined with priority queuing mechanisms, usually available in typical switches on their output ports. We illustrate our approach through experimentations with an OpenvSwitch SDN switch controlled by a Beacon controller.", "paper_title": "Coarse-grained Scheduling with Software-Defined Networking Switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000370556200012"}
