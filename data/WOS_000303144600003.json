In this context, the CLIC method (French acronym for \"Cotation en Localisation avec Influence des Contacts\") has been developed in our laboratory since 1998. The method describes the complete process involved in functional tolerancing. The three dimensional calculation of the result of tolerance chain is formulated functions of tolerances and offsets of surfaces, based on transfer by tolerance zone or by virtual boundary. However, the current standards are incomplete to specify complex junctions, for example to respect a minimum clearance. The paper outlines that the independence principle does not permit to limit the orientation inside location zone in particular case with floating datum reference frame. Then, two main contributions are developed, the extension of material conditions on complex surfaces and the definition of a new association criterion in order to specify hybrid prismatic surfaces with a surface contact zone and a zone with clearance. In this aim, the paper advises six propositions as possible extension of standards of tolerancing. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
