Our algorithm produces solutions of value at most OPT + 1 in time d(O(d)) (log(7) n + s(3.5)), where OPT is the value of an optimum solution, n is the number of objects, and s is the total number of bits needed to encode the object sizes. This algorithm works under the assumption that the modified integer round-up property of Scheithauer and Terno for the cutting stock problem holds. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
