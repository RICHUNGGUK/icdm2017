Collaborations between engineers, Human Factors specialists, industrial designers and medical end users were foreseen, but actual methodologies had to be developed. Three applications were used as development vehicles and as demonstrators. The resulting teamwork and process of indentifying requirements, finding solutions (in technology and workflow), and shifting between these to optimize and speed development towards quality of care were studied. The ARIS*ER approach solves current problems in collaborative teams, taking a systems approach, and manages the overview of requirements and solutions, which is too complex to manage centrally.
