However, the condition number of the associated stiffness matrix becomes large if E is too small, which leads to the unstable computation. In this paper, we design an iterative penalty method for the problem and give some error estimates. In our algorithm, we can use a not very small penalty parameter E independent of h to avoid the unstable computation. Numerical examples are given to show that the algorithm is very effective and powerful.
