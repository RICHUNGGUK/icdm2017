Though many improvements published aims to increase the computational efficiency, there are still many works need to do. Inspired by evolution programming theory, this paper proposes a new adaptive particle swarm optimization in which the velocity threshold dynamically changes during the course of a simulation. Seven benchmark functions are used to testify the new algorithm, and the results showed clearly the new adaptive PSO leads to a significantly better performance, although the performance improvements were found to be dependent on problems.", "paper_title": "Adaptive velocity threshold particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500047"}
