In a network virtualization environment, a set of virtual networks share the resources of a common physical network although each virtual network is isolated from others. Benefits include increased flexibility, diversity, security and manageability. Resource discovery and allocation are fundamental steps in the process of creating new virtual networks. This paper surveys previous work on, and the present status of, resource discovery and allocation in network virtualization. We also describe challenges and suggest future directions for this area of research.", "paper_title": "Resource Discovery and Allocation in Network Virtualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000315392500010"}
