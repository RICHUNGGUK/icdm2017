We reduce its computation to the case of irreducible configurations and describe its behavior under specialization of some of the variables to zero. We give characterizations of dual defect toric varieties in terms of their Gale dual and classify dual defect toric varieties of codimension less than or equal to four. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
