Concrete that is not properly casted or consolidated may have defects, such as air voids, honeycombs, and aggregate segregation. The modeling of fresh concrete flow can significantly contribute to the durability and strength of a structure and it is necessary for design optimization of casting procedure. The fresh concrete is considered as a non-Newtonian fluid. The Bingham model is used as constitutive model, with the yield stress and plastic viscosity as parameters. An interface-capturing approach is used to track the position of a free surface. (C) 2008 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
