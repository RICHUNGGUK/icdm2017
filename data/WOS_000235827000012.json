The AN then constructs a local-view for the cluster by exploring Correlations among information received from nearby SNs, and sends the local-view toward a base-station that creates a global-view for the entire WSN. ANs can also relay local-views for other ANs, if the resultant network lifetime is longer. In this paper, we want to arrange inter-AN relaying optimally, which is an important process in topology control for maximizing the topological lifetime of a WSN with regard to a certain amount of initial energy provisioning. We first propose some criteria on relay candidates preselection, which can considerably reduce the overhead of obtaining an optimal relaying. We then design an algorithm to serialize the parallel relay allocation, so that each AN only needs to have one relaying AN at any time. Finally, we demonstrate the equivalency in network lifetime of the serialized inter-AN relay schedules. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
