The phase calibration is digitally controlled and considers the mismatch effect of charge pump, removing the disadvantage of conventional analog calibration circuit whose performance is sensitive to process and temperature variations and aging. It is shown that the two VDBs have an 8 degrees quadrature phase shift tuning range, and an 8 mA current at 1.7 HGz, and the calibration process takes less than 160 mu s.", "paper_title": "Phase self-calibrated scheme for zero-IF receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000246764800005"}
