Recent works suggest that this functional plasticity is related to alterations in the area of representation of the conditioned stimulus frequency in AI. In this work, we present a computational model of AI and pre-cortical structures involved with auditory processing (cochlea and medial geniculate body) which reproduces some properties of tonotopic maps in AI. The model is used to simulate a classical conditioning experiment, which causes retuning of certain neurons to the conditioned frequency. This retuning is accompanied by an expansion of the cortical representation area of the conditioned frequency.
