These two approaches are applied to analysis of large genealogies. Genealogies can be represented as graphs in different ways: as Ore graphs, p-graphs, or bipartite p-graphs. We show that p-graphs are more suitable for searching for relinking patterns, whereas Ore graphs are better for computing kinship relations using network multiplication. Algorithms described in this article are implemented in the program Pajek.", "paper_title": "Analysis of kinship relations with Pajek", "paper_id": "WOS:000255167400007"}
