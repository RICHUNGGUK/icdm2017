It is reported in the literature that the complexity of this problem is still open. We show in this paper that this problem is NP-hard under high multiplicity encoding and can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time under binary encoding. When the first agent's objective is to minimize the total weighted completion time, we show that the problem is strongly NP-hard even when the number of tardy jobs of the second agent is restricted to be zero.", "paper_title": "A note on the complexity of the problem of two-agent scheduling on a single machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000241166500006"}
