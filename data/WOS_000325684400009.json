Concretely, we investigate a generalization of the known conjunctive normal form (CNF) in the classical logic representation that we call the generalized conjunctive normal form (GCNF), which aims to characterize the constants and implication connectives that are essentially different from the ones in classical logic. We then extend the established resolution principle at a certain truth-value level alpha (called alpha-resolution) in this lattice-valued logic to a more general form, i.e., from binary alpha-resolution to multiary alpha-resolution. The extension to multiary alpha-resolution starts from lattice-valued propositional logic LP(X), while its theorems of both soundness and completeness are proved. Multiary alpha-resolution principle is then further established in the corresponding lattice-valued first-order logic LF(X), along with its soundness theorem, lifting lemma, and completeness theorem. Meanwhile, an important result that multiary alpha-resolution principle in LF(X) can be equivalently transformed into that in LP(X) to some extent is obtained. All these works will theoretically support the establishment of an automated reasoning algorithm and its implementation with further applications into automated deduction and decision-making problems under uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Multiary alpha-Resolution Principle for a Lattice-Valued Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000325684400009"}
