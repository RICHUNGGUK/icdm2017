Embedded scalable video bitstreams, together with a complementary content adaptation framework, give the possibility to respond to heterogeneous usage environments. In this paper, temporally scalable H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoded bitstreams and bitstreams encoded by relying on the fully-embedded MC-EZBC wavelet-based codec are used. The MPEG-21 Bitstream Syntax Description Language (BSDL) specification is used to generate high-level XML descriptions of the structure of a bitstream. As such, the adaptation of a scalable video stream can be realized in the XML domain, rather than on the bitstream itself. Different transformation technologies are compared to each other as well. Finally, a practical setup of a video streaming use case is discussed by relying on the MPEG-21 BSDL framework.", "paper_title": "MPEG-21 bitstream syntax descriptions for scalable video codecs", "paper_id": "WOS:000238024500002"}
