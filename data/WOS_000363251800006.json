Circularly polarized (CP) liquid crystal display (LCD) is one of the main-stream consumer 3D displays with the prospering of 3D movies and gamings. The polarizing system including the patterned retarder is one of the major causes of crosstalk in CP LCD. The contributions of this paper are the modeling of the polarizing system of CP LCD, and a crosstalk reduction method that efficiently cancels crosstalk and preserves image contrast. For the modeling, the practical orientation of the polarized glasses (PG) is considered. In addition, this paper calculates the rotation of the light-propagation coordinate for the Stokes vector as light propagates from LCD to PG, and this calculation is missing in the previous works when applying Mueller calculus. The proposed crosstalk reduction method is formulated as a linear programming problem, which can be easily solved. In addition, we propose excluding the highly textured areas in the input images to further preserve image contrast in crosstalk reduction.", "paper_title": "Modeling, Prediction, and Reduction of 3D Crosstalk in Circular Polarized Stereoscopic LCDs", "paper_id": "WOS:000363251800006"}
