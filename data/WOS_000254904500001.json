This is often the case when there are time or resource constraints involved in finding a solution. FastPGA utilizes a new ranking strategy that utilizes more information about Pareto dominance among solutions and niching relations. New genetic operators are employed to enhance the proposed algorithm's performance in terms of convergence behavior and computational effort as rapid convergence is of utmost concern and highly desired when solving expensive multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). Computational results for a number of test problems indicate that FastPGA is a promising approach. FastPGA yields similar performance to that of the improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), a widely-accepted benchmark in the MOEA research community. However, FastPGA outperforms NSGA-II when only a small number of solution evaluations are permitted, as would be the case when solving expensive MOPs.", "paper_title": "A fast Pareto genetic algorithm approach for solving expensive multiobjective optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254904500001"}
