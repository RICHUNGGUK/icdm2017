In this paper, a multitude of pioneering applications increasingly carry out pervasive collection and dissemination of information and environmental data, such as traffic conditions, pollution, temperature, and so on. Participants collect and report measurements from their mobile devices and entrust them to the cloud to be made available to applications and users. Naturally, due to the personal information associated to the reports ( e. g., location, movements, etc.), a number of privacy concerns need to be considered prior to a large-scale deployment of these applications. Motivated by the need for privacy protection in participatory sensing, this paper presents a privacy-enhanced participatory sensing infrastructure. We explore realistic architectural assumptions and a minimal set of formal requirements aiming at protecting privacy of both data producers and consumers. We propose two instantiations that attain privacy guarantees with provable security at very low additional computational cost and almost no extra communication overhead.", "paper_title": "Extended Capabilities for a Privacy-Enhanced Participatory Sensing Infrastructure (PEPSI)", "paper_id": "WOS:000327345700011"}
