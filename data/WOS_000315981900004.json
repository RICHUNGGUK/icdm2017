This learning algorithm involves a Parzen windowing scaling parameter. We present a learning theory approach for this MEE algorithm in a regression setting when the scaling parameter is large. Consistency and explicit convergence rates are provided in terms of the approximation ability and capacity of the involved hypothesis space. Novel analysis is carried out for the generalization error associated with Renyi's entropy and a Parzen windowing function, to overcome technical difficulties arising from the essential differences between the classical least squares problems and the MEE setting. An involved symmetrized least squares error is introduced and analyzed, which is related to some ranking algorithms.", "paper_title": "Learning Theory Approach to Minimum Error Entropy Criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000315981900004"}
