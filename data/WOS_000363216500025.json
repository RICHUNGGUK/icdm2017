We formulate the synthesis as a joint optimization problem that simultaneously synthesizes the interior and the boundaries of the region, transferring relevant content from the source to meaningful locations in the target. We also provide an intuitive interface to control both local and global direction of textural details in the synthesized image. A key advantage of our approach is that it enables a combing metaphor in which the user can incrementally modify the target direction field to achieve the desired look. Based on this, we implement an interactive texture painting tool capable of handling more complex textures than ever before, and demonstrate its versatility on difficult inputs including vegetation, textiles, hair and painting media.", "paper_title": "Brushables: Example-based Edge-aware Directional Texture Painting", "paper_id": "WOS:000363216500025"}
