We make the assumption that each quantum dot can be represented as an atom with zero kinetic energy, and that all excitonic effects except dipole-dipole interactions may be disregarded. We use the Jaynes-Cummings-Paul model with applications to quantum systems based on a time-dependent Hamiltonian and entangled states. We obtain a system of equations describing the interaction, and present a method to solve the equations analytically for a single mode field within the Rotating-Wave Approximation. As an example of the applicability of this approach, we solve the system of two, two-level quantum dots in a lossless cavity with two modes of electromagnetic field. We, furthermore, study the evolution of entanglement by defining and computing the concurrency.", "paper_title": "Interaction of Quantum Dot Molecules with Multi-Mode Radiation Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000279693800006"}
