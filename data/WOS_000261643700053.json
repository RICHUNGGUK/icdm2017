Our method is based on a branch-and-bound procedure, derived from modern mixed integer quadratic programming solvers, and is useful for implementing the feed-forward phase of the SVM in fixed-point arithmetic. This allows the implementation of the SVM algorithm on resource-limited hardware like, for example, computing devices used for building sensor networks, where floating-point units are rarely available. The experimental results on well-known benchmarking data sets and a real-world people-detection application show the effectiveness of our approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
