Design/methodology/approach - This is an artificial intelligence algorithm for designing information gathering in group decision making. The authors propose the nonlinear programming model to gather information based on plant growth simulation algorithm (PGSA). The authors collect each program on each attribute group decision preference ordering interval and then use them to find the preference vector and the preference matrix. The entropy method is used to determine the weight of each attribute by the constructed preference matrix. According to the possibility degree matrix of each attribute, the combined effect vector is established by the priority weight vector method, which sorts and selects the best decision making program. Findings - To the authors' knowledge, the application of PGSA in the field of management decisions to collect program on each attribute group decision making preference interval number is the first trial in literature. It has retained more valuable decision making information from all experts without distortion. Practical implications - In practice, a real number may not be an accurate representation, but only gives a range of values to describe the attributes. This study provides a useful measurement of interval number information for managers to evaluate military science, venture capital, and environmental assessment, etc. Originality/value - The methodology considers the complete information to ensure no information distortion even with large and complex systems. The authors adopt computer artificial intelligence algorithms to obtain the objective evaluation, which is meaningful for both research studies and practical use.", "paper_title": "Research on group decision making with interval numbers based on plant growth simulation algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000332133600007"}
