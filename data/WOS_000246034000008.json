Using SAS, this paper also presents systematic scan reconfiguration, a test data compression algorithm that is applied to achieve 10 x to 40 x compression ratios without requiring any information from the automatic-test-pattern-generation tool about the unspecified bits. The architecture and the algorithm were applied to both single stuck as well as transition fault test sets.", "paper_title": "Scan test cost and power reduction through systematic scan reconfiguration", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034000008"}
