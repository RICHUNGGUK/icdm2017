In this study, we applied the methodology of georectification to compare historical maps with current orthophotos from 2005. We propose colour and lines code as useful tools for the analysis of the urban and landscape changes that the town has undergone since the 18th century, and we graphically reconstruct certain former heritage items that no longer exist. For example, these techniques are applied to the Real Sitio de Aranjuez (Spain) using the two most important historical maps: the 1775 Domingo de Aguirre map, which shows the full extent of the royal site for the first time, and the 1835 General Town Plan, which is the most characteristic of available 19th-century maps, as it displays the consolidated historical town. Next, using two rectified rasters and the orthophoto, we overlay a grid of nine 1 x 1 km squares, allowing us to \"see the town and its territory\" at three moments in history: 1775, 1835 and 2005. Thus, we obtain formal and dimensional information allowing analysis of the evolution of the territory, urban area and historic buildings. Among the many applications of this methodology in the fields of urban development and monumental-heritage conservation, we propose the graphical reconstruction of three urban elements that no longer exist. We determined that graphical reconstruction, in conjunction with traditional historical research, provides the greatest benefits for recreating an historical landscape. These methodologies will aid in the development of long-range management strategies and facilitate the assessment of threats posed by anthropogenic activities and environmental change to preserve the landscape heritage.
