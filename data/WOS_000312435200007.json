It has been widely used in various human-related image processing applications that skin detection techniques based on skin color information have gained much attention recently. Although several techniques have been proposed, skin color detection still remains as a challenge mainly due to problems such as illumination conditions, camera characteristics, and ethnicity. Among the various techniques used for skin color detection, neural networks have been proven to be one of the most effective tools. In this paper, an up-to-date review of the available neural network-based human skin color detection algorithms is presented.", "paper_title": "HUMAN SKIN COLOR DETECTION: A REVIEW ON NEURAL NETWORK PERSPECTIVE", "paper_id": "WOS:000312435200007"}
