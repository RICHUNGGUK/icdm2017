We present a GRASP based heuristic for the 0/1 version of the knapsack problem, and another heuristic for the unconstrained version of the knapsack problem. This last heuristic is divided in two steps: first it packs items in rectangles and then use the rectangles as items to be packed into the bin. We also solve the cutting stock problem with items of irregular shape, by combining this last heuristic with a column generation algorithm. The algorithms proposed found optimal solutions for several of the tested instances within a reasonable runtime. For some instances, the algorithms obtained solutions with occupancy rates above 90% with relatively fast execution time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
