The goal is to maximize quality of services, in terms of number of subscribers served, number of IPTV channels carried, and perceived video qualities of individual viewers, subject to constraints on multicast channel capacities and space-time channel quality variations. We present an efficient heuristic algorithm based on the Pareto principle that achieves near-optimal results in polynomial time complexity. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare this new approach against state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms and consistent superior performance has been observed.", "paper_title": "Optimal Layered Video IPTV Multicast Streaming Over Mobile WiMAX Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000297343400018"}
