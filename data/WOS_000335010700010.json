We mainly applied it to the leaf venation network, and the prediction in our model are compared with that from available correlations obtained by matching the numerical results, both of which are consistent with each other. Our model and relations may have important significance and potential applications in leaf venation and porous media. They also have a certain guiding significance to fluid heat transfer and thermal diffusion, as well as biotechnology research, e.g. veins and the neural networks of human.", "paper_title": "A honeycomb model for tortuosity of flow path in the leaf venation network", "paper_id": "WOS:000335010700010"}
