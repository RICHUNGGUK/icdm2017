We assign each sensor three parameters: the transmission range r, the interference range alpha r and the carrier sensing range beta r, where alpha, and beta are constants. lambda >= 1 channels are available for communication. We design a centralised algorithm with latency bound as (inverted right perpendicular a/lambda inverted left perpendicular +11inverted right perpendicular b/lambda right left perpendicular)R + (Delta - 23) inverted right perpendicular b/lambda inverted left perpendicular - inverted right perpendicular a/lambda inverted left perpendicular 12, where a and b are two integer constants derived from alpha and beta, Delta is the maximum degree of the network, and R is the latency's trivial lower bound. Our algorithm has an approximation ratio (inverted right perpendicular a/lambda inverted left perpendicular +11 inverted right perpendicular b/lambda inverted left perpendicular). When lambda = 1, the performance ratio is a + 11b, which improves the result in Zhu et al. (2009). We evaluate our algorithm's performance through extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Conflict-free many-to-one data aggregation in multi-channel multi-hop wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360156900001"}
