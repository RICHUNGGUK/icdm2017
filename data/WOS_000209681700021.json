The proposed scheme dynamically utilizes either systematic coding or mixed generation coding for network changing characteristics to maximize wireless bandwidth use. A simple and accurate analytical model for performance analysis of the proposed scheme is developed and verified via simulations. The results show the proposed scheme has notably better goodput than existing schemes such as SW and ASR-ARQ.", "paper_title": "Efficient Frame Aggregation Transmission Using Random Linear Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681700021"}
