A novel fractional adaptive learning approach that utilizes fractional calculus is presented in this paper. In particular, a fractional steepest descent approach is proposed. A fractional quadratic energy norm is studied, and the stability and convergence of our proposed method are analyzed in detail. The fractional steepest descent approach is implemented numerically and its stability is analyzed experimentally.", "paper_title": "Fractional Extreme Value Adaptive Training Method: Fractional Steepest Descent Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000351835900001"}
