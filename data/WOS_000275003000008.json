Having implemented UWT to a typhoon cloud mage, noise in a typhoon cloud image is reduced by modifying the undecimated wavelet coefficients by combining with generalization cross validation at fine resolution levels. CA and nonlinear gain operation are used to modify the undecimated wavelet coefficients at coarse resolution levels in order to extrude the details of a typhoon cloud image. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce the additive gauss white noise in a typhoon cloud image while well extruding the detail. In order to accurately assess an enhanced typhoon cloud image's quality, an overall score index is proposed based on information entropy, contrast measure and peak signal-noise ratio. Finally, comparisons between the proposed algorithm and five other similar methods, are carried out. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
