In this network, bursts are never lost at intermediate nodes but packets are lost at an ingress edge node due to a burst transmission algorithm. In addition, packet transmission delay increases depending on the algorithm. In order to improve packet level performance, in this paper, we propose a new burst transmission algorithm. In this method, two different thresholds are used; one is used to send a control packet to a controller and the other is used to assemble a burst. With these thresholds, a time slot can be assigned to a burst in advance and packet level performance can be improved. In order to evaluate its packet level performance and investigate the impact of thresholds, we also propose a queueing model of a finite buffer where a batch of packets are served in a slot of a constant length. Numerical results show that our proposed method can decrease packet loss probability and transmission delay with two thresholds. In addition, we show that our analysis results are effective to investigate the performance of the proposed method when the number of wavelengths is large.", "paper_title": "Burst transmission algorithm to improve packet level performance in contention-free slotted OBS networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279840000007"}
