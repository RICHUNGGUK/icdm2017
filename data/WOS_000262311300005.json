Grey number denoting an uncertain value is described in real interval from this concept. in this paper, we introduce the real formal concept analysis based on grey-rough set theory by using grey numbers, instead of binary values. We propose, to extend the notion of Galois connection in a real binary relation as well as the notions of formal concept and Galois lattice. The relationships between the new notions and old ones are discussed. Finally, we present a grey-rough set approach to Galois lattices reduction.
