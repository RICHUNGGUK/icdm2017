They are obtained as the images of recently proposed optimal quaternary sequences under the most significant bit and the Gray maps. The first family has 2(n) + 1 sequences of length 2(n) - 1 and the identical correlation distribution to that of Gold sequences and Gold-like sequences, and the second family of sequences of length 2(2(n) - 1) has 2(n) sequences and the same correlation values as those of Kerdock sequences.", "paper_title": "Two New Families of Optimal Binary Sequences Obtained From Quaternary Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632200033"}
