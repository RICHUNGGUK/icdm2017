Most histogram-based contrast enhancement methods have problems with excessive or low image contrast enhancement. This results in unnatural output images and the loss of visual information. The proposed method manipulates the slope of the input of the Probability Density Function (PDF) histogram. We also propose a pixel redistribution method using convolution to compensate for excess pixels after the slope modification procedure. Our method adaptively enhances the contrast of the input image and shows good simulation results compared with conventional methods.", "paper_title": "Image Contrast Enhancement Using Adaptive Slope", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784200044"}
