Reversible data hiding is a special type of data hiding technique that guarantees not only the secret data but also the cover media can be reconstructed without any distortion. Traditional schemes are based on spatial, discrete cosine transformation (DCT) and discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) domains. Recently, some vector quantization (VQ) based reversible data hiding schemes have been proposed. This paper proposes an improved reversible data hiding scheme based on VQ-index residual value coding. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms two recently proposed schemes, namely side-match vector quantization (SMVQ)-based data hiding and modified fast correlation vector quantization (MFCVQ)-based data hiding.
