This paper presents the design and implementation of Rubber, a two-level scheduling framework that decouples throughput and latency allocation to provide QoS guarantees to VMs while maintaining high disk utilization. The high-level throughput control regulates the pending requests from the VMs with an adaptive credit-rate controller, in order to meet the throughput requirements of different VMs and ensure performance isolation. Meanwhile, the low-level latency control, by the virtue of the batch and delay earliest deadline first mechanism (BD-EDF), re-orders all pending requests from VMs based on their deadlines, and batches them to disk devices taking into account the locality of accesses across VMs. We have implemented Flubber and made extensive evaluations on a Xen-based host. The results show that Flubber can simultaneously meet the different service requirements of VMs while improving the efficiency of the physical disk. The results also show improvement of up to 25% in the VM performance over state-of-art approaches: for example, in contract to the default Xen disk I/O scheduler- Completely Fair Queueing (CFQ)-besides achieving the desired QoS of each VM, Flubber speeds up the sequential and random reads by 17% and 25%, respectively, due to the efficient physical disk utilization.
