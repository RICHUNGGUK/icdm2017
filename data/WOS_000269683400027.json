The problems are online in the sense that all jobs arrive over time. Each job'S characteristics, such as processing time and weight become known at its arrival time. For the first problem Q vertical bar r(j), online vertical bar Sigma C(j), we prove that R-LIST algorithm is root 4m-3 + 3/2-competitive. For the second problem Q vertical bar r(j), online. pmtn vertical bar Sigma w(j)C(j), we show that WSPT-1 algorithm is 2-competitive if s(i)/s(m) >= Sigma(i)(h=1) s(h)/Sigma(m)(h=1) s(h) for i = 1,..., m - 1. Then we study a special case where s(1) = s(2) = ... = s(m-1) <= s(m). We obtain that algorithm WSPT-1 is 2-competitive if s(m)(m - 2) <= s(1)(m - 1). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
