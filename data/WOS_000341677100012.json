This ecosystem enables users to globally access e-healthcare services at competitive costs. However, the secure data communications between the cloud and Wireless Body Area Networks are critical because the data is related to users' privacy information. In this paper, we propose the Multi-valued and Ambiguous Scheme to capture data confidentiality in the Cloud-assisted Wireless Body Area Networks since it is the most important issue. The approach combining the scheme with existing encryption schemes provides a general paradigm for deploying applications. The obtained results show that secure data communications between the cloud and Wireless Body Area Networks can be achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
