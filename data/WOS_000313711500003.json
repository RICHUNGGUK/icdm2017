Through our focus on China, we are able to demonstrate the evolving trend towards the establishment of collaborative patenting networks within an emerging market. In addition to exploring the pattern of joint international inventions, we link the patent data to other macro-economic factors for empirical analysis. Our results indicate that the relative manufacturing strength, the international trade exposure, and the respective economy standing have positive effect on the propensity for engaging in such international co-invention activities.", "paper_title": "The patterns and propensity for international co-invention: the case of China", "paper_id": "WOS:000313711500003"}
