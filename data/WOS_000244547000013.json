This approach maintains the same current consumption because a low-pass pi-type LC matching network is inserted in the inter-stage of a conventional cascode LNA. 5 dB gain enhancement with no noise figure degradation at 4 GHz is observed in the SiGe HBT LNA with inter-stage matching.", "paper_title": "4-GHz inter-stage-matched SiGe HBT LNA with gain enhancement and no noise figure degradation", "paper_id": "WOS:000244547000013"}
