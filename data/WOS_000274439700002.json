TBR is based on real-time measurements of mobile stations (position, velocity and acceleration). The scheme consists in sending reservation requests to the neighboring cells based on an extrapolation of the user's motion. The originality of our approach lies in dynamically adjusting the amount of time for which bandwidth has to be allocated and reserved in a cell. In addition, we propose an optimal channel requests arrangement (CRA) algorithm in order to improve the performance of TBR in terms of resource utilization. Finally, we propose VTBR, an adapted and extended version of TBR for better support of vehicular network specificities where service degradation or forced call termination may occur owing to frequent handoffs. Detailed simulation results for TBR and VTBR schemes and a comparison with the guard channel scheme are presented. The results show that TBR and VTBR can efficiently improve the flow dropping probability.
