This process relies heavily on oral communication with the assistance of construction drawings, schedules, and other related documents. Because most construction projects include multiple working phases and involve multiple parties, it is difficult for participants to clearly grasp the whole picture of a construction site and to make accurate predictions about future activities. In this research, the authors proposed a visualized environment to facilitate the discussion process. It includes a stationary display called BIM Table for displaying public information and for collaboration among disciplines, and multiple mobile devices for showing private information. The authors employed augmented reality technologies to connect the BIM Table and the mobile devices as well as the public and private information. The authors named this discussion environment augmented reality and multiscreen (AR-MS) system. This system aims to reduce the complexity of discussion information while keeping necessary information available during the entire discussion process. To validate the AR-MS system, a user test with 36 participants (N = 36) was conducted. The participants were required to perform the three tasks: Data-finding (DF), problem prediction (PP), and decision-making (DM) using both the AR-MS system and the conventional paper-based method. This research discovered that the completion time is significantly shortened using the AR-MS system in both DF and PP tasks, while the accuracy in all three tasks showed no significant difference between AR-MS system and conventional method. Based on the results, the AR-MS system can be of benefit in information searching and foreseeing potential problems on a construction site and the discussion process can be made more effective and efficient by its use.
