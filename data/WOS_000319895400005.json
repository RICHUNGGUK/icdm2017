However, wireless communication links normally suffer from the characteristics of realistic physical layer, which significantly reduce the reliability of broadcasting among the nodes. This work addresses the minimal broadcasting problem in multi-hop wireless networks with a realistic physical layer. Given a probability p*, the problem is to design a distributed broadcasting algorithm such that each node in the network receives the broadcasting packet with probability no less than p* and the number of retransmissions is minimized. We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose a distributed greedy algorithm which maximizes the gain cost ratio at each node. We prove that the proposed algorithm guarantees that each node receives the broadcasting packet with probability no less than p*, and analyze upper bound on the number of total retransmissions in the network. Simulation results show that our algorithm can provide near 100% coverage to the wireless network with a realistic physical layer, and reduce the number of retransmissions compared with modified traditional flooding schemes k-Flooding (pure flooding with multiple times) and ACK-Flooding (pure flooding with acknowledgement). We believe our algorithmic solution is efficient and practical for general existing multi-hop wireless networks. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
