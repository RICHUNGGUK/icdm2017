However, the majority of existing methods suffer from one or more of the following limitations: (1) There is a lack of an automatic mechanism to formally discriminate between authoritative and nonauthoritative users. In fact, a common approach to authoritative user identification is to provide a ranked list of users expecting authorities to come first. A major problem of such an approach is the question of where to stop reading the ranked list of users. How many users should be chosen as authoritative? (2) Supervised learning approaches for authoritative user identification suffer from their dependency on the training data. The problem here is that labeled samples are more difficult, expensive, and time consuming to obtain than unlabeled ones. (3) Several approaches rely on some user parameters to estimate an authority score. Detection accuracy of authoritative users can be seriously affected if incorrect values are used. In this article, we propose a parameterless mixture model-based approach that is capable of addressing the three aforementioned issues in a single framework. In our approach, we first represent each user with a feature vector composed of information related to its social behavior and activity in an online community. Next, we propose a statistical framework, based on the multivariate beta mixtures, in order to model the estimated set of feature vectors. The probability density function is therefore estimated and the beta component that corresponds to the most authoritative users is identified. The suitability of the proposed approach is illustrated on real data extracted from the Stack Exchange question-answering network and Twitter.", "paper_title": "Identifying Authorities in Online Communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000355670300002"}
