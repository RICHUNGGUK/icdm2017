More specifically, first, we investigate the discrete memoryless MARC-WT. Three inner bounds [with respect to decode-and-forward (DF), noise-and-forward (NF), and compress-and-forward (CF) strategies] on the secrecy capacity region are provided. Second, we investigate the degraded discrete memoryless MARC-WT, and present an outer bound on the secrecy capacity region of this degraded model. Finally, we investigate the Gaussian MARC-WT, and find that the proposed relay strategies (DF, NF, CF strategies) help to enhance Tekin-Yener's achievable secrecy rate region of the Gaussian MAC-WT.", "paper_title": "Multiple-Access Relay Wiretap Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000358518300004"}
