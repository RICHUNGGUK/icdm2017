Due to limited bandwidth and extreme high cost of satellite communication, the majority of data is unable to transmit via satellites. For the moment, there are no efficient data collection methods provided for data collection in underwater sensor networks. After collecting and analyzing GPS data of 40 ships for two months, we find the mobility pattern of ships. On the basis of the mobility pattern, we propose a new data collection strategy for underwater sensor networks through delay tolerant routing. Through simulations and real data analysis, we provide quantitative analysis of the proposed strategy, such as data collection ratio, complexity of the algorithm and energy consumption. Especially, the data collection ratio on real data analysis could reach 95%-100% in acceptable time, which is 30% more than the radio of the strategy that data stored as they come.", "paper_title": "DCEP: Data Collection Strategy with the Estimated Paths in Ocean Delay Tolerant Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000333586100001"}
