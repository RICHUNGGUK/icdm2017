Extracellular glutamate and GABA was quantified by 2D gas chromatography and time of flight mass spectrometry after stimulation at varying amplitudes and frequencies. Amplitude sweeps resulted in a linear calibration for P19 neurons; the level of neurotransmitter varied over one order of magnitude from similar to 200 pg/neuron to similar to 1.2 ng/neuron for glutamate and similar to 1 ng/neuron to similar to 2 ng/neuron for GABA, depending on the stimulation amplitude. Frequency sweeps resulted in a peak release at 250Hz for glutamate and 400 Hz for GABA in P19 cells. The GABA transporter inhibitor, nipecotic acid, increased extracellular GABA levels and decrease glutamate. In contrast the embryonic cortical cells had a strongly nonlinear dependency of release on stimulation amplitude, and a weak dependence on frequency. These cells had roughly equal extracellular glutamate and GABA levels after stimulation despite the expression of GAD65. In addition glutamate and GABA levels were insensitive to nipecotic acid. These results demonstrate an ability to calibrate and tune neurotransmitter release from neural cells using high frequency stimulation parameters.", "paper_title": "CALIBRATION OF NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE FROM NEURAL CELLS FOR THERAPEUTIC IMPLANTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000267701800006"}
