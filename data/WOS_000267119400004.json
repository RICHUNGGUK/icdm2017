The measurement results can be used to describe the normal behavior of the network and detect distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS attacks). The measurement does not require any synchronization between the two measurement ends. Pairs of probe packets are sent from the source to the destination and intra-gaps between the probes are separately measured at the two ends. By performing an iterative Fourier-to-time reconstruction algorithm on the measured intra-gaps, distribution of the end-to-end one-way queuing delay is estimated. The packet loss rate and delay jitter are simultaneously measured as well. The simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
