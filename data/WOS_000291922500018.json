This paper investigates the size of routing tables as the number of nodes in the network increases. A routing protocol in a flat-label network is information-efficient if the amount of information at individual nodes required to route packets does not increase with the network size. It is shown that the shortest-path and straight-line routing algorithms are not information-efficient, i.e., these protocols can be implemented only when nodes' memory increases with the network size. On the other hand, it is established that there exists an information-efficient algorithm that routes packets correctly even if each node in the network is capable of storing information on a fixed number of destinations only.", "paper_title": "On Scalability of Routing Tables in Dense Flat-Label Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500018"}
